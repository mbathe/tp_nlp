Introduction 1. Notes that the world stands on the verge of the fourth industrial revolution; points out  that in comparison with the three previous waves, initiated by the introduction of steam,  electricity, and then computers, the fourth wave draws its energy from an abundance of  data combined with powerful algorithms; stresses that today’s digital revolution is  shaped by its unprecedented scale, fast convergence, and the enormous impact of  emerging technological breakthroughs on states, economies and societies; 2. Observes that the digital revolution has, at the same time, triggered a global tech race, in  which digital sovereignty is seen as a prerequisite for great-power status in both  political and economic terms; stresses the growing realisation among decision makers  that emerging technologies could lead to a global power shift away from the Western  world; 3. Points out that Europe, which for centuries set international standards, dominated  technological progress and led in high-end manufacturing and deployment, has  therefore fallen behind in a new ‘winner-takes-most’ or ‘superstar’ economy; underlines  the risk of European values being globally replaced, our companies becoming  marginalised and our living standards being drastically reduced;
PR\1224166EN.docx 9/38 PE680.928v01-00 EN4. Highlights, firstly, that digital tools are increasingly becoming an instrument of  manipulation in the hands of authoritarian states and their proxies, used to trigger a  clash between political systems; explains that digital espionage, low-scale warfare and  disinformation campaigns are deployed in order to pose an existential threat to our  democratic societies and question the European way of life; 5. Underlines, secondly, that the EU is failing to commercialise its ground-breaking  technological innovations, thereby enabling fast-growing non-European corporations to  take our best ideas, talent and companies; points out that, as a result, only eight of  today’s top 200 digital companies are domiciled in the EU, while our economic growth  is constantly declining; notes that Europe’s high wages and the world’s most generous  social welfare systems are financially dependent on us competing with the rest of the  world; 6. Warns that as a result of these and other existential threats to our democracy and  prosperity, the global tech race has become a fight for survival for the EU; stresses that  if the EU does not act swiftly and courageously, it will end up becoming a digital  colony of China, the US and other states and risk losing its political stability, social  security and individual liberties; 7. Argues that artificial intelligence (AI) is the key emerging technology within the fourth  industrial revolution; notes that AI is the control centre of the new data layer that  surrounds us and which can be thought of as the fifth element after air, earth, water and  fire; states that by 2030, AI is expected to contribute more than EUR 11 billion to the  global economy, an amount that almost matches China’s GDP in 2020; 8. Explains that there is therefore a race for AI leadership within the global tech race;  points out that the countries that master AI will gain key advantages; highlights,  however, that AI is not a technology with magical powers but rather an efficient tool  that we can put to good use; states that the rise of AI likewise does not require us to  completely rewrite our laws to counter new kind of threats or to prevent intelligent  machines from taking over; believes that although AI is indeed reshaping the world as  we know it, the reality is much less dramatic and most developments in the field of AI  are positive; 2. Potential opportunities, risks and obstacles in the use of AI: six case studies examined  by the AIDA Committee 9. Explains that AI is actually an umbrella term that covers a wide range of old and new  technologies that often have little more in common than being guided by a given set of  human-defined objectives and having some degree of autonomy in their actions; notes  that while some of these technologies are already in widespread use, others are still  under development or are even just speculative concepts that may or may not exist in  the future; 10. Points out that there is a significant difference between symbolic AI, the main approach  to AI from the 1950s to the 1990s, and machine-learning, data-driven AI, which has  dominated since the 2000s; clarifies that during the first wave, AI was developed by  encoding the knowledge and experience of experts into a set of rules that was then  executed by a machine;
PE680.928v01-00 10/38 PR\1224166EN.docx EN11. Notes that in the second wave, the automated learning processes of algorithms based on  the processing of large amounts of high-quality data, the ability to bring together inputs  from multiple radars, lidars and cameras to form a single image of the environment, and  the identification of patterns made AI systems more complex, autonomous and opaque;  stresses that current AI can therefore be broken down into many different sub-domains  and techniques, whereby deep learning is for instance a subfield of machine learning,  which itself is a subfield of AI; 12. Notes that although today’s AI has become much more powerful than symbolic AI, it  can still only solve tasks in domain-specific niches such as chess or facial recognition  and does not understand the actions it performs; points out that it is therefore referred to  as ‘narrow’ or ‘weak’ AI and is still not more than a tool that provides  recommendations and predictions; explains that self-driving cars operate, for instance,  through a combination of various one-task AI systems that together are able to provide a  three-dimensional map of the surroundings of the vehicle so that its operating system  can make the appropriate decisions; 13. Highlights that many fears linked to AI are based on hypothetical concepts such as  general AI, artificial superintelligence and singularity which could, in theory, lead to a  power shift from humans to AI and create machines that could even break free from  human control; stresses, however, that there are significant doubts as to whether this  speculative AI can even be achieved with our technologies and scientific laws; 14. Underlines that, on the contrary, the vast majority of AI systems currently in use, are  almost or even completely risk-free; refers, for instance, to automatic translations,  ‘Eureka machines’, gaming machines and robots that execute repetitive manufacturing  processes; concludes that only a very small number of use cases can be categorised as  risky and that only such cases require regulatory action and effective safeguards; 15. Considers that the public debate should therefore be more focused on the enormous  potential of AI; believes that AI offers humankind the unique chance to improve almost  every area of our lives, from combating global societal challenges such as climate  change, pandemics and starvation, to enhancing quality of life through personalised  medicine, fitness programmes and assisted living; 16. Explains that the present report addresses six AI case studies in detail, outlining the  opportunities offered by AI in the respective sector, the risks to be addressed and the  obstacles currently preventing us from fully harnessing the benefits of AI; highlights  that the case studies represent some of the most important AI use cases and, at the same  time, reflect the main topics of the public hearings held by the AIDA Committee during  its mandate, namely health, the Green Deal, external policy and security,  competitiveness, the future of democracy and the labour market; a) AI and health 17. Stresses that AI can unlock solutions in the health sector that could save millions of  lives, improve our standards of living and bring a competitive edge to the European ICT  sector; 18. Underlines that AI is already being used to detect diseases and abnormalities at an early 
PR\1224166EN.docx 11/38 PE680.928v01-00 ENstage and more accurately through real-time pattern recognition and image processing,  thus speeding up diagnosis and treatment and reducing unnecessary biopsies; 19. Highlights that AI has the potential to speed up the development of new drugs,  treatments and vaccines at a lower cost, while improving the quality and overall safety  of the production process; finds that AI can help predict the outcome of and responses  to treatments with increasing levels of accuracy when based on high-quality data, thus  increasing the effectiveness of preventive care; 20. Underlines that AI has the potential to tailor treatments and drug development to  specific patient needs and enhance engagement with stakeholders and participants in the  healthcare system; finds that AI and access to datasets increase the potential for  healthcare professionals to better understand the patterns and symptoms of their patients  and therefore provide better feedback, guidance and support; 21. Finds that the fight against COVID-19 has both accelerated research into and the  deployment of new technologies, notably AI applications, in the quest for improved  case detection, and heightened the need for industry and publicly funded research to be  able to deploy AI to strengthen the monitoring and modelling of the spread of future  pandemics, without excessive limitations on freedom of movement, the infringement of  data protection principles or the risk of establishing excessive surveillance regimes; 22. Highlights the potential of AI systems to relieve healthcare systems, and especially  medical staff, by supporting routine tasks such as patient transport and reminding  patients of their medication, and to remedy challenges posed by rapidly ageing  populations; 23. Stresses that consumer health applications based on AI can help to track an individual’s  health status, yield data which can apply to early triage questions and encourage healthy  behaviour, thus reducing the need to seek advice from a healthcare professional; 24. Stresses that AI in the health sector is particularly dependent on large amounts of  personal data, data sharing, data accessibility and data interoperability to realise the full  potential of AI and health, which are currently lacking; stresses the need to combat  mistrust and to educate and better inform citizens about the benefits of AI in the field of  health; 25. Stresses that additional legal steps, time and purpose limitations introduced by the  GDPR, and differing interpretations across Member States have led to legal uncertainty  and a lack of cooperation in the health sector; underlines that specific consent  obligations hinder the processing of used medical data for further analysis and studies;  stresses that this leads to lengthy delays to scientific discoveries and a significant  bureaucratic burden in health research20; 26. Underlines that automatic decision-making in healthcare applications may pose risks to  patients’ well-being, although AI already outperforms doctors’ diagnoses in several  instances, such as breast cancer21; finds that current liability frameworks do not provide  20 https://www.feam.eu/wp-content/uploads/International-Health-Data-Transfer_2021_web.pdf  21 https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1799-6 
PE680.928v01-00 12/38 PR\1224166EN.docx ENsufficient legal certainty over who is accountable in the event of misdiagnosis through  AI, for example; b) AI and the Green Deal 27.Highlights that AI applications can bring environmental and economic benefits and  strengthen predictive capabilities that contribute to the fight against climate change, to  meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to achieving our target of  becoming the first climate-neutral continent; finds that the use of AI has the potential to  reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by up to 4 % by 203022; underlines that AI  systems themselves need to be designed sustainably to reduce resource usage and  energy consumption, thereby limiting the risks to the environment; finds that it has been  estimated that ICT technologies are capable of reducing 10 times more greenhouse gas  emissions than their own footprint23; 28. Is concerned that only six Member States have included a strong focus on AI  applications in their efforts to meet the Green Deal objectives; finds that AI will  produce information relevant to environmental planning, decision-making and the  management and monitoring of the progress of environmental policies, for instance for  cleaner air, where AI applications can monitor pollution and warn of hazards; highlights  that AI and digital solutions have the potential to scale up resource-efficient solutions  that would otherwise only be implemented in one company or sector; 29. Emphasises the importance of AI in developing smart cities and smart villages to  improve the technological resilience of infrastructures, building on local strengths and  opportunities, including public transport, emergency assistance, waste management,  urban planning, smart energy and resource optimisation; stresses that AI-based solutions  can further assist in optimising architecture, construction and engineering processes to  reduce emissions, construction time, costs and waste; finds that this is already a reality  in countries such as China and Malaysia, where large-scale urban AI systems manage  the transport, energy and safety systems of several cities; 30. Stresses that the energy transition will not take place without digitalisation, which will  be achieved to a significant extent through AI; underlines that AI can monitor, optimise  and reduce energy consumption and production, as well as support the integration of  renewable energies into existing electricity grids; 31. Highlights that the growing complexity of an energy transition system, with increased  volatile renewable generation and changes in load management, makes increasing  automated control necessary for energy supply security; stresses that AI benefits for  supply security, especially in the operation, monitoring, maintenance and control of  water, gas and electricity networks, must be taken into account in the regulation of these  networks; 32. Finds that AI and other digital solutions for mobility and transport have the potential to  reduce traffic flows and enhance road safety, by greatly increasing the efficiency of  22 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/652713/IPOL_STU(2020)652713_EN.pdf  23https://www.europarl.europa.eu/cmsdata/231743/Working%20Paper%20%20AIDA%20Hearing%20on%20AI%20and%20Green%20Deal.pdf   
PR\1224166EN.docx 13/38 PE680.928v01-00 ENaccess to transport systems through, for example, autonomous vehicles and optimised  public transport planning, thus reducing the environmental footprint of the transport  sector, travel times and costs; 33. Believes that AI can have a transformative role in the agricultural sector when it comes  to tackling food security issues, enabling the emergence of new harvesting methods and  harvest prediction, novel approaches to food processing and retail, agricultural resource  management and input efficiency, as well as improved land management and the  optimisation of food supply chains; stresses that agriculture is a key sector in which AI  can help to cut emissions and the use of pesticides, fertilisers, chemicals and water;  further stresses that AI can contribute to the restoration of biodiversity and prevent  deforestation by monitoring endangered species and tracking deforestation activities  through smart forests; 34. Stresses that AI contributes to a circular economy through increased production output  and quality, reduced maintenance costs, better use and the ethical sourcing of raw  materials, and reduced waste; highlights that AI has the potential to automatically  provide businesses with detailed insight into their emissions, including value chains,  and forecast future emissions, thus helping to adjust and achieve individual emission  targets; underlines that digital tools help businesses to implement the necessary steps  towards more sustainable conduct, especially small and medium-sized enterprises  (SMEs) which do not otherwise have the resources to do so; 35. Stresses that more environmental data is needed in order to gain more insight and  induce more progress through AI solutions; underlines that using AI to systematically  connect data on CO 2 emissions with data on production patterns, consumer behaviour,  supply chains and logistics routes could ensure that activities that have a positive or  negative impact are detected; c) External policy and the security dimension of AI 36. Is concerned that the global community does not seem likely to reach an agreement on  minimum standards for the responsible use of AI, as the stakes, in particular for the  most powerful nations, are too high; believes, however, as a matter of principle, in the  potential of democratic nations to jointly shape the international debate, to work  together towards certain minimum standards, and thereby to promote multilateralism,  interoperability and data sharing on the international stage; 37. Observes that Chinese nationals have assumed leadership positions in the International  Organization for Standardization, the International Electrotechnical Commission and  the International Telecommunication Union, the three largest and best-established  standard-setting organisations in the world, while the Chinese Government has also  signed standards and cooperation agreements with 52 other countries through its Belt  and Road Initiative; warns that since several of their promoted standards, including on  AI technologies and in particular in relation to government surveillance and individual  liberties, are not in line with EU values, the Chinese standard offensive poses a crucial  geopolitical challenge for the EU, while also giving China a first-mover advantage in  economic terms; 38. Stresses that AI technologies, used in military command centres or in missile launch 
PE680.928v01-00 14/38 PR\1224166EN.docx ENfacilities, could escalate an automated reciprocal conflict before humans have the  chance to detect what is happening, understand the causes and intervene; agrees with  studies that warn that the impact of AI technologies on warfare could rival that of  nuclear weapons24; 39. Notes that the use of AI systems in defence-related developments is considered a game  changer in military operations; states that the key advantage lies in the potential to  engage in armed conflicts with a reduced risk of physical harm to one’s own military  personnel and as a means to reduce military response time; 40. Is concerned about military research and technological developments relating to lethal  offensive weapon systems without human oversight that are pursued in countries such  as Russia and China with little regard for the risk to humanity; observes that such lethal  offensive weapon systems are already used in military conflicts; warns that even nonstate armed groups could soon equip drones with AI software for navigation and facial  recognition and thus turn them into cheap lethal offensive weapons capable of acting  entirely without human oversight; 41. Notes that AI technology can also be used as a means for various forms of hybrid  warfare; specifies that it could for instance be mobilised to trigger information warfare,  by using fake social media accounts, to weaponise interdependence, by gathering  valuable information or denying network access to adversaries, or to create disturbances  in the economic and financial systems of other countries; 42. Illustrates that AI technologies could also help perpetrators by simplifying the use of  very sophisticated cyberattacks, such as through AI-powered malware, identity theft  using biometric data or adversarial AI that causes other AI systems to misinterpret  input; points, in particular, to the rise in deepfakes, which already lead to doubts about  the authenticity of all digital content, including genuinely authentic videos; warns that  deepfakes could contribute to a broad climate of public mistrust in AI, as well as a  deeper socio-political polarisation within our societies; 43. Elaborates that the internet of things, as well as the fact that AI systems nowadays run a  significant amount of key critical infrastructure, such as energy grids, the food chain,  the ATM network and hospital logistics, has created a massive AI cybersecurity threat;  predicts that states will focus more and more on protecting their IT logistics and care  delivery as a domestic asset, which could in turn create the temptation to invoke ‘AI  autarchy’; 44. Explains that the high level of accuracy that AI can achieve may pose security risks, as  it can induce humans to place such confidence in AI as to trust it more than their own  judgment; notes that experiments have shown that this can elevate the level of  autonomy of AI beyond the supporting role for which it was originally designed and  means that humans miss opportunities to gain experience and refine their skills and  knowledge of AI systems; observes that this type of AI overuse has, for example, been  cited as a major factor in several aircraft crashes25; 24 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/634452/EPRS_STU(2020)634452_EN.pdf  25 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/634452/EPRS_STU(2020)634452_EN.pdf 
PR\1224166EN.docx 15/38 PE680.928v01-00 EN45. Highlights however that AI’s core characteristics also make the technology an ideal tool  to enhance security; specifies that it can be used to synthesise large amounts of data,  perform behavioural analysis of network activities and detect specific patterns; stresses  that these elements would allow for better prediction and assessment of the threat level,  faster decision-making processes, improved reactivity and the more effective securing  of endpoint devices; 46. Underlines, in particular, the potential inherent in enabling law enforcement agencies to  proactively assess and predict AI misuse, as well as to counter it effectively by using AI  technologies themselves; underlines that such AI-supported law enforcement activities  do, however, require clear transparency rules, highly skilled employees and access to  large amounts of relevant data; d) AI and competitiveness 47. Notes that by 2030, products and services along the value chain will be interconnected  and technology-driven, with AI and robotics at the core of most manufacturing  processes and business models; states that this technological transformation will,  however, require massive public and private investment in order to digitalise all sectors  of the economy, upgrade the digital infrastructure and reskill the workforce; 48. Observes that the current funding levels are merely a drop in the ocean, which is why  most European industries are lagging behind and are far from exploiting the competitive  potential of AI technologies; highlights, in this regard, the fact that the EU does not  have a single AI ecosystem that can compare with Silicon Valley, Boston, Toronto, Tel  Aviv or Seoul; 49. Underlines that AI is a game changer for the competitiveness of EU industry as it  increases productivity, accelerates innovation, makes manufacturing processes and end  products safer as well as more sustainable, and could help to increase the resilience of  European supply chains; 50. Points to the increasing geopolitical risk of well-established supply chains suddenly  being disrupted by economic decoupling; stresses that by using AI, the EU would be  able to identify problems in value chains much earlier and perform predictive  maintenance, guarantee the diversification of suppliers or even bring aspects of  delocalised production back to the EU; 51. Notes that companies that have initiated digital disruption have often been rewarded  with disproportionate gains in market share, while the profits and revenue growth of  incumbent firms have come under severe pressure; notes that recent studies indicate that  this pattern is likely to repeat itself with even more intensity as companies that adopt AI  tend to strongly enhance their competitive edge as compared to non-adopting firms;  stresses that a two-tier economy with large numbers of bankruptcies could be the result; 52. Emphasises that this outlook is particularly concerning since the largest incumbent tech  companies will likely also dominate AI technologies and could again become  gatekeepers to markets, customers and innovation, while capturing most of the value  that is generated; stresses that because the data that drives the AI sector is  overwhelmingly collected from the very same large tech companies, which offer users 
PE680.928v01-00 16/38 PR\1224166EN.docx ENaccess to services in exchange for data and exposure to advertisements, their existing  market dominance could, in itself, become a driver of further market dominance; 53. Underlines that SMEs and start-ups are playing a central role in the introduction of AI  technologies within the EU as they represent the bulk of all companies and are a critical  source of innovation; observes, however, that promising AI ideas and pilots are often  too slow to scale up and eventually fail to transform into impactful large-scale projects  and actors, or, when they do, that they are acquired by large tech companies; 54. Stresses that the intensive use of algorithms could also create completely new AIspecific problems within the single market; notes that antitrust authorities might, for  instance, find it difficult to prove price collusion between AI-driven price-setting  systems, while the few AI providers that are already participating in stock trading could  present a systemic risk to the financial markets by jointly triggering extreme market  movements or even collapses; 55. Observes that most AI companies within the EU face legal uncertainty regarding how  they can develop their products and services in an assured manner as the digital single  market lacks established AI standards and norms; notes, furthermore, that overly  cautious safety standards and bureaucratic burdens at a time when the success of a new  AI technology is not yet foreseeable lead to non-lucrative business cases, as the initial  investments that are needed are seen as too risky; 56. Points out that the increasing consolidation of the digital and physical realms, as well as  of processes and services, makes it more and more difficult for AI companies to uphold  quality standards; concludes that transparency and trustworthiness will decide in the  future whether a product or service is eventually accepted by the market; 57. Considers that the EU’s intellectual property laws do not always provide a clear and  predictable framework allowing European businesses, and in particular start-ups, to  adequately and easily secure intellectual property protection; notes that EU companies  might often find it easier to protect their AI intellectual property rights in the US; 58. States that data analytics, as well as access to, sharing and re-use of non-personal data,  are already essential for many data-driven products and services today, but will be  absolutely crucial for the development and deployment of upcoming AI systems;  stresses, however, that most of the non-personal data generated in the EU so far goes  unutilised, while a single market for data is still in the making; 59. Points also to the legal uncertainties that persist in the field of the sharing and  processing of mixed and personal data; specifies that conflicting interpretations by  national data protection authorities as well as non-adequate guidance on mixed data and  on depersonalisation techniques have proved to be problematic for AI developers; notes,  furthermore, that autonomous AI systems are also at odds with the information duties  laid down in the GDPR as well as certain of its principles, including purpose limitation,  data minimisation and restrictions on secondary use; e) AI and the future of democracy 60. States that technical developments in the field of AI are very rapid and dynamic, 
PR\1224166EN.docx 17/38 PE680.928v01-00 ENmaking it difficult for elected representatives to have sufficient technical knowledge of  how new AI applications work and what kind of potential outcomes those applications  could produce; 61. Warns that legislative cycles are therefore often out of sync with the pace of  technological progress, while many policymakers tend to argue for categorical bans on  certain AI technologies or use cases without sufficient prior analysis of the  proportionality and necessity of an outright ban; is concerned that such a policy  approach to AI could, on the one hand, lead to overregulation which hampers  innovation and the competitiveness of EU companies and, on the other hand, even be  counter-productive in terms of safeguarding security and fundamental rights; 62. Finds in this regard that using AI to acquire biometric data, by analysing fingerprints or  typing cadence, or using voice or facial recognition, can be highly appropriate and  beneficial for the individual as well as the general public; refers, for instance, to acts  such as scanning criminal suspect databases, identifying victims of human trafficking,  preventing children from watching X-rated content, penalising illegal parking and  preventing welfare fraud; 63. Acknowledges at the same time that the very same AI technologies used to address  fundamental societal problems and achieve important public policy goals could also  pose crucial ethical and legal questions; notes that there have already been documented  instances which have led to serious wrongdoing within the EU; notes that in practice,  Member States rely heavily on the police to collect data, but also on private entities  whose activities are often not supervised and who regularly sell the collected and highly  sensitive data to other third parties; clarifies that this practice runs counter to European  values and undermines the high level of fundamental rights in the EU, in particular the  right to privacy; 64. Stresses that many authoritarian regimes apply AI systems to control, spy on, monitor  and rank their citizens; believes that any form of unrestricted normative citizen scoring  on a large scale by public authorities, especially within the field of law enforcement and  the judiciary, leads to the loss of autonomy and is not in line with European values;  highlights past cases of EU companies having sold biometric systems which would be  illegal to use within the EU to authoritarian regimes in non-EU countries; 65. Notes that dominant tech platforms nowadays not only have significant control over  access to information and its distribution, but they also use AI technologies to obtain  more information on a person’s identity and knowledge of decisional history than is  possessed by public authorities or close personal advisors such as doctors, lawyers or  bankers; stresses that this development challenges the sovereignty of our nation states,  the foundations of our democratic systems and the safeguarding of our fundamental  rights; 66. Points out that digital platforms are also used to spread disinformation, acting as  networks for propaganda, trolling and harassment with the aim of undermining electoral  processes; stresses that machine learning enables in particular the targeted use of  personal data to create personalised and convincing messages for potential voters, who  are often completely unaware that the content has been created or manipulated through 
PE680.928v01-00 18/38 PR\1224166EN.docx ENthe use of AI; 67. Underlines that AI could, however, also be used to reduce anti-democratic and unethical  activities on platforms and as a means to stop the distribution of fake news; notes that  the effective use of AI for this purpose has so far been prevented by strongly diverging  definitions of hate speech among Member States and the lack of consensus on how to  harness AI to effectively filter out illegal and harmful content; explains that it is also  problematic that divisive language leads to greater user engagement, which is why  removal of such language would be in direct conflict with the platform’s business  model, based on maximising user engagement; 68. Stresses that bias in AI systems often occurs due to a lack of diverse and high-quality  training data, for instance where data sets are used which do not sufficiently cover  discriminated groups, or where the task definition or requirement setting themselves  were biased; notes that bias can also arise due to a limited volume of training data,  which can result from overly strict data protection provisions, or where a biased AI  developer has compromised the algorithm; points out that some biases in the form of  reasoned differentiation are, on the other hand, also intentionally created in order to  improve the AI’s learning performance under certain circumstances; 69. Raises the question of whether certain biases can be resolved by using more diverse  datasets, given the structural biases present in our society; specifies in this regard that  algorithms learn to be as discriminatory as the society they observe and then suggest  decisions that are inherently discriminatory, which again contributes to exacerbating  discrimination within society; concludes that there is therefore no such thing as a  completely impartial and objective algorithm; f) AI and the labour market 70. Believes that that the adoption of AI, if combined with the necessary support  infrastructure and training, can substantially increase productivity, innovation, growth  and job creation, with expectations of labour productivity set to increase by 11-37 %26  by 2035; 71. Stresses that although AI may replace some tasks, including mundane, labour-intensive  or dangerous tasks, it will create new, higher value-added employment; stresses that AI  is currently substituting or complementing humans in a subset of tasks but that it is not  yet having detectable aggregate labour market consequences27; stresses, however, the  potential for an increase in income inequality if AI is augmenting high-skill occupations  and replacing low-skill occupations, and that such possible effects need to be prepared  for; 72. Highlights that AI implementation also represents an opportunity for significant cultural  change within organisations, including improved workplace safety, better work-life  balance and more effective training and guidance; is of the opinion that humanempowering AI applications could also create new job opportunities, in particular for  those who, because of natural restrictions such as disabilities or living circumstances,  26 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2020/652713/IPOL_STU(2020)652713_EN.pdf  27 https://www.nber.org/papers/w28257

Is concerned about AI-fuelled surveillance in the workplace and teleworking  environment, as well as in the school environment, in the light of the fundamental right  to privacy, data protection and the human dignity of the worker, as well as the  fundamental rights of children; 74. Considers that the adaptation of the workforce in terms of AI education and retraining is  of vital importance, as 52 %28 of the current European workforce urgently requires  retraining; highlights that current concepts of learning and working are still defined to  too great an extent by the job market needs of a pre-digital world, which also  contributes to a growing skills gap and a new digital divide for both citizens and  businesses who do not have access to a secure digital space; stresses that enhancing  digital literacy contributes to achieving the SDGs, in particular those on education,  human capital and infrastructure; 75. Stresses that more than 70 % of businesses report a lack of staff with adequate digital  and AI skills as an obstacle to investment; is concerned that as of 2019, there were  7.8 million ICT specialists in the EU, with a prior annual growth rate of 4.2 %, which is  far short of the 20 million experts that are needed for key areas such as data analysis, as  projected by the Commission; is concerned about the extensive gender gap in this area,  with only one in six ICT specialists and one in three science, technology, engineering  and mathematics (STEM) graduates being female29; g) Three recurring findings in all six case studies 76. Notes that there are a number of transversal obstacles that the EU needs to overcome in  order to achieve a widespread use of AI and to fully harness its benefits; states that in  particular, legal uncertainty, insufficient digital infrastructure and a lack of AI skills can  be observed as barriers to the successful application of AI in all fields analysed; 77. Concludes from the case studies examined, furthermore, that it is not specific AI  technologies themselves that are risky, but certain use cases; points in particular to dualuse AI systems such as drones, the uses of which can vary drastically from consumer  recreation to warfare, with the worst-case scenario being swarms of inexpensive, armed  microdrones used to kill specific human targets; 78. States that while it is important to examine and categorise potential risks posed by AI,  the case studies illustrated that AI technologies also enable us to apply, in most cases,  very effective counter measures that are able to mitigate or eliminate the very same  risks; underlines that, as AI is still in its early stages of development within a wider  context of emerging technologies, its real potential can still only be imagined; stresses  that the promise and potential benefits of AI in economic and societal terms appear to  be tremendous; 28 https://www.digitaleurope.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/DIGITALEUROPE-%E2%80%93-Our-Callto-Action-for-A-STRONGER-DIGITAL-EUROPE.pdf  29 https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/communication-digital-compass-2030_en.pdf

Observes fierce AI competition that involves not only the two frontrunners, the US and  China, but also countries such as Canada, India, Israel, Japan, Russia, South Korea and  the UK; underlines that the previous chapter has already indicated that the EU is so far  struggling to meet its aspiration30 of becoming a global leader in AI; 80. Examines in the following the EU’s global competitiveness with regard to AI by  comparing it with that of China and the US, focusing on three core elements: regulatory  approach, market situation and investments; a) Regulatory approach 81. Notes that the US refrains from introducing horizontal legislation in the digital field,  while focusing instead on sector-specific laws and private sector innovation, in  particular among its tech giants and leading universities; observes that the US approach  on AI up to 2019 can therefore be summarised as providing legal guidance to  businesses, investing in research projects and removing barriers to innovation; 82. Stresses that the 2019 American AI Initiative Act ushered in a slight realignment, as  besides redirecting funding, retraining workers and strengthening digital infrastructure,  the US Government announced the development of common standards for trustworthy  AI; notes, however, that the resulting 10 principles were very broadly formulated in  order to allow each government agency to create sector-specific regulations; expects  that although the administration of President Biden plans to bring forward a new bill of  rights to limit AI harms in 2022, the US approach will remain market-driven, aiming to  avoid regulatory overreach; 83. Highlights that Chinese President Xi Jinping underlined as early as 2013 the importance  of technologies in geopolitics, the role of public policies in defining long-term  objectives and the fact that AI offers an opportunity to overtake the US in terms of  military supremacy; stresses further that the Chinese Government subsequently put  forward the Made in China 2025 plan in 2015 and the Next Generation AI Development  Plan in 2017, both of which had the clear targets of making China the global leader in  AI by 2030; notes that the 2018 AI standardisation white paper further outlined how the  socialist market economy can develop international standards and strategically engage  in international standardisation organisations; 84. Observes that on the global stage, China actively promotes international AI partnership  as a way to export its own AI-based government surveillance practices, social scoring  system and censorship strategies; emphasises that heavy investment abroad under the  Digital Silk Road initiative are also used as a means to spread Chinese AI globally and  to bring other countries under Chinese influence; concludes that the Chinese approach is  therefore built upon deploying AI domestically as well as exporting AI technologies  that follow predetermined standards that are in line with the ideology of the Chinese  Communist Party; 85. Notes that the Commission started its work on regulating AI in 2018 by publishing the  30 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/speech_21_1866
PR\1224166EN.docx 21/38 PE680.928v01-00 ENEuropean AI strategy, setting up a High Level Expert Group and introducing a  coordinated plan31 to foster ‘AI made in Europe’; notes that the 2020 white paper on AI  proposed numerous measures and policy options for future AI regulation and eventually  resulted in the horizontal AI Act32, which was presented with a revised coordinated plan  on AI33 in May 2021; points out that as of June 2021, 20 Member States have published  national AI strategies, while seven more are in the final preparatory stages of adopting  theirs; 86. Emphasises that central to the EU regulatory approach is a strong attention to ethical  considerations in line with core human rights values and democratic principles;  underlines that the Commission thereby hopes to achieve another GDPR-like ‘Brussels  effect’, meaning that the EU’s regulatory and market power leads to a competitive edge  in AI; states that establishing the world’s first regulatory framework for AI could indeed  leverage a first-mover advantage in setting international AI standards based on  European values, as well as successfully exporting ‘trustworthy AI’ around the world; b) Market situation 87. Is aware that that the vast majority of the 100 leading AI companies globally are  domiciled in the US, whereas only three Chinese companies and four EU companies fall  into this category34; notes that the US also leads in the total number of AI start-ups,  hosting 40 % of all new AI companies, followed by the EU with 22 % and China with  11 %35; 88. Points out that in recent years, many of the EU’s most successful digital companies  have been acquired by US tech giants; refers also to the ongoing debate about so-called  ‘killer acquisitions’; notes that US firms, with 130 acquisitions in 2020 alone, acquired  many more AI companies than EU and Chinese firms combined, which made 30 and  three comparable acquisitions respectively; 89. Stresses that while the US and China are trying to accelerate the use of AI technologies  in the public and private sectors, the adoption of AI within the EU lags behind; states  that only 7 % of all EU companies are currently using AI technologies, while just 30 %  are planning to do so in the future36; states that there is also a clear gap in AI readiness  between different business sectors as well as among Member States, with southern and  eastern Europe lagging behind, while northern Europe is, in general, very advanced,  even by global standards; 90. Underlines that while the US and China each have a unified digital market with a  coherent set of rules, the EU’s digital single market is still fragmented and features  31 European Commission, Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence (COM(2018)0795). 32 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on  artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act) and amending certain Union legislative acts (COM(2021)0206). 33 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council, the  European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee  of the Regions – Fostering a European approach  to Artificial Intelligence (COM(2021)0205). 34 https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-100-artificial-companies-in-the-world/  35 https://asgard.vc/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Artificial-Intelligence-Strategy-for-Europe-2018.pdf  36 https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20210413-1

Points also to the problem that inconsistencies in EU law, contradictions between EU  and national laws, different legal interpretations and a lack of enforcement among  Member States is putting European companies in operational and financial jeopardy as  they cannot determine whether their AI innovations are later likely to be assessed as  non-compliant with EU law; 92. Notes that the insufficient legal certainty for AI companies is further exacerbated by the  fact that common standards and norms are missing in some sectors, while others are  compromised by overregulation or the presence of legislative proposals that have been  pending for long periods of time without being adopted; highlights as an example the  fact that EU AI developers face a data challenge that neither their US nor Chinese  counterparts do; observes that they often do not have enough high-quality data to train  their algorithms, struggle with strict data protection rules and are affected by a lack of  sectoral data spaces and cross-sectoral interoperability, as well as constraints on crossborder data flows; c) Investments 93. Points out that although private investments in the EU AI industry are rising strongly,  with EUR 3.4 billion invested in 2018, the investment gap compared with the US  (EUR 31 billion) and China (EUR 21 billion) has grown further37; states that the US is  also leading in venture capital and private equity funding, which is particularly  important for AI start-ups, with EUR 12.3 billion, against EUR 4.8 billion for China and  EUR 1.2 billion for the EU; notes that as a consequence, many European AI  entrepreneurs are crossing the Atlantic to scale up their businesses in the US; 94. States that together with national initiatives, the estimated annual public investment of  the EU in AI of EUR 1 billion is also much lower than the EUR 5.1 billion invested  annually in the US and up to EUR 6.8 billion in China38; states, however, that between  2017 and 2020, EU public funding for AI research and innovation increased by 70 %  compared to the previous period; acknowledges that the Commission plans to increase  investment further through the digital Europe programme, Horizon Europe, the  European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF), the European Investment Fund  (EIF), the Recovery and Resilience Facility and various cohesion policy programmes39; 95. Stresses that AI companies within the EU have problems finding qualified employees as  42 % of the EU population lacks basic digital skills40; points out that the EU also  struggles with AI-relevant university degrees, as the number of bachelor’s degrees  37 https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/RPS_ENPROD/PROD0000000000505746/%28How%29_will_the_EU_become_an_AI_superstar%3F.pdf  38 https://www.dbresearch.com/PROD/RPS_ENPROD/PROD0000000000505746/%28How%29_will_the_EU_become_an_AI_superstar%3F.pdf  39 European Commission, A Europe fit for the digital age - Excellence and trust in artificial intelligence (2021) 40 https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/desi

Observes that although the EU still has an excellent community of researchers who are  producing many AI research papers that are often cited and downloaded, the EU’s  global impact is steadily declining, with a brain drain of top EU researchers to the US  and China41; notes that the EU only spends 2 % of its GDP on research and  development (R&D), while the US spends 2.8 %; emphasises that the total R&D  spending of US software and computer services firms in 2019 was EUR 100 billion,  which is much higher than comparative figures in China and the EU, where private  R&D spending amounted to EUR 20 billion and EUR 12.5 billion respectively; 97. Notes that the EU’s digital infrastructure is underdeveloped, with just 25 % of people in  the EU being able to connect to a 5G network, compared to 76 % of people in the US42;  observes that the EU in general lacks high-performance digital infrastructure with  interoperable data spaces, affordable energy supply, high transmission rates and  volumes, reliability and short delays as well as a genuine AI ecosystem with excellence  clusters such as can be found in the US or China43; d) Conclusion 98. Concludes that the US is still the overall leader in AI as it is ahead in almost every  category, in particular when it comes to market power, investment, AI talent, research  and infrastructure; highlights, however, that China, which five years ago was still  significantly lagging behind the US in all indicators, is now quickly catching up in  almost every category; notes that China could in fact achieve its goal of becoming the  global leader in AI by 2030 or even earlier; recognises that both countries have the  advantage of a unified single market, greater flexibility in digital governance and  stronger political commitment to remaining a leader in AI; 99. Stresses that the EU is behind the US and China in virtually every category and that  despite its current measures, it is losing further ground; notes that the EU is, however,  ahead on regulatory approaches; points out that a viable EU strategy for becoming more  competitive on AI would be to quadruple efforts to catch up when it comes to AI  research and innovation, skills, infrastructure and investment, while at the same time  trying to create a first-mover advantage by establishing a future-oriented and  innovation-friendly regulatory framework for AI development and use; 100. Underlines that the EU’s efforts to strengthen its global AI footprint were severely set  back by Brexit, as the UK was one of the leading EU countries in AI with London as  one of the EU’s most important AI hubs, home to 1.000 AI companies, 35 tech hubs and  reputed research centres such as the Alan Turing Institute; 41 https://datainnovation.org/2021/01/who-is-winning-the-ai-race-china-the-eu-or-the-united-states-2021-update/  42 https://www.ft.com/content/d2fd9b8a-fddc-4c90-ad11-2d05c542d10b 43 Working paper of the AIDA Committee on AI and Competitiveness.

Specifies that as the EU does not have the legislative power to address all the points  listed in the EU Roadmap for AI, the special committee recommends that a political  process be launched with the aim of pulling all Member States in the right direction and  drastically improving the performance of those that are lagging furthest behind; refers in  this regard to the EU 2000 Lisbon agenda, which, despite the criticism, played a part in  guiding the EU’s policy orientation over 20 years and in keeping up the pressure on  Member States to reform; 4. ‘Europe fit for the digital age’ - Roadmap for becoming a global leader a) Favourable regulatory environment i. LAW-MAKING 103. Calls on the Commission to propose only legislative acts in the form of regulations for  new digital laws in areas such as AI, as the digital single market needs to undergo a  process of genuine harmonisation; is convinced that due to rapid technological  development, digital legislation should always be swiftly adaptable, principle-based and  future-proof, while adopting a risk-based approach; stresses, furthermore, the  importance of legal certainty and, consequently, the need for robust, practical and  unambiguous applicability criteria, definitions and obligations in all legal texts; ii. GOVERNANCE AND ENFORCEMENT 104. Calls for the creation of an adequately resourced mechanism to supervise the uniform,  EU-wide implementation and enforcement of the upcoming AI laws; prefers a European  AI Board over the creation of a costly new EU Agency for AI; suggests, however, that  this board should be made up of not only the national AI supervisory authorities and the  European Data Protection Board (EDPB), but also a broad range of relevant EU bodies,  such as the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights, the High-Level Expert Group on AI,  the EU Agency for Cybersecurity, the European Consumer Consultative Group, and  standardisation organisations the European Committee for Standardization, the  European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization and the European  Telecommunications Standards Institute; iii. LEGAL FRAMEWORK FOR AI 105. Highlights that the underlying objective of the EU’s digital strategy, as well as that of  the AI strategy is to create a ‘European Way’ in a digitalised world; clarifies that this  approach should be human-centred, value-oriented and based on the concept of the  social market economy; underlines that the individual, with their respective dignity and  individual freedoms, should always remain at the centre of all political considerations; 106. Agrees with the conclusion drawn by the Commission in its 2020 White Paper on

States that the co-legislators should aim to align the AI definition in future legislation  with the concepts, terminologies and standards developed together with other likeminded democratic countries in the OECD44; stresses that doing so would give the EU  an advantage in shaping a future international AI governance system; 108. Is convinced that it is not AI as a technology that should be regulated, but that the type,  intensity and timing of regulatory intervention should solely depend on the type of risk  incurred by the use of an AI system; underlines, in this regard, the importance of  distinguishing between a minority of ‘high-risk’ and the vast majority of ‘low-risk’ AI  use cases; concludes that while only the former category indeed demands legislative  safeguards, businesses should self-regulate ‘low-risk’ technologies by choosing  measures that deliver the best outcomes; 109. Specifies that the classification of technologies as ‘high-risk’ should be based on the  concrete use and context, complexity and autonomy of the AI system, the probability  and likelihood of the worst-case scenario, the severity of the harm and its irreversibility,  the techniques used and the governance arrangements adopted; stresses that this  classification should be introduced together with best practices and guidance for AI  developers and should also recognise that AI technologies can significantly reduce  certain risks; 110. Notes that the requirements that AI systems need to fulfil differ significantly in a  business-to-business (B2B) environment compared to a business-to-consumer (B2C)  environment; points out that while consumer rights need to be legally protected through  consumer protection legislation, companies can solve liability and other legal challenges  more quickly and cost-effectively by contractual means with business partners directly;  concludes that, in particular, SMEs and start-ups investing in AI technologies would  benefit from a B2B exclusion as they are disproportionately affected by new legal  obligations, which also harms their ability to attract investments; 111. Underlines the need to address open ethical questions raised by new technological  possibilities, but clarifies that new AI ethical guidelines should not set up stricter rules  than those already existing for human or automated actions; proposes that on these  grounds the EU should introduce ethical guidelines that consist of three categories of  core values and principles; 112. Explains that the first category could list fundamental, mandatory principles such as the  non-maleficence principle, the principle of respecting human dignity or the protection  of the democratic process; states that the second category could include good practices  in AI development such as human-centric AI, responsible governance and the principles  of transparency and explainability; concludes that the last category could include  44 Recommendation of the OECD Council on artificial intelligence of 22 May 2019.
PE680.928v01-00 26/38 PR\1224166EN.docx ENprinciples of sustainable AI that would be fully aligned with the UN 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development; 113. Highlights, with regard to the third category, the gap in leadership on AI global  governance, which gives the EU the chance to become the leading voice in aligning AI  with the UN SDGs and using AI technologies to push worldwide for their achievement;  stresses, however, that not all AI technologies developed or applied in the EU should  need to comply with all three categories; suggests, for example, that sustainable AI  could only be mandated for AI implemented or procured by public tender or in specific  sectors, while the majority of AI developers and companies would only be encouraged  to align with the second and third categories through soft law; 114. Is convinced that efforts to completely ‘de-bias’ AI algorithms are frequently  misguided, because this strategy wrongly suggests that bias-free data sets exist; notes  that in this regard the requirement that data used to train AI systems is ‘complete and  free of errors’ needs to be revisited; stresses, however, that the EU should at the same  time cooperate very closely with AI developers to counterbalance structural biases in  our societies and daily life; 115. Elaborates that transparency or explainability obligations for AI systems, while helpful  in certain cases, may not be possible to implement in every instance; notes that both  concepts also need to be balanced against other factors, including the interests of  businesses in maintaining trade secrets or the potential value of exposed data to  potential competitors; stresses, however, that a mandatory self-identification of AI  systems or accessible machine logs seem to be very useful for many AI use cases that  interfere with the fundamental rights of individuals or affect consumers; 116. States that the legislative framework on intellectual property must continue to  incentivise and protect AI innovators by granting them patents as a reward for  developing and publishing their creations; finds that existing laws are mostly futureproof, but proposes certain adjustments, including the integration of open source  elements and new forms of patent licensing to ensure that tools are available to regions  and initiatives that could not otherwise afford them; recognises that it will also be  necessary to clarify whether AI will be able to hold intellectual property rights in itself; 117. Elaborates that obligatory ex ante risk self-assessments, comparable with CE markings  or data protection impact assessments, combined with market surveillance based on  clear rules and standards, and complemented with ex post enforcement for high-risk AI  systems, seem to be a sufficiently robust governance approach for AI; warns that overly  burdensome conformity assessment obligations could create significant burdens that  make the business models of AI developers and companies economically unviable; 118. Notes that in order to increase product safety and improve the identification of faults,  the developers of high-risk AI should at least be obliged to ensure that accessible logs of  algorithmic activity are maintained securely; considers that developers should also  design high-risk AI systems with embedded mechanisms – ‘kill switches’ – for human  intervention to immediately halt automated activities at any moment; 119. Is convinced that despite the legal challenges caused by AI systems, there is no need for  a complete revision of the existing liability rules; stresses that the Product Liability 
PR\1224166EN.docx 27/38 PE680.928v01-00 ENDirective and the national fault-based liability regimes can in principle remain the  centrepiece legislation for countering most harm caused by AI; underlines that only in  some cases could there be inappropriate outcomes, but warns that any revision should  take the existing product safety legislation into account and should solely be based on  clearly identified gaps; 120. Notes that certain changes to the legal definitions of ‘product’, including integrated  software applications, digital services and inter-product dependency, and ‘producer’,  including backend operator, service provider and data supplier, do however seem  necessary to ensure that compensation is available for harm caused by emerging  technologies; stresses, however, that an overly broad approach to the definition of  ‘product’ should be avoided, as this may make it difficult to differentiate between AI  and other algorithms; 121. Points out that, due to the characteristics of AI systems, such as their autonomy and  opacity, there could also be cases where neither an updated Product Liability Directive  nor national fault-based liability regimes apply and where persons who suffer harm or  whose property is damaged would end up without compensation; suggests, therefore,  the introduction of a limited new liability mechanism for legal claims against the  operator, who controls the risks associated with the AI system and who also often is the  cheapest cost avoider; specifies that while high-risk AI systems should fall under strict  liability, combined with mandatory insurance cover, victims of low-risk AI systems  should only benefit from a presumption of fault against the operator; iv. EU DATA CHALLENGE 122. Agrees with the conclusion drawn by the Commission in its 2020 communication  entitled ‘A European strategy for data’ that the creation of a single European data space  is key to ensuring the EU’s global competitiveness in AI, as well as its strategic  sovereignty and economic prosperity; recalls the essential link between the availability  of high-quality data and the development of AI; b) Completing the digital single market i. NATIONAL AI STRATEGIES 123. Calls on the Member States to review their national AI strategies that they developed in  accordance with the ‘coordinated plan on AI’, as the vast majority of them remain  vague and lack clear goals; recommends that they formulate more concrete, quantifiable  and specific actions, while trying to create synergies between them; ii. MARKET BARRIERS 124. Urges the Commission to continue its work on removing key barriers for developers and  companies in areas such as country-based discrimination, burdensome market access  procedures and high regulatory costs, as well as to address the frequent use of  derogations which results in diverging rules among different Member State  jurisdictions; iii.

CONNECTIVITY AND COMPUTING POWER 126. Calls on the Commission to follow up on its ambition of incentivising 75 % of  European enterprises to take up cloud computing services, big data and AI by 2030 in  order to remain globally competitive and reach climate neutrality; finds that the  allocation of EUR 2.07 billion in funding for digital infrastructure under the Connecting  Europe Facility (CEF)45 is insufficient; 127. Stresses that the shift in the volume and processing of data for AI requires the  development and deployment of new data processing technologies encompassing the  edge, thereby moving away from centralised cloud-based infrastructure models towards  increasing decentralisation of data processing capacities; urges the strengthening of  European intense-computing AI architectures as a key strategic priority to maximise  investment and research, including distributed clusters, the deployment of edge nodes,  digital microcontroller initiatives, and the capacity to enable faster data collection and  processing in all aspects of society; 128. Stresses that AI requires powerful hardware to make sophisticated algorithms useable,  including high-performance and quantum computing and the IoT; urges the  maximisation of funding and research for such AI-enabled emerging technologies; finds  that, similarly, nano-technologies and chips are essential to enabling AI to be embedded  in, for example, medical devices, which also requires priority funding; 129. Highlights that a functioning and fast infrastructure for AI must be based on a fair, safe  and high-quality foundation by avoiding gaps in digital high-speed connectivity, which  requires 5G roll-out in all urban areas by 2030, as well as ultra-fast broadband networks  and spectrum policy with licence conditions that do not distort competition; urges  Member States to continue to implement the 5G toolbox, specifically enabling  legislation related to the risk assessment of suppliers and service providers; calls for the  Broadband Cost Reduction Directive to be put into practice to facilitate network  deployment; 130. Calls on the Commission to establish timetables and financial incentives for Member  states, cities, regions and industry, and to accelerate the administrative approval  processes for 5G; supports the incentivisation of private investment in 5G roll-out;  requests that in regions where roll-out is not carried out by the private sector, more  funds are made available; calls for funding for broadband and connectivity projects  under the multiannual financial framework, with easier access for local authorities to  45 Regulation (EU) 2021/1153 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2021 establishing the  Connecting Europe Facility and repealing Regulations (EU) No 1316/2013 and (EU) No 283/2014, OJ L 249,  14.7.2021, p. 38.

Finds that it will not be possible to achieve the necessary deployment of dense edgenode connectivity for 5G in rural areas, where half of European households are not even  connected through fibre; calls for a clear strategy on fibre-optic network deployment  and broadband roll-out in rural areas, which is also key for data intensive technologies  such as AI; recommends that European Investment Bank support for connectivity  projects in rural areas be enhanced; 133. Stresses that the significant investment required for network deployment, coupled with  the ambitious expectations of public authorities and consumers regarding roll-out timing  and coverage, will be impossible to achieve without infrastructure-sharing agreements,  which are also key to promoting sustainability and reducing energy consumption; ii. SUSTAINABILITY 134. Urges the EU to take the lead in making green digital infrastructure climate neutral and  energy efficient by 2030; calls for coordinated global multilateral action to use AI in the  fight against climate change and environmental degradation; d) Ecosystem of excellence i. TALENT 135. Calls on the Commission to create an AI competence framework for individuals that  builds on the digital competence framework for citizens, which helps individuals and  SMEs to find relevant AI training and learning opportunities and to improve the sharing  of knowledge, best practices, digital skills initiatives and funding between organisations  and companies, at both EU and national level; recommends the establishment of a  central body for the European AI skills data space to coordinate European skills training  on sectoral and regional levels in all Member States; urges the Commission and the  Member States to support free online courses that enhance digital literacy such as basic  training in AI; ii. RESEARCH 136. Calls for the EU to increase investment in research into key technologies such as AI,  robotics, quantum computing, microelectronics, batteries, the Internet of Things, nanotechnology, distributed ledger technology and 3D printing; calls on the Commission to  develop and maintain a European strategic research roadmap for AI which includes  major interdisciplinary challenges where AI can be a part of the solution; 137. Encourages all Member States to spend a significant proportion of their GDP on  research into digital technologies, and for annual combined public and private  investments in the EU to reach at least EUR 20-25 billion; urges the continued  strengthening of the Horizon Europe programme, notably its AI, data and robotics 
PE680.928v01-00 30/38 PR\1224166EN.docx ENpartnership and the European Innovation Council, and to expand the digital Europe  programme, whose allocated funding of EUR 7.6 billion46 is insufficient to remain  competitive; 138. Calls on the Commission to simplify and streamline the structure of research funding  instruments by reducing the effort and time needed to obtain decisions when applying  for grants; stresses the need to improve the quality and consistency of proposal reviews  and to increase the predictability of funding instruments and their timing to support  long-term planning, using the European AI research roadmap; 139. Encourages the creation of more chairs on AI at European universities as well as  competitive salaries for AI research and the provision of more funding in order to  properly train and retain the next generation of researchers and entrepreneurs and  prevent brain drain to locations outside the EU; stresses the need to reduce the  bureaucratic burden for university researchers in accessing funds and calls on the  Commission to provide tools to increase digital interconnectivity between universities;  urges the development of cross-cutting networks for AI across European universities  and research institutions; 140. Calls on the Commission to improve knowledge transfer between AI research and the  business world by setting up business networks, regulatory sandboxes and contact  points with legal personnel and business consultants in universities; 141. Stresses the need to accelerate knowledge transfer in the EU from research and science  to AI applications in industry and the public sector; recommends the creation of a  dedicated public-private partnership (PPP) on AI; calls on the Commission to establish  European AI data centres, jointly developed by government and industry and using  strong encryption to protect the stored data in an appropriate manner; stresses the need  to support the development of large-scale testing sites for AI; calls on the Commission  to provide financial incentives at EU level to launch pilot projects in Member States; 142. Supports strongly the establishment of an AI lighthouse under the Horizon Europe  framework, which would be the continent’s pioneering centre of excellence for AI  research and development; notes, however, that the EU and the Member States should  commit to a long-term and much more substantial investment plan in the region of EUR  1 billion per year over the next 10 years; adds that the AI lighthouse would be an  excellent place to create regulatory sandboxes, meaning time- and space-limited areas  for experimenting with, testing and finessing specific AI applications that carry some  risk but also have high potential for public good; 143. Points out that the designation of European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) under the  digital Europe programme is another important step in building up an AI ecosystem of  excellence based on university-industry clusters; criticises, however, the fact that the  hubs are dotted across the continent and that the interplay with other digital hubs  designated by the European Institute of Innovation & Technology (EIT) and under the  Horizon Europe framework remains unclear; suggests, consequently, that more  coordination is needed, as is the establishment of a cooperating overall cluster of  46 https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/eu-budget/performance-and-reporting/programmes-performance/digitaleurope-programme-performance_en

Proposes to scale up and align existing mission such as ELLIS, platforms such as  CLAIRE and flagship projects such as HumanE AI and AI4EU with the goal of  promoting ambitious, collaborative and EU-wide research and development goals as  well as projects; explains that a single AI mission with clear milestones and regular  evaluation would attract the most talented researchers, bringing them together to  address the biggest scientific questions in AI; e) Ecosystem of trust i. SOCIETY AND AI 145. Proposes that on top of the suggested AI training, the EU and its Member States should  create awareness raising campaigns, including public discussions at local level, as an  additional means to reach, inform and empower citizens to understand better the  capabilities, limitations and impacts of AI; ii. EGOVERNANCE 146. Calls on Member States to deliver on the Tallinn Declaration on eGovernment and put  mechanisms in place to provide borderless, interoperable, personalised, user-friendly,  and end-to-end digital public services based on AI to all individuals and businesses at  all levels of public administration; is of the opinion that the objective should be to  increase the number of people that use eGovernment services, with a focus on AI, to up  to 80 % of all EU citizens over the next five years; iii. EHEALTH 147. Calls for human-centred design and an evidence-based approach to AI in health that  focuses on patient-oriented and high-quality digital healthcare and that seeks consumer  and user feedback throughout the development process; calls on the Commission to set  the global tone on cutting-edge healthcare and well-being, placing the benefits of AI at  the centre of policy-making; urges the prioritisation of funding, the setting of strategic  goals, the fostering of cooperation and the adoption of AI applications in healthcare as a  critical sector; f) Industrial strategy i.

Proposes to offer an alternative to the buy-out vision of many AI start-ups by ensuring  that government support is provided at all stages of their development; underlines in this  regard that the EU should amplify its efforts at offering SMEs and start-ups  development paths and services, especially by promoting the use of digital tools,  developing AI transition plans and further expanding the exchange of best practices;  urges the Commission and the Member States to provide better counselling and more  concrete support through networks, digital hubs, AI trainers, business mentoring and  site visits; iii. INTERNATIONAL STAGE 150. Points out that the EU should forge a strong international core value-based technology  alliance, working together with like-minded partners in order to overcome regulatory  divergence in the fields of privacy rights, data flows or competition rules and to remedy  strategic vulnerabilities by building on each other’s assets and pooling resources in  areas where it is mutually beneficial to do so; g) Security and military deterrence i. AI AND LAW ENFORCEMENT 151. Considers it to be of paramount importance for the safety and security of citizens that  law enforcement agencies are well advanced in AI development, making full use of the  potential of digital technologies to prevent and investigate serious crimes through realtime facial recognition in select locations; underlines that diligently developed  algorithms for crime prevention and investigation, based on highly qualitative data, may  provide a higher level of efficiency, neutrality and legal certainty than human law  enforcement agents, and should thus be promoted; ii. CYBERSECURITY 152. Asks Member States to confer competences in the field of cybersecurity to the European  level in order to enable the EU to better pool resources, more efficiently coordinate and  streamline national cybersecurity policies, further increase cybersecurity capacity  building and awareness raising, and swiftly provide cybersecurity knowledge and  technical assistance to SMEs as well as to other more traditional sectors; iii. CYBER DEFENCE 153. Urges Member States to pursue an active policy of European cyber diplomacy by  denouncing and attributing foreign-supported AI-powered cyberattacks, while  leveraging the full toolbox of EU diplomacy; advises that this should include diplomatic  responses, the termination of financial aid and sanctions against those countries or  proxies that engage in malicious cyber activities or that sponsor cybercrimes; believes  that the EU, in close cooperation with NATO, should consider using AI to execute  cyber counter-strikes against repeat offenders; iv. MILITARY USE OF AI
PR\1224166EN.docx 33/38 PE680.928v01-00 EN154. Notes that exclusive military and national security uses of AI should be exempt from  civilian AI legislation, since overregulation in the field of security and defence could  pre-emptively restrict the EU’s capacity to innovate and deploy AI technologies,  placing it at a disadvantage to its adversaries that do not have such constraints; 5. Conclusion: an urgent call for action! 155. Believes that the ongoing digital transformation, where AI plays the key role, has  triggered a global tech race that will determine the future political and economic power  status of the European Union; urgently stresses that the EU is so far falling further and  further behind in this race with the result that current technological standards are being  actively developed and determined outside of Europe, presenting an existential threat to  our democracy and prosperity; concludes that in order to remain both competitive and a  global power, the EU needs to become a global leader in AI; 156. Highlights that AI, while often portrayed as an unpredictable threat, is in reality a  powerful digital tool that is already a game changer in core fields that bring benefits for  the good of society, including in our aspirations to combat climate change, provide  innovate healthcare, revolutionise employment, strengthen our security and democratic  systems and boost our competitiveness on a global scale; stresses that these benefits  should guide and inform regulation and public communication on AI; 157. Highlights further that the EU, with its regulatory and market powers, has the potential  to shape the international debate on AI and to push for common standards for the ethicsdriven, sustainable and trustworthy development and use of this technology, fully in line  with European principles and values; highlights, however, that the window of  opportunity for consolidating such a distinctive European approach to AI on the  international stage is closing fast, which is why the EU needs to join forces and agree on  a joint AI strategy, including a balanced regulatory framework, very soon; 158. Stresses that currently, the EU does not meet any of the preconditions that would allow  us to fully capture the potential of AI, especially compared to the AI frontrunners China  and the US; finds that a lack of legal certainty, access to and sharing of high-quality  data, harmonised rules and standards, funding, research, skills and infrastructure for  core technologies, as well as high regulatory burdens, have led to a situation in which  the EU’s competitiveness is constantly decreasing; is convinced that only by executing  a bold and comprehensive EU Roadmap for AI will the EU manage to catch up; states  that Parliament needs an ad hoc digital committee with legislative powers in order to be  able to respond effectively to these horizontal challenges, ; notes that as long as this  committee is not established, clear competences among existing committees need to be  defined in order to enable them to follow up effectively on all specific parts of this  Roadmap; 159. Concludes that it is the EU’s responsibility to quickly set up a favourable regulatory  environment for AI that provides for swift digital law-making, effective governance and  balanced ethical standards, while at the same time preventing overregulation and giving  enough leeway for innovation; urges that the adequate development and training of AI  will require better access to high-quality data, common standards and incentives for  voluntary data sharing; calls on its Committees on Legal Affairs (JURI), Internal 
PE680.928v01-00 34/38 PR\1224166EN.docx ENMarket and Consumer Protection (IMCO), Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), Civil  Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), and Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) to  ensure that these goals are met; 160. Concludes that our digital ambitions in fields such as AI can only be achieved through a  fully integrated and fully harmonised digital single market that promotes cross-border  exchange and that guarantees that the same rules and standards apply to all AI  researchers and companies across the EU; stresses in this regard that the EU also needs  to target abuses of market power in order to level the playing field; calls on the  Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON), IMCO and JURI Committees to guarantee  this; 161. Concludes that AI systems require robust infrastructure and connectivity; stresses that  digital green infrastructure which is in line with the Green Deal will target all sectors,  including agriculture, electricity, housing, transport, businesses, value chains and the  circular economy; stresses that AI will not, however, be functional without strong  deployment of broadband, fibre, edge nodes and 5G, or if key emerging technologies  such as quantum computing are not made a priority; calls on the Environment, Public  Health and Food Safety (ENVI), Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), Regional  Development (REGI), Transport and Tourism (TRAN), ITRE, ECON and IMCO  Committees to follow up on these points; 162. Concludes that in order to promote innovation in AI, it is necessary to provide EU  citizens with the means to acquire digital skills; stresses that in order to increase digital  literacy and resilience and to combat the digital divide among citizens in the digital age,  digital and AI education needs to start at an early stage and remain available at all levels  of employment; finds that initiatives to establish AI ecosystems of excellence, to  increase the pool of AI talent in the EU and to combat brain drain are of vital  importance; calls on the Culture and Education (CULT), Employment and Social  Affairs (EMPL) and ITRE Committee to focus their resources on these fields; 163. Concludes that in order to build trust in AI among citizens, public services and their  administrative structures need to lead by example; stresses that the EU needs to  accelerate the uptake of AI in eGovernance in order to facilitate the secure use of AI in  public administrations and to strengthen democratic structures as well as the EU’s core  ethical principles; stresses furthermore that AI in the healthcare sector, if provided with  the means to securely access patients’ data, will revolutionise healthcare systems; calls  on the ENVI, ITRE, JURI and LIBE Committees to monitor and accelerate these  developments; 164. Concludes that the EU’s AI strategy should not overlook military and security  considerations that arise with the global deployment of AI technologies; stresses that  international cooperation with like-minded partners needs to be increased in order to  safeguard our ethical principles and values but also to protect our continent against new  technological threats; finds that our entire security system is affected by the digital  transformation; urges the EU, therefore, to come up with new policy responses and  tactics; calls on the Foreign Affairs (AFET), International Trade (INTA) and LIBE  Committees, and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence (SEDE) to develop  effective responses;

PE680.928v01-00 36/38 PR\1224166EN.docx ENEXPLANATORY STATEMENT A concise and fully-fledged EU Roadmap for AI was not possible to establish within the  character limit for this report. As a result, many important policy recommendations in  Chapter 4 are missing in the version that is officially presented on 9 November. The rapporteur will however table all dropped paragraphs as additional amendments on     6 December. The complete version of the draft report, including all missing policy  recommendations (highlighted in yellow) can already be accessed from 9 November via: https://www.axel-voss-europa.de/digitalpolitik/ Artificial Intelligence (AI) determines the current digital transformation as the key  technology. As a term encompassing a wide range of technologies that are guided by a given  set of human-defined objectives and have some degree of autonomy in their actions, AI  processes and responds to the data it receives, leading to learning, reasoning, planning,  decision-making and creativity. Therefore, AI covers technologies that are already in  widespread use, technologies that are currently under development as well as speculative  inventions that might exist in the future. Within the current digital transformation, the impact  of AI cannot be understated. It will continue to transform and improve the way we work, we  move and we communicate. It will continue to transform and improve our society, our  administration, our industries, our economy, our health care and our security system. Thus, AI  has an impact on every sector and every part of our day-to-day life. The Committee on Artificial Intelligence in the Digital Age (AIDA) was set up to present a  EU Roadmap for AI that encompasses the steps the European Union needs to take in order to  respond to these economic and societal challenges within the next few years. Within the  global competition, the EU has already fallen behind. Significant parts of AI innovation and  even more the commercialisation of AI technologies take place outside of Europe. We neither  take the lead in development, research or investment in AI. If we do not set clear standards for  the human-centred approach to AI that is based on our core European ethical standards and  democratic values, they will be determined elsewhere. The consequences of falling further  behind do not only threaten our economic prosperity but also lead to an application of AI that  threatens our security, including surveillance, disinformation and social scoring. In fact, to be  a global power means to be a leader in AI. Therefore, the goal of the AIDA committee and this report is an urgent call to action. It  provides a holistic approach for a common, long-term position that highlights the EU’s key  values and objectives relating to AI in the digital age that ensures that the digital transition is  human-centric and consistent with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.  In line with its mandate, the report first defines the European approach to AI and reiterates its  importance within the digital transformation. Instead of focusing on threats, a human-centric  approach to AI based on our values will use AI for its benefits and give us the competitive  edge to frame AI regulation on the global stage. Rather than an unpredictable and fully  autonomous system, with the right rules, safeguards and regulations, AI is merely a tool for  data processing that can revolutionize systems for the good of society. The report thus continues by analysing the future impact of AI in the digital age, balancing its  benefits towards certain risks on the EU economy, in particular on health, infrastructure, 
PR\1224166EN.docx 37/38 PE680.928v01-00 ENsustainability, transport, agriculture, energy, defence, industry, democracy, e-government,  employment, skills and education. Moreover, based on this analysis, the report demonstrates  the EU’s current place in the global digital competition, which uncovers several deficiencies.  It shows that the EU currently does not meet any of the preconditions that enable innovation  to fully capture the potential of AI and other emerging technologies. A lack of access to and  sharing of high-quality data, a lack of harmonized rules and standards, high regulatory burden  and a lack of funding, research, skills and infrastructure for AI lead to the EU’s stagnating  competitiveness. In order to tackle these deficiencies and with the goal to make the EU a global leader in AI,  the report presents its EU Roadmap for AI with clear policy recommendations for the next  years. With a holistic approach and built on the key takeaways from the previous chapters, the  Roadmap underlines several horizontal goals with clear recommendations for the European  Commission, EU Member States and the European Parliament. For one, there is a clear need for a favourable regulatory environment established by dynamic  law-making and modern governance. Current regulatory frameworks, both on EU and  Member State level, are too fragmented, too ponderous and do not provide for legal certainty.  Thus, it is necessary to speed up and streamline legislative and governance processes when it  comes to digital policy. Only high-risk AI applications need to be strictly regulated in order to  achieve leeway for innovation and avoid regulatory burden. Moreover, AI is entirely  dependent on high-quality data. Current frameworks do not provide for timely access and  sufficient sharing of data, which needs to be revised and extended. Our ambitions on AI can only be achieved through a fully integrated and fully harmonized  completed digital single market that facilitates cross-border exchange and innovation. AI  requires a robust infrastructure and connectivity roll-out with access for every citizen. The  digital infrastructure must be based on sustainable principles in line with the Green Deal,  targeting all sectors, including agriculture, electricity, housing, transport, businesses, value  chains and the circular economy. Moreover, AI will not be functional without strong  deployment of broadband, fibre, edge nodes and 5G as well as making key emerging  technologies such as quantum computing a priority. In addition, it is key to achieve an ecosystem of AI excellence where every EU citizen is  provided with the means to acquire digital and AI skills at all stages of education and  employment. That way, we can also establish AI centres of excellence as well as increase and  retain AI talent to combat brain drain and remain competitive on the global scale. In order to  build trust in AI among citizens, public services and their administrative structures need to  lead with example by taking up AI in e-governance and e-health. Lastly, the EU’s AI strategy should not overlook military and security aspects that arise with  its deployment. The EU needs to cooperate internationally with like-minded partners to be  able to promote its human-centric vision of AI and secure the EU’s ethical principles in the  global competition.
