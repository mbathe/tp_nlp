  1 Foreword   This report is published in the context of AI Watch, the European Commission knowledge service to monitor  the development, uptake and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for Europe, launched in December 2018.   AI has become an area of strategic importance with potential to be a key driver of economic development. AI  also has a wide range of potential social implications. As part of its Digital Single Marke t Strategy, the  European Commission put forward in April 2018 a European strategy on AI in its Communication "Artificial  Intelligence for Europe" COM(2018)237. The aims of the European AI strategy announced in the  communication are:   ● To boost the EU's techn ological and industrial capacity and AI uptake across the economy, both by  the private and public sectors   ● To prepare for socio -economic changes brought about by AI   ● To ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework.   Subsequently, in December 2018, the E uropean Commission and the Member States published a “Coordinated  Plan on Artificial Intelligence”, COM(2018)795, on the development of AI in the EU. The Coordinated Plan  mentions the role of AI Watch to monitor its implementation.   AI Watch monitors Europe an Union’s industrial, technological and research capacity in AI; AI -related policy  initiatives in the Member States; uptake and technical developments of AI; and AI impact. AI Watch has a  European focus within the global landscape. In the context of AI Wa tch, the Commission works in coordination  with Member States. AI Watch results and analyses are published on the AI Watch Portal  (https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch_en ).  From AI Watch in -depth analyses we will be able to understand better European Union’s areas of strength and  areas where investment is needed. AI Watch will provide an independent assessment of the impacts and  benefits of AI on growth, jobs, education, and society.   AI Watch is developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission in collaboration with  the Directorate ‑General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT). This report  addresses the following objectives of AI Watch:  Developing an overview and analysis of the European AI  ecosystem.

  3 Abstract   This report proposes an operational definition of artificial intelligence to be adopted in the context of AI  Watch , the Commission knowledge service to monitor the development, uptake and impact of artificial  intelligence for Europe. The definition , which  will be used as a basis for the AI Watch  monitoring activity, is  established by means of a flexible scientific methodology that allows regular revision. The operational  definition is constituted by a concise taxonomy and a list of keywords that characteris e the core domains of  the AI research field, and transversal topics such as applications of the former or ethical and philosophical  considerations , in line with the wider monitoring objective of AI Watch . The AI taxonomy is designed to inform  the AI landsc ape analysis and will expectedly detect AI applications in neighbour technological domains such  as robotics  (in a broader sense) , neuroscience or internet of things.  The starting point to develop the  operational definition is the definition of AI adopted b y the High Level Expert Group on artificial intelligence.   To derive this operational definition we have followed a mixed methodology. On one hand, we apply natural  language processing methods to a large set of AI literature. On the other hand, we carry out  a qualitative  analysis on 5 5 key documents including artificial intelligence definitions from three complementary  perspectives: policy, research and industry.   A valuable contribution of this work is the collection of definitions developed between 1955 an d 2019, and  the summarisation of the main features of the concept of artificial intelligence as reflected in the relevant  literature.  
  4 Executive summary   This report proposes a taxonomy for artificial intelligence (AI)  and a list of related keywords,  as an o perational  definition for AI in the framework of the AI Watch , the Commission’s knowledge service to monitor the  development, uptake and impact of artificial intelligence for Europe. AI Watch  aims to monitor the industrial,  technological and research capac ity, as well as policy initiatives in the Member States, uptake and technical  developments of AI and its impact. AI Watch  has a European focus within the global landscape and covers all  Member States. The established operational definition will be used as a basis for the AI Watch  monitoring  activity. The AI taxonomy will assist in the mapping of the AI landscape, and it  is expected to detect AI  applications in  other technological domains such as robotics  (in a wider sense) , big data, web technologies,  high performance computing, embedded systems, internet of things, etc.    The need to establish an operational definition proceeds  from the absence of a mutually agreed definition  and taxonomy of AI, which would impede the attainment of the wide monitoring objective of AI Watch . It is in  this basis that we propose a multi -perspective analysis to structure the AI taxonomy . In particul ar we provide  a unique taxonomy that represents and interconnects all the AI subdomains from political, research and  industrial perspective. In this scope, the taxonomy reflects these perspectives and aims to cover the entire AI  landscape, which consists o f economic agents with R&D or industrial AI activities. Moreover, c onsidering that  AI is a dynamic field, we propose an iterative method that can be updated over time to capture the rapid AI  evolution, and that provides a taxonomy and a set of keywords. Th e method consists of the following steps: (i)  qualitative analysis of AI definitions and subdomains emanating from reports with academic, industrial and  policy perspective s, (ii) selection of definition, identification of representative keywords in AI with  a natural  language processing method, and taxonomy formation, and (iii) taxonomy and keywords validation.   In the first part of the method , the objective is to collect and analyse the existing definitions and identify the  main subdomains covering all aspec ts in the AI field. In this scope, we conduct a qualitative analysis in a  selected set of 29 AI policy and institutional reports (including standardisation efforts , national strategies, and  international  organisations reports ), 23 relevant research publica tions and 3 market reports, from the  beginning of AI in 1955 until today. AI has been usually described in relation to human intelligence, or  intelligence in general , with many definitions refer ring to machines that behave like humans or are capable of  actions that require intelligence. Since human intelligence is also difficult to define and measure, and  although there have been different attempts of quantification, the objective definition of something as  subjective and abstract as intelligence, falsely g ives the impression of a precision that cannot be obtained. As  a consequence, most definitions found in research, policy or market reports are vague and propose an ideal  target rather than a measurable research concept. The study of the definitions found i n literature leads us to  identify four characteristics that are commonly mentioned in AI: i) perception of the environment and realworld complexity , ii) information processing : collecting and interpreting inputs , iii) decision making, including  reasoning, learning and taking actions; and iv) achievement of pre-defined goals . Taking into consideration  these features, we consider the definition proposed by the HLEG on AI as the starting point in developing the  opera tional definition in AI Watch : "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and possibly also  hardwar e) systems designed by humans  that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by  perceiving their environment through data acqu isition, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured  data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information, derived from this data and deciding the best  action(s) to take to achieve the given goal. AI systems can either use symbolic rul es or learn a numeric model,  and they can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous  actions." (HLEG, 2019) .  Although it may be considered highly technical for different audiences and objectives, it is a very  comprehensive definition , which incorporates the aspects of perception, understanding, interpretation,  interaction, decision making, adaptation to behaviour and achievement of goals, whereas other definitions do  not address them in their entirety. Consider ing that the HLEG definition is comprehensive, hence highly  technical and detailed, less specialised definitions can be adopted for studies of different objective, such as  enterprise surveys. In this scope, the definitions provided by the EC JRC Flagship r eport on AI (2018) and the  European AI Strategy (COM(2018) 237 final), or the one to be used in the AI module of the Community survey  on ICT usage and e -commerce in enterprises 2021, are suitable alternatives.   Regarding the AI subdomains, we found that des pite the multiple facets of AI, and consequently the lack of a  common definition and taxonomy among research communities, literature or reports, there are a number of  common topics in the definitions and taxonomies analysed for this study. In particular , in order to establish  the taxonomy, in addition to  the assessment of the aforementioned set of documents, we explored the  information provided by the official publication of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial 
  5 Intelligence (AAAI) (aitopics.org ), and several top AI conferences. The proposed AI taxonomy , as a list of  representative core and transversal AI domains  and subdomains , will assist us to classify R&D and industrial  agents  and their activities . Therefore, it encompass es main theoretical AI scientific areas , and AI related non technological issues  from industrial and R&D AI activities , as well as ethical and philosophical issues. It  remains linked  to the HLEG definition of AI in the context of AI Watch . The proposed taxon omy follows :      AI taxonomy     AI domain  AI subdomain   Core Reasoning  Knowledge representation   Automated reasoning   Common sense reasoning   Planning  Planning and Scheduling   Searching   Optimisation   Learning  Machine learning   Communication  Natural language processing   Perception  Computer vision   Audio processing   Transversal  Integration and  Interaction  Multi -agent systems   Robotics and Automation   Connected and Automated vehicles   Services  AI Services   Ethics and Philosophy  AI Ethics   Philosophy of AI   Source: Authors' elaboration       To complete the operational definition of AI, a  list of keywords representative of the AI subdomains  is  established based on a part of the techno -economic segments (TES) analytical approach that will provide at a  later stage an overview of the AI landscape worldwide. The keywords are used in text queries to identify  activities and economic agents relevant  to AI, for their further analysis. The list of keywords is the result of a  multi -step process combining a semi -automatic text mining approach, desk research and domain experts'  involvement. More specifically, the top keywords from a vast collection of  journals in AI are identified though  text mining in the Scopus database in three different years , from which the most frequent author’s keywords  per year are selected. Similarly, the industrial aspect is addressed by extracting keywords from firms’  descriptio ns. Subsequently, the initial list of keywords is reviewed by AI experts and a short selection is made.  A topic modelling is then performed, so as to detect the most representative topics and terms without the  involvement of any expert that might induce un intentional bias. The initial list and the list resulting from the  topic modelling step are merged and any redundancies are removed. External domain experts from several AI  subdomains review the list and advise on synonyms that need to be grouped and on ta rgeting subdomains  that may not be sufficiently captured by the initial sources. The taxonomy and list of keywords is then  validated and finalised.   Valuable contribution s of this work are: the collection of definitions developed between 1955 and 2019; the  summarisation of the main features of the concept of artificial intelligence as reflected in the relevant  literature ; and the development of a replicable process that can provide a dynamic definition and taxonomy of  the AI.    
  6 1 Introduction   AI has become a n area of strategic importance and been identified as a potential key driver of economic  development as underlined in the European strategy on AI (COM (2018) 237 on Artificial Intelligence for  Europe) and in the related Coordinated Plan (COM(2018)795). Sim ilarly, AI has become a clear target for  national governments resulting in the formulation of national AI strategies. AI Watch  is the Commission  knowledge service to monitor the development, uptake and impact of artificial intelligence  (AI) for Europe ,  launched in December 2018 . It will monitor industrial, technological and research capacity, policy initiatives in  the Member States, uptake and technical developments of AI and its impact. AI Watch  has a European focus  within the global landscape and covers a ll Member States.   The aim of this document  is to establish an operational definition of AI formed by a concise taxonomy and a  set of keywords that characterise the core and transversal domains  of AI. The operational definition is  based  on a concrete  and inclusive definition of AI . Such a taxonomy and keywords will assist the  mapping  of the AI  ecosystem of interrelated economic agents, and will allow to describe their technological areas of  specialisation. Also , it will expectedly  overlap with other technological domains such as robotics  (in a broader  sense) , big data, web technologies, high performance computing, embedded systems, internet of things, etc.   The operational definition will be used as a basis for the monitoring activity and will serve as  a reference for  the other AI Watch  outputs. This objective results from the need to monitor the implementation of the EC  Coordinated Plan on AI on an annual basis, as reflected in the communication1.  This work has been organised in a three step strategy a s follows:   — Review of existing definitions . We review AI definitions found in a selected set of 55 documents: 29 AI  policy and institutional reports, 2 3 relevant research publications and 3 market reports , in order to  incorporate academic, industrial and corporate perspectives .  — Definition selection , taxonomy formation  and representative keywords selection : We then  adopt, based on this review, a general definition of AI and we complement this with a taxonomy and  keywords that characterise  the AI domain. The  keywords are extracted based on automatic text analysis  of a corpus of AI scientific references, firm -level databases, and industrial activity documents ,  complemented by desk research and domain experts' involvement.   — Definition  and taxonomy  validation : We validate our approach with a small number of AI experts.   Since AI is a dynamic field, the described  process  is planned to be dynamic . This taxonomy  and keywords  building process will be  reviewed and iterated in the future  to capture the rapid evolution of AI .  The rest of the report is organised as follows: section  2 presents the AI definition , together with its  operationalisation in the form of a  taxonomy and list of keywords , as well as a description of the process.  section  3 provides detailed information  about the 5 5 documents analysed, including the source, the text of  the definition a nd AI subdomains -when available -, contextual information about the source and the  document itself, and the date of publication . Finally , section  4 presents the conclusions drawn from this study.                                                     1  Footnote 19 of the Annex: "AI Watch developed by the Joint Research Centre will contribute to monitoring AI -related development  and will provide a number of analyses necessary to support the implementation of the European AI initiative. Among others it will  develop AI indexes addressing all dimensions relevant for policy making. Such information will be made available at the AI Watch  portal https://ec.europa. eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch_en ". 
  7 2 Proposal for a common definition on Artificial i ntelligence   To establish an operational  AI definition  to be adopted in AI Watch , composed by  a taxonomy and  representative  keywords , we propose a 3 -layer approach  that allows the dynamic update of all the  aforementioned . This approach consists of the following layers :  i. AI definition selection ,   ii. taxonomy formation  with core and transversal AI subdomains ,  iii. pertinent keyword selection  for each  subdomain of the taxonomy .  In this scope , we consider  55 documents that address the AI domain from different perspectives,  acknowledging three complementary approaches under which AI is considered:   — the policy and institutional perspective , which is especially relevant for the objective of this work given  the scope in which the AI definitio n is to be used, focus es on the development of the industry, the  research capacity, and the impact on society of advanced technologies. This approach considers AI as an  instrument for growth and technological development. We have collected and analysed doc uments from  the European Commission, national strategies  and policy documents  (European and non -European) , as  well as  other international institutions such as the OECD, UNESCO , World Economic Forum, ISO, etc.;   — the research perspective , which is the unders tanding of AI as a research field and its development as a  general purpose technology;   — the market perspective , which has a strong focus on industrial development and assessment of the  economic value and future market prospects.   The simultaneous  consideration of the three approaches provides an overview of the past and current  perceptions of AI and how the concept evolves over time. All the collected documents provide a n AI definition,  or identify or describe core and transversal AI subdomains, most of the documents present both types of  information. These were analysed in order to identify the main aspects specified as AI features, as well as the  core and transversal AI subdomains, so as  to propose an operational definition and ta xonomy  that is  useful  for the objectives of AI Watch . The thorough investigation of the concept from an ontological perspective and  the analysis of the evolution of AI as a concept and research field remain out of the scope of this study. The  details of th e explored  definitions  can be found in section  3. Table 3 offers a collection of the definitions and  AI subdomains covered, as provided in the original documents .   2.1 AI definition s  Despite the increased interest in  AI by the academia, industry and public institutions, there is no standard  definition of what AI actually involves. AI has been described  by certain approaches  in relation to human  intelligence, or intelligence in general. Many definitions refer to machines that beh ave like humans or are  capable of actions that require intelligence (US NDAA, 2019; Russel and Norvig, 1955; McCarthy, 2007;  Nilsson, 1998; Fogel, 1995; Albus, 1991; Luger and Stubblefield, 1993; Winston, 1992; McCarthy, 1988;  Gardner, 1987; 1983; Newell a nd Simon, 1976; Bellman, 1978; Minsky, 1969; McCarthy et al., 1955 ). Since  human intelligence is also difficult to define and measure, and although there have been different attempts  of quantification (Gardner, 1983; 19 87; Neisser et al., 1996 ), the object ive definition of something as  subjective and abstract as intelligence (Kaplan, 2016 ) falsely gives the impression of a precision that cannot  be obtained. As a consequence, most definitions found in research, policy or market reports are vague and  propose an ideal target rather than a measurable research concept.   The oversimplification of the concept of intelligence that is needed in order to define, or even develop, AI is  illustrated by Russel and Norvig (1985; 2010) and emphasised by the High Level Exper t Group on A rtificial  Intelligence  (HLEG, 2019) when focusing on rational AI and hence considering benchmark against an ideal  performance. "A system is rational if it does the “right thing”, given what it knows" (Russel and Norvig, 1985;  2010 ).  Two activities are especially considered in this study when analysing AI definitions: existing standardisation  efforts, and the contribution of the High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence.     
  8 Standardisation efforts   In order to collect information o n the standardisation of AI and its applications , the International Organization  for Standardization (ISO) is included in the analysis . Currently the available AI definitions are found in the  ISO/IEC 2382 of 2015, established in 1993 and 1995. In 2018 , in an effort  to update these definitions, two  sub committees with six working groups and one study group are formed with the goal to develop 10 AI  standards for ISO/IEC. The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC42 is the first international standards committee identifying the  entire AI ecosystem. JTC1’s scope for SC42 is to become “a systems integration entity to work with other ISO,  IEC and JTC 1 committees looking at AI applications”. Until May 2019, three standards are published with a  different objective; hence an AI definition  is not included.   The High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence   The High -Level Expert Group (HLEG) on Artificial Intelligence has been appointed by the European Commission  with the main aim to support the implementation of the European AI Strategy. This includes the elaboration of  recommendations on future -related policy developments and on ethical, legal and societal issues related to  AI, including socio -economic challenges. The HLEG on AI is composed by 52 representatives from academia,  civil society and industry. The first two outputs of the HLEG on AI are the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy  Artificial Intelligence2, and a definition of AI3 developed to describe a common understanding of the domain  and its capabilities, and serving as a  supporting document for the HLEG's deliverables. The HLEG definition is  considered together with the remaining documents analysed in this study.   Common features in AI definitions   Despite the multiple facets of AI, and consequently the lack of a common def inition, there are a number of  commonalities that we observe in the analysed definitions. This expression of common aspects suggests that  they may be considered as the main features of AI:   — Perception of the environment , including  the consideration of the real world complexity (HLEG, 2019;  European AI Strategy, 2018; EC JRC Flagship report on AI, 2018; Tsinghua University, 2018; Nakashima,  1999; Nilsson, 1998; Poole et al., 1998; Fogel, 1995; Wang, 1995; Albus, 1991; Newell and Simon, 1976).   — Information pro cessing: collecting and interpreting inputs (in form of data) (HLEG, 2019; European AI  Strategy, 2018; EC JRC Flagship report on AI, 2018; Kaplan and Haenlein, 2018; Tsinghua University,  2018; Nakashima, 1999; Nilsson, 1998; Poole et al., 1998; Wang, 1995) .  — Decision making (including reasoning and learning): taking actions, performance of tasks (including  adaptation, reaction to changes in the environment) with certain level of autonomy (HLEG, 2019; OECD,  2019; European AI Strategy 2018; EC JRC Flagship rep ort on AI 2018; Kaplan and Haenlein 2018;  Tsinghua University, 2018; Nilsson, 1998; Poole Mackworth and Goebel, 1998; Fogel, 1995; ISO/IEC 2382 28, 1995; Wang, 1995; Albus, 1991; Newell and Simon, 1976).   — Achievement of specific goals: this is considered as  the ultimate reason of AI systems (HLEG 2019; OECD,  2019; European AI Strategy , 2018; Kaplan and Haenlein, 2018; Poole at al., 1998; Fogel, 1995; Albus,  1991; Newell and Simon, 1976).   2.2 AI Watch  operational definition  of AI  The proposed AI Watch  operational definition is based on a concrete definition  taken as a starting point , and is  composed by  a concise taxonomy and a set of keywords that characterise the core and transversal domains   of AI. To reach a common understanding o n the concept of AI in the framework  of AI Watch , it is important  that the starting point is an inclusive definition , hence covering all technological developments and activities  carried out by all types actors that make up the AI  ecosystem , whether industrial, research, gove rnment  initiatives . Taking into consideration the features that many of the explored definitions share (see Table 3), as  well as the afore mentioned objective s, we consider the definition proposed by the HLEG on AI  as the  starting point for the  develop ment of  the operational definition . Although it may be co nsidered highly  technical for different audience s and objectives , it is a very comprehensive definition which incorporates the  aspects of perception, understanding, interpretation, interaction, decision making, adaptation to behaviour and  achievement of go als, whereas other definitions do not address  them  in their entirety :                                                    2  ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58477   3  ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=56341  
  9 HLEG definition of AI   "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and possibly also hardware) systems designed by humans (2)  that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through  data acquisition, interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or  processing the information, derived f rom this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given  goal. AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can also adapt their  behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actio ns."  Other suitable definitions  targeted to alternative  uses  Considering that the HLEG definition is comprehensive, hence highly technical and detailed, less specialised  definitions can be adopted for studies of different objective, such as enterprise surv eys. In this scope, the  definitions provided  by the EC JRC Flagship report on AI (2018) (see detailed reference in subsection  3.1.1.4 )  and the European AI Strategy (C OM(2018) 237 final, see subsection  3.1.1.3 ) are suitable alternatives :  EC JRC Flagship report on AI   “AI is a generic term that refers to any machine or algorithm that is capable of observing its environment,  learning, and based on the knowledge and experience gained, taking intelligent action or proposing decisions.  There are many different technologies that fall under this broad AI definition. At the moment, ML 4 techniques  are the most widely used.”   European AI Strategy   "Artificial Intelligence refers to systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and  taking action — with some degree of autonomy — to achieve specific goals. "  The latter  has been considered by Eurostat as the starting point for the development of a definition that will  be included in  the AI module of the Community Survey on ICT Usage and e -Commerce i n Enterprises  2021  upon approval.   Community survey on ICT usage and e -commerce in enterprises 2021   “Artificial intelligence refers to systems that use technologies such as: text mining, computer vision, speech  recognition, natural language generation, machine learning, deep learning to gather and/or use data to predict,  recommend or decide, with varying levels of autonomy, the best action to achieve specific goals.”   2.2.1  AI taxonomy   The proposed taxonomy addresses political, research and industrial perspectives and aims to cover  and  classify  the AI landscape , which  consists of  economic agents with R&D or industrial AI related activities.  Therefore, this taxonomy is able to detect correspondingly a wide range of core AI related scientific  subdomains (e.g. knowledge representation and reasoning, machine learning) and transversal  topics such as  applications of the former (e.g. robots, automated vehicles , etc.) or ethical and philosophical considerations .  The taxonomy is presented as a reduced list of abstract high level domains and their related subdomains.  These are meant to  encompass the main theoretical AI branches , as well as AI related non -technological  issues. The AI subdomains are represented by a list of keywords (see subsection 2.2.2 ), these will enable us to  capture the AI activities carried out by economic agents, for further analysis of the AI landscape from a  techno -economic perspective.   2.2.1.1  Sources   The AI field allows several classification approaches and correspon ding divisions in specific subdomains or  topics. It should be noted again that  there is no commonly agreed AI taxonomy among research communities,  literature or reports, given the rapid  evolution of this knowledge domain and varied perspectives from which  AI is considered. For this part of the study , we have analysed existing taxonomies and attempts to disentangle   the AI knowledge domain. We have explored the following sources:                                                        (4)    Machine Learning  
  10 — AITopics5: this website is an official publication of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial  Intelligence (AAAI), presenting in ordered way information about AI. The information gathered covers  different dimensions: research (through journals and conference s), AI applications, authors; and different  types of sources: papers, news, tweets, etc. The documents analysed are tagged -combining machine  learning with subject matter expert knowledge - and classified according to two main dimensions:  technological and industrial, that is considering the economic sector in which AI is developed and/or used.  We focus on the technology break down provided by this source. The following AI related fields are  considered by AITopics under AI: Assistive technologies, Cognitive science, Games, Human -centered  computing, Machine learning, Natural language, Representation & reasoning, Robots, Speech, Systems &  languages, Vision, together with other less technology related : Challenges,. Issues, History, Science  fiction, The future6.   — Specialised conferences: we explore the top AI conferences in order to identify submission groups as  proxies of the main current in research sub -fields. The following conference submission groups have been  considered:   o AAAI5: AI and the Web, Applications , Cognitive Modeling, Cognitive Systems, Computational  Sustainability and AI, Game Theory and Economic Paradigms, Game Playing and Interactive  Entertainment, Heuristic Search and Optimization, Human -AI Collaboration, Human -Computation  and Crowd Sourcing, H umans and AI, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Machine  Learning Applications, Machine Learning Methods, Multiagent Systems, Natural Language  Processing ( NLP) and Knowledge Representation, NLP and Machine Learning, NLP and Text  Mining, Planning and S cheduling, Reasoning under Uncertainty, Robotics, Search and Constraint  Satisfaction, Vision.   o International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) :   2009: Agent -based and Multi -agent Systems, Multidisciplinary Topics and Applications,  Robotics  and Vision, Natural -Language Processing, Knowledge Representation,  Reasoning and Logic, Constraints, Satisfiability, and Search, Planning and Scheduling,  Uncertainty in AI, Machine Learning, Web and Knowledge -based Information Systems.    2018: Agent -based a nd Multi -agent Systems, Computer Vision, Constraints and SAT,  Heuristic Search and Game Playing, Humans and AI, Knowledge Representation and  Reasoning, Machine Learning, Machine Learning Applications, Multidisciplinary Topics  and Applications, Natural Lang uage Processing, Planning and Scheduling, Robotics,  Uncertainty in AI.   — Documents analysed for this study  (section 3): We also acknowledge the AI subdomains mentioned in the  policy, research and market reports. A summary of the main AI subdomain s listed in all the documents  follow  (subsection  2.3). Additionally, we analysed the taxonomy and keywords developed by the Working  Group drafting the Spanish strategy on AI 7: Machine Learning, Natural Language Pr ocessing, Computer  Vision and Perception, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, Multiagent Systems, Data Science,  Other.   — Moreover, this top -down approach is complemented with a bottom -up approach that converges with the  taxonomy. In the early results of  this approach we used a natural language processing method (topic  modelling) to unbiasedly identify thematic subdomains in a collection of more than 64 thousand  industrial and R&D AI activities. This resulted in the identification of six thematic subdomai ns (machine  learning, computer vision, natural language processing, connected and automated vehicles, robotics, and  AI services), which have a correspondence in the proposed taxonomy.

  11 2.2.1.2  AI Watch  taxonomy   In accordance to the HLEG, AI techniques and sub-disciplines can be grouped under two big strands regarding  the systems' capabilities: (i) reasoning and decision making, (ii) and learning  and perception . The first group of  capabilities includes the transformation of data into knowledge, by transformi ng real world information into  something understandable and usable by machines, and making decisions following an organised path of  planning, solution searching and optimisation. This strand cover s the AI subdomain s of Knowledge  representation and reasonin g (usually making use of symbolic rules to represent and infer  knowledge ) and  Planning (including Planning & Scheduling, Searching, and Optimisation ). The second group of capabilities  develops in absence of symbolic rules, and involves learning -meaning th e extraction of information, and  problem solving  based on structured or unstructured perceived data (written and oral language, image, sound,  etc.)-, adaptation and reaction to changes, behavioural prediction, etc. This second strand covers AI sub -fields  related to learning, communication and perception, such as Machine learning, Natural language processing,  and Computer vision.   The academic approach followed by the HLEG is to be complemented by considering the wider monitoring  objective of AI Watch , namely to capture and measure the AI landscape that involves multifarious economic  agents and complementary approaches, considering also the impact on society. Consequently, the taxonomy  proposed is based on the main AI domains identified by the HLEG and  is expanded to cover additional  dimensions:   — the concept of rational agents, as entities that make decisions and act in relation to its environment,  including interaction with other agents ;  — research and industrial developments, and other AI applications s uch as cloud service models offered by  service companies to accelerate AI uptake ;  — other noteworthy aspects related to AI, but not necessarily technology related, arise as important subjects  in policy documents and the social debate: ethical considerations such as transparency, explainability,  accountability, fairness and safety , as well philosophical matters involving the deepest nature of AI and  its evolution .   Taking into consideration the above, we propose the following AI domains and subdomains as characterising  the AI field. They are divided into core and transversal domains, the former referring to the fundamental  goals of AI, the latter not specifically related to a particular academic discipline or area of knowledge , but as  issues common to a ll the core domains.

  12 It is noteworthy that the suggested domains and subdomains  are related, and not disjoint, subsets of AI. This  ensues from the nature of the AI field that embraces intertwined applications and theoretical advancements,  with fuzzy boundaries. For instance, the fact that machine learning is exploited in either compu ter vision ,  audio processing or  natural language processing does not prevent them from being separate research fields,  considered by top AI conferences topics and related literature (see subsection 2.2.1.1). At the same time,  computer vision and natural la nguage processing are in turn embedded in more complex applications, such as  virtual personal assistants  or robotic platforms. Following this continuum, we consider theoretical  advancements in one end of the taxonomy and industrial applications in the othe r one. We should also stress  that the defined subdomains may not be fully AI -driven. For instance, while mechanical robots do not always  incorporate AI techniques, robotics is considered as a relevant domain impacted by recent developments in AI  techniques .  In conclusion , the AI Watch  taxonomy is not meant to constitute a  rigid classification , but a comprehensive  collection of areas  that represents AI from our three target perspectives: policy, research and industry.    In the following, we succinctly describe the above domains and subdomains , highlighting their identification  in  different AI national strategies and reports.   Domain: Reasoning   Subdomains: Knowledge representation ; Automated reasoning; Common sense reasoni ng  The domain of reasoning tackles the way machines transform data into knowledge, or infer facts from data.  Several classifications address knowledge representation and  automated  reasoning as a field of AI, to  describe the process of justifying (reasoning ) the available data and information, provide solutions and  represent them efficiently, based on a set of symbolic rules (HLEG, 2019; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial  Intelligence, 2019; National Strategy : France  Monitoring Report, 2019 ; CB Insights, 2019; AI National Strategy:  Germany, 2018; Working Paper for National Strategy: India, 2018; ETSI, 2018; National Strategy: France  (Villani Mission), 2018;  AI National Strategy: China, 2017; McCarthy, 2007; Nilsson, 1998 ).  Domain: Planning   Subdomains: Planning and Scheduling; Searching; Optimisation   The main purpose of automated planning concerns the design and execution  of strategies (e.g., an organi sed  set of actions) to carry out some activity, and typically performed  by intelligent agents, autonomous robots  and unmanned vehicles. Unlike classical control and classification problems, the solutions are complex and  must be discovered and optimi sed in the multidimensional space. (HLEG, 2019; Spanish RDI Strategy in  Artificial Intelligence, 2019; National Strategy: France Monitoring Report, 2019 ; CB Insights, 2019; AI National  Strategy: Germany, 2018; McCarthy, 2007 ).  Domain: Learning   Subdomains:  Machine Learning (ML)   By learning, we refer to the ability of systems to auto matically learn, decide, predict, adapt and react to  changes, improving from experience, without being explicitly programmed. ML is widely included in the vast  majority of efforts to identify AI categories, as the basic algorithmic approach to achieve AI r egardless the  type of learning, namely reinforcement, supervised, semi -supervised, unsupervised  (HLEG, 2019; Spanish RDI  Strategy in Artificial Intelligence, 2019; StandICT.eu project, 2019; National Strategy: Denmark, 2019; National  Strategy: France Monitoring report, 2019;  Australia’s Ethic Framework Dawson et al., 2019;  US Congressional  Research Service, 2019; CB Insights, 2019; EC JRC Flagship report on AI, 2018; AI National Strategy: Germany,  2018; OECD, 2018; Tsinghua University, 2018; Working Pa per for AI National Strategy: India, 2018; National  Industrial Strategy: UK, 2018;  2017;  AI National Strategy: France (Villani Mission), 2018; US Department of  Defense, 2018; OECD, 2017; McKinsey, 2017; Stone et al.: AI100, 2016 ; McCarthy, 2007 ).   Domain: Communication   Subdomains:  Natural Language Processing (NLP)   NLP, as the main task of communication, refers to the machine’s ability to identify, process, understand  and/or generate information in written and spoken human communications. It is considered as an AI  subdomain from several national strategies and AI experts, encompassing  applications such as  text  generation, text mining, classification, and machine translation ( HLEG, 2019; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial  Intelligence, 2019; National Strateg y: Denmark, 2019; National Strategy: France Monitoring report, 2019; CB 
  13 Insights, 2019; EC JRC Flagship report on AI, 2018; OECD, 2018; Tsinghua University, 2018; Working Paper for  AI National Strategy: India, 2018; National Strategy: France (Villani Missi on), 2018;  US Department of  Defense, 2018; AI National Strategy: Japan, 2017 ; AI National Strategy: China, 2017 ; McKinsey, 2017; Stone  et al.: AI100, 2016; McCarthy, 2007 )   Domain: Perception   Subdomains:  Computer vision; Audio processing   Perception refers to systems ’ ability to become aware of their environment through the senses : vision,  hearing, manipulation. etc ., being vision and hearing the most developed areas in AI. Computer vision (CV)  refers to activities that identify human faces and objects in di gital images, as part of object -class detection. It  is identified as one of the essential scientific fields with parts belonging to machine perception and, thus, AI. It  is usually referred to as image pattern recognition  for specific tasks, or as in a broa der sense as machine  vision , with applications on face and body recognition, video content recognition, 3D reconstruction, public  safety and security, health etc.  (HLEG, 2019; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence, 2019; National  Strategy: Denmar k, 2019;  Australia’s Ethic Framework Dawson et al., 2019; US Congressional Research  Service, 2019; CB Insights, 2019; EC JRC Flagship report on AI, 2018;  AI National Strategy: Germany, 2018;  Tsinghua University, 2018; Working Paper for AI National Strategy: India, 2018;  OECD, 2018; US Department  of Defense, 2018; AI National Strategy: Japan, 2017;  OECD, 2017;  McKinsey, 2017; Stone et al.: AI100, 2016;  McCarthy, 2007).  Audio processing refers to AI systems allowing the perception or generation (synth esis) of  audio signals, including  speech , but also  other sound material  (e.g. environmental sounds, music) . Speech or  voice recognition, audio processing or sound technologies are also often proposed to be archived as an AI  subdivision (AI4Belgium Report, 2019; COM(2018) 237 final; EC JRC Flagship report on AI, 2018; OECD, 2017,  2018; Tsinghua University, 2018; Working Paper for AI National Strategy: India, 2018; AI National Strategy:  Japan, 2017; McCarthy, 2007).   Domain: Integration and Interaction   Subdomains:  Multi -agent systems; Robotics and Automation; Connected and Automated vehicles  (CAVs)   The transversal domain of Integration and Interaction addresses t he combination of perception, reasoning,  action, learning and interaction with the environme nt, as well as characteristics such as distribution,  coordination, cooperation, autonomy, interaction and integration .. Robotics and Automation refers to activities  related to application and research of the technological intelligent tools to assist or sub stitute human activity,  or to enable actions that are not humanly possible (e.g. medical robots), to optimize technical limitations,  labour or production costs. The CAVs subdomain regards technologies of autonomous vehicles, connected  vehicles and driver a ssistance systems, considering all automation levels and all communication technologies  (V2X). Multi -agent systems, Unmanned systems (CAVs, drones), as well as robotics and process automation  (Application programming interface (API), robotic process automa tion for industrial, social and other uses) are  also mentioned as separate intrinsic subdivisions of AI (HLEG, 2019;  Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial  Intelligence, 2019; UNESCO, 2019; Australia’s Ethic Framework, 2019; National Strategy: Denmark, 2019;  National Strategy: France Monitoring report, 2019; US Congressional Research Service, 2019; CB Insights,  2019;  EC JRC Flagship report on AI, 2018; COM(2018) 237 final; AI National Strategy: Germany, 2018;   Tsinghua University, 2018; Working Paper for AI National Strategy: India, 2018; National Industrial Strategy:  UK, 2018; 2017; National Strategy: France (Villani Mission), 2018 ; Statista 2017; McKinsey, 2017 ; AI National  Strategy: Japan, 2017; AI National Strategy: China, 2017; Stone  et al.: AI100, 2016 ).   Domain: Services   Subdomains: AI Services   The transversal domain of AI services refers to any infrastructure, software and platform (e.g., cognitive  computing, ML frameworks, bots and virtual assistants, etc.) provided as (serverless ) services or applications ,  possibly in the cloud , which are available off the shelf and executed on demand, reducing the manag ement  of  complex infrastructures. In this regard, c loud computing services are  often  presented  when describing the AI  landscape (US NDAA, 2019; Chinese National Strategy, 2017). Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is the basis of  cloud computing, providing access and management of virtual resources such as servers, storage, operating  systems and networking. Subsequently, cloud platfor ms (or Platform as a Service (PaaS)) are service products  of cloud applications, and can be used within Software as a Service (SaaS) architectures, which are cloud  applications and adaptive intelligence software  (HLEG, 2019; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence, 
  14 2019; US Department of Defense, 2018; Tsinghua University, 2018; Working Paper for AI National Strategy:  India, 2018 ; AI National Strategy: China, 2017 ; Statista, 201 7; McKinsey, 2017 ).  Domain: E thics & Philosophy   Subdomains: AI Ethics; Philosophy of AI   Philosophical and ethical issues associated with AI are proliferating and rising citizens’ attention and  governments’ policy interest  as intelligent systems become widespread. The ethics of AI is c onsidered as a  transversal subdomain, as AI advances  and applications  in different areas should ensure compliance with  ethical principles and values, including applicable regulation.  Given the impact on human beings and society ,  establish ing trust in AI is the focus of several frameworks and initiatives by policy bodies and institutions  (HLEG, 2019 ; OECD, 2019; StandICT.eu project, 2019; National Strategy: France Monitoring report, 2019;  Australia’s Ethic Framework Dawson et al., 2019; EC Coordinated Acti on Plan on AI, 2018; European AI  Strategy : EC Communication ; National Strategy: France (Villani Mission), 2018; Artificial Intelligence for  Europe, 2018 ).  2.2.2  AI keywords   In order to fulfil its objective as a monitoring tool, one of the outputs of AI Watch  will be to provide an  overview of the worldwide landscape of AI. This effort will be conducted by applying the Techno -economic  segments (TES) analytical approach developed by the EC JRC to the AI field (Samoili S., Righi R., Cardona M.,  López Cobo M., Váz quez-Prada Baillet M., and De Prato G., 2020) . This methodology is developed to map  technological (and non -technological) domains that do not correspond to standard classifications (e.g.  industries, products), and that are pervasive and cross -sectoral. It is conceived as an analytical framework and  replicable methodology  to analyse and describe the dynamics of specific TES ecosystems, by exploiting  different types of factual data including non -official heterogeneous sources. The initial stages of the TES  analytical approach are presented in Samoili S., Righi R., Lopez -Cobo M., Cardona M., and De Prato G.  (2019),  and a first application to the AI domain is shown in De Prato G., López Cobo., M., Samoili S., Righi R., Vázquez Prada Baillet, M., and Cardona M. (2019) and Samoili et al. (2019). The first step of the TES methodo logy  addresses the  defini tion of  a techno -economic segment, e.g. AI, followed by its operationalisation through a  list of keywords. The keywords are used in text queries to identify activities and economic agents relevant to  the technology under study, AI in this case, for further analysis.   2.2.2.1  Construction process   The domains and subdomains  that are  selected as characterising AI  are represented by a list of keywords .  These, as the AI subdomains,  cover different aspects, such as methods, algorithmic approaches , applications,  products, research areas, etc. , but also  address aspects such as ethics  and philosophy , not as an intrinsic part  of AI, but rather as an application of ethical principles and philosophical concerns to AI. The list of keywords is  built in a multi -step process combining a semi -automatic text mining approach, desk research and domain  experts' involvement:   1. Identification of top keywords in the research domain   (a) Seed articles: First we conduct a selection of a seed subset of scientific articles wh ere the term  "artificial intelligence" is present in the title, keywords or abstract of the publication. This first step is  run on all articles available in the Scopus Database in three  different years ( 2005, 2009 and 2017).  The consideration of the time d imensions allows capturing recently coined terms, as well as others  that are consolidated, or even some that fell into disuse but that were important terms in the past.   (b) Expansion to cover articles not triggered by the technology term: In view of expanding the set of  investigated documents, and not limiting the analysis to the papers containing the keyword "artificial  intelligence", we consider all articles published in the journals in which the articles identified in step  1.(a) are found. In this step, 137 specialised journals are considered, while generalist journals and the  ones centred in other scientific fields are ignored. For instance, the journal “Engineering Applications  of Artificial Intelligence” would be selected, while “Physics of Life Reviews” would not, even if the  latter has published some AI related articles.   (c) First draft list of keywords: We consider all papers published in the journals selected in step 1.(b)  during the three  referred years . The selected AI related articles amount to 25  600: 2 907 published  in 2005, 12  706 in 2009 and 9  987 in 2017.  The number of different keywords included in these 
  15 papers  totals 57  850. The first draft list of keywords is composed by a selection from the 300 most  frequent author's keywords  per year, from whic h generic terms are removed .  2. Identification of keywords in the industrial dimension of the technology   In order to cover terms reflecting the recent industrial developments and AI applications, we also take into  consideration sources of industrial activity.  To that end, we have analysed and extracted relevant terms from  companies’ activities descriptions. Since an equivalent to author's keywords is not available from firms'  descriptions, we obtain the most frequent terms (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams) and manually inspect their  relevancy in order to incorporate them to the draft list built in step 1.   3. Initial keyword  selection   The list of candidate terms, sorted by relevance based on their frequency of occurrence, is then reviewed by  in-house  researchers and a short selection is made. Terms are grouped when synonyms, very similar terms  and different spellings are found, then the groups are reduced to a single term per groups. Terms appearing in  both sub -lists are prioritised.   4. Selection of keywords through  topic modelling   We consider the most representative terms from the six AI subdomains identified from topic modelling on a  corpus of 64 thousand documents of R&D and industrial activity. The subdomains are identified by applying  semantic clustering with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model, a generative hierarchical mixed membership model for discrete data  (Blei & Laerty, 2009; Blei et al., 2003; Papadimitriou et al., 2000) . The  model returns the most probable topics that best represent the corpus , without the involvement of any expert  to avoid unintentional bias. Only the labelling of topics is done manually. The most relevant keywords of each  of the six topics are also considered, and redundancies with terms already included in the list, removed.   5. Validation by a panel of experts in several AI subdomains   An in -house pool of researchers made a selection that was reviewed by external domain experts in several AI  areas . The advice for improvement targeted the expansion of the frontiers considered, nam ely the inclusion of  domains and related terms not so well captured by the research and industrial sources analysed so far.   6. Final review and selection of list of keywords per domain   As a consequence of the review in step 5, areas  such as Knowledge represe ntation and reasoning or AI ethics  and their corresponding related terms were introduced. The final taxonomy was then depicted and the final  keyword list defined. Valuable inputs in this process were: the terms describing the submission groups in top  AI co nferences, the term frequencies observed in AITopics, and the terms produced by the Spanish Working  Group on AI responsible for the drafting of the Spanish strategy.   2.2.2.2  Keyword list   Table 2 presents the keywords identified as most relevant within each AI subdomain comprising the  taxonomy . This list of keywords is designed to map and model AI activities in a broad sense. The keywords are  presented grouped in t he broad categories identified in the taxonomy , which , as explained in detail in  subsection  2.2.1 , are not mutually exclusive. This keyword list is intended to  be dynamically updated according  to new technological developments in core and transversal domains , and to agree with alternative proposals.   The rationale for building the list of keywords is to determine, in a practical way, the boundaries of the  ecosystem of economic agents active in AI. In practical terms, the list of keywords will be used taking into  account additional considerat ions. For instance, in order to avoid as much as possible the occurrence of false  positives, i.e., the incorrect identification as AI of activities that are not AI related, a  reduced list of intrinsic -AI  keywords is used to query the data sources to identi fy the relevant active agents in the TES ecosystem.   Furthermore, some of the remaining keywords are considered only after conditioning its co-occurrence w ith  some of the core AI terms  (these are the non -intrinsic AI keywords) . Examples of intrinsic -AI terms  used as  standalone terms  to identify activities are: deep learning, face recognition, swarm intelligence  and  unsupervised learning. Terms that are only used in combination with intrinsic -AI terms include, for instance:  accountability, classification,  clustering, cognitive system, industrial robot, service robot and  social robot , since  these non -intrinsic terms could be used in a non -AI context .

An agent is something that acts in an environment —it  does something. Agents include worms, dogs, thermostats, airplanes, humans,  organizations, and society. An intelligent agent is a system that acts intelligently:  What it does is appropriate for its circumstances and its goal, it is flexible to changing  environments and changing goals, i t learns from experience, and it makes appropriate  choices given perceptual limitations and finite computation.”     2010, 2017: “Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the field that studies the synthesis and  analysis of computational agents that act intelligent ly.  An agent is something that acts in an environment; it does something. Agents include  worms, dogs, thermostats, airplanes, robots, humans, companies, and countries.”   “We are interested in what an agent does; that is, how it acts. We judge an agent by  its actions…   An agent acts intelligently when:   • what it does is appropriate for its circumstances and its goals, taking into account  the short -term and long -term consequences of its actions   • it is flexible to changing environments and changing goals   • it learns from experience   • it makes appropriate choices given its perceptual and computational limitations”   “A computational agent is an agent whose decisions about its actions can be  explained in terms of computation. That is, the decision can be broken down  into  primitive operations that can be implemented in a physical device. This computation  can take many forms. In humans this computation is carried out in “wetware”; in  computers it is carried out in “hardware.” Although there are some agents that are  arguably not computational, such as the wind and rain eroding a landscape, it is an  open question whether all intelligent agents are computational.   All agents are limited. No agents are omniscient or omnipotent. Agents can only  observe everything about the wo rld in very specialized domains, where “the world” is  very constrained. Agents have finite memory. Agents in the real world do not have  unlimited time to act.”   The central scientific goal of AI “is to understand the principles that make intelligent  behavio r possible in natural or artificial systems. This is done by:   • the analysis of natural and artificial agents   • formulating and testing hypotheses about what it takes to construct intelligent  agents and   • designing, building, and experimenting with computational systems that perform  tasks commonly viewed as requiring intelligence.   As part of science, researchers build empirical systems to test hypotheses or to  explore the space of possible designs. These are quite distinct from applications that  are built to be useful for an application domain.”   “The definition is not for intelligent thought alone. We are only interested in thinking  intelligently insofar as it leads to more intelligent behavior. The role of thought is to  affect action.”   “The central e ngineering goal of AI is the design and synthesis of useful, intelligent  artifacts. We actually want to build agents that act intelligently. Such agents are  useful in many applications.”   Subdomains  -  Context  Book  Date of  publication/  release  2017; 2010;  1998

Text of the  definition  Artificial intelligence is commonly defined by referencing definitions of human  intelligence, as in Minsky’s definition.   In contrast to the standard approach of measuring one kin d of intelligence (as in  standard IQ tests), Gardner (cognitive scientist) offers an eight -dimensional definition  to disentangle the oversimplification of intelligence's measurement.   In particular, he proposed multiple conceptions of intelligence, not only  logical mathematical, linguistic, but also spatial, musical, bodily -kinaesthetic, personal.

Gardner is a cognitive developmental psychologist, among the pioneers trying to  quantify human intelligence in more than one dimension (another is Robert  Sternberg), introducing the notion of multiple intelligences.   Before his study, human intelligence was mono -semantic and was quantified as such  in intelligence quotient (IQ) points.   The multiple intelligences approach is a better fit to the over simplification of one  intelligence, and is used to describe why the definition of AI is not easy. (see J.

  86 4 Conclusions   The absence of a formal  commonly agreed AI definition demanded the development of a process to establish  a reference AI definition, and its subsequent operational isation into  a taxonomy  and representative keywords,  which  can be adopted in the AI Watch  framework  and used in mapping and monitoring activities . The  proposed iterative process includes three perspectives : policy and institutional, research , and market , in order  to acquire a comprehensive  overview about the AI domain . The AI definition adopted by the High Level Expert  Group on AI is used as a  baseline  definition . It is selected based on the review of 5 5 relevant documents   covering AI policy and institutional reports (including standardisation efforts, national strategies, and  international organisations reports), research publications and market reports . An exhaustive list of the  collected documents can be found in the report.  The p roposed operational definition is composed by a concise  taxonomy characterising the core domains of the AI research field and transversal topics; and a list of  keywords representative of such taxonomy. As AI is a dynamic field, we propose an iterative meth od that can  be updated over time to capture the rapid AI evolution.   While the baseline definition will be used as the general AI Watch definition of AI, the operational definition  has a more functional use. Both the taxonomy and the list of keywords are es sential to identify, map and  characterise the worldwide AI landscape, one of the monitoring goals of AI Watch. The keywords are used in  the initial phase to capture the relevant AI activities and the economic agents behind them.  The main utility of  the tax onomy is to classify AI activities, and will assist in the mapping of the AI landscape and the  classification of economic agents’ areas of specialisation. Different uses of the keyword list are possible. A  narrow use of the list, i.e. selecting only intrin sic-AI terms, allows to identify relevant AI activities, with an  expected low  proportion of false positives. When the objective is the categorisation of AI -related activities, a  more comprehensive  list is more suitable , in order to classify activities in t heir corresponding taxonomy  domains.   Valuable contributions of this work are: the collection of definitions developed between 1955 and 2019; the  summarisation of the main features of the concept of artificial intelligence as reflected in the relevant  literature; and the development of a replicable process that can provide a dynamic definition and taxonomy of  the AI.
