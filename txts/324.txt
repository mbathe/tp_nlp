FRA Focus 1#BigData: Discrimination   in data-supported decision  makingHELPING TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS  A REALITY  FOR EVERYONE  IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FRA Focus ContentsWe live in a world of big data, where technological developments in the area of  machine learning and artificial intelligence have changed the way we live. Decisions  and processes concerning everyday life are increasingly automated, based on  data. This affects fundamental rights in various ways. The intersection of rights  and technological developments warrants closer examination, prompting the  Fundamental Rights Agency to research this theme. This focus paper specifically deals with discrimination, a fundamental rights area  particularly affected by technological developments. When algorithms are used for  decision making, there is potential for discrimination against individuals. The principle  of non-discrimination, as enshrined in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights  of the European Union (EU), needs to be taken into account when applying algorithms  to everyday life. This paper explains how such discrimination can occur, suggesting  possible solutions. The overall aim is to contribute to our understanding of the  challenges encountered in this increasingly important field. 1.

#BigData: Discrimination in data-supported decision making 21.  Big data and fundamental rights  implications In the past decades, technological advancements  have changed the way we live and organise our  lives. These changes are inherently connected with  the proliferation and use of big data. Big data generally refers to technological devel­ opments related to data collection, storage, analy­ sis and applications. It is often characterised by   the increased volume, velocity and variety of data  being produced (“the three Vs”), and typically refers  (but is not limited) to data from the internet.1 Big  data comes from a variety of sources, including  social media data or website metadata. The Inter ­ net of Things (IoT) contributes to big data, includ­ing behavioural location data from smartphones or fitness tracking devices. In addition, transaction data from the business world form a part of big  data, such as providing information on payments  and administrative data.2 The increased availability  of data has led to improved technologies for ana ­ lysing and using data – for example, in the area  of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI). Arguably, big data can enhance our lives – for  instance, in the health sector, where personalised diagnosis and medicine can lead to better care. 3  However, the negative fundamental rights impli ­ cations of big data ­related technologies have only  recently been acknowledged by public authorities and international organisations. 4 The use of new  technologies and algorithms, including machine  learning and AI, affects several fundamental rights.  These include, but are not limited to: the right to a  fair trial, prohibition of discrimination, privacy, free ­ dom of expression, and the right to an effective rem ­ edy, as outlined by the Council of Europe in their 2017 report. 5 In addition, the European Parliament  adopted a 2017 resolution highlighting the need for  action in the area of big data and fundamental rights  implications.6 In this resolution, the European Par­ liament uses the strongest language when refer ­ ring to the threat of discrimination through the use  of algorithms. This serves to underpin the particu ­ lar focus of this paper. 1 Additionally, terms such as increased “variability” with respect  to consistency of data over time, “veracity” with respect to  accuracy and data quality, and “complexity” in terms of how to link multiple datasets can be added to the list of characteristics of big data (Callegaro, M. and Yang, Y. (2017)). 2 Callegaro, M. and Yang, Y. (2017). 3 Seitz, C.

This includes FRA’s reporting on the oversight of surveillance by national intel­ ligence authorities, as requested by the European  Parliament. In addition, FRA has published reports  on the use of biometric and related data in the EU’s  large ­scale IT databases. Starting with the present  paper, FRA explores the implications of big data and AI regarding fundamental rights, focusing in the first instance on discrimination as a key area  of EU legal competence, and also an area where  FRA has undertaken extensive research to date. European Parliament resolutions on  big data and artificial intelligence To use big data for commercial purposes and in  the public sector, the European Parliament “calls  on the European Commission, the Member States  and the data protection authorities to identify and  take any possible measures to minimise algorith ­ mic discrimination and bias and to develop a strong  and common ethical framework for the transpar ­ ent processing of personal data and automated  decision ­making that may guide data usage and  the ongoing enforcement of Union law”. When it comes to the use of big data for law enforce ­ ment purposes, the Parliament “warns that […] maxi ­ mum caution is required in order to prevent unlawful  discrimination and the targeting of certain individ ­ uals or groups of people defined by reference to  race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features,  language, gender expression or identity, sexual ori ­ entation, residence status, health or membership  of a national minority which is often the subject of ethnic profiling or more intense law enforcement  policing, as well as individuals who happen to be  defined by particular characteristics”.* Moreover, the European Parliament has high ­ lighted the need for ethical principles concern ­ ing the development of robotics and artificial intel ­ ligence for civil use. It points out that a guiding  ethical framework should be “based on […] the principles and values enshrined in Article  2 of  the Treaty on European Union and in the Charter  of Fundamental Rights, such as human dignity,  equality, justice and equity, non ­discrimination,  informed consent, private and family life and data  protection”, among other principles.** * European Parliament (2017a). ** European Parliament (2017b).
FRA Focus 3Focus on discrimination Direct or indirect discrimination through the use of  algorithms using big data is increasingly considered  as one of the most pressing challenges of the use  of new technologies. This paper addresses selected  fundamental rights implications related to big data,  focusing on the threat of discrimination when using  big data to support decision making. Previously, decisions and processes were under­ taken with little support by computers. Nowadays,  there is an increase in the use of sophisticated tech ­ niques of (statistical) data analysis to facilitate these  tasks. However, this can lead to discrimination. For  example, this may include the automated selection  of candidates for job interviews based on predicted  productivity. Another example is the use of risk  scores in assessing the credit worthiness of individu ­ als applying for loans. Furthermore, in the course of  a trial, the use of risk scores in the decision ­making  process on sentencing can lead to discrimination. The principle of non ­d iscrimination is embedded in  EU law. Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamen ­ tal Rights prohibits discrimination based on sev ­ eral grounds, including: sex, race, colour, ethnic or  social origin, genetic features, language, religion or  belief, political or any other opinion, membership  of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age, sexual orientation, and nationality. Informa­ tion about or related to these attributes, once pro ­ cessed as data, is connected to the individual. By definition, this makes them personal data that are protected under the data protection legal frame ­ work. This is particularly important, due to the grow ­ ing availability and processing of large amounts of  data that also include information (potentially) indi ­ cating one or more of these characteristics relat­ing to individuals. At EU level, the General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR)7 addresses some of these new technologi ­ cal developments, including the potential for dis ­ crimination. The fundamental rights implications of  using algorithms in decision making include consid ­ erations addressed in the GDPR, but also go beyond. The issues raised here highlight the potentially prob ­ lematic nature of the use of data for decision mak ­ ing. However, the use of data to inform decisions is  also considered a positive development, as it poten ­ tially allows for more objective and informed deci ­ sions, in comparison to decisions that do not take  into account available data. It also has the potential  to limit discriminatory treatment based on human decision making that is derived from existing prej­udices. While the limits of data and data analysis  need to be taken into account, decisions supported  by data are potentially better decisions than those  without any empirical support. Algorithms can, in  turn, be used to identify systematic bias and poten ­ tially discriminatory processes. Therefore, big data  also presents opportunities for assessing funda­mental rights compliance. 2.  Data-supported decision making:  predictions, algorithms and  machine learning With the increased availability and use of data, deci ­ sions are increasingly being facilitated or some ­ times even completely taken over by using so ­ called predictive modelling methods – often referred  to as the use of algorithms. Using data to predict  incidents or behaviour is a major part of develop ­ ments related to machine learning and AI. A classic   example of using algorithms based on data analy­ sis, a tool most people experience every day, is the  spam filter. The algorithm has ‘learned’ – with some  level of certainty – to identify whether an email is spam and to block it. A basic understanding of how algorithms support  decisions is essential, to allow experts and prac ­ titioners from other fields to enter the discussion and to increase awareness and technical literacy. Furthermore, it is important to be able to identify and ask the right questions about potential prob ­ lems that arise when using algorithms, particularly  when it comes to discrimination. Creating algorithms to make predictions may involve  different methods, all of which use so ­called ‘train ­ ing data’ to find out which calculations predict a cer ­ tain outcome most accurately. For example, a set  of several thousands of emails, identified as either  ‘spam’ or ‘not spam’, is used to identify charac ­ teristics that define differences between the two  7 General Data Protection Regulation.
#BigData: Discrimination in data-supported decision making 4groups of emails. In this example, characteristics  may include specific words and combinations of words within emails. Through this process, rules  for identifying spam are established. Many differ ­ ent calculations (i.e. algorithms) can be used and  the best performing one is selected, i.e. the cal ­ culation that can categorise most cases correctly. It is critically important to note that the output of  algorithms is always based on probability, which  means that there is uncertainty attached to the clas ­ sifications made. As we can see in our daily lives, the methods can work quite well, but they are not infallible. Sometimes spam passes through to our  email inbox, so ­called ‘false negatives’ (i.e. errone ­ ously, it is not identified as spam). Less frequently,  a fully legitimate email might be suppressed by the  filter, a so ­called ‘false positive’. The rate of true  positives, the rate of true negatives and the trade ­ off between these two rates are commonly used to assess a classification problem, such as detect ­ ing spam. There are several rates and indicators  available that can be analysed for the assessment  of how well an algorithm works. 3.  Computers “learning to discriminate” Using data and algorithms for prediction can con ­ siderably facilitate decisions, as it allows for the revelation of patterns that cannot be otherwise  identified. However, an algorithm can contribute  to discriminatory decision making. As specified under EU legislation, discrimination is  illegal with respect to several conditions related to employment, access to social services and education. It is also forbidden when it is ‘indirect’:  “where an apparently neutral provision, criterion or practice would put persons of a racial or eth ­ nic origin at a particular disadvantage compared  with other persons, unless that provision, crite­ rion or practice is objectively justified by a legit ­ imate aim and the means of achieving that aim are appropriate”. 8 Similarly, Article 11 (3) of the  Police Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/680) explicitly  prohibits any ‘profiling’ that results in discrimina­ tion on the basis of special categories of personal  data, such as race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation,  8 Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 19 July 2000 implementing the  principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of  racial or ethnic origin, OJ L 180/22. See also FRA (2010); FRA (2011).What is an algorithm? The term ‘algorithm’ is widely used in the context of big data, machine learning and AI. An algorithm is  a sequence of commands for a computer to transform an input into an output. For example, a list of per ­ sons is to be sorted according to their age. The computer takes the ages of people on the list (input) and  produces the new ranking of the list (output). In the area of machine learning, several algorithms are used, which could also be referred to as ways  of calculating desired predictions with the use of data. Many of these algorithms are statistical methods  and most of them are based on so ­called ‘regression methods’. These are the most widely used statisti ­ cal techniques for calculating the influence of a set of data on a selected outcome. For example, consider calculating the average influence of drinking alcohol on life expectancy. Using existing data, the aver ­ age amount of alcohol a person drinks is compared to their life expectancy. Based on these calculations, life expectancy can be calculated and predicted for other persons simply by taking into consideration the  amount of alcohol a person drinks, assuming a correlation exists. The algorithm used depends on the way  the data are presented (e.g. whether it is numerical or textual data) and the goal of the calculation (e.g. prediction, explanation, grouping of cases). In machine learning, often several algorithms are tested to see which one has the best performance in predicting the outcome. The creation of algorithms for prediction is a complex process that involves many decisions made by sev ­ eral people who are variously involved in the process. Therefore, it does not only refer to rules followed by  a computer, but also to the process of collecting, preparing and analysing data. This is a human process that  includes several stages, involving decisions by developers and managers. The statistical method is only part  of the process for developing the final rules used for prediction, classification or decisions. According to the Racial Equality Directive (2000/43/EU), dis ­ crimination occurs “where one person is treated less favour ­ ably than another is, has been or would be treated in a  comparable situation on grounds of racial or ethnic origin”.
FRA Focus 5political opinion, or religious beliefs.9 Whereas the  term ‘discrimination’ was absent from the previous  Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), the need to  prevent discrimination as a result of automated  decision making is emphasised in the new GDPR.  Automated decision making, including profiling,  with significant effects on the data subject is for ­ bidden, according to Article 22 of the GDPR, sub­ ject to specific exceptions. “In order to ensure fair and transparent processing in  respect of the data subject, (…) the controller should use  appropriate mathematical or statistical procedures for the profiling, implement technical and organisational measures  appropriate to ensure, in particular, that factors which result  in inaccuracies in personal data are corrected and the risk of errors is minimised, secure personal data in a manner that takes account of the potential risks involved for the  interests and rights of the data subject and that prevents,  inter alia, discriminatory effects on natural persons (…).” General Data Protection Regulation, Recital 71 Academics and practitioners are increasingly  researching ways to detect and repair algorithms  that can potentially discriminate against individuals  or certain groups on the basis of particular attrib ­ utes – for example, sex or ethnic origin.10 This hap­ pens when the predicted outcome for a particular  group is systematically different from other groups  and therefore one group is consistently treated dif ­ ferently to others. For example, in cases where a member of an ethnic minority has a lower chance  of being invited to a job interview because the algo ­ rithm was ‘trained’, based on data where their par ­ ticular group performs worse, i.e. has worse out ­ comes than other groups. As a result, they may not be invited to a job interview. This can occur  when the data used to train the algorithm include  information regarding protected characteristics (e.g.  gender, ethnicity, religion). Furthermore, so ­called  ‘proxy information’ is sometimes included in the  data. This may include the height of a person, which  correlates with gender, or a postcode, which can  indirectly indicate ethnic origin in cases of segre ­ gated areas in cities, or more directly, a person’s  country of birth. Unequal outcomes and differen ­ tial treatment, especially relating to proxy informa ­ tion, need to be assessed to see if they amount to  discrimination. 9 Directive (EU) 2016/680 on the protection of natural persons  with regard to the processing of personal data by competent  authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA. 10  There is increasing literature on discrimination by algorithms.  See, for example, Zliobaite I., Clusters B. (2016); Kamiran, F., Žliobaitė, I. and Calders, T. (2013); Sandvig C. et al. (2014).Moreover, discrimination might not only be based  on differences in the outcomes for groups, but the choice of data to be used might not be neutral. If  the data used for building an algorithm are biased  against a group (i.e. systematic differences due to  the way the data are collected), the algorithm will  replicate the human bias in selecting them and learn  to discriminate against this group. This is particularly  dangerous if it is assumed that the machine ­learn ­ ing procedure and its results are objective, without  taking into account the potential problems in the  underlying data. Data can be biased for several rea ­ sons, including the subjective choices made when  selecting, collecting and preparing data. To give  a real ­life example: an automated description of  images was trained, based on thousands of images  that were described by humans. However, humans  do not neutrally describe images. Namely, a baby  with white skin colour was described as a ‘baby’, but  a baby with a black skin colour was described as a  ‘black baby’. This is biased data because it assigned  additional attributes only to a certain group, while objectively either both cases should be described  including the colour or none of them. If such biased  information is included in training data that is used  for the development of algorithms, it will be used for  resultant predictions and is therefore not neutral.11 In addition to the problematic use of data in rein ­ forcing bias against groups, low quality data as such  can lead to poor predictions and discrimination. Data  can be either poorly selected data or incomplete,  incorrect or outdated.12 Poorly selected data might  include ‘unrepresentative data’, which do not allow  generalising about other groups. For example, if an  algorithm was created using data on a certain group  of job applicants, then the predictions for another  group might not hold true.13 The quality of data and  potential bias is particularly important in the age of  big data as data is generated, often quickly, over the internet without any quality control. In statis­ tics, this is often referred to as ‘garbage in, garbage  out’: even the most well ­developed methods for  predictions cannot function effectively using low  quality data.14 In this sense, data quality checks and  the appropriate documentation of data and meta ­ data is essential for high quality data analysis and the use of algorithms for decision making. 11 Miltenburg E. (2016). 12 The White House (2016). 13 For example, it was found that speech recognition did not  work as well for women as for men. This difference might  come from the algorithms being trained using datasets which include more men than women. See an article on this issue.  14  For example, in a number of the EU’s large-scale IT databases  that are used in the field of border management and asylum, incorrect or poor quality data has been highlighted as an area that needs to be addressed; see FRA’s report on data interoperability: FRA (2017c) and FRA’s report on biometrics, EU IT-systems and fundamental rights: FRA (2018).
#BigData: Discrimination in data-supported decision making 64. Detecting and avoiding discrimination Auditing algorithms Detecting discrimination in algorithms is not an easy  task – just as detecting forms of discrimination in  general can be difficult. Algorithms used in modern applications of machine learning and artificial intel ­ ligence are increasingly complex. As a consequence,  results are difficult or almost impossible to interpret,  in terms of which information in the data influences  predictions and in which way. This is related to the fact that huge amounts of data can be used to pre ­ dict certain outcomes. For example, frequently ­used  algorithms are based on so ­called ‘Neural Networks’,  which work with hidden layers of relationships and  combinations of all different characteristics in the  data. This makes it difficult to assess whether or not  a person is being discriminated against on grounds  of their gender, ethnic origin, religious belief or other  grounds. However, if a predictive algorithm is fed with  information on different groups and it finds a differ ­ ence according to this information, it may potentially  provide an output that discriminates. Despite the complexity, algorithms need to be  ‘audited’ to show that they are lawful. In other words,  they must be shown to not process data in such a  way that leads to discrimination. In this context, the  term ‘auditing’ comes from ‘discrimination testing’ (or  ‘situation testing’) in real ­life situations. For example,  in an experiment, two identical, fictional job appli ­ cations are sent to employers and only the group  membership of interest (e.g. ethnic origin) varies.  Often simply the name of the applicant is changed  by using names typically indicating ethnic origin.15  In this way an experimental situation is created and  differences in call ­back rates for a job interview can  be directly interpreted as discrimination. Similar approaches can also be used for detecting  discrimination in the use of algorithms. For example,  recent advances in research on algorithmic discrimi ­ nation have suggested different ways to detect dis ­ crimination on internet platforms. Algorithms can be  audited by obtaining full access to the computer soft­ ware and code used for the algorithms, which could  then be evaluated by a technical expert. However,  this might not always be straightforward because  the discrimination is not directly encoded in the syn ­ tax of the computer software. Other methods could  include the creation of profiles on platforms which are randomised as ‘testers’ and sent repeatedly to  see if the outcome differs according to characteristics  15 See, for example, Bertrand M. and Mullainathan S. (2003).that could influence discrimination. However, if such  tests are undertaken on real data platforms, this could  lead to legal problems if the service in question is  harmed – for example, through overloading the server  with requests. Hence such tests have to be created in a way to avoid such problems. 16 One example of  such a test was used to detect how well gender clas ­ sification algorithms work for different groups by using preselected images. The results of the study showed that gender recognition works considera ­ bly less well for darker skinned females, compared to white males. 17 Additionally, there are methods to extract informa ­ tion about which data contribute most to the out ­ come of the algorithm. This way it can be checked if information on protected grounds, e.g. ethnic ori ­ gin, is important for the predictions.18 Information on  certain characteristics needs to be extracted from the algorithm to understand differences in the out ­ comes and results of the algorithm. If, for example,  a difference in income explains why a person is not  offered a loan, this might be reasonable.19 However,  if group membership makes a difference for a deci ­ sion, e.g. on a loan, it might be discrimination. The easiest way to detect discrimination is when  full transparency is granted, in the sense that the  code and the data used for building the algorithm are accessible to an auditor. However, even in this case it is not always straightforward. Some results  might appear discriminatory but a closer look shows  that they are not.20 For example, a group may appear  to be treated differently on an aggregate level, but breaking up the results into explainable differences shows that no discrimination exists. 21 To avoid violating fundamental rights, it is crucial  that the automated tools used for making decisions  on people’s lives are transparent. However, the data  16 Sandvig C. et al. (2014). 17 Buolamwini and Gebru (2018). 18 See, for example, a blog on the issue.  19 Wachter, S., Mittelstadt, B. and Russel C. (2017). 20 Kamiran, F., Žliobaitė, I. and Calders, T. (2013). 21 This is related to one of the most well-known cases related to  admissions to studies at the University of California Berkeley,  where it was shown that, overall, women were much less likely to be admitted than men. However, when splitting up the admission rates by type of studies, it was shown that, for each of the different types of studies, women actually had a slightly higher chance of being admitted for all studies. This is a completely counter-intuitive result, which can occur under certain circumstances, related to the different magnitude of applications per type of studies and differing admission rates. Bickel, P. J. et al. (1975). One explanation is that women tended to apply for more competitive studies as compared to men. 
FRA Focus 7used for creating the algorithm are often not available  to people outside the company or institution creating  the algorithm, due to issues such as copyright and  competition between businesses. So only the ‘own ­ ers’ of the data can easily make such tests.22 In this  case, either methods to detect discrimination without  having access to the dataset need to be developed  and allowed (e.g. discrimination testing),23 or ways  of auditing algorithms – through a process that pro ­ tects business secrets – need to be put in place; for  example, through external expert auditors, who can  access the data and code, similar to financial auditor  checks. In this regard, consideration could be given  to establishing public bodies that have the right and  power to investigate the use of predictive systems,  which are used to make decisions that affect peo ­ ple’s lives.24 One example of a study on bias in algorithms was  carried out by journalists who investigated if there  is racial bias in the risk scores used in the US crimi ­ nal justice system. They analysed the Correctional  Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanc ­ tions (COMPAS) scores, including risk scores for recid ­ ivism.25 To evaluate how well the risk scores work,  22 This is often for very legitimate reasons – for example, for  law enforcement purposes, where the data and algorithms  often cannot be publicly available. Moreover, the user of the algorithms might not own the data they use and consequently not be able to share the data (e.g. applications from third parties using Twitter data). 23  Sandvig C. et al. (2014). 24 Tutt A. (2016).  25 The study including accompanying documentation is available  on the Propublica webpage. The report is cited as: Angwin J. et al. (2016).the journalists obtained a dataset of criminal histo ­ ries for a period of two years from Broward County  in Florida and analysed the actual recidivism in com ­ parison to the risk score. Based on the analysis, it  was reported that white defendants were more often  mislabelled as ‘low risk’ compared to black defend ­ ants, and the risk score was more likely to falsely  flag black defendants as ‘high risk’. This potentially  indicated racially ­biased algorithms. However, the  company and other researchers contested the result,  by pointing to alternative analyses showing that the  model does not make any difference when looking at risk scores for each group separately. 26 This dis­ cussion demonstrates that it is complex to prove that  an algorithm discriminates. Interpretation of results  takes place at a comparatively advanced level of sta ­ tistical analysis, but findings are not fully conclusive,  due to an absence of standards for evaluation, and the challenge to create ‘fair’ algorithms in the pres ­ ence of different outcomes and their interpretation.  The situation is further complicated by the absence of case law in this field. This last point relates to the problem that it is not fully  clear when differential treatment between groups  26 Flores A. et al. (2016).Application of the legal principle of the right to “meaningful information” Full transparency on processing might not be pos ­ sible due to a number of legitimate reasons. For example, these issues may include intellectual  property rights or issues of national security. How ­ ever, controllers have to make sure that an auto ­ mated decision ­making process is explained clearly  and simply to individuals, in particular when involv ­ ing decision ­making processes based on profiling. This materialises in the GDPR through the intro ­ duction of a right to explanation, which states that  data subjects should be provided with “meaningful  information about the logic involved, as well as the  significance and the envisaged consequences of  such processing for the data subject”.* The Euro ­ pean Parliament has clarified its understanding of  the concept, by stating that this should include “information about the data used for training algo­ rithms and allow individuals to understand and monitor the decisions affecting them”.** However, the concrete implementation of this right  remains to be seen and is related mainly to auto ­ mated decision making. As emphasised by sev ­ eral researchers,*** the delimitation of the scope  and feasibility of the explanation to be provided  is not evident. Notably, the wording “meaningful  information” raises several questions: to whom and when should information be deemed mean ­ ingful? Should the information cover the ration ­ ale behind the technique or the technique itself?  This point would benefit from further clarification  – for example, by the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) established by the GDPR. * General Data Protection Regulation, Recital 71, Art. 13 (2) (f) and Art. 15 (1) (h). ** European Parliament (2017a). *** See Wachter, S., Mittelstadt, B., Floridi, L.

#BigData: Discrimination in data-supported decision making 8actually constitutes discrimination. In the United States,  there was a case on hiring practices, which were ruled  as unlawful even if the decision was not explicitly deter ­ mined based on race. The barriers for accessing a job  with a test that was not directly related to the job  requirements disproportionately put black applicants  at a disadvantage.27 In this case, a certain level of dif ­ ferential treatment was reached that was deemed to  constitute discrimination. At the same time, the United  States Supreme Court acknowledged that there can ­ not be a general rule on the level at which differen ­ tial treatment is seen as discriminatory. Instead, each situation and application needs to be assessed sepa­ rately. 28 A detailed analysis of the way a group is dis ­ criminated against should be conducted, taking propor ­ tionality into account with respect to the impact that certain criteria have on different groups. For example,  a specific job requirement – such as having completed  training in a particular country – may not be a genuine  or occupational requirement for carrying out the job. If such a requirement puts certain groups at a disad ­ vantage (e.g. immigrants), a potential algorithm that  sorts job applications should not use such information for determining eligibility for a job. Data protection impact  assessment (DPIA) Algorithms may be so complex that the character ­ istics that will influence the outcome might not be  easily identifiable. Article 35 of the GDPR has made  data protection impact assessment  (DPIA) man­ datory for all “processing, in particular using new  technologies, [which] is likely to result in a high  risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons”.  DPIAs are complex procedures that may require a combination of technical, legal and sociological  knowledge. Institutional* and academic** actors  have developed standards and guidance to help  data scientists in the development and implemen ­ tation of these and standards are being developed  by industry associations.*** In this context, guid ­ ance on the minimum requirements to be inserted  in any DPIA, and established at regional level, would  likely enhance the effectivity of DPIAs. Using DPIAs  could be a way for controllers to increase their  accountability and make sure from the outset that  their applications are not discriminatory. * See, for instance, the Template for Smart Grid and  Smart Metering Systems, developed by the European  Commission, or the Guidance on Privacy by design and  DPIA, developed by the Information Commissioner’s office. ** See, for instance, the detailed roadmap developed by S.  Spiekermann (2016). *** As referred to in the Council of Europe study on human  rights dimensions of automated data processing techniques (Council of Europe 2017b). 27 U.S. Supreme Court, Griggs v.

There are several ways to assess whether or not  a group is treated differently by an algorithm.29 In  the presence of different outcomes for different  groups (e.g. one group is more likely to be eligible  for a job), there are inherent trade ­offs in creating  fair predictions on all accounts. It can be mathe ­ matically proven that it is not possible to have the  same overall risk scores for different groups and a  balanced prediction model, unless groups are not  performing differently on a certain outcome. For  example, women may fare worse on a scale used  for hiring people (e.g. using income ­related infor ­ mation as a proxy for past performance at work).  As algorithms should not discriminate against a  particular group, there needs to be an assessment  of the implications of using different performance  measurements (or their proxies). However, pre ­ cisely balanced predictions for both genders would  not be possible. This limits the ability to make fair  predictions for groups who, in reality, fare differ­ ently on a certain outcome.30 In addition, situations of potential bias or discrim ­ ination cannot be easily solved by simply exclud ­ ing information on the protected group from the  dataset (e.g. just exclude information on gender or  ethnic origin). There could be additional informa ­ tion that may be related to membership of a pro ­ tected group. For example, a given post code could  indicate ethnic origin (as mentioned above). There  are ways to address and detect indirect informa ­ tion on protected attributes (which can result in indirect discrimination) that can be used to repair  algorithms. For example, testing whether pro ­ tected characteristics of individuals can be pre ­ dicted well from other information included in  the dataset. 31 However, research on the topic has  only just begun and needs to progress further to develop standardised methods for detecting and  29 For example, the overall accuracy (e.g. one group is more likely  to be hired, when controlling for other explanatory factors),  the true positive rate (the algorithm more often selects people from one group among those who should be selected), and the true negative rate (e.g. the algorithm more often rejects people from one group among those to be rejected) are different ways to assess fairness. For a discussion of measuring bias and different fairness criteria, see Chouldechova (2017). 30  Kleinberg J. et al. (2017a).

FRA Focus 9removing discrimination. One fundamental chal ­ lenge to data ­supported analysis is the question  of whether information on the protected group is  available in the data used to create the predictions. Data protection by design and  by default The mere exclusion of information on protected  groups will not be sufficient to avoid discrimina ­ tion. Non ­discriminatory data processing may be  further strengthened through the implementa ­ tion of “appropriate technical and organisational  measures which are designed (…) to integrate  the necessary safeguards into the processing in  order to (…) protect the rights of data subjects”.* As pointed out by the EDPS and some data pro ­ tection authorities,** ensuring that data protec ­ tion is embedded in the early conception phase of  any algorithm has several positive consequences:  it minimises the risks of potential discrimina­ tory results, and increases trust between the  data subject and the data controller. This has led  programmers to focus on and develop Privacy  Enhancing Technologies (PETs).*** Similar meth ­ ods could be conceptualised and integrated in  the development of data ­induced decision mak ­ ing to ensure this is non ­discriminatory. In this  sense, a ‘by design’ approach would work in con ­ junction with a risk assessment that also takes potential discrimination into account. At the same time, further consideration could be  given as to whether ‘data protection by design and by default’ also leads to a situation where  information that could be used to detect poten ­ tial discriminatory practices is being withheld for data analysis to protecting the data subject.  Clarification is needed on how data on sensitive  personal characteristics can be employed. For example, such data may be used as aggregate data for statistical purposes, to identify poten ­ tial discrimination in practices such as selection of persons for interviewing. * General Data Protection Regulation, Art. 25. ** EDPS (2010), pp. 4-6; ICO, Guide on Data Protection –  Privacy by design. *** ENISA, Privacy Enhancing Technologies: Evolution and State  of the Art, 9 March 2017.(Un-)Availability of  information on protected characteristics Most methods developed so far to identify poten ­ tial discrimination make use of information on the  protected group (e.g. information on ethnic origin)  in the dataset. Availability of information on pro ­ tected groups differs considerably across countries  and data collection approaches. For example, infor ­ mation on ‘race’ or ethnicity is frequently collected  in the United States and in the United Kingdom.  However, in many EU Member States, there was a move away from data collection on ethnicity, and  in some countries, data collection of information  on ethnic origin is forbidden. This was introduced in some countries due to the abuse of administra ­ tive data that included ethnic origin and/or religion  before and during the Second World War.32 This  means that, when collecting data on ethnic origin (or any other protected attribute), data protection  becomes particularly important. This includes the  explicit consent of the data subject as well as con ­ sideration of the data collection being in the pub ­ lic interest, or some explicit legal obligation to col ­ lect the data. As a general rule, the GDPR has established that  the processing of sensitive data should be prohib ­ ited, and has listed the ten exceptional cases when  processing of such data may be allowed. These include, but are not limited to, the obtention of the data subject’s explicit consent, the protection  of their vital interests, or the protection of public  interest in the area of public health. 33 In contrast to a number of EU Member States, in the  United Kingdom there was a movement in favour of collecting data on ethnicity. This started before the 1990s, for the very purpose of being able to  detect discrimination. There are strong arguments  for the use of ethnic identifiers in data collection in order to be able to detect discriminatory treat ­ ment and outcomes. 34 In fact, including this infor ­ mation is not only needed to detect discrimination in algorithms, it is also needed to correct the algo­ rithm.35 The discussion in this area is also related to  the interplay between the right to privacy and the right to fair processing of personal data. 36 Future research should assess the extent to which proxies (i.e. other information highly correlated with protected characteristics, such as citizenship  32 Simon, Patrick (2007). 33 General Data Protection Regulation, Art. 9. 34 Chopin I, Farkas L. and Germaine C.

#BigData: Discrimination in data-supported decision making 10for ethnic origin or height for gender) can be used  instead of more direct information on protected characteristics. This discussion extends to other  grounds as well. There is an increased amount of  information in datasets, including potentially thou ­ sands of different characteristics being collected.  With this in mind, there should be further assess ­ ment of the types of characteristics being profiled  by algorithms for the purpose of prediction. Consid ­ ering the list of protected characteristics in Article 21  of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a lot of infor ­ mation can easily relate to any of these grounds.  For example, this protection could apply to political  opinions on Facebook or Twitter posts. It is impor ­ tant to note that the use of algorithms and profil ­ ing – for example, when using social media data –  can easily predict or relate to special categories, as  forbidden under Article 9 in the GDPR. For example,  combining ‘likes’ on social media with other data  can be used – quite accurately – to determine a per ­ son’s sexual orientation, ethnic origin or religion.37 Feedback loops and more  efficient decision making Algorithms used for daily decision making shape  people’s lives. If they are applied for a longer period  of time, they can replicate decision making, because  the decisions based on algorithms shape the future  data for the algorithm to learn from. In other words,  decisions are based on data that exists in a feedback loop. This might not be problematic if the algorithm  is fair and balanced. However, if such models are  based on biased data or algorithms, discrimination  will be replicated, perpetuated and potentially even  reinforced. Discriminatory predictions create the  (allegedly neutral) basis for future data and there ­ fore the basis for further development of the algo ­ rithms used in the future. It could even lead to con ­ tinuously increasing discrimination due to ‘more  efficient’ decisions being taken on the basis of data,  which puts certain groups at a disadvantage and  consequently makes it more difficult for members of disadvantaged groups to obtain fairer opportu ­ nities.38 This is exacerbated when automated deci ­ sions are created with algorithms. For example, statistical learning procedures for more  efficient law enforcement, which adapt policing (or surveillance) practices based on historical and  assumed ‘neutral’ data, can lead to unequal out ­ comes even if the underlying levels of criminality  are the same among certain sub ­populations. This  can have the negative effect of criminalising spe ­ cific sub ­populations.39 The problem of using algo ­ rithms is that future assessments are only based  on results of the algorithms – for example, “hiring  algorithms only receive feedback on people who  were hired and predictive policing algorithms only  observe crime in neighbourhoods they patrol”.40 This  means that feedback loops of algorithms need to be  assessed in detail, to identify whether it is neces ­ sary to ‘repair’ the algorithms to avoid discrimination  and, ultimately, to produce more accurate results. 5. Possible ways forward: addressing  fundamental rights and big data The use of data and research for evidence ­based  policies and decision making has gained popularity  in the past decades. This is a trend that also needs to embrace the use of big data and new technolo­gies. Current developments in the area of big data  call for action at several levels of society, given  the impact of the use of big data across multiple spheres. This focus paper has highlighted poten ­ tial threats to fundamental rights – focusing on dis ­ crimination – when building algorithms based on big  data to support decisions. The use of data and more  advanced methods for prediction can improve the way we make decisions, as long as the basis for  those decisions is fully understood and does not neg ­ atively affect fundamental rights. The efficiency of  37 See the examples and explanation given in Article 29 Data  Protection Working Party (2017).algorithms also needs to be assessed against basic  fundamental values, such as equal treatment and  non­discrimination.41 Since decision making based on predictive models and other related methods is relatively new, the  need for further safeguards in this area needs to be  considered. In comparison, the production and sell ­ ing of food or drugs is highly regulated, due to the dangers related to unregulated use 42 (acknowledg­ ing the different reasons and needs for regulation in  38 The White House (2016); O’Neil C. (2016). 39 Osoba, Osonde and Welser IV William (2017).  40 Ensign D. et al. (2018) 41 See for example the discussion in Kleinberg J. et al.

FRA Focus 11these two areas). However, the use of algorithms in  making decisions and building automated processes  may have a significant impact on people’s lives. This makes it important to consider the need to  review the impact of existing legislation and oversight  mechanisms – where these are in place. This would  help prevent any possible negative consequences for  people resulting from the use of algorithms. Poten ­ tially, lessons could be learned from existing fields  that are highly regulated, such as medicine. Consideration could be given to how the oversight  of algorithms, which are used for different purposes,  might be undertaken in practice. This is reflected  in FRA’s opinions related to oversight in the area of surveillance, which are attached to the agency’s  2017 report on this subject. Effective oversight would  require detailed assessment by experts, which would  need to be provided for by law in each EU Mem ­ ber State.43 Independent oversight by experts in dif ­ ferent subject fields – including technical fields – is  crucial for safeguarding the legality of data ­based  applications. One way of potentially ensuring effec ­ tive accountability is by setting up dedicated bod ­ ies with an exclusive mandate to provide oversight  of big data ­related technologies, similar to the role  of Data Protection Authorities (DPAs). Developing guidance for the use of algorithms calls for strong collaboration between statisticians, lawyers, social  scientists, computer scientists, mathematicians and  subject area experts, to obtain further clarity on the  presence of discrimination and other fundamental rights breaches. In sum, this is a field that warrants further careful analysis. The GDPR does include safeguards to address non ­ discriminatory automated decision making before, during, and after processing data. Data science  experts agree that big data ­related technologies  are currently not being held accountable, and that the need for oversight is urgent and real. 44 Trans­ parency is a key element to achieve effective reme ­ dies, and this is all the more so when complex algo ­ rithmic decision making and/or large datasets are part of the elements legal practitioners will have to review. 45 Here again, the GDPR has increased the  powers of the data protection authorities in the Euro ­ pean Union, making them competent to hear com ­ plaints, conduct investigations, and promote aware ­ ness. However, in practical terms, further progress is required to ensure that the use of algorithms is in compliance with the law. When developing and using algorithms for decision  making, their lawfulness needs to be assessed. Data  43 FRA (2017a). 44 Pew Research Center (2017), pp.77-83. 45 See FRA (2017a) and FRA (2017b).protection principles provide guidance to come to  legal decisions concerning the use of algorithms. However, there is more that needs to be consid ­ ered. A fundamental rights approach encompasses  an analysis of legality based on data protection, but  at the same time it goes beyond this. As stated in FRA’s Opinion on the proposed Regulation on the  European Travel Information and Authorisation Sys ­ tem (ETIAS), when defining risks, the threat of dis ­ crimination through the use of algorithms is not neg ­ ligible. Without testing algorithms and showing that  their application and risk assessments are neces­ sary, proportionate and do not result in discriminatory  profiling or decision making, we may not be certain  that their application is in compliance with the law.46 With this in mind, the following are some examples of how we can move towards fundamental rights  compliance in the development and use of algorithms.  Being as transparent as possible: opening up for scrutiny how algorithms were built supports the further development of these tools and allows  others to detect, and therefore rectify, any erro ­ neous applications.  Conducting fundamental rights impact assess ments: to identify potential biases and abuses  in the application of and output from algorithms.  These include, among others, an assessment of  the potential for discrimination in relation to dif ­ ferent grounds – such as gender, age, ethnic ori ­ gin, religion and sexual or political orientation. At  the same time, impact assessments could assess  the potential discrimination bias of using ‘proxy  information’ – such as addresses – with respect to  protected grounds in the area of discrimination.  Checking the quality  of data: given the amount of  data generated and used, it remains a challenge  to assess the quality of all data collected and used  for building algorithms. However, it is essential to  collect metadata (i.e. information about the data)  and make quality assessments of the correctness  and generalisability of the data.  Making sure the way the algorithm was built and operates may be meaningfully explained:  this would help facilitate access to remedies for  people who challenge data ­supported decisions  and also relates to the principle of transparency. The challenge of understanding the mathemati ­ cal background of a statistical method or an algo ­ rithm does not prevent a general description of the process and/or rationale behind the calcula ­ tions feeding the decision making, most notably,  which data were used to create the algorithm. 46 FRA (2017c).
