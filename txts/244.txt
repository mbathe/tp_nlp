  2 Foreword   Artificial intelligence (AI) is likely to be the “general purpose technology” of our era and as such will have a  tremend ous impact on the way people live and work over the coming decades. While the technology attracts  its share of hype, its significance is real and e xamples of benefic ial applications of AI already abound . Yet AI’s   full impact is still to  come , as firms, governments and individuals take up and combine  numerous AI  applications in innovative ways .   That i s why it is important to keep track of the progress of AI developmen t and deployment. All EU Member  States are develop ing and implement ing policies and national strategies to seize the benefits of AI for the  economy and society. Keeping a tab on how countries are support ing the development of  AI and how  successful differen t policies are is critical for public policy -makers. It enables countries to benchmark their  progress and to learn from good practices  implemented  elsewhere.   To prepare this publication  the EU and the OECD have joined forces, continuing our cooperation on AI policy .  The EC-OECD database  of national AI policies and strategies that we began to build in 2019 contains over  650 AI policies and strategies from over 60 countries , including  all th e EU Member States. It has now been  expanded to include emerging trends in AI policy, such as AI regulatory initiatives.    Building on this database, the present joint report from the EC Joint Research Centre’s AI Watch and the  OECD’s AI Policy Observatory  team provides information on the latest policy developments and trends in AI  policies for research and development, jobs and skills and much more.   We would like to take the opportunity to thank EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland for the  substantial and detailed contributions that have made this report possible. We intend to continue our   successful cooperation over the coming years to together help our members share and shape successful  AI  policies.

  4 Executive summary   Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the world in many aspects . It is essential for Europe to consider how  to make the most of the opportunities from this transformatio n and to address its challenges. I n 2018 the  European Commission adopted the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence1 that was developed  together with the Member States to maximise the impact of investments at E uropean Union (E U) and  national levels, and to encourage synergies and cooperation across the EU. One of the key actions towards  these aims was an encouragement for the Member States to develop their national AI strategies. The recently  published 2021 review of the  Coordina ted Plan on Artificial Intelligence2 presents the actions taken  by the European Commission and sets  concrete proposals and recommendations for further joint actions  between the EU and Member States in order  to strengthen the EU’s competitiveness in the glo bal AI  landscape.   The review of national strategies is one the tasks of AI Watch , which was  launch ed by the European  Commission to support the implementation of the Coordinated Plan on A rtificial Intelligence .3 The first review  of national strategies was published in February 2020.4 Building on the 2020 release, this report presents an  updated review of national AI strategies from the EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland . By  June 2021 , 20 Member States and Norway ha d published  national AI strategies , while 7  Member  States were in the final drafting phase. Since the 2020 release of the AI Watch report, additional  Member  States - i.e. Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia, and Spain - published their strategies, while Cyprus, Finla nd  and Germany have revise d their initial s trategies .5   This report reviews the  national AI strategies and provides an overview of national policy initiatives across  the following policy areas:    Human capital ;   From the lab to the market ;   Networking ;   Regulation ;   Infrastructure.   These policy areas are consistent with the actions proposed in the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence  and with the policy recommendations to governments contained in the OECD Recommendation on AI  (hereafter “ AI Principles ”). Further to the above policy areas , the report includes a section on AI policies to  address societal challenges.   National  approaches on AI differ in strategic priorities, budget allocations, and timeframe of implementation,  however all EU Member States and Associated Countries h ave ambitious plans to support the uptake  and development of AI.   Specifically, on the objective  to nurture human capital  in AI, Member States set various actions . First, all  governments are supporting education reforms  to increase the offer of AI -related c ourses and study  programmes at all education levels. These initiatives are complemented by lifelong learning and  upskilling opportunities  to provide advanced AI and digital skills to the workforce.  Measures addressing  broader labour market trends and chall enges remain at a very early stage of development. Furthermore,  governments are deploying national competence centres in AI  to build a strong AI research capacity  and  are fostering academic partnerships between public and private AI research institutions .  Governments are also setting up investment programmes for AI innovators , to foster the deployment of  innovative ideas into marketable products and services, with particular attention for AI start -ups and SMEs.  Commonly reported priority sectors for the dep loyment of AI are manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare,  transport and energy. The majority of the countries are also taking several actions to stimulate the use of  AI in public services . Many national AI strategies include a requirement for experimental projects to learn  by doing and sharing good practices. Some national strategies mention funding programmes to support AI  projects in public administration.                                              1  European Commission, Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence  (COM(2018) 795 final)    2  European Commission, Coordinated Plan on Artificial intelligence 2021 Review , (COM(2021) 205 final)   3  More information is available on the AI Watch  portal.  4  Van Roy, V.

  5 Governments are actively supporting collaborative partnerships among relevant stakeholders , across   the public sector, private sector, and civil society. Such partnerships are typically built by setting up innovation  communities, through setting up  digital innovation hubs and organising public awareness programmes.  Several Member States have also develope d maps of AI players and applications to better monitor ongoing  technological and scientific activities in AI and to facilitate national and international collaborations.   Many governments have established AI ethics  oversight bodies , to ensure that the development of AI is  grounded in European values and  fundamental rights.  These bodies aim to raise ethical awareness through  the provision of good practices, training and ethical codes of conduct for researchers and practitioners.  Several Member States are  also deploying AI certificates to acknowledge that AI systems have been  developed in an ethical, transparent and socially responsible manner. To further ensure trustworthy AI, most  governments are adopting new legislative frameworks for AI technologies , which are often sector specific and cover areas such as autonomous driving, healthcare and e -justice.  Lastly, several governments  are setting up regulatory sandboxes , offering controlled environments for AI experimentation and testing.   Data governance and c utting -edge ICT infrastructures are also  key for the uptake of AI. In this respect, all  national AI strategies mention having developed accessible repositories for public data. Governments are  building on their open data policies to promote data access and  sharing for AI . Governmental data chief  officer functions have been  created or  are being considered in several countries to further support and  encourage data use and exchange. These public bodies act as facilitators to coordinate and stimulate the  manage ment of national data assets by adopting open data governance. Open access to public sector data  continues to be a priority as national data strategies increasingly focus on AI to foster a robust digital  ecosystem for AI and to advance AI R&D. Policies to promote access to public data and initiatives that enable  private sector data sharing include data trusts and data spaces. To foster  the development of AI, all Member  States and Associated countries support access to secure data storage, high -performance c omputing,  affordable high -speed broadband networks  and next -generation software for data analytics.   Lastly, the current edition of the report highlights and analyses national policy initiatives that support the use  of AI to tackle societal challenges , nota bly the COVID -19 pandemic and climate change. Policy makers  have set up ambitious AI R&D programmes, rolled out long -term investment funds, provided access to data  and infrastructure, and supported national and international collaborations to accelerate th e diagnosis,  prevention and recovery of  diseases during  the COVID -19 pandemic and to find innovative  solutions to  mitigate climate change.   The collection of AI policies is conducted jointly by the European Commission ’s Joint Research Centre  (JRC) and the O ECD’s Science Technology and I nnovation Directorate6, while the analyses presented  in this report are carried out by the JRC, with contributions from the OECD. Both institutions joined forces to  ensure that the information supplied by AI Watch  and the  OECD AI Policy Observatory  is harmonised,  consistent and up to date. The EC-OECD database of national AI policies  contains national AI strategies and  AI-related policy initiatives from over 60 countries. This report is based on the EC -OECD database of national  AI polic ies, validate d by Member States’ representatives.   To conclude, the current report serve s as a starting point  in identifying national AI policies and governance  approaches in EU Member States and Associated Countries. Further ‘deep dives’ at country level into the  conte nt and implementation of AI policies are needed to acquire more in -depth policy intelligence about their  economic and societal impact. In terms of policy implications, this report demonstrates the  importance of  working closely with relevant stakeholders to  share lessons learned, good practices and challenges when   shaping AI policies.                                                6  The European Commission and the OECD have been  collaborat ing on global monitoring and analysis of Artificial Intelligence  developments , notabl y through a joint database of national AI policies at OECD.AI launched in February 2020.  
  6 1 Introduction   1.1 Background   Continuously growing computing power, and increased availability of data, have led to an unprecedented  upsurge of breakthroughs in artificial i ntelligence (AI)7, over the last few decades .8 These advances and  innovations in AI are significantly reshaping economies and societies across the world. They offer many  opportunities for better living conditions , for example  through enhanced efficiency of  production systems,  improved health care with better and more precise diagnosis and prevention of diseases and innovative  solutions for climate change mitigation and adapt ation.9 While AI technologies open up many new  opportunities for Europe, they also e ntail challenges .  The overall goal for the European Union (EU) is to make the EU a world -class hub for AI, while ensuring that  AI is human -centric and trustworthy and grounded in European values and fundamental rights .10 To this end,  all EU Member States an d Norway signed a Declaration of cooperation on Artificial Intelligence11 in  April 2018 to work together on the opportunities and challenges brought about by AI . The European  Commission  proposed a strategy on A rtificial Intelligence  for Europe, which was endorsed by the European  Council in June 2018.12  To increase synergies between national and EU level actions , the European Commission (EC) adopted  a  Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence13 in December 2018  to maximise the impact of investments  at EU and national levels, encourage synergies and cooperation across the EU, including on ethics and foster  the exchange of good practices.  The plan  was developed together with the Member States and it proposes  joint actions for closer and more efficient cooperatio n between Member States, Norway, Switzerland and the  European Commission in key areas  including  increasing investment, making more data available, fostering  talent and ensuring trust.  One of the key actions in the Coordinated Plan was encouragement for  all Member  States to develop their national AI strategies .   A European approach to AI is further developed  in the White paper on Artificial Intelligence - A  European approach to excellence and trust14, released in February 2020. The White paper  announced  the update of the Coordinated Plan  on Artificial Intelligence , and  presented  policy options for a future EU  regulatory framework for AI.  As a next step, the European Commission released t he 2021 review of the  Coordinated Plan  on Artificial Intelligence15 in Apr il 2021 . It builds on the Coordinated Plan of 2018 and  the White Paper on A rtificial Intelligence  and puts forward a concrete set of joint actions for the European  Commission and Member States on strengthen ing Europe's leading position in the development o f human centric, sustainable, secure, inclusive and trustworthy AI.  On the same day, the European Commission also  released a legal framework on AI16, which addresses the risks of AI and proposes p roportionate and  flexible rules to address the specific risks  posed by AI systems and set the highest standard worldwide .  In May 2019, the OECD Council adopted t he Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence  (OECD   AI Principles )17 to promote AI that is innovative and trustworthy and that respects human rights and  democratic values. In June 2019, the G20 adopted human -centred AI Principles that draw from the OECD AI  Principles.  The OECD AI Principles identif y five complementary values -based princ iples for the responsible  stewardship of trustworthy AI  systems: inclusive growth  and well -being;  human rights and fairness;   transparency  and explainability;  safety , security  and robustness;  and accountability  of AI actors for the  functioning of AI systems  in line with the se principles . Consistent with these value -based principles, the OECD   AI Principles  also provide five priority recommendations to governments: promoting invest ment  in AI R&D;                                             7  For a definition of AI, see the European Commission Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence ,  (COM(2021) 206 fina l  8  See the JRC Report  AI Watc h - TES analysis of AI Worldwide Ecosystem in 2009 -2018  (Samoili et al., 2020 ).  9  European Commission, White Paper on Arti ficial Intelligence: a European approach to excellence and trust , COM(2020) 65 final   10  European Commission , Communication Fostering a European approach to Artificial Int elligence  COM(2021) 205 final   11  European Commission, Declaration of cooperation on Artificial Intelligence , 2018   12  European Commission, Communication on A rtificial Intelligence  for Europe , (COM(2018) 237 final)   13  European Commission, Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence  (COM(2018) 795 final)   14  European Commission, White Paper on Artificial Intelligence: a European approach to excellence and trust , COM(2020) 65 final   15  European Commissio n, Coordinated Plan on Artificial intelligence 2021 Review , (COM(2021) 205 final)   16  European Commission,  Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence , (COM(2021) 206 fina l  17  OECD, Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence  [OECD/LEGAL/0449] , (2019)  
  7 data, AI compute , software & knowledge; reviewing policy and regulatory frameworks and  using  testbeds;  building skills and preparing labour markets; and co -operati ng international ly on AI .   As agreed through  the 2018 Coordinated Plan , most Member States been active in developing and adopting   national AI strategies .18 The Coordinated Plan on A rtificial Intelligence  2021 review provided  an overall view  on the status of adoption of national strategie s.19 This report provides a more detailed and structured   overview of actions and priorities of each country, as well as common directions and developments at  European level . Careful monitoring and analysis of national AI strategies is important as is the foundation for  identifying and building synergies, and le arning from each other. EU’s strength lies in the variety of national  strategies combined with close cooperation to bring good practices to the European level.   1.2 Objectives  of the report   In support of the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence, the Euro pean Commission has launched the  AI  Watch20 initiative,  the European Commission knowledge service to monitor the development, uptake and  impact of AI for Europe , implemented by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in close  coordination with DG CONNECT. Monitoring and analysing national AI strategies is in the core of AI Watch’s  mandate and goals.   This report  gather s information on EU Member States’ AI policies in unified form to:   Provide a useful resource for Member States ’ policy makers  to help them compare their strategy  to  those of other countries,  and to identify areas for collaboration;    Support , at the EU level,  the monitor ing of  the implementation of the Coordinated Plan on Artificial  Intelligence  and provide input for its development .  The first AI Watch report on national AI strategies21 presented  the status of EU Member States’ national AI  strategies up to the date of its release in  February 2020. The current report builds on the previous edition  and presents an updated review of Member States’ national AI strategies  from March 2020 till June  2021. This  report has been enriched with  a more in -depth analysis on national AI strategies  in the EU ,  highlighting similarities and differences  in Member States’ national policy approaches. This exe rcise allows  identify ing good practices and common strengths on which the EU can reinforce  its position as  a top AI player  at global level . Second, this report is complemented with a dedicated section on AI policies to tackle  societal challenges  on sustain able climate and environment, and the COVID -19 pandemic.  Lastly, the  report now has a broader country coverage and also covers Associated Countries: Norway and Switzerland.   The collection of AI policies is conducted jointly by the European Commission ’s Joi nt Research Centre  (JRC) and the OECD Science Technology and I nnovation Directorate22, while the analyses presented in  this report are carried out by the JRC, with contributions from the OECD. Both institutions joined forces to  ensure that the information supplied by AI Watch  and the  OECD AI Policy Observatory  is harmonised,  consistent and up to date. The EC-OECD database of natio nal AI policies  contains national AI strategies and  AI-related policy initiatives from over 60 countries. This report is based on the EC -OECD database of national  AI polic ies, validated by Member States’ representatives.   This report is structured as follow s. The next section, Section 2, presents an overview of the current status of  national AI strategies in the European Union, Norway and Switzerland. Section 3 discusses the methodological  approach to gather and structure information on national AI policy in itiatives. Section 4 offers insights from   national AI strategies. Lastly, Section 5 outlines country reports for all Member States, Norway and  Switzerland, summarising  the AI policy measures at national level .23                                               18  See section 2 for an overview of the status of national AI strategies.    19  The Coordinated Plan on AI 2021 r eview also includes an annex with short updates on the national strategies. This report gives a  deeper and more structured overview to sup plement the r eview.   20  More information on the initiative is available on the AI Watch  portal.   21  Van Roy, V. (2020).

  8 2 Overview of national AI strategies   By June 2021 , 20 Member States and Norway had adopted national AI strategies , while 7 Member  States were in the final drafting phase  and ready to publish their strategy in the coming months.  Table 1  provides an overview of national AI strategies in the EU Member States and Norway.24  After the publication of the  2020  AI Watch report on national AI strategies  (Van Roy, 2020)  released in  February 2020, Bulgaria, Hunga ry, Poland and Spain adopted their strategy  in the third and fourth quarter of  2020 , and Slovenia released its strategy in May 2021 . Other Member States, such as  Cyprus, Finland  and  Germany, have revised  their initial strategies.  Cyprus has launched a call for tender to develop an Action Plan  to follow -up the progress and implementation of its national AI strategy. In November 2020, Finland  launched the Artificial Intelligence 4.0 programme25 to promote the development of AI in com panies, with a  special focus on SMEs. Lastly, since the release of its AI strategy, Germany revised it twice and committed in  December 2020 to increase the initial public investment for AI from EUR 3 billion to EUR 5 billion.   Eight Member States (Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Gree ce, Ireland, Italy, and Romania ) currently have final  drafts of their strategies and intend to publish their strategy  before the end of 2021.

  9 3 Methodology   This report is based on information on national policy initiatives collected by AI Watch  and by  the OECD.AI  Observatory  and information provided by Member States. The  collection of  information benefited from  close  collaboration between JRC, DG CONNECT and the OECD  and r egular consultations with Member States’  representatives .26 These exchanges were set up so that Member Stat es’ representatives could provide initial  feedback and - after revision - a formal validation of the information  presented in this report.   This report follows the same methodology as the 2020  AI Watch report on national AI strategies (Van Roy,  2020). It provides an overview of AI policies along the key policy areas outlined below and  it highlights AI  policies to tackle societal challenges related to  the climate and  environment , and to the COVID -19 pandemic.    AI policy areas   The national policy initiatives are presented  in this report according to  the following policy areas :   Human capital : include s all policies to foster the educational development of people in using and  developing AI solutions. It includes aspects of formal education and training (e.g. refo rms of  educational systems towards  the inclusion of AI courses and programmes), vocational and  continuing learning (e.g. AI training  for the workforce), and labour market intelligence and needs (e.g.  identifying forthcoming skill needs due to changes in te chnology developments);    From the lab to the market : encompasses policy initiatives to encourage research and innovation  in AI towards business growth in the private sector and increased efficiency of public services. This  area also includes policy instrume nts to facilitate testing and experimenting  with newly developed AI  pilots and services;    Networking : covers all policy initiatives related to AI collaborations across private and/or public  sectors and directed to increasing the (inter)national attractivene ss of the country (e.g. policies  aiming at attracting foreign AI talented individuals and firms to the focal country). This area also  includes policies related to the dissemination and uptake of AI such as promotion al campaigns and  mapping of AI players an d applications;    Regulation : covers policies for the development of ethical guidelines, legislative reforms and  (international) standardisation ;   Infrastructure : covers initiatives to encourage data collection , use and sharing,  and to foster the  digital and telecommunication infrastructure .  These policy areas  are consistent with the actions proposed in the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence  and the policy recommendations to governments contained in the OECD AI Principles .  Figure  1 provides  an overview of these relevant policy areas for AI and the key objectives to unleash the full  potential of AI  in Europe.                                                26 The European Commission organises regular meetings with the AI Watch Steering Group  composed of Member States and Associated  Countries representatives. The Steering Group provides strategic guidance and monitors the implementation of AI Watch activit ies,  including the current report .

The impact s of ongoing  climate change and the COVID -19 pandemic  are compelling and significantly  impact  human lives , the  environment  and economic development. With its recent proposals on the European Green Deal27, the EU  is  leading the way in tackling climate and environmental -related challenges. At the same time, the European  Commission is working on all fronts to fight the spread of the coronavirus, to support national health systems  and to counter t he socio -economic impact of the  pandemic .28  AI is perceived  as a game changer in tackling these societal challenges. In this respect, the 2020 White Paper  on Artificial Intelligence29 highlights that (p 2.) “ digital technologies such as AI are a critical enabler for  attaining the goals of the Green Deal ”. The 2021 revi ew of the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence   proposes forthcoming policy actions to foster the role of AI in support of the European Green Deal and the  recovery of the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic. In addition, AI has contributed to  countering the current  COVID -19 pandemic . The COVID -19 crisis has acted as a boost for AI adoption and data sharing, and  created new opportunities for society and the economy.30 At the European level, AI is also recognised a s a key  technology to respond to the socio -economic disruption caused by the COVID -19 pandemic. The  Recovery and  Resilience Facility ( a temporary recovery instrument to raise funds to help repair the immediate economic  and social damage and centrepiece to Europe’s recovery plan  NextGenerationEU , in which 20 % of the  funding is earmarked for digital including AI ) highlights  the importance of green and digital transitions   for recovery .31                                               27 European Commission, The European Green Deal , COM(2019) 640 final   28 See the timeline of EU action  for more information about the EU measures in response to the COVID -19 pandemic.   29 European Commission, White Paper on Artificial Intelligence: a European approach to excellence and trust , COM(2020) 65 final   30 For the detailed analysis see, AI Uptake in Health and Healthcare , JRC Technical Reports (De Nigris et al. 2020) .  31 See the Recovery plan for Europe  webpage for more information about  NextGenerationEU and the Recovery and Resilience Facility.   
  11 4 Insights from  national AI strategies  and policies in the EU   This section provides insights from  national AI strategies across EU Member States, and Associated Countries  (Norway and Switzerland ). It highlights  a range of  policy approaches across diverse  policy areas and provides   examples of good policy practices.  National strate gies differ in both the scope and approaches to the  regulation of AI , ranging from high -level strategies with different  policy initiatives to concrete action plans  with specific milestones  and time frames (e.g. Bulgaria, Estonia  and Hungary ). AI policies can also be  incorporated in a wider strategy of digital transformation, as for Slovakia.  Recently published or updated  strategies (e.g. Germany and Spain) include policy initiatives in response to the COVID -19 pandemic and  sustainability issue s, such as environmental and climate change.   More detailed information on AI policies for each specific country can be f ound in Section 5 of the report and  is available on the EC-OECD database of national AI policies , the AI Watch Portal  and the OECD.AI Policy  Observatory .  4.1 Human capital   As part of the national AI strategies, go vernments are supporting human capacity building in AI and aim to  prepare for the labour market transformations brought about by AI technologies. The objective is to provide  current and future generations  with the necessary skills and competenc ies in AI an d to anticipate labour  market trends. To this purpose, several EU Member States have developed AI skills strategies  to address  the challenges posed by the increasing digital transformation of the world of education and work. For  example, as outlined in Malta’s AI strategy, the  Malta College of Arts, Science & Technology has released an  AI Strategy and Action Plan 2020 -2025  in which it outlines policy actions towards the int roduction of AI in  higher education (see Section 5.19.1) . Similarly, the Swiss G overnment published a strategy on Artificial  Intelligence  in Education  highlighting the opportunities and challenges of AI for the education system (see  Section 5.27.1).   Most countries  commonly follow a similar policy approach  to nurture AI talents . First, national strategies aim  to strengthen the provision of A I competenc ies at all education levels with supportive policies for  education reforms . Education reforms in the primary and secondary education systems typically include  courses on ICT, digital literacy and AI, often complemented with courses on judg ement and problem solving,  creative and critical thinking, and interpersonal communication. AI competenc ies at tertiary education levels  are fostered through increased support for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)  subjects, and the creatio n of Bachelors, Masters, PhD and postgraduate programmes in AI -related fields.32 To  guarantee high -quality levels of education in AI, most countries also develop policies to enhance teachers’  competenc ies in teaching and working with digital and AI technolo gies.   Second, national strategies  also propose actions to promote  a culture of lifelong learning and continuous  up/reskilling  of citizens . This is typically done through  massive open online courses (MOOCs) and on -the-job  trainings in AI for employees in t he public and private sector. An example is the Finnish MOOC  Elements of AI   (see Section 5.9.1)33, which aims to demystify AI wit h a basic and more advanced course on AI. While Finland  initially aimed to  train 1% of its population, the  course attracted more than 100, 000 participants,  representing more than 2% of the population. To reach as many people as possible, the online course is being  translated in to all languages  of the European Union.   Finally, governments  are setting up policies to evaluate the future needs of the labour market  in terms of  digital and AI competences. The Czech Republic, for example, will monitor the labour market and anticipate  future  labour requirements to improve career guidance, worker mobility and reskilling opportunities (see  Section 5.6.1). Similarly, Sweden developed a pilot project  to identify the s kills needed for better use of  emerging technologies such as AI (see Section 5.28.1). Germany is monitoring the impact of AI on the labour  market for policy intervention through the Observatory for Artificial Intelligence in Work and Society (or AI  Observa tory) 34, and also supports the  OECD Programme on AI in Work, Innovation, Productivity and Skills (AI                                            32  A recently published JRC report on Academic Offer of Advanced Digital Skills in 2019 -20. International Comparison  provides an  overview of the education offer for advanced digital skills in fields such as artificial intelligence, hig h-performance computing,  cybersecurity, and data science (Righi et al, 2020). It covers the EU Member States, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Can ada and  United States, and Australia.   33  The University of Helsinki also released a MOOC on Ethics of AI .  34  For more information on human capacity building in AI in Germany, see Germany’s human -centred approach to AI  on the OECD AI  Policy Observatory.   
  12 WIPS ). AI-WIPS analyses the impact of AI on the labour market, skills and social policy while providing  opportunities for international dialogue and policy  assessments .35   4.2 From the lab to the market   Bringing AI developments from the lab to the market  can only be successful in a well -supported  enterprise -driven ecosystem with sufficient scope and funding for AI research and innovation activities36,  including in centives for experimentation. Funding and support programmes should target the development of  initial ideas to pave the path towards promising emerging fields in AI. In addition, it is critical to support the  transformation of AI concepts into successful p roducts and services, with policy instruments all along the  innovation process from the lab to the market.37 It equally  requires support mechanisms for the uptake and  use of AI in public administration.   Against this background, countries have taken various  measures to stimulate and support AI research. A large  majority of the EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland have developed or are in the process of creating  national competence centres in AI research . Examples of national competence centres include  the  Finnish Centre for Artificial Intelligence ( FCAI), the French interdisciplinary institutes of Artificial Intelligence  (3IA), the Danish National Centre for Research in Digital Technologies ( DIREC ), the six German Competence  Centres for AI Research and the Hungarian Artificial Intelligence National Laboratory ( MILAB ). Some resear ch  centres have a more general approach and target many research fields in AI, others are more specific. The  Hungarian National Laboratory for Autonomous Systems  is for instance focused on autonomous systems,  while the Polish Centre for CyberSecAI38 and the forthcoming  competence centre in Slovakia39 are specialised  in cyber security procedures for AI systems. Lastly, Est onia has a Competence Centre Specialised in Machine  Learning and Data Science ( STACC ).  Cross -border co -operation in AI research is also a pr iority for EU countries. Figure 2 illustrates AI international  research collaboration.   Figure 2.

  13 To increase innovation in AI  and foster the creation and growth of AI businesses, many countries are  complementing existing and general funding instruments for innovation with more AI -focused fund ing  schemes and support programmes. Commonly reported funding instruments that have been  in place for  many years are innovation vouchers, seed capital, venture capital schemes (particularly targeting SMEs), and  business growth programmes.  Malta, for exampl e, has reformed its Seed Investments Scheme with more  favourable tax credit conditions for innovative AI firms.   Several countries have dev eloped or are developing AI readiness tools  to evaluate the digital and AI  maturity of businesses and to identify government guidance and policy actions for innovation support. The  Finnish AI maturity tool  helps organisations to increase their business opportunities in identifying their most  important areas for improvement in AI  (see Section 5.9.2) . Other policies such as the Danish Sprint:Di gital  offer support for the digital transformation of Danish SMEs and the development of new digital business  models  (see Section 5.7.2).   To support AI start -ups during their first business years, Belgium, Malta and Sweden have developed  dedicated support programmes on AI for young companies. Through the Belgian Start AI  programme  and  Trempli n AI programme  (see Section 5.2.2) , the Swedish Startup AI activities  funding  (see Section 5.28.2)  and  the Maltese YouStartIT  accelerator  (see Section 5.19.2) , start -ups are supported in their discovery of AI at  early stages of the innovation process (e.g. during the proof of concept (PoC) phase). In a similar vein , though  not necessarily targeting only start-ups, Finland launched the Artificial Intelligence Accelerator  to facilitate  companies in bringing AI experiments into production  (see Section 5.9.2) . Cyprus and Hungary are planning to  set up similar AI accelerator pr ogrammes/centres in the near future.   Most countries highlight various priority sectors  in their national AI strategies with a high potential for AI  applications. The most  commonly reported sectors are manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, transport and  energy. In addition to these priority sectors, a number of countries prioritised language technologies in their  AI strategies as key to enabling interactive dialogue syste ms and personal virtual assistants f or personalised  public services . For example,  Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Slovakia, and Spain report supportive policies for  natural language processing . Slovakia is developing a tool for natural language processing to ac celerate the  development of AI in the private sector and improve the quality of public services. Spain launched a project  on the Spanish Language and AI ( LEIA) to promote and enable the use of the Spanis h language in the digital  world . These policy efforts continue the action lines outlined in the National Plan for Advan cement in Natural  Language Processing  (see Section 5.27.5).  Denmark is focusing on language technologies  to support ‘AI in  Danish’ and in June 2020, launched a platform  displaying metadata of existing linguistic resources to  facilitate the development of language technologie s in Danish  (see Section 5.7.5).    Lastly, governments are also setting up policies to spur AI innovation  and use in public administration .40  Such poli cies include AI programmes for public services, e -governance strategies to improve t he digitalisation  process of public  administration, support for innovative public procurement and sharing good practices.  Initiatives such as GovTech Polska  and GovTech Lab Lithuania  are good examples of how to boost the  innovation ecosystem in the public administration and AI.                                              40  For an Overview of the use and impact of AI in public services in the EU, see the JRC AI Watch report on Artificial Intelligence in public  services  (Misuraca, G. & van Noordt, 2020). This report will be updated i n 2021.  
  14 4.3 Networking   Networks and collaborative platforms  are important for a swift deployment of AI. Bringing the relevant  community together and combining expertise and efforts from various sources can help  to seize (the often  ambitious) AI opportunities.41  Against this background, many governments hav e set up policies to build innovation communities  by  bringing together tech companies, research centres, innovation actors and citizens. Examples are the Belgian  Beacon  initiative, the Czech Knowledge Transfer Partnerships  programme, the Finnish AuroraAI  national  programme, the German the Plattform Lernende Syst eme, the Norwegian AI Research Consortium , the Polish  Virtual Research Institute , the Portuguese collaborative laboratories , and the Slovak.AI  platform.   To further increase innovation community building, the governments of Belgium, the Czech Republic,  Germany, Finland, Poland and Spain have developed maps of AI actors  and applications . These maps  provide an overview of academic institutions, research centres, public administrations and companies active  in AI. They also monitor ongoing te chnological and scientific activities in AI and encourage networking  opportunities .  In addition, EU Member States, Norway and Switzerl and support the establishment and  further expansion of  digital innovation hubs  (DIHs). DIHs are important channels for net working opportunities to foster the  digital and AI transformations of industries. Well -established  DIHs in AI -related fields are the CYRIC Digital  Innovation Hub  of Cyprus (expertise in IoT and robotics), the Ventspils High Technology Park  of Latvia  (expertise in robotics and automation), and  the Luxembourg Digital Innovation Hub  (expertise in AI and digital  infrast ructure, such as HPC and data centres).   Global and Pan -European networks are further developed through initiatives such as the OECD.AI Network  of Experts . The network  is a multi -stakeholder and multi -disciplinary group that provides AI -specific policy  advice to the OECD and contributes to the OECD.AI Policy Observatory . It is composed of over 200 experts,  including AI policy experts, technical experts and experts from social sciences and humanities. The network  consists of a working group on classifying AI systems; a working group on implementation tools for  trustworthy AI; a working group on national AI policies  and a task force on AI compute.   The EC and some EU Membe r States also participate in the Global Partnership on AI  (GPAI). The GPAI  brings together experts from industry, civil society, governments and academia. It supports cutting -edge  research and applied activities on AI -related priorities. In May 2021, the European Commission and the  following EU Member States were involved in the Global Partnership in AI: France, Germany, Italy, the  Netherlands, Poland, Slovenia, and Spain.    Many countries are also setting up policies to attract AI talent and investments from abroad . To this  purpose, some countries have dedicated strategies, such as  the researchers’ mobility programme in Cyprus  and the forthcoming Spanish Talent Hub programme. Other policies aim to improve working conditions f or  foreign talents by facilitating administrative procedures. This is achieved by simplifying and accelerating  procedures to acquire a residence and a working permit for foreign researchers and their family members.  The Czech Republic, Finland, Italy, Malt a, Portugal and Spain are implementing this through  start-up visas and  fast-track services for valuable talents coming from abroad.   Lastly, the majority of countries is also exploiting social media channels and organising public events   to raise awareness o n AI and to increase networking opportunities. The Maltese strategy announces for  instance a public investment of EUR 1 million per year for promotion campaigns and outreach activities.  Slovenia plans to launch a communication platform for the collection a nd dissemination of good practices  and case studies on the use and deployment of AI in society. Similarly, Hungary will organise an annual  innovation award for AI application projects to make AI developments  visible to the  broader public.                                                41  European Commission, Coordinated Plan on Artificial intelligence 2021 Review , (COM(2021) 205 final)  
  15 4.4 Regulation   The u se of certain AI technologies raise s ethical and legal issues, necessitating  the development of a legal  framework for  human -centric and trustworthy AI .42 These issues relate to human rights, privacy, fairness,  algorithmic bias, transparency and explainability, safety and accountability, among others.   National actions to address ethical concerns  differ across countries in terms of strategic approach  and  level of focus. Finland released the  government  report on Ethical information policy in an age of artificial  intelligence  outlining principles for fair data governance, including guidelines for the us e of information and  ethical values. Denmark propose s a specific focus on  the responsible and sustainable use of data by the  public and private sector. In December 2019, a Data Ethics Toolbox  was launched to support companies to  adopt and implement data ethics into their business models. In January 2021 a Danish  law entered into force  on data ethics compliance for Denmark’s largest companies. It is accompanied by a guide for business  on  how to include data ethics in their annual reports . Sweden established an AI sustai nability centre , which acts  as a hub co -founded by companies, universities and public authorities with a specific focus on  the social and  ethical aspects of AI.   To facilitate the development of ethical guidelines many governments have established AI ethics   committees  and councils. These bodies  provide recommendations on ethical issues and continuously  monitor the use and development of AI technologies. They also  raise ethical awareness through the provision  of good practices, training and ethical codes of c onduct for researchers and practitioners in both the public  and private sector.   Many governments also implement monitoring and reward systems for compliance with principles  for  trustworthy AI . Malta has developed an AI certification  framework, issued by the Malta Digital Innovation  Authority ( MDIA ). It serves as valuable recognition in the marketplace that the AI systems of successful  applicants have been developed in an ethical , transparent and socially responsible manner  (see Section  5.19.4) . Similar quality seals or labels - acting as hallmarks for a responsible approach in AI - have been  adopted in other countries such as Denmark and Germany. The Czech Republic, Italy , Lithuania, and Spain are  consider ing developing them as well. Similarly, the AI registers  set up by the cities  of Amsterdam and Helsinki   (see Section 5.9.4)  aim to ensure a secure, responsible and transparent use  of AI algorithms.   Various EU Member States are setting up AI Observatories and knowledge centres  to support and enable  socially responsible and ethically sound implementations of AI. An example  of such an i nitiat ive is the  planned Artificial Intelligence Regulation and Ethics Knowledge Centre of Hungary. This centre  aims is to  create and coordinate an ex tensive pool of experts to advis e on legal issues and ethics of AI.  In terms of legislation, many governme nts highlight the need to evaluate the current legal framework and to  adopt new  EU level  legislation to guarantee a binding regulatory framework  for the  successful uptake  and deployment of AI. Countries are starting to develop sector -specific regulations  for well -defined fields  of AI that are currently not or not sufficiently covered by existing  EU legislation. A notable  example in this  respect is the regulation on automated driving. Many governments (e.g. Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic  Germany, Lithuania and Spain) have adopted regulations to allow for the testing of automated vehicles and  associated technologies on public roads. Other regulatory fields that receive particular attention are (health  care) data and automated decision making. Norway  is for instance working on proposals for amending its  Health Register Act  to delineate the use of data for patient treatments and rules of consent from individuals   (see Section 5.21.4) . Slovakia is also preparing a new Act on Data to better define regulations on data  protection, disclosure principles, data access and open data regul ations. Regardi ng the latter field, the Dutch  Government has implemented the Law Enforcement Directive in its national legislation, which contains  provisions on automated decision making for law enforcement. Finland and Portugal are also d eveloping  nationa l regulations for  automated decision -making to determine liability issues among others.   Many governments are also considering the establishment of controlled environments for AI experimentation,  for example by developing regulatory sandboxes .43 The objectiv e of the sandboxes is to facilitate  experimentation in real -life conditions while temporarily reducing regulatory burdens to help testing                                             42  In April 2021 the Europe an Commission  proposed a legal framework for AI, see  Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised  rules on artific ial intelligence , (COM(2021) 206 fina l)  43 Article 53 of the Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence  (COM(2021) 206 fina l) includes  a  provision on AI regulatory sandboxes . 
  16 innovations.44 Although announced in several national AI strategies of EU Member States, Norway and  Switzerland, the de velopment of regulatory sandboxes for AI is still at an embryonic stage in most countries.  Germany’s AI strategy plans the establishment of AI regulatory sandboxes  and testbeds , such as the  “Digital  Motorway testbed A9 ” (administrated by  the Federal Ministry of Transport and  Digital Infrastructure). These  make it possible to test technologies in a real -life setting and to screen the regulatory environment and make  adjustments (see Section 5.11.2).  Similarly , The Italian Government put in place regulatory sandboxes  through the  Sperimentazione Italia  initiative to facilitate controlled experiments with innovative products,  including AI.   4.5 Infrastructure   As AI algorithms often involve large amoun ts of data, it is crucial to establish a solid data environment to  collect, share and analyse big data.45 To this purpose, governments are supporting the development of data  infrastructures to ensure the provision of reliable and high -quality data that can be shared with a wide range  of users in a robust and accessible way. Several EU Member States have developed specific national data  strategies  to set the foundations for trustworthy data use and exchanges. Commonly, these strategies  outline policy actions for open data governance, the creation of data repositories and data management such  as the improvement of data interoperability across databases and the protection of individual and collective  rights. The Data Strategy  of the German Federal G overnment for instance identifies four concrete fields of  actions: the improvement of data provision and access, the promotion of responsible data use, the increase  of data competenc ies in society and the development of a data culture for data sharing and use. Similarly,  the Czech Republic launched a National Strategy on Open Access to Research Information  for the years  2017 -2020 to initiate a gradual process to open access to scientific information at the national level. Other  countries, such as Spain, integrate their policies towards a data economy into the broader umbrella of the  Digital Agenda 2025  strategy.   To create an open data culture, countries are setting up open data  and open science  policies . In this  respect, the Portug uese Open Data Policy  and the Danish Open Science Policy  are good examples of  how to  provide guidelines for managing and sharing data in the scientific community, while ensuring data integrity  and open access.   Open data platforms and portals  have been developed in all EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland.  They commonly aim to provide free access to data of the public administration and to encourage its  secondary use. In addition to non -commercial data, some governments are planning to support commercial  data platforms. Hungary for instance foresees to support the creation of a data market place to encourage  the transmission of non -personal data of high quality for commercial purposes.   Finally, several EU Member States and Norway have set up governance bodies and data chief officers  to  support and encourage data  utilisation. These public bodies act as facilitators to coordinate and stimulate the  management of national data assets and to foster open data governance.   A wide range of policies is also taken by governments to foster the quality and capacity of the  telecommunication and ICT infrastructure , crucially  needed to enhance data analytics  resources for AI.   All Member States and Associated countries mention support ing the access to secure data storage, high performance computing, affordable high -speed broadband  networks and next -generation software for data  analytics.  Participation in  the European High -Performance Computing Joint Undertaking  (EuroHPC ) is  often highlighted in national AI strategies . EuroHPC announced eight sites to host world -class  supercomputers. They are located in Sofia (Bulgaria), Ostrava (Czech Republic), Kajaani (Finland), Bologna  (Italy), Bissen (Luxembourg), Minho (Portugal), Maribor (Slovenia), and Bar celona (Spain). Some countries have  also released dedicated strategies for the creation of high -performance computing.  The Advanced Computing  Portugal 2030  strategy outlines action lines to transform Portugal into an advanced computing service  economy by 2030  (see Section 5.23.5) . In addition, governments are increasing computing capacities through  investments in cloud services and quantum computing . In this respect, the Malta Hybrid Cloud  initiative  procu red by MITA is an example of  how to enable access to cloud platforms for the public and private sector                                              44  In addition to regulatory sandboxes, the Coordinated Plan on Artificial intelligence 2021 Review  (COM(2021) 205 final)  outlines   forthcoming EU actions on Testing and Experimentation Facilities (TEFs) and European D igital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) to support  innovation and uptake of AI technologies .  45  European Commission, A European strategy for data , COM(2020) 66 final, 2020  
  17 (see Section 5.19.5) . Finally, gove rnments mention their support for  high-quality connectivity and nationwide  5G deployment.   4.6 AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   To tackle the ongoing climate change and environmental challenges, Member States and Associated  Countries are embra cing AI solutions and support the development of innovative ideas from the lab to the  market. As highlighted in the Coordinated Plan on AI 2021 review46, AI technologies could primarily support  the achievement of the Green Deal objectives through four main channels : 1) transition to a circular  economy,  2) better setup, integration and management of the energy system s, 3) more efficient transport,  and decarbonisation of buildings, agriculture and manufacturing , and 4) enabling new solutions that were not  possible with other technologies .   Many governments are setting up ambitious R&D programmes  and calls for proposals  to support  the  development of AI solutions  for the achievement of the Green Deal objectives . Prominent examples are the  German Lighthouses of AI for Environment, Climate, Nature and Resources  (see Sectio n 5.11.6),  the  Lithuanian call for proposals on Green industry innovation  (see Section 5.17.6)  and the Swedish R&D call on  AI in the service of climate  (see Section 5.28.6).  These program mes commonly target appli ed research  projects , not only in the fields of  energy efficiency  and reduced greenh ouse gas emissions but also  e.g. for  the protection of biodiversity, water management and sustainable consumption.   At the same time, the education offer with a combined focus on AI and environmental issues  remain s  rather limited. Most Member States  are expanding their education offer at all levels, including formal and  informal education programmes for advanced digital skills  in fields such as AI and high -performance  computing . However , little attention seems to be given so far to the development of  education programmes   that teach how AI can be used to address critical and global environmental challenges.47   The creation of AI technologies for a greener and more sustainable economy and society is further supported  through the development of cutting -edge data ecosystems and high -end ICT infrastructure .  Countries, such as  France and  Switzerland, have for instance developed  strategies on energy and data .48  These strategies outline recommendations and policy actions to mitigate climate change and to support  digital and AI -related innovations for energy efficiency  based on improved data infrastructures . Other  countries , such  as the Netherlands and Latvia suppo rt the use of AI to exploit the vast and often  untapped environmental data sets  in their public administrations. To this purpose, the Royal Netherlands  Meteorological Institute ( KNMI ) provides access to its databases and has created the KNMI DataLab  to  facilitate and coordinate innovations in the fields of climate change, weather forecasting and seismology  (see  Section 5.20.6) . Similarly, Latvia provides ac cess to the data repositories from  the Latvian Environmental,  Geological and Meteorological Centre ( VSIA) containing meteorological radar images, measurements, and  forecasting data.  In addition , high-performance com puting centres run the data -driven and  computationally -intensive environmental models . Ireland has various projects  at the Irish Centre for High -End  Computing ( ICHEC ). First, in collaboration with other institutes, thi s centre has established various national  platforms to ensure the provision of high -quality data (on satellite images and oceanographic data, among  others) and to enhance possibilities for data exchange. Second, the complex compute solutions and  infrastruc tures of the centre are used in many collaborative projects with public institutions both at  the  national and European level.49 Moreover,  other high -performance computing centres, such as the Vienna  Scientific Cluster 4 ( VSC-4) and the Bulgarian Strategic Centre for Artificial Intelligence ( SCIA) leverage  their  facilities to forecast the impact of climate change using big data and machine learning techniques.   COVID -19 pandemic   To quickly respond to the COVID -19 pandemic, governments actively support the development of AI -powered  technologies with targeted R&D programmes and investment funds . Member States and Associated  countries are supporting dedicated research projects within  hospitals, research centres, and univers ities. For                                             46  European Commission, Coordinated Plan on Artificial intelligence 2021 Review , (COM(2021) 205 final)   47  Out of 1032 education programmes identified in the field of AI in the JRC report ' Academic Offer of Advanced Digital Skills in 2019 20. International Comparison ', it identifies only one with a combined focus on AI and environmental issues.   48  For more information about these policy reports, see Section 5.10 for France and Section 5.29 for Switzerland.   49  See Section 5.14.1 for an extensive list of projects in which the Irish Centre for High -End Computing ( ICHEC ) participates.  
  18 example, the Danish G overnment has allocated a total of EUR 20 million for research and development  to  combat the pandemic and has launched various signature projects  on AI and health.50 Similarly, Ireland  established the Rapid Response Research and Innovation  programme  in March 2020  to enable the research  and innovation community to respond to the challenges raised by the pandemic. Other examples include the  R&D projects  at the Finnish Centre for Artificial Intelligence, the AI-enabled methods  to model the COVID -19  replication process at the French HPI research laboratory, the innovative AI -powered tools to track and model  the spread of the virus at the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment and the COVID 19 Activities  at the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute.   To increase the speed of scientific breakthroughs for developing COVID -19 solutions, many governments are  encouraging national and international collaborations  among relevant stakeholders, including the public  sector, private sector, and civil society. This is commonly done by fostering collaborative partnerships and  organising hackathons, which help to collect innovative ideas about deployable AI and robotics solutions to  face the ongoing COVID -19 crisis. Notable examples of initiatives supporting collaborative partnerships   are the EU Framework programmes (e.g. Horizon2020) and the Global Partnership on AI (GPAI).   With respect to Horizon2020, in A ugust 2020, the Commission announced to support 23 new collaborative  research projects with EUR 128 million in response to the continuing coronavirus pandemic.51 Also, the GPAI is  supporting the responsible development and use of AI -enabled solutions to COV ID-19 and other future  pandemics. To this end, a working group on AI and pandemic response has been formed to promote cross sectoral and cross -border collaboration in this area. Multiple hackathon  events have been organised in  Europe. Among them, the #EuvsVirus  hackathon promoted cross -European partnerships to come up with  innovative solutions to fight against the COVID -19 pandemic.52 Many countries, such as the Czech Republic,  Greece, Latvia and Lith uania have also organised hackathons at a national level.   The global challenges stemming from the COVID -19 pandemic have urged governments to provide access  and promote sharing of research data . In April 2020, the European Commission and several stakehold ers  established a COVID -19 data portal  to enable rapid and open sharing of research data. Similarly, the Swedish  COVID -19 Data Portal  provides informatio n, guidelines, tools and services, to support researchers to use  Swedish and European infrastructures for data sharing.   Various AI -enabled technologies such as virtual assistants and chatbots  have been launched to help  governments and healthcare organisat ions provide people with reliable information about COVID -19.  Examples of these AI solutions include the Czech Republic’s chatbot , Estonia’s chatbot Suve, Lithuania’s AI powered virtual assistant ViLTė  and France’s virtual phone assistant AlloCOVID . All these AI -powered  solutions have the objective to provide accurate and trustworthy information about the emerging situation  related to COVID -19.   Finally, countries offered their support in the field of high -performance computing  (HPC)  to help to find   treatment s for the novel coronavirus. In this respect, the EU -funded Exscalate4CoV ( E4C) project is a good  example o f how European supercomputers can be used to find new therapies for COVID -19. This project  consists of a coalition between public and private partners located across seven European countries (Belgium,  Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland). Participating pharmaceutical firms, research  institutions, and biological laboratories explo it the computing power of three HPC centres in Bologna, Italy;  Barcelona , Spain;  and Jülich , Germany .                                              50  See Sections 5.7.2 and 5.7.6 for more information about these initiatives.   51  See European Commission press release on new research projects  to address the COVID -19 pandemic.    52  Examples of winning projects proposing AI solutions and having their headquarter in EU Member States are the Italian aiLearning  and  Jobiri  projects (see Section 5.15.6) the Lithuanian Katana ML  project (see Section 5.17.6), the Luxembourg COVID19 Smart Screening  Tool (see Section 5.18.6), the Spanish PoCOVIDscreen  project (see Section 5.27.6), and the Greek SERS4SARS  project (see Section  (5.12.1). Many of these projects are conducted with the participation of other Member States.  
  19 5 Country reports   This section includes country r eports for all EU Member States, Norway and Switzerland. The country reports  provide an overview of the st atus and implementation of national AI strategies. It outlines ongoing and  planned policy initiatives to foster AI deployment in the economy and society.   Policy initiatives are presented across various policy areas including  human capital (i.e. educational   development), from the lab to the market (i.e. R&D and innovation, business and public sector development),  networking (i.e. collaboration and dissemination), regulation (i.e. ethical guidelines, legislation and  standardisation) and infrastructure (i.e. d ata and telecommunication infrastructure). The policy overview is  complemented with a dedicated section on AI policies related to the societal challenges  concerning  environment and COVID -19. This latter section presents national  initiatives that support  AI solutions to  address environmental sustainability  (in line with the European Green Deal) and to tackle the COVID -19  pandemic .   The last section of country reports relates to monitoring and future update as it highlight s 1) the public body  in charge of implementing and monitoring the AI strategy, 2) the time period covered by the strategy, and 3)  when updates may be expected.    
  20 5.1 Austria    In August 2017, the Ministry for Transport, Innovation and Technology established a Council on Robotics and  Artificial Intelligence . It consists of experts on robotics and AI from research  centres , academia  and industry  and it serves as an advisory board to provide recommendations about the current and future challenges and  opportunities of AI. The council has been commissioned to help the Ministry to develop its national AI  strategy.   The Austrian G overnment has been very active in shaping policy initiatives for the future of AI in Austri a. In  November 2018, the Council publi shed the  white paper , entitled Shaping the future of A ustria  with robotics  and a rtificial  intelligence , with policy recommendations on robotics and AI, covering policy areas related to  smart governance, smart innovation and smart regulations.  The Federal Ministry also highlights the use of AI  for evaluating judicial proceedings, as mentioned in its National e -justice strategy . In June 2019, the  Austrian  Governm ent issued  the policy report  Artificial intelligence m ission Austria 2030  (Austria, 2019) providing the  first steps towards an official strategy for AI.   Under the direction of the Federal Ministry for Climate A ction and Federal Ministry for Digitalisation the  Austrian AI strategy has been finalised  and is currentl y under political consultation.  It defines the framework  conditions for a prosperous, responsible and safe use of AI in all areas of life in accordance  with European  requirements for trustworthy AI. The objectives of the Austrian strategy are formulated in close coordination  and comprehensive agreement with the AI foundations, objectives and joint action of the European Union.  Key focus areas will includ e regulatory framework (ethics, legal), safety and  security of AI, defining  standards, AI infrastructure, data use and sharing, conditions for R&D&I, transfer and uptake of AI,  cooperation between education, research and business societal dialogue and crea ting awareness, and AI in  the public sector.   The AI strategy is expected to be released by the end of Q2 2021 .  5.1.1  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   Several initiatives are currently ongoing in Austria to support the use of AI in reaching the ambitious climate  and energy targets:    Contributing to the Mission Innovation ( MI) initiative, which regroups 20 countries and the European  Commission. This initiative su pports the development of clean energy technologies and identifies the  innovation needs, challenges and opportunities of clean energy in addressing the climate change. In  this endeavour, AI plays an important role as highlighted in the summary report of th e Mission  Innovation Austria Week Pre -Event on Artificial i ntelligence and 5G technologies in future i ntegrated  energy s ystems . Mission Innovation Austria is supported by the Federal Minister for Climate Action,  Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and Technology;    Strengthening  the Vienna Scientific Cluster 4 ( VSC-4), which is the most powerful supercomputer in  Austria. This high -performance computing facility is established and managed by a network of  several Austrian universities and it  enjoys considerable financial support from the Austrian Federal  Ministry of Edu cation, Science and Research ( BMBWF ). Among others, this supercomputer supports  research projects that forecast the impact of clim ate change using big data and machine learning  techniques.    The Austrian Federal Ministry for Climate Policy, Environment, Energy, Mobility, Innovation and  Technology ( BMK) is launching a call for proposals for AI in June 2021. The "AI for Green"  program me promotes research -intensive technologies in the field of AI. The fields of application  include both climate protection (mitigation) and adaptation to the consequences of climate change.   COVID -19 pandemic   To ens ure favourable conditions for the development of AI -enabled technologies that counter the COVID -19  pandemic, the Austrian G overnment strengthens support initiatives towards promising start -ups. These  support initiatives could significantly increase the proliferation of successful use -cases in which AI acts as a  key enabler to fight the COVID -19 outbreak, such as :   
  21  The Viennese start -up Prewave , a spin -off from the Vienna University of Technology, has created a  Coronavirus disruption m ap to monitor and prevent disruption of the supply chain caus ed by COVID 19. This map uses  AI to analyse vast amounts of data from news channels, social media and  industrial partners in more than 50 languages to provide a visual representation of interrupted  supply chains for c oronavirus hotspot areas. Specifically, this map depicts the effects of the  coronavirus pandemic on industrial supply chains, focussing on the hotspots that are important for  industrial manufacturing, including China, the USA, India and Eu ropean countries such as Austria,  Germany, Italy, Spain, France and the UK;    The Graz -based company KML Vision  launched a new and free image analysis application capable of  detecting COVID -19 cases from chest X -rays on their online platform IKOSA . The underlyi ng AI model  is based on an algorithm published by a Canadian research group from the University of Waterloo  and DarwinAI.  
  22 5.2 Belgium    The Belgian G overnment plans to release its national AI  strategy in the first quarter of 2021 . The objective of  the national AI strategy is to provide a strategic and operational action plan for the development of AI in  Belgium. It takes stock of the policy re port of the AI4BELGIUM  coalition and presents ongoing actions and  plans for the future along three strategic p illars and thematic priorities :   Creat ing a technological impact  by supporting high -quality expertise in AI and outlining a responsible  data strategy for AI;    Ensuring social and economic benefits by encouraging continuous skills development in AI, building a  robust and prosperous AI economy and optimising public services through AI;    Build ing appropriate conditions for the development of an ethical, resilient and secure society  through AI.   The transversal nature of AI and its pervasive impact on the Belgian economy and society at large, calls for a  multi -level gove rnance approach given the division of competenc ies in a federal state such as Belgium. To  take this into account, the Belgian AI strategy presents policy actions at federal and regional level,  distinguishing between measures for the Federal State, Flanders , the Walloon region, Brussels Capital and  those of the Wallonia -Brussels Federation.   In March 2019, the Flemish G overnment launched the Flemish action plan  to foster AI in Flanders. The  Flemish AI action p lan foresees an annual budget of EUR 32 million for its implementation , broken down as  follows: EUR 15 million dedicated to the implementation of AI within companies, EUR 12 million allocated to   basic  research, and EUR 5 million  to supporting measures  (training, ethical and legal aspects related to AI adoption, and outreach activities).  This funding is complemented with other policy instruments of both FWO  (funding for HEIs) and VLAIO (funding for enterprises). In 2020  FWO invested about  EUR 15 million and  VLAIO some EUR 45 million in AI related projects. The same amounts are expected for the following years.    In the Walloon region  the DigitalWallonia4.ai  programme  has the objective of accelerating the adoption of AI  in the region . This programme  is supported by the Digital Agency, Agoria, the ICT Cluster Infopole and the AI  Network.  Its official launch was celebrated on November 27, 2019 but the effective start too k place on July  1, 2019. The overall budget, which also includes industry 4.0 and the regional digital strategy "Digital  Wallonia", is EUR 18 million per year.  Since December 2020, the regional AI programme includes a research  project called " ARIAC by DigitalWallonia4.ai " launched in the framework of the TRAIL consortium, which brings  together universities and research centres in the Wallonia -Brussels Federation . The EUR 32 millio n project is  funded by the Walloon Region and  runs from 2021 to 2026.   Although the Brussels region does not have a dedicated action plan for AI, it launched a wide range of  initiatives in order to boost AI -related activities in Brussels. All these initiati ves have been recently listed on a  new website , in order to clarify the regional support offer for AI. This website includes information over all  the public and semi -public programmes, and more specif ically everything related to funding, training,  accelerations programmes, support services, the AI ecosystem and available data.   Besides, in the  last two years, the regional innovation funding body Innoviris  has been playing a major role in  the support of AI -related research and innovation effort, through a strong development of its support  programmes with a dedicated budget of EUR 22 million. Overall, the region has already invested around EUR  44 million in AI si nce 201 7.  The Belgian AI strategy draws up a com prehensive overview of AI actions  and support programmes at federal  level and in the various regional ecosystems. A summary of the national and regional AI policy initiatives  is  presented below across the mai n policy areas related to human capital, R&D and innovation, networking,  regulation and infrastructure.   5.2.1  Human capital   One of the key cornerstones for a successful deployment of an AI ecosystem is the access to human capital  in AI. Against this background, the Belgian strategy highlights the need to encourage continuous development   and maintenance of AI knowledge. The Belgian AI strategy aims to tackle this challenge at various fronts.   First, it foresees the reinforcement of human skills in AI at all educati on levels . This includes reforms  at primary, secondary and tertiary education levels to integrate AI -related courses and programmes in the  
  23 school curricula. It equally requires training and upskilling opportunities for teachers to teach AI -related  courses.  Second, various policies provide tailored incentives for lifelong learning and reskilling  at large  scale through massive open online course (MOOCs) and reskilling programmes to acquire the necessary  digital skills.   Flanders   In order to foster the developm ent of AI knowledge and s kills in Flanders, the Flemish G overnment supports  various policies to increase STEM and digital skills (including AI-related subjects ) at all education levels:    Stimulating AI in primary and secondary education through the Smart Education @ Schools   programme , and tools such as the EDUbo x on AI , the STEM academy  (with an overview of all STEM related activities outside school hours for students between 5 and 18 years), and STEM partnerships ;   The Flemish Agency for I nnovation and Entrepreneurship ( VLAIO ), in collaboration with the Flemish  Ministry of Education, aims to foster personalised learning methods  in digital skills in primary and  secondary education through projects as “School of the Future” and i-learn ;   Supporting the reform of Bachelors and Masters Programmes to include AI -related courses (a list of  academic  offers in  Flemish universities is available in the national AI strategy) ;   The Flemish G overnment has approved its  “Action plan DigiJump”, which is an ICT plan to support  schools in delivering qualitative digital education with attention for data literacy, data usage and AI.   In addition to education reforms, the Flemish G overnment also supports practical courses in STEM and AI related subjects in the context of lifelong learning, targeting the workforce and citizens in general:    The higher levels of secondary schools can call upon DataBuzz  and the VUB AI Experience centre  for  educational support on AI and robotics applications and demonstrations. The two expertise centres  on Data and Society and Media Literacy cooperated in creating open teaching modules on AI  that are  distributed via the educational portal Klascement (targeting schools);    Massive online courses: Already two  online course s on AI organised by Agoria  and a MOOC  from the  Flemish Employment and Vocational Training Service (VDAB)  to understand the basi cs of AI, to learn  about the business drivers for AI and to receive practical guidance on how to get started with AI  business opportunities;    The master course on Data Innovation  beyond the Hype  led by the Sirris Data and AI Competence  Lab ( EluciDATA Lab ), provides pragmatic and industry -oriented sessions and webinars on data -driven  innovation;    The AI Academy , an initiative set up by the Howest University of Applied Sciences ( Howest ) and the  Flemish employer’s organisation ( Voka), offering a series of seminars for entrepreneurs interested in  AI applications.   Overall, the Flemish action plan  for AI foresees the following investments to enhance continuous skills  developments in AI:    Fostering and developing strong digita l skills for students , doctoral candidates  and high profile  professionals via the Flemish AI Academy53 that collects, creates and distributes courses and  trainings on AI (EUR 1 000 000 per year);    Accelerati ng the cross -cutting implementation of digitalisation through targeted initiatives for the  coaching and guidance of schools and teachers (EUR 1 000 000 per year) ;   Improving  AI/digital skills competence building in the job/on the  floor (EUR 1 000 000 per ye ar).  The Wallonia -Brussels Federation   The growing importance of AI in society is reflected by its increased presence in education. More AI training  in  primary, secondary and tertiary education systems is fostered through the following actions in the Wallonia Brussels Federation:    Provision of state -of-the-art technology equipment to the primary and secondary schools of the  Wallonia -Brussels Federation through the Digital School  project;                                              53  Not to be confused with the AI Academy mentioned earlier.  
  24  Projects to raise pupils’ awareness of new technologies on a pedagogical platform ( E-class ), to  motivate pupils to acquire ICT skills ( ICT passport ), to organise conferences for school leaders and  teachers on emerging trends and changes in education ( #edTechforum ) and to provide initiation  courses on coding for pupils and computer science courses for teachers ( Wallcode );   The Wallonia Wonder Women  camp aign foster s the participation  of girls in science and technology   fields ;   University Masters and Bachelors tracks containing AI -related courses (a list of academic offers in  Walloon  and Brussels’ universities is available in the national AI strategy) .  The Brussels -Capital R egion   The Brussels -Capital Region is committed to raising awareness among students and promoting the choice to  engage in a STEM discipline, through various initiatives:    STEM Projects , a programme granting subsidies to entities (companies, non -profit organisations,  research centres) promoting STEM. 80 to 90 projects are thus taken up annually, receiving a subsidy  ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 euros;    Brussels Science Promotion Network , a networking programme for actors active in the field of  science promotion;    STEM Project Call , a funding programme for STEM micro -projects . In 2021, the theme of the project  call is "Science for Climate ";   The yearly election of a Science Ambassador  to promote science and technology to women ;   The yearly edition of the  I Love Science Festival , which consists of three days of experiments, labs,  activities, conferences, works hops and exhibitions .54  Following policy actions are ongoing  to equip the current and future workforce with digital and AI -related  skills in the Brussels -Capital  Region :   IT training and awareness raising by mapping  the various ICT courses available mainly for  jobseekers and students in the Brussels Region;    The establishment of Digitalcity.brussels , as part of Brussels  Next Tech plan , to improve the quality  and availability of ICT training  in Brussels region, among oth ers;   Supporting initiatives that provide digital and AI -related courses and training for the workforce and  job seekers, such as the technology hub MolenGeek , the BeCode  training programme in AI , and  Numeria  providing a complete training programme for business, project or develop er profiles with 4  skill levels .  The Wallonia -Brussels Federation  (WBF), Walloon region and Br ussels -Capital region aim  to further   strengthen collaboration s in education in the future as stated in WBF’s Declaration of community p olicy  2019 -2024  and the General p olicy statement 2019 -2024  of the Walloon G overnment.   5.2.2  From the lab to the market   The Belgian AI strategy contains a myriad of policy initiatives to spur research and innovations in AI . The  objective is to support businesses in their innovative process in bringing AI applications to the market and to  create a competitive enterprise -driven AI ecosystem . At the federal level, research and innovation are  stimulated through a series of tax incentives. This is achieved through favourable tax measures of R&D staff,  deduction of notional interests for companies, and tax credits among others. In  addition, the public service  responsible for programming science policy ( Belspo ) is funding a wide range of AI -related research projects.   Furthermore , the Belgian AI strategy calls for initiatives to stimulate the uptake of AI applic ations in the  public administration . Several federal public services (FPS) have introduced AI methodologies to increase  the efficiency and quality of their services. FPS BOSA  has also a number of ongoing initiatives concerning the  development of AI applications (e.g. the use of AI for a chatbot pilot and for the audit of the accessibility of  websites).   These federal measures are complemented with ongoing and planned policy actions at regional level.                                                54  The 2020 edition could not take place due to the sanitary restrictions caused by the COVID -19 pandemic.  
  25 Flanders   To strengthen cutting -edge strategic  research on AI in Flanders, the Flemish Government approved the  implementation of the AI research programme  in June 2019.  This programme is the first pillar  of the Flemish  action plan  to foster AI in Flanders. With an annua l budget of EUR 12 million, the AI Research P rogramme   supports  demand -driven  applied research in Flanders in the field of AI and addresses four strategic  challenges:    Help to make complex decisions through data science: hybrid, automated, trusted, and actio nable;    Deliver AI to the edge: real -time & power efficient AI;   Interact autonomously with other decision -making entities: multi -agent collaborative AI;   Communicate and collaborate seamlessly with humans: human like AI.  Roadmaps have been  developed for each  challenge , including feasibility milestones. The research programme  is adapted each year to meet future research needs.   The research agenda for AI in Flanders is supported by a wide range of academic institutions, research  laboratories, associations and governmental institutions such as the federal employer’s organisation ( Agoria ),  the Flemish Department of Economy, Science and Innovation ( Ewi), the Flemish research foundation ( FWO),  the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre  (Imec), the collaborative research centre for Belgian technology  industry ( Sirris ), the Flemish Agency for Innovation and Entrepreneurship ( VLAIO ), and the Flemish employer’s  organisatio n (Voka).  Financial support of the Flemish AI research programme is complemented with funding available through the  regular, bottom -up instruments of both FWO (funding for HEIs) and VLAIO  (funding for enterprises). T hanks to  these regular instruments, in 2020 FWO invested about EUR 15 million and VLAIO some  EUR 45 million in AI  related projects.   Lastly, cutting -edge research in AI is further  supported through the establishment of the VUB AI experience  centre  and initiatives for public -private partnerships between research, industry and public authorities such as   the City of Things  project o n smart cities in Antwerp.   A second part of the Flemish AI policy plan  focuses on the implementation of AI in the Flemish business  community and support for AI innovations . Under this implementation component, VLAIO is designated as  a driving force. With an annual budget of EUR 15 million,  different types of actions with the following  objectives are put forward:    To raise awareness, to inform and to adv ise companies about the possibilities of AI ;   To guide and support com panies in their AI applications;    To support companies developing AI technology .  The Flemish AI policy plan also draw particular attention on the development of AI for the healthcare  secto r. In line with the Flemish policy plan for 2019 -2024 and the framework of Flanders Care , a specific  focus is given to support new cooperation models between the public health care sector and the industry.   Agoria has recently launched an AI-MOOC for the health sector .  Finally, to further promote AI innovation s, Flanders support s the development of test environments. To this  purpose, the Sandbox Vlaanderen  initiative has been launched to provide companies a safe environment to  test and validate new products and technologies . Although this initiative is not specifically targeting AI,  it is bene ficial to AI start -ups and SMEs that search for testing, piloting and experimentation infrastructure.   With respect to the uptake and stimulation of AI in public administration , the Flemish region foresees  the following initiatives:    The courses and training  offerings of the FAIA (see elsewhere) can also be attended by civil servants ;   Innovative Public Procurement programme: this programme  is an initiative of the Flemish  Government and is managed by the Flemish Department of Economy, Science and Innovation ( Ewi).  It enables different public services to launch innovative AI projects, among others. The public  services which form part of this programme are entitled to fifty percent co -financing for the  implementation of their projects.   The national AI strategy  document  also provides a comprehensive overview of existing and planned AI  applications in public services.  
  26 The Walloon R egion   As part of the DigitalWallonia4.ai  programme  to accelerate the adoption of AI in Wallonia, two action plans  have been launched to foster the development of AI innovations  in Walloon businesses:    Start AI  programme: the objective is to support companies in their discovery of AI, through a 3 -day  coaching by one of  the members of the AI expert pool of Digital Wallonia. The AI expert helps  businesses to identify opportunities through AI, measure their return on investment and  define an  action plan for the implementation of AI. 4 calls for "Start AI" projects have bee n launched since the  launch of the programme. More than 60 companies have been supported by the Experts of the  DigitalWallonia4.ai AI Expert Pool;    Tremplin AI  programme: thi s initiative intends to support promising proof of concepts (PoCs) on AI in  the Walloon Region. Currently, the programme supports 19 PoCs submitted by individual firms and 8  PoCs involving a collaborative consortium of firms. More PoCs ma y be supported in the future,  potentially with in sectoral themes;    Cap AI  programme: launched in April 2021, this programme aims to support companies in bringing  their AI solution to market with the help of a strategic expert.   In order to further support Walloon digital start -ups, the Digital Wallonia programme  established the Wallonia  Innovation and Growth ( W.I.N.G ) fun d. Launched in 2016, more than 60 start -ups were already eligible for  funding totalling around EUR 7 million of financial support.   Several subsidies, and financial grants to companies have been simplified and brought together in the form  of a business voucher . Launched in 2017, this business support system helps to speed up, and simplify the  access to financial support. In total, over EUR 2 million of funding has already been allocated in the form of  vouchers for almost 400 companies.   With respect to the uptake and stimulation of AI in public administration , the Walloon region foresees  the following initiatives:    Establishment of a Chief Information Officer  (CIO): A CIO team was established in 2019 for a three  year period to develop an integrated digital strategy for the Walloon Public Services, focusing on  building innovative and inclusive digital governance;    As part of the D igital Wallonia strategy, the Smart Region  project aims to propose a new model of  governance for Walloon cities in order to transform them into Smart Cities. The idea is therefore to  rethink the experience of public administration offered to citizens. A budget of EUR 4 million was  allocated to t he Smart Region project in 2019;    As part of the DigitalWa llonia4.ai programme, a study on  the impact of AI in the public sector  has  been funded. In addition, a Start AI programme  dedicated solely to public organisations was  developed.   Lastly , Wallonia is making its mark with an ambitious research initiative called Trusted AI Labs ( TRAIL )  launched with the help of Digital Wallonia, among others . TRAIL is a consortium bringing together the  universities and research centres of the Wallonia -Brussels Federation.  TRAIL is partly materialised through  the TRAIL Factory  marketplace , which represents a platf orm for hosting technological bricks developed by  research in Wallonia for the Walloon and international ecosystem. The platform is currently under  development.    Within the framework of TRAIL, a first research project was formalised in December 2020. This  project is  called " ARIAC by DigitalWallonia4.ai " and is based on an agreement between the Walloon Region - including a  major involvement of the  Public Service of Wallonia on Economy, Employment and Research  (SPW-EER) - and  the actors of the TRAIL consortium. This re search project has a budg et of EUR 32 million spread between  2021 and 2026. In particular, it aims to finance 50 PhDs  in 4 technological orientations seen as strategic for  the Region: Human and AI, Trusted AI, AI -models hybrid isation and Embedded AI.   The B russels -Capital Region   In the last two years, the regional innovation funding body Innoviris  has been playing a major role in the  support of AI -related research and innovation efforts in Brussels . Back in 2018, I nnoviris launched for  instance the Anticipate  programme  to support projects implemented by academic researchers who have a  forward -looking vision in the field of AI.  Financial  and operational  support for applied research in AI  is  achieved through a strong development of policy  programmes  of Innoviris , such as:  
  27  The R&D Project : a financial support instrument made available by Innoviris to companies wishing to  implement an innovative R&D project;    The Joint R&D Project : a funding programme to foster collaboration between academia and the  industry. In 202 0, the theme of the programme was  ‘The Industry of Tomorrow: Green,  Human &  Smart”, referring in particular to AI;    International projects set -up: a funding programme to help companies in preparing submissions for  European R&D programmes (e.g. Horizon 20 20, Horizon Europe );   Eureka clusters : Innoviris offers support to companies interested in joining the European network  Eureka Clusters, which brings together a multitude of companies with a common objective: to invest  together in the development of new technologies in sectors that are strategic for European  competitiveness, such as AI.   From an  industrially focused approach, Innoviris has a wide range of initiatives to foster innovation in AI ,  such as:   Innovation vouchers : a maximum of EUR 10,000 in financial aid offered by Innoviris for limited  technical support in a research centre. This initiative mainly targets start -ups and SMEs and echoes  the Start AI  programme  of Digital Wallonia;    In addition to the various R&D programmes  mentioned above, Innoviris funds AI and d ata related  projects for more than EUR 6 mil lion subsidy per year (equivalent to a quarter of its budget  dedicated to industrial support) through its open call s dedicated to comp anies;    Financial support for start -ups (not specifically targeting AI) through initiatives on seed capital  funding ( Bruseed ), business concepts ( proof of business ), and incubation  and coaching  services  (ICAB);   As part of Brussels Next Tech plan  for the period 2017 -2020, the Brussels Capital region has  supported various AI -related projects involving companies, resea rch centres and academic  institutions.   While the approach so far was meant to be cross -sectorial, Innoviris is now engaged in a more speciali sed  track with for example an ongoing call dedicated to predictive medicine and an upcoming call dedicated to  Indus try 4.0.   The SPW -EER also offers funding programmes dedicated to research. Numerous actions are regularly  published  and address a wide range of research fields, including digital and AI:    Win2Wal : support research projects with a high potential of valorisation in themes linked to  identi fied strategic industrial needs;    BelCOO : Innovate in collaboration with companies in Flanders, Wallonia and/or Brussels and work on  a transregional research or development project.   Finally, with a view to achieving greater gender eq uality, the Brussels Capital G overnment intends to promote  women’s entrepreneurship in digital and technology oriented fields. Initiatives such as Women in Tech  aim to  empower women in the entrepreneurial e cosystem.   5.2.3  Networking   A wide range of policy initiatives have been deployed at national and regional level to encourage networking,  raise the international attractiveness and increase awareness on AI.   National and regional governments have appointed National Contact Points ( NCPs ) to provide advice and  coaching to the business com munity, which can enhance collaborative efforts and awareness on AI. NCPs are  helped by a large network of experts in various domains. Among others, NCPs disseminate information to  potential candidates about European research programmes and share good practices with business actors.   Also t he DigiCoach  initiative reinforces this awareness thanks to inter alia events, media, articles and  personalised recommendations to companies.   Flanders   To increase cooper ation among businesses, public administrat ions and citizens, the Flemish G overnment has  set up the following initiatives:  
  28  The Beacon  initiative: an innovation community, bringing together tech companies, research, skil ls,  innovation actors and citizens to collaborate on smart solutio ns for keeping the  world liveable  and  sustainable. It focuses on the key AI & IoT innovation domains of smart city, mobility, logistics and  industry;    ICON  projects: funding for interdisciplinary research projects involving the cooperation of one or  more research organisation s and at least three industrial par tners from Flanders. This funding  initiative is not specifically targeting AI -related projects, but has a broader perspective;    Projects for Collective Research & Development and Collective Knowledge Dissemination ( COOCK   and TETRA ): funding  for research organisations  focusing  on AI -challenges that apply  to a large group  of companies , with the aim of accelerating the introduction of AI;    The Imec.start  programme : an initiative that supports start -ups to develop their business idea. Start ups participating in this initiative receive financial support and are entitle d to support. In addition, the  Imec facilities are also available to start -ups, which can make intensive use of the ne twork of  partners and investors;    VLAIO  stimulates networking and thematic events about  AI through a network of  structural  partners ;   A citizen science programme (called AMAI ) has been set up. A dissemination campaign to stimulate  citizens send in challenges (in the domains of mobility, climate, work and/or health) on what they see  as important societal challenges  in their life where AI could help. The intention is that these  challenges will lead to the selection of 4 projects to be implemented in 2022 by consortia of  research groups, SMEs and citizens. The total programme has a total cost of EUR 1 million spanning   over 2 years of which the 4 projects take up EUR 300, 000 ( i.e. EUR 75,000 per project). The selected  projects will start  at begin ning of  2022.    The Digihubs: initiatives to coach and advise SMEs  within their transition towards data -driven  organisations and the introduction of new digital technologies (including AI);   The Walloon R egion   Within the framework of  Digital Wallonia, the Walloon G overnment has launched various policies to increase  networ king among public and private actors:    Industry of the future  programme : this initiative organised in a consortium promotes and supports  manufacturing companies i n their digital transformation towards Industry 4.0. The consortium brings  together Walloon poles of excellence, sectoral federations, and research centres;    The Digital Wall onia International  project, which aims to increase the visibility and presence of the  Walloon digital sector at international level.  In collaboration with  Wallonia Export -Investment Agency  (AWEX ), Digital Wallonia  offers a programme  of international missions and sets up a network of  international hubs to support Walloon companies in their international development;    Digital Wallonia Champions  are ambassadors of the Digital Wallonia strategy . Their mission is to  promote  the digital  transformation in Wallonia , and to disseminate the actions of Digital Wallonia.   Launched  in 2017, the programme has more than 200  champions at present .  The Brussels -Capital R egion   Various policies have also been deployed in the Brussels Capital region to improve knowledge transfers and  fully benefit from a network of relevant stakeho lders in the field of AI:    Hub.Brussels  initiative:  Hub.Brussels is the competent body in the Brussels Region for the provision  of intelligence and business support, where Finance &Invest .brussels  and Innoviris  are responsible for  financing innovative projects (including AI). The objective of this initiative is to  put their network of  experts at disposal of businesses to  advice and support them  in their start -up and development  phase, including internationalisation. The AI companies supported so far were active in the  healthcare and software sector ;   Icity.brussels  initiative:  funded by the European Regional Development Fund ( ERDF ) and Innoviris and  as a joint initiative of ULB, VUB and Sirris . It is devoted to strengthening Research and Innovation in  Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Brussels. It has already launched R&D ICT  projects in several key domains like education, e -Health, mobility, Internet of Things and 5G.   Finally, the Joint R&D project  aims to foster collaboration between academia and industry. This programme  is  a reflection of the Brussels region approach to AI development, which puts a great emphasis on collaborative  research and open innovation.  
  29 5.2.4  Regulation   The Belgian AI strategy emphasise s the need to ensure a reliable , safe and trustworthy AI development  by  establishing a legal and regulatory framework  that encourages innovation while respecting the  fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens.   With resp ect to regulation, the Belgian G overnment adopted a Royal decree on t ests with automated vehicles   In March 2018. It paves the way for the development of fully autonomous vehicles, as it allows the use of  automated vehicles on the road for testing purposes and under restricted conditions.   Flanders   The third pillar of the Flemish action plan , with a dedicated budget of EUR 5 million, is targeting support  activities on awareness, training and ethics. This pillar includes among others the launch of the Knowledge  Centre Data & Society , which focuses on the interplay between data, AI and society. The Centre enables  socially r esponsible, ethical and legal implementations of AI in Flanders. It is funded by the Flemish  Department on Economy, Science and Innovation  and is managed by a consortium of three organisations:  imec-SMIT (Vrije Universiteit Brussel) , imec-MICT (Ghent University) , the Centre for IT & IP Law (KU Leuven)   and the Flemish G overnment.   The Walloon and Brussels -Capital Region   Policy mak ers of the Walloon and Brussels -Capital R egion recognise the importance to develop AI  applications in line with appropriate ethical and legal frameworks, and compliant  with n ational and  international laws. Policy efforts to create a regulatory ecosystem for AI are ongoing.   5.2.5  Infrastructure   Data is an essential prerequisite for the use of AI. Hence, the Belgian AI strategy recognises the importance  of facilitating access to data  and making it available for citizens, businesses, public authorities and  researchers.   At Federal level, following policies have been deployed to facilitate free access to data and to support data  sharing and processing:    The open data portal Data.gov.be  provides access to 15,000 datasets across various categories such  as education, energy,  environment, health, transport and public sector. The portal also provides an  overview of the tools available to support the processing and sharing of data;    Statbel , the statistical institute of Belgium, provides  free access to a  hundred datasets, which can be  used for commercial and non -commercial purposes.   Flanders   To facilitate the access to high-quality data, the Flemish G overnment has set up the following initiatives:    The Kruispuntbank.Vlaanderen  programme to promote the Flemish G overnment data ecosystem. The  objective of this programme is to make da ta accessible through APIs, to ensure high -quality  standards, and data integrity;    The Semantics@YourFingertips  project, launched under the Innovative Public Procure ment  Programme (IPO), has the objective to effectively re -use the information contained in the decisions  of the local authorities through linked data. The re-use of structured data for administrative and  political purposes will be greatly simplified and wi ll improve efficiency of  operations ;   The LBLOD  initiative aims at linking and making available local data and information (such as policy  for parking lots in a city , opening hours of a public swimming pool etc.). The linked data complies  with the OSLO standard (open standard for linking organisations - data.vlaanderen.be ).  In addition, the steering group for Information and ICT policy approved in February 2020 the Flemish action  plan Open data 2020 -2024  to increase the availability and use of Flemish open data. The Flemish  Government has also expressed its intention to create a Flemish data u tility company  that should act as a  third thrusted party and can create vertical data sharing within industry sectors as well empower citizens  with more ownership over their personal data.    
  30 The Walloon R egion   In order to st imulate open data, the Walloon G overnment and the Wallonia -Brussels Federation (WBF) have  launched the platform opendata.digitalwallonia.be . The ambition of this portal is to promote the access to  data from public services at regional, prov incial and municipal level in order to be re -used by other  administrations, businesses and citizens.   The Brussels -Capital R egion   The Brussels G overnment has launched several open data portals to promote data sharing and data analysis:    The datastore.brussels  platform, undertaken by the Brussels Regional Informatics Centre ( BRIC), is  the regional platform for opening up and sharing data and services in the Brussels -Capital Region;    The opendata.brussels  portal is the open data initiative of the City of Brussels;    To improve the quality of health care, the Brusafe+  initiative allows sharing of patient data among  health professionals while ensuring data protection of citizens;    The platform analytics.bru  ssels  has been created  to collect business -related data and to analyse the  business ecosystem development in Brussels.   5.2.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The Belgian Ministers of Digital Agenda highlight in the AI4 Belgium  policy report that AI is an important  driver to support solutions for the climate change. AI should be considered as an ally against climate change.  In this respec t, AI needs to be developed and deployed so it can meet society’s needs and protect the  environment by saving more energy than it expends. Several initiatives are ongoing  or have been recently  conducted in Belgium  to take advantage of the untapped potentia l of AI in order  to reach the  ambitious  climate targets. At the time being most of these initiatives are concentrated at local and regional level. To  increase their impact, such initiatives could  be scaled up at national level:    The Smart Education @ Schools  programme from the Flemish G overnment, coordinated by Imec and  KU Leuven  and promoting  the use of smart educational technologies. One of the supported projects  in this programme is the “Artificial i ntelligence, climate change, st omata project ” (KIKS project ). This  project encompasses online courses directed to the secondary education in Flemish schools in which  the benefits of AI techniques are explained to fight the current climate change;    The Joint R&D Project : a funding programme launched by Innoviris which aims to foster  collaboration between academia and the industry. In 2020, the theme of the programme is ‘The  Industry of Tomorrow: Green, Human & Smart”. The programme contribute s to enrich the Brussels  Region -based  industries with new modes of production: smarter (including AI) and more efficient, but  also more respectful of the environment and its workers;    At the end of 2020, the Flemish G overnment launched the Circula r Manufacturing Initiative. Using a  quadruple helix concept, an agenda will be developed to support the circularity of manufacturing.  Digitisation and the use of data and AI will be a crucial lever for a greener production;    “Energy -efficient AI systems ” is one of the four main research themes in th e Flanders AI Research  Progra mme . Also Imec works on an integrated approach  that combines innovations in data usage,  hardware and software. Lastly, t wo use cases in the Flanders AI Res earch Program me for the ener gy  sector  focus on : (i) improving  the prognostic health management  and production of energy in wind  turbine parks  (ii) decision support for smart energy distribution in low voltage grids ;   The Brussels Smart City  initiative highlights the environmental transition for a green and sustainable  city among its main axes and identifies an important role for AI in this respect. This will be achieved  by developing  a solid data infrastructure and a smart grid network that could be exploited with AI  tools, guaranteeing a smo oth transition towards green IT;    In March 2021 , two universities located in Brussels (ULB and VUB)  launched  the FARI Institute  - AI  for Common Good. FARI is a unique structure that aims to bring together more than 300 researchers  in AI and related disciplines, around projects that can benefit society . The institute will promote  research on reliable  and transparent  AI. It will also aim to help the Brussels -Capital Region to tackle  social and environmental  challenges. FARI researchers will contribute to projects on transport,  sustainable development, health services, c itizen  consultations on AI and algorithms. The projects  will actively engage citizens and boost  awareness  about A I and its impacts in the region;  
  31  The DigitalWallonia4.ai  programmes stimulate and strengthen  initiatives of W alloon companies in  the field of the climate change, the circular economy, and the European Green  Deal. In the future,  the Start AI and Springboards  programmes could be developed for specific sectoral theme s to  encourage  companies to take steps in these  areas. A good example includes for instance  the  selected proof of concepts of the  Tremplin AI  programme,  in which  the IA4GIS project proposes the  use of AI technologies for satellite and aerial image analyses. Machine learning and deep learning  tools are used to  automatically detect changes and abnormalities in treated images, which can be  helpful to observe environmenta l changes due to the climate change.   COVID -19 pandemic   Several successful Belgian use -cases provide insightful examples on how AI-enhance robots and digital  tools are used to combat COVID -19 outbreak. Only a selection is included below:    Belgian hospitals and shops  are employing robots that speak more than 53 languages , which are  used to detect if people are  having fever and to control whether they are wearing their face masks  properly.  These robots can for instance steer individuals with signs of fever to a separate area. This  way, they have an important role in pre-screening the many  visitors  of hospitals during the  pandemic ;   Belgian hospitals are participating in a collaborative project on Imaging COVID -19 AI. The objective  of this project is to enhance computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID -19 by using AI.  The project team creates  a deep learning model for automated detection and classification of  COVID -19 on CT scans, and for assessing disease severity in patients by qua ntification of lung  involvement;    The Flemish foreign trade agency Flanders Invest & Trade  mentions  the use of AI by a  Flemish  company Robovision  to analyse CT scans automatically in order to guide radiologist s toward s a  faster diagnosis;    IcoMetrix  has developed IcoLung, with support of the Flemish AI Plan and European Funding (from  the H2020 project icovid ). This application is currently  used by m ore than 800 hospitals in Europe on  a daily basis to process CT images  and to decreas e the workload in clinical practice . It provid es a  fully automated assessment of the total and lobular disease burden  by offering fast and objective  quantificati on of lung pathology on chest CT scan s in admitted COVID -19 patients;    Single-cell transcriptomics data for CO VID-19 patients was generated: a  pipeline for scalable  preprocessing of single -cell transcriptomics was implemented, and run on the Flemis h  Superco mputer infrastructure.  This data is made publicly available  within the framework of a CZI  COVID -19 Atlas project;    CrowdScan provides a wireless crowd density system t hat predicts size and density of large crowds  to monitor the cap acity in terms of humans per m²;    A Global Data Sharing Initiative  was built together with se veral researchers from the Flemish AI  Research Program me to host the health data of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) patients from more than 80  countries. These data were collected and analysed to adjust the COVID -19 advice for people with MS  based on data -driven i nsights. This medical advice is now available  in 14 different languages across  the globe.   5.2.7  Monitoring and future update   The Federal Government and competent entities at regional level will evaluate the national AI strategy on a  regular basis and update it w here needed.  
  32 5.3 Bulgaria    The Bulgarian G overnment published its National AI strategy  (Bulgaria, 2020) in December 2020. The s trategy  has been based on a framework  established by s cientists of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences ( BAS) and  finali sed by experts of th e Ministry of Transport, Information Technology and Communications (MTITC) after a  public consultation with the state institutions and interested stakeholders.  A version in English has been   released on the p ortal of the Council of Ministers with the title Concept for the development of artificial  intelligence in Bulgaria until 2030 .  The Bulgarian AI strategy  presents policy initiatives for the development of AI in Bulgaria for the period 2020 2030. It offers a comprehensive policy vision for the development  and use of AI in Bulgaria and identifies  main areas of impact such as infrastructure and data availability, research an d innovation capacity,  knowledge  and skills,  and building trust in society .

  33 5.3.2  From the lab to the market   Policy initiatives to spur research excellence are present ed in the  recently updated National research s trategy  2017 -2030 , the National roadmap for s cientific i nfrastructure and the funding schemes of the National  scientific programmes .   In addition, Bulgaria’s national AI strategy  highlights the following activities to foster  research capacities in  the field of AI :   Creating  a Bulgarian AI  Research  Centre of Excellence to bring together scientific organisations and  higher education institutions with proven excellence in AI research . Research will focus on the fields  of neural n etworks, machine learning, natural language processing, seman tic technologies, robotics ;   Stimulating research in priority areas and providing growing opportunities to experienced AI  scientists;    Expand ing and enrich ing the activities of the Bulgarian Assoc iation of Artificial Intelligence ( BAIA).  To foster innovation, the Ministry of Economy ( MoE) recently launched  Bulgaria's strategy for the fourth  industrial r evolution . It aims to  support the integration of intelligent production systems and processes  in the  economy . This includes  AI-based pr oducts and services that are enabled through a cutting -edge  communication and data infrastructure.   Additional policies to  develop innovation  and testing  capacity in AI  in Bulgaria encompass:    Establishing  at least one Digital Innovation Hub specialised in AI;   Creating Living Labs and virtual information centres for companies, in particular SMEs, to learn about  success stories of AI products and services;    Expanding  financial mechanisms to support the  deployment of AI solutions in industry and services,  in particular for SMEs;    Financing innovation laboratories at company level to test new AI technologies and business models  in practice;    Stimulating  innovation capacity in public research organisations an d higher education institutions.   Bulgaria’s national AI strategy pr esents several priority sectors . The choice  of these sectors for the next 3 to  5 years was based on their  readiness  to use and develop AI . Among the thematic areas, it highlights smart  agriculture, health care and the public administration.   Smart agriculture   In May 2019, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry ( MZH) released its Strategy for the digitisation of  agriculture and r ural areas, which includes m easures related to AI and block chain for the agriculture sector.  The strategy supports  the introduction of  computer technologies  in the production of agricultural products,  including the use of AI to carry out controls on production, to protect plants against harmful organisms and to  reduce administrative burdens for farmers.  To further strengthen smart agriculture  in Bulgaria, fol lowing  initiatives are foreseen:    Setting up an intelligent  AI-related  system for information management to support  more efficient,  environmentally -friendly and ecological farming;    Establishing  a monitoring system based on AI technologies and satellite i magery to improve  forecasting, extraction and produ ction of agricultural resources.   Health  care  The e -health and in general, the transformation of the digital health sector are among the main priorities of  the National Digital Transformation Strategy for 2020 -2030. It aims at ensuring the digital transformation in  the health sector based on three technology pillars: cloud solutions, wireless networks (4G/5G) and enhanced  deployment of high -speed fiber optics  networks . The national AI strategy mentions the plan  to set up a  National Health Information System, including a national system for citizens’ electronic health records, and  electronic referrals.  The aim is to improve the interoperability of health systems and to facilitate the exchange  of health data at na tional and international level.  In this regard, towards the end of 2020, electronic health  records and electronic prescriptions have been successfully launched in Bulgaria.      
  34 Public sector   An updated strategy  on the development of e -government in the Republic of Bulgaria 2019 -2023 has been   adopted  in 2019 , together with an updated roadmap of measures for its implementation. The update ensures  the implementation of the European e -governance principles put in place at national level.  Among others, it  includes the development of information technology to improve the interaction between  public  administrations . The Bulgaria n open data portal further improves efficiency by enabling data sharing and re use in the public sector.   5.3.3  Networking   The national AI strategy of Bulgaria emphasise s the need to strengthen research and innovation capacities  and the uptake of AI techn ologies by means of active collaborations  between research institutions and  industry at national and international level. This is achieved through:    Promoting cooperation spaces between r esearchers and AI professionals and encouraging the  creation of collab orative networks in AI between universities, vocational schools and companies;    Supporting the participation in  European AI and digitalisation n etworks, such as CLAIRE  and CLARIN  &  DARIAH  initiatives ;   Participating  in European testing and experimentation centres related to health, robotics and  agriculture.   In addition, the Bulgarian AI strategy foresees policies to  raise both citizens’ awareness on  the benefits  and  risks of AI (e.g. the malicious use of AI for mass impact, manipulation and disinformation ). Following policies  are planned to improve the public  dialogue and to build trust  in AI:   Ensuring visibility of the AI applications de veloped in AI Research Centre of Excellence and presenting  the expected benefits for society;    Exploiting social media channels and events to raise awareness on AI and to share successful  examples of AI applications and companies;    Organising AI competitions  and h ackathons for students to raise their knowledge and experience in  working with AI systems.   5.3.4  Regulation   The Bulgarian G overnment commits to establish a regulatory basis for the development and use of  trustworthy AI in line with international regulatory  and ethical standards. The principles of respect for  fundamental rights, non -discrimination and the protection of personal data should be seen as an integral part  of the regulatory framework that ensure the safety of AI technologies.  To this purpose, the following policies  are proposed:    Establish ing a national framework to assess the  impact and  risks associated with the development of  AI technologies.  The aim of the framework is to enable a comprehensive overview of the legal and  ethical aspects of AI tech nologies;    Creat ing a toolkit to stimulate the adoption of safety and legal responsibility principles among actors  involved in the development, deployment and use of AI technologies.  The toolbox will include a  combination of procedures and flexible approach es that promote informed judgement in decision making processes.   5.3.5  Infrastructure   Bulgaria’s national AI strategy highlights the need to invest in infrastructure for  delivering high performance  computing, secure data collection, storage and processing, 5G connectivity and next -generation software to  support the development and deployment of AI.  This requires investment in the construction and maintenance  of computing infrastructure, communications and service software, as well as the accumulation of big data.   Bulgaria is already setting up a modern ICT computing infrastructure and is planning both the further  development of the 5G network and the provision of data unde r the Digital Europe Programme 2021 -2027.  In  particular, following policy initiatives are foreseen:    Establishing platforms to ensure access to and sharing of company data, enabling real -time data  transmission in priority sectors such as  smart agriculture a nd e-health;  
  35  Integrating scalable high performance computing infrastructure in the national AI Research Centre of  Excellence;    Setting up clusters of experts in priority areas (such as health and agriculture) to set up   standardisation approaches and to ensu re interoperability and compliance to  FAIR principles . These  measures should be integrated in the national Open data p ortal;   Establishing guidelines  for anonymis ation  and pseudonymisation of personal data for the purpo se of  sharing health data, with clear rules on transparency, governance and privacy protection.   The need to improve existing infrastructure by ensuring wide deployment and use of high capacity networks is  also presented in the policy report on Digital t ransformation of Bulgaria for the period 2020 -2030 , adopted in  July 2020. The strategy report states that improving connectivity w ill enable the development of innovative  business models in many sectors such as research, industry, digital and remote health, security, logistics,  autonomous and connected vehicles, digital governance and digital education, as well as the development of  smart cities.   Finally, to achieve a  safe and secure cyberspace for the development of socie ty and industry, the Bulgarian  Government released the Cyber security s trategy . It provides a framework for the development of a national  cyber security plan to tackle  potential threats and attacks to autonomous and intelligent systems.   5.3.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   In January 2020 , the Bulgarian G overnme nt released its Vision, obj ectives and priorities for the national  development p rogramme: Bulgaria 2030 . The policy report sets  out strategic objectives to accelerate   economic development and reducing inequalit ies. One of the development axes t o achieve the se strategic  objectives relates to a g reen and sustainable Bulgaria . Along the priority of ensuring a more sustainable  environment, digital connectivity is mentioned as a core component to support developments  in this field.   In addition,  the Bulgarian Strategic Centre for Artificial Intelligence ( SCIA) aims to support and develop  projects that use AI  to tackle the most difficult societal and business problems . According to its  mission  statements, its objective is  to solve humanity's biggest problems from terminal diseas es to climate change,  by using b ig data, machine l earning, and robotics. The centre has the following partners and stakeholders:  Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe ( PRACE ), SophiaLab , and the National Cent re for  Supercomputing Applications ( NCSA ).  COVID -19 pandemic   Since the COVID -19 outbreak, the use of AI has tremendously increased as an essential and effective tool to  observe and predict the evolution of the pandemic . At the same time, it also helps in the recovery phase.   Against this background, Sofia Investment Agency , and Innovative Sofia , have recently met with a number of  industry associations in participation with the Sofia Deputy Mayor for digitalis ation, Mr. Vladimir Danailov. The  objecti ve of the online meeting was to discuss potential actions on how to rebuild the business ecosystem  after the COVID -19 crisis. The proposed measures are outlined on the European Cluster Collaboration   platform. A mong others, Sofia -based companies dealing with big data, business intelligence, AI, telemedicine,  cybersecurity, automation and robotics of business processes, clinical trials and more, should be engaged in a  working group to develop a three - or five -year plan to implement working digital models for the healthcare  sector.   5.3.7  Monitoring and future update   AI policy making  is spread across various governmental institutions . Given the horizontal nature of the  activities, responsibilities are shared between the Ministry of Transport, Information Technology and  Communications (MTITC) and other administrations, including the Ministry of Education and Science, the  Ministry of Economy , the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy, the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Forestry,  the Ministry of Health, and the State Agency for e -Government, among others.   The coordination of Bulgaria’s national AI strategy implementation is under considerati on. To effectively and  continuously monitor the implementation of the AI strategy, an interdepartmental working group will set up a  roadmap outlining the policy measures, responsible institutions, expected results and monitoring indicators.     
  36 5.4 Croatia   The Croatian G overnment is currently working on its  national AI strategy . A working group consisting of  experts from academia, business, civil society and the public sector has been appointed to develop the AI  strategy.  The working group  has finalised a first draft of the National plan for the development of  artificial intelligence , including policy measures and actions for the period 2021 to 2025. A final version of  the strategy will be completed in 2021.   5.4.1  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   During the Croatian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and  Computer Science, University of Zagreb hosted a workshop on ESA - Croatia "Spac e technologi es for the green  plan and digital e conomy" . The workshop, organis ed by the European Space Agency (ESA) in collaboration with  the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb and the Ministry of Science and  Education was  meant to discuss the contribution of the space industry and technology to all key goals of the  EU Council Presidency. On this occasion, the  private and public sector experts from Croatia  learnt more  from leading European experts on how opportunities under  ESA since Earth Observation, have become key to  measuring progress towards goals for sustainable development and the Green Plan as one of the central  goals of the President of the European Commission. Europe's leadership in Earth Observation produces  an incredible wealth of data available for environmental monitoring and security in Europe . New  opportunities related to information technology, big data, AI and miniature satellites are available to the  benefit of environment.   On the 15th February 2020, a new  Installation Research Project entitled " Software sensor augmentation at  environmental data analysis l aboratory ” funded by the Croatian Science Founda tion started. This initiative   encompasses the follow ing partners: the University of Split; the Faculty of Science of the University of Zagreb;  the Faculty of Transport and Traffic Sciences of the St. Kliment Ohridski University; the Faculty of Technical  Sciences of Ericsson Nikola Tesla; and the R&D Institu te of Oceanography and Fisheries. The scientific goal of  the project is to employ machine learning models to ultimately reach a more efficient resource utilis ation with  positive effects on industry and environment.   COVID -19 pandemic   Croatia deployed a digital assistant called Andrija  that can be activated on WhatsApp and that guides people  towards diagnosing and managing suspected COVID -19 infections. This “virtual doctor” powered by AI was  developed by Croatian IT companies in cooperation with epidemiologists.      
  37 5.5 Cyprus   In January 2020 , the Council of Ministers has approved the National A I strategy  of Cyprus  (Cyprus, 2019 a). It  focus on the following priority areas:    Cultivating talent, skills and lifelong learning;    Increasing the compet itiveness of businesses through support initiatives towards research and  innovation and maximising opportunities for networking and partnerships;    Improving the quality of public services through the use of digital and AI -related applications;    Creating nati onal data areas;    Developing ethical and reliable AI.   5.5.1  Human capital   Concerning improvements to the  education in AI , the policy report mentions among others the creation  and  upgrade  of higher education programmes  in AI, the development of reskilling and upsk illing opportunities for  the labour force and an overall extension of societal knowledge i n the use and application of AI technologies.   Education reforms  will aim to support new technological skills, particularly in STEM subjects and will provide  support to teachers to improve their education methods.  Besides  improving  technological skills, the Cypriot   Government emphasises the importance of integrating so ft skills in students’ c urricula, such as interpersonal   communication and problem solving skills. At higher education levels, B achelors and Master programmes  will  be created in the field of AI in collaboration with the Higher Education Quality Assurance and Accreditation  Agency  of Cyprus.   To ensure that education programmes  are adapted to the rapidly changing needs of the labour market ,  the Cypriot  strategy recommends the creation of tailor -made program mes for further training and lifelong  learning for the workforce. The introduction of Massive Open Online courses (MOOCs) in AI will be considered  as an effective tool  to educate citizens in general. More flexible and  personalised trainings could target th e  working population and respond to the new labour market challenges. In this perspective the Cyprus Human  Resource Authority ( AnAD ) can provide inform ation and incentives to employers for upgrading the workforce   skills and competenc ies in digital and AI -related fields.   5.5.2  From the lab to the market   The Cypriot  Government devotes particular attention to policy actions fostering research and innovation,  including the creation of a Centre of Excellence for applied researc h in AI , and the formation of new  financi al support and funding schemes. The establishment  of a special Task Force for Researchers is also  considered to help the AI Expert Group in developing AI policies.   A vibrant start -up ecosystem in AI will be fostered  through the development of an  AI accelerator  programme , to support the  start-up and growth  of AI business ventures.  This programme  will provide  expertise in developing AI solutions, and will help firms accessing expert communities . Besides creating  opport unities to team up with other firms and research institutions, and facilitating the access to flexible  and effective financial funding , this programme  will also provide dedicated support to testing  and open  data environments  (including  regulatory sandboxes ). The growth of the AI start -up ecosystem will be  encouraged through national funding programmes  and state incentives, which will be complemented  with  European funding programmes  (e.g. Horizon2020).   The Cypriot  Government also commits to encourage the use of AI in the public administration by means of  automatic decision chains to accelerate administrative processes. Introducing more AI -related applications in  the public sector will increase transparency and foster citizens’ trust in the state and instituti ons.   5.5.3  Networking   Regarding networking, the Cypriot  strategy highlights the need to encourage partnerships with leading  internat ional organisations to increase the level of research and innovation in AI. This will be achieved by   setting up  new col laboration models. Among others, Digital Innovation Hubs  (DIH)  will be expanded and  meet ings will be organised with foreign countries to obtain guidance and good practices about successful AI  applications . These collaborative meetings will also aim to  assess how public -private partnerships  can be  improved in the future.   
  38 At national level, Cyprus has already established several DIHs such as the CYRIC Digital Innovation Hub , the  KIOS Innovation Hub , the Robotics Control and Decision Systems ( RCDS ) Lab at the University of Technology,  and the Entrepreneurship Centre  at the Cyprus University.  These DIHs are active in various market segments  (e.g. agriculture, health, construction, transport, manu facturing and energy) and in a wide range of  technological areas, including AI, big d ata, cloud computing and cybersecurity. The AI Expert Group considers  the creation of a (virtual) AI DIH with dedicated AI research programmes  that could serve as a platfo rm where  the scientific and business community could access and share knowledge.   To determine in which domains collaborations are most favourable, the AI Expert Group can make use of the  recently published Competitiveness r eport  of the Council of Economy and Competitiveness (Cyprus, 2019b).  This report provides a general overview of the structur e and performance o f the Cypriot  economy, highlighting  the comparative advantages, weaknesses and risks to the econ omy, including recommendations on how t o  address them .  The Cypriot  Government will increase the international visibility of the country  to attract AI experts from  abroad. To do so , the Cypriot  Government considers setting up mobility programmes  for experts between  research centres in Cyprus and abroad. In addition, the AI Expert Group recommends to create an  inventory of  researchers and e xperts in the field of AI in order to assess the country’s needs and areas in which to attract  foreign talents.    5.5.4  Regulation   The Cypriot  Government will develop a legislative framework  to ensure the availability of da ta with  transparent regulations, in particular on data protection. This legislative framework will take into account EU  directives on the free flow of data  and general data protection  and will facilitate  the interoperability of data.  To this purpose , it is important that the new legislative framework enables digital services to  use up -to-date  and high -quality inf ormation, while taking into account the protection of personal data.   With respect to ethics , the G overnment of Cyprus is currently developing guidelines to ensure ethically  sound and reliable developments in AI , i.e. by defining measures of transparency, r esponsibility, privacy ,  equality, diversity and safety  among others. The developed guidelines should preserve human rights and  social values. To coordinate the development of ethical guidelines , the Cypriot  strategy advocates the creation  of a National Committee on Ethical and Reliable AI . This Committee will continuously and systematically  monitor and analyse issues related to the use and development of AI technologies and  will provide  recommendations for legal and ethical reforms . To successfully condu ct this exercise, the Committee will take  into account the Ethics guidelines for trustworthy artificial i ntelligence  as prepared by the High -Level Expert  Group on AI.  Cyprus is also active in developing international standards for AI  to foster and facilitate industrial and  economic developments in this field. The Cyprus Organisation for Standardisation ( CYS), will establish  a  National Commission constituting of technical experts from the public and private sectors to monitor and  evaluate the work of International and European Committees on AI . It will also be responsible  to apply and  introduce  AI standards in all sectors of the Cypriot  economy.   5.5.5  Infrastructure   The Cypriot  Government commits to create a data ecosystem  with guidelines and  regulations about data  interoperability and data exchange agreements. Respecting the anonymis ation  process during data collection  is of particular importance in data exchange agreements, as to  prevent the leakage of personal data contents.  Overall, t he national data environment will be reinforced through the further development of the National  open data p ortal, and the creation of a National Research Data Portal. The National Open Data Portal is an API  interface that provides access to a large data repository of the public administra tion. In the same vein, the  National Research Data Portal will provide access to data produced by research institutions. In general,  both  initiatives aim at fostering the availability of open, high -quality and trustworthy data to leverage the benefits  of research and development in the field of AI.   In terms of digital and telecommunication infrastructure , the Cypriot  strategy recommends to improve  access to analytical systems  such as Platform -as-a-Service (PaaS) and  Machine Learning as -a-Service  (MLaaS) . Investing in  High Performance Computing infrastructures such as to those offered by  the  Computation -based Science and Technology Research Centre ( CaSToRC ) is also considered. In this respect,  Cyprus is  participatin g in the joint pan -European undertaking for developing supercomputers ( EuroHPC ).  
  39 5.5.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The Cypriot national AI strategy  mentions that AI can enhance the reduction of energy consumption through  the optimal use of natural resources, reduce the need for p esticides by contributing to a cleaner environment,  improve weather forecasting and lead to disaster prevention. In general AI aims to improve the living  conditions of the modern human being in a circular and sustainable development environment. A series o f  initiatives are currently ongoing in Cyprus to address the climate change and create more sustainable living  conditions. The Government is actively in volved in the implementation of projects , co-funded by the European  Commission,  relating to the smart ci ties and smart environments sectors with dedicated projects to fight the  climate change:    The KOIOS Centre of Excellence  is a pioneer in the field of supervision, control and security of critical  infrastr uctures, which are inextricabl y linked to smart environments. The multidisciplinary research  conducted in this centre touches upon climate change issues.  The SOLAR -ERA.NET  project develops  an ICT platform for improving the operation, maintenance and diagnosis of solar photovoltaic  systems;    The MaRITeC -X project proposes  the creation of innovative solutions in the maritime sector, based on  the use of smart meters and infrastructure. The objective of the project is to develop a scientific and  business centre of excellence in marine and mariti me activities which will focus among others on the  climate and the environment. The use of AI will be a key tool in the research  projects funded by this  centre.   COVID -19 pandemic   In order to track contagions at a first stage of COVID -19 pandemic, Cyprus developed CovTracer , a pilot  mobile app to targets the movements of individuals who were keeping on working under the lockdown (e.g. ,  doctors, nurses, police officers, fir e fighters, security forces ).   5.5.7  Monitoring and future update   The national AI strategy of Cyprus will be reviewed on a regular basis to assess the policy progress and to  foster the development and use of AI. To this end , in June 2020, the Deputy Ministry of Research, Innovation,  and Digital Policy  has launched a procurement for tender to develop an Action Plan that will detail the  progress and implementation of the national AI strategy , which has been very recently concl uded. The o verall  objective of the action plan is the preparation of an implementation plan of the national s trategy for AI, based  on the mandate for utilisation and adoption of innovative technologies, a broader strategy not only just from  a purely techno logical perspective, but primarily in relation to the digital transformation action plan, so that  both can constructively, maximi se the perceived benefit for society and Cypriot citizens.    
  40 5.6 Czech Republic   In May 2019, the Czech Republic released its National AI strategy  (Czech Republic, 2019) that builds on both  the Innovation s trategy 2019 –2030  and the Digital Czech Republic  strategy. The aim of this AI strategy is to  improve the national economic growth and competitiveness in AI by means of:    A responsible and trusted AI ecosystem;    The digitalisation of enterprises, in particular SMEs;    Equitable opportunities and benefits in AI to boost the economic development of society.   To achie ve these objectives, the Czech G overnment envisages policy actions across key areas like education,  R&D support, financing, industry, social impacts, regulation and international cooperation. The Min istry of  Industry and Trade will coordinate the overall AI strategy, while the Ministry of competence will coordinate  each specific key area.   The strategy follows this structure: for each key area, it highlights the responsible Ministry, the policy  initiat ives to develop, the cooperating entities, and the key objectives until 2021, 2027 and 2035 respectively.   The strategy provides annexes of facts and figures on employment and on AI applications in public and  private institutions. It also includes funding estimations for public research teams in AI, but lacks budget  allocations for the implementation of the national AI strategy.  However, since the launch of the strategy, the  Technology  Agency of the Czech Republic  supported various AI projects for a total o f EUR 120 million .  5.6.1  Human capital   The Czech Republic envisages actions to reform the primary, secondary and higher education  towards  AI learning. Primary and secondary education systems will teach courses on IT, digital literacy, AI, and on soft  skills (i.e . creative thinking) for AI. Higher education will provide Master and Doctoral Programmes in AI.  Finally, the Czech Industrial Strategy foresees a governmental programme to support innovative academic  programmes entirely on AI.   The Strategy for the education p olicy of the Czech Republic up to 2030+  also aims to support educators in  upgrading their teaching curricula with digital technologies. In 2021 new curric ula for elementary education   was approved, doubling the number of computer science classes and introducing new digital key  competence s.   The Czech strategy emphasises the importance of lifelong learning, vocational training and reskilling  opportunities . Since educational reforms should track the lab our market dynamics, the Czech G overnment  will closely monitor the labour market by commissioning analyses to predict the jobs’ creation and loss due to  AI. The predictions on future labour requirements will ente r into the National Register of Professions and  the Central Competence Database for a systematic promotion of updated jobs by means of career guidance,  worker mobility and reskilling opportunities.   5.6.2  From the lab to the market   An adequate support to basic an d applied research in the field of AI is key to deploy AI successful ly. To  this purpose, the Czech G overnment will cooperate to establish a Centre of Excellence in AI Research, Digital  Innovation Hubs  (DIHs)  and a Centre for Humanities and Social Science t o analyse the impact of AI on the  economy.  In April 2021, the Czech Republic counted 8 DIHs that are fully operational and 4 in preparation   stage performing in 8 regions.   Stimulating breakthrough innovations in AI  through an efficient AI entrepreneurial ecosystem is key for  the Czech G overnment. The Innovation Hub in AI (IHAI), co -funded by CzechInvest , and the start -up support  programmes and accelerator instruments, among others, will prompt AI economic activities and innovations.   The Czech Government introduced the 2019 -2030 Innovation s trategy  with a roadmap to improve the  innovation system as for the strategic manag ement (e.g., education and research), and trends of digital  technologies and skills. “ The Country for the Future ” (CFF) programme by the Ministry of Industry and  Trade is the implementation tool for the Innovation Strategy as it allocates a budget of CZK 6 .1 billion  (approx. EUR 232.6 million) to support innovative companies, digital services and R&D -based innovations.   
  41 The Czech strategy envisages financial instruments to support AI in the private and public sector . The  Digital Czech Republic P rogramme  will fund the Centre of Excellence in AI research with resources from the  City of Prague ad private partners. In the long -term, the Czech Republic plans to set up g rant programmes for  AI with funds from the Grant Agency of the Czech Republic  (GA CR) and the Technology Agency of the Czech  Republic  (TA CR). In addition, the access to finance for AI businesses will expand to market -based financial  instruments of the Czech -Moravian Guarantee and Development Bank . On top, European initiatives like Digital  Europe, Horizon Europe, and Connecting Europe Facility will support addition al AI developments. The Czech  Government will also develop specific grants and investment programmes for S MEs, start -ups and spinoffs  with highly innovative services and business models. Although many financing tools address the private  sector, the Czech Ministries envisage programmes to support AI start -ups and applications in the public sector  too.  Finally, the effectiveness of all support programmes will be regularly evaluated and integrated with  alternative forms of financing.   5.6.3  Networking   The Czech strategy foresees policy recommendations to foster both national and international  partnerships . The Czech G overnment suggests to include AI into the V4 priorities in order to increase  collaboration in this field across Poland, Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. Bilateral collaborations are  very important too, like 1) the Czech -German strategic dialogue on rese arch, development and innovation,  2)  the Czech -French Strategi c partnership on digitisation and 3)  the Czech -Slovak partnership on education and  industry 4.0. Finally, the Czech G overnment will increase networking opportunities by participating to working  groups of international organisations (EC, OECD, UN), by creating the European Centre of Excellence in AI  Research and by establishing Digital Innovation Hubs.   Collaborations between SMEs, start -ups and scientific research centres will receive support form   specific programmes like the Knowledge Transfer Partnerships  for the development of a mutually beneficial  partnerships between the business community and research orga nisations. The Czech Republic will also  launch calls for tenders to foster the development of AI innovations in multidisciplinary teams. In addition, an  expert group made of representatives from academia, research centres  and the private sector will suppor t  collaborative investment programmes in AI.   The Czech G overnment foresees policies actions to increase the international attractiveness  of the  country, and to attract and retain foreign talent in AI. For example, the Czech strategy aims to revise the Act  on the Residence of Foreigners and long -term residence permits for scientific researchers. The upcoming  governmental programme will introduce simplified procedures that will help researchers and their families to  acquire the residence and working permits f aster. Scientific researchers will be able to remain in the Czech  Republic  for nine more months after the end of their work contract to search for another job in the country.   The Czech Republic recommends the promotion of the Czech AI ecosystem, inside th e country and abroad, to  enhance the dissemination and uptake of AI  in the economy. In collaboration with CzechInvest, the  Confederation of Industry and AICZECHIA, the Ministry of Industry and Trade has prepared an interactive web  mapping  of actors  from the private sector, academia and other AI institutions in the Czech Republic.  Forthcoming in -depth analyses will  study the socio -economic impact of AI.   5.6.4  Regulation   A human -centric AI requires an effective regulation to protect human rights, and to clarify responsibilities,  intellectual property rights and liabilities. The Czech strategy dedicates a section to legal and social aspects of  AI with reference t o ethics, consumer protection and security issues.   The objective is to define an ethical and legal regulation  that also releases the development of AI  technologies from needless regulatory constraints. First, the Czech Republic plans to identify the secto rs  whose research and development efforts in AI are mostly refrained by inappropriate legislations. All issues of  data access, data ownership and (personal) data protection will receive strong consideration within a sector specific approach to the heteroge neous legislations of different sectors. For instance, an AI Committee will  analyse  the current Czech legislat ive framework  for autonomous cars. Other examples relate to certificates  and standards for cybersecurity, and specific data regulations for the he althcare sector. Regulatory sandboxes  will also contribute optimal conditions for testing AI concepts.  
  42 Lastly, the Czech Republic launched the AI Observatory and Forum  (AIO&F), an expert platform on legal  aspects of AI to create a favourable social and legal environment for research, development and use of  responsible AI. Audits in the public and private sector will also detect the existence of legal barriers.   5.6.5  Infrastructure   A well-functioning data infrastruc ture is a key prerequisite of AI developments. Therefore, the Czech  Republic has set up a National strategy on open access to research i nformation  for the period 2017 -2020 to  start opening  the access to scientific information at national level.   The modernisation of the digital and telecommunication infrastructure will foster the provision of high quality data. Within the context of the  EuroHPC JU  initiative , the Czech G overnment plans to expand the  IT4Innovations  national supercomputing centre  with the petascale HPC system Karolina , participate s in the  LUMI  consortium aiming to build pre -exascale HPC system s and supports  the EuroHPC  research and  innovation call.  The Digital Czech Republic  strategy highlights that the G overnment will prioritise connectivity improvements  on the internet infrastructure to deploy the 5 G networks in the country during the coming years. To this  purpose, the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Czech Republic and the Bavarian State Chancellery aim to  create a common 5G -corridor between Munich and Prague, which should also become part of t he programme  "Connecting Europe Facility " of the European Commission.   5.6.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The upsurge of global temperatures caused by increasing carbon emissions calls for new tools to help to  better manage the impacts of climate change and to protect the planet. According to a recent analysis of  PwC  consultancy , technologies with potential for addressing climate change are: advanced materials, cloud  technology including big data, autonomous vehicles, including drones, synthetic biology, virtual and  augmented reality, AI, robots; blockchain, 3D pr inting and the Internet of things (IoT).   Furthermore,  the Digital Czech Republic  strategy highlights the importance of a public and political debate to  find new and innovative ways of adapting to the emerging climate change through digital and AI -enhanced  technologies and tools.   COVID -19 pandemic   During the outbreak of the COVID -19 pandemic, several initiatives and projects using AI have been developed.  The Cze ch Republic has released a trac ing system of Smart Quarantine  based on AI principles and also  developed an AI -enabled chatbot  for answering COVID -19 related questions. As an interesting use case, the  mapping application Mapy.cz  uses location sharing in relation to COVID -19 to alert citizens of potential risky  encounters. Deve lopers are further attempting to obtain anonymous data about people who tested positive  and compare it with the location of users by means of advanced algorithms. This would help identifying cases  of probable contacts with a person who has been confirmed p ositive for COVID -19.  The Hack the Crisis  hackathon has also contributed to the development of AI based applications (e.g. mapping  of people density in public spaces, strengthening cybersecurity of the hospitals against cyberattacks using AI  during the pandemic, evaluation of personal protective equipment and determining its FFP standard).   The Czech G overnment also intends to focus on Digital Innovation Hubs and Testing and Experimentation  Facilities (TEFs) for different applications of AI  in the health sector. For the TEFs, a concept for  the coop eration  of hospitals with technical capacities is in consideration.  Moreover , the TREND P rogram me from the  Technology Agency of the Czech Republic subsidises, among others,  projects aiming to counteract the COVID 19 pandemic and  using 5G technology .  5.6.7  Monitoring and future update   While the Ministry of Industry and Trade will coordinate the national AI strategy of the Czech Republic, an AI  committee will supervise its implementation. The AI committee is a subcommittee of the Steering Committee  of the Digital Czech Republic  strategy. This strategy consists of seven chapters with dedicated working groups  on education, R&D support, financing, industry, social impacts, regulation and internatio nal cooperation. Each  working group is responsible to monitor the fulfilment of the strategic objectives.  Once a year, the Steering 
  43 Committee and the Czech G overnment will receive a progress report on the strategy implementation. The  national AI strategy w ill be updated along the goals of the 2021 review of the Coordinate Plan on AI.   The Ministry of Industry and Trade is preparing a call to co -finance Digital Innovation Hubs in the upcoming  Digital Europe Program me with the aim to create an interconnected a nd sustainable EDIH ecosystem in the  Czech Republic. With other sources as ESIF , the Cze ch Republic  plans to boost also a network of national DIH  to address the local needs of companies.   
  44 5.7 Denmark    In March 2019, the Danish G overnment published its National AI strategy  (Denmark, 2019).  The Danish  strategy sets out the goals and visions for AI development in Denmark, it presents the challenges to be  addressed and it identifies  specific policy initiatives and priority areas.   It aims at putting Denmark at the forefront of responsible development of AI and sets out four objective to  achieve this goal:    Develop a common ethical and human -centred basis for AI;    Prioritise and support research in AI;    Encourage the growth of Danish businesses by developing and using AI;    Ensure that the public sector uses AI to offer world -class services for the benefit  of citizens and  society.   The strategy originally contained 24 initiatives for which EUR 9.2 million h as been reserved by the Danish  Government for the period 2019 -2027. The budget has since been reprioritised and lowered to EUR 5 million.  The government plans to evaluate the strategy in order to determine future action s regarding AI.  In add ition, the 2019 national budget earmarked EUR 39.5 million for research in new digital technologies. An  additional  EUR 26.8 million has been  earmarked for a n Investment Fund (2019 -2022) to help municipal and  regional government authorities develop and adop t digital welfare solutions and new technologies.  Technological possibilities, such as AI, also play a role in the research funding established via the 2020   budget .  The outlined policy initiatives below also include those presented in the Strategy for Denmark’s digital g rowth   (Denmark, 2018) , a policy report setting the direction for how Denmark can seize the opportunities of the  digital transformation. Th e report cont ains 38 initiatives , some of which  relate directly to AI or provide initial  policy steps that will push the development of AI technologies.   5.7.1  Human capital   In terms of formal education and training , the Danish Government has launched these programmes :   Techno logy Pact: the pact signed by 80 participating institutions aims to attract 250 participating  members and to increase the number of students choosing  STEM subjects ((science, technology,  engineering and mathematics) by 20%, or 10,000 students by 202 8;   A four -year test progra mme  has been launched (2019 -2021) to strengthen technology  understanding in primary and lower secondary education. Various teaching models will be evaluated  and efforts will be devoted to de veloping the skills of teachers.   Furthermore, a national action pl an to strengthen digital competenc ies and digital learning on higher  education institutions was launched in April 2019, including funding to support continuous upskilling courses  for teachers ( EUR 6 million in 2019).   The Danish G overnment is not only targe ting an increased uptake of education in digital and AI -related skills,  but is also promoting a culture of lifelong learning and continuous up/reskilling of the existing  workforce . The government thus has set up a vocational adult education and training wo rking group to  advise new forms of vocational education programmes  to target the upcoming needs of the labour market.  The Government will set up a centre for the application of IT in vocational education teaching, and will support  vocational courses, among  others in AI.   As a consequence of COVID -19, the Danish G overnment has allocated EUR 16. 1 million in order to create  more study places in which a significant portion will be allocated to STEM - programs including IT programs.  This comes on top of the extra EUR 13. 7 million allocated to more study places in STEM  in December 2019.  As a result, the intake in STEM education programmes increased by 9%  (1,380 study places) at the 2020  summer intake.   5.7.2  From the lab to the market   As mentioned above regarding the national budgets for  2019 and 2020, Denmark is i nvesting in a range of  programmes  to boost research and development  in digital and AI research and pilot projects. Policy   initiatives include :  
  45  The creation of the Digital Research Centre Denmark (DIREC) : the aim of the centre  is to develop and  support the digital field through research in AI, big d ata, Internet -of-Things (IoT) and IT Security . The  centre was established  in 2020 and the Innovation Fund Denmark has supported DIREC with DKK  100 million  (approx. EUR  13.4 million) ;   AI research funds: The Innovation Fund Denmark  and the Independent Research Fund Denmark   financially support research into new technological possibilities suc h as AI.  To increase innovation in AI  and foster the creation and growth of  AI businesses, the Danish Strategies   highlight  the following policy initiatives and investment instruments:    Investment for AI businesses: The Danish Growth Fund will launch a pilot project in the form of an  investment pool of EUR 3.1 million over four years targeting companies with a business model based  on AI. It will take the form of co -investments with privat e investors;    Sprint :Digital  – a coordinated scheme to support the digital transformation of Danish SMEs, which  can benefit their ability to innovate in AI. The aim of this policy is to promote the digital  transformation of SMEs by using agile design sprints to develop and test new digital solutions and  business models .  The Danish AI strategy foresees the following four priority areas :   Healthcare;    Energy and utilities;    Agriculture;    Transport.   Besides policie s directed to the private sector, the Danish Government  aims to also support more effective  deployment and use of new technologies, including AI, across the public sector :   National Centre for Public Sector Innovation (COI): this centre  supports more effective deployment  and use of new technologies, such as AI, in  the public sector;    The Digital  strategy  2016 -2020 set the course  for Danish  public  secto r digitisation  efforts  and their  interaction  with businesses and industry. It played a significant role in preparing  the public sector to  upcoming technological challenges and opportunities of AI and big data  (Denmark, 2016) . A new  national digital strategy is currently expected in late 2021;    Investment fund to boost the adoption  of AI by municipal and regional government authorities : In  2019, 2020, and 2021 , the Government, municipalities and regions agreed to launch 28 signa ture  projects  financed by the fund. The projects focus on  healthcare, social affairs, employment,  administration, and climate mitigation and adaptation.    To develop AI tools into effective and efficient products and services, both public and private sector  players  should have the possibility of testing AI solutions . For this purpose, the Danish G overnment has initiated   several policy initiatives:    Performance contracts  with seven Danish GTS institutes: the government is setting up performance  contracts with seven GTS institutes allowin g them to test new technologies , including for instance AI;    The Danish Government  has allocated approximately  EUR 27 million to an investment fund for  testing, scaling, and encouraging the uptake of AI in the public sector, with a particular focus on  healthcare, public administration, and the green transition.   5.7.3  Networking   A major challenge for the Dan ish G overnment is to create a collaborative  environment for the development of  digital technologies. In this respect, the Danish AI strategy pays particular attention to improve  opportunities for partnerships between public and private sectors , in particul ar for new technologies  such as the Internet of Things, AI and data analysis:    National Centre for Public Sector Innovation: one of the objectives of this centre  is to help strengthen  public -private collaboration, so that  the public sector incorporates private sector competenc ies,  resources and experience.  
  46 5.7.4  Regulation   The Danish strategy led to the development of an ethical framework for AI based on six principles in order to  improve the level of trust and confidence in AI.  The six principles for AI relate to self -determination (i.e.  ensuring that citizens can make informed and independent decisions) and to human dignity, equality and  justice (i.e. ensuring that there is no infringement of human rights and maintaining respec t for diversity). It  also covers aspects of responsibility and explainability (i.e. openness and transparency). The sixth principle  stipulates that AI development should be ethically responsible. To ensure that ethical issues  are addressed,  the Danish Gove rnment set up the following initiatives:   • In May 2019 an independent Data Ethics Council  was established.  The C ouncil makes   recommendations on ethical issues  relating to data and new technologies , in particular on  responsible and sustainable use of data by the public and private sector s;  • In December 2019 a Data Ethics Toolbox  was launched to support companies to adopt and  implement d ata ethics into their business models;   • A joint cybersecurity and data ethics seal  (a labelling scheme) will be launch ed in 2021. It is foun ded  by an independent multi -stakeholder consortium involving the national industry organisations and  the Danish Consumer Council .  In terms of legislation , the Danish strategy highlights the need to evaluate the current legal framework and  to adopt new legislation to guarantee the responsible development of AI applications. The n ew legislation  relates among others to data ethics and security regulations and  include initiatives as:    Law on disclosure of Data Ethics Policy: A legislative amendment  to the Danish Financial Statement s  Act affects Denmark’s largest  companies and how they conduct their annual reporting. The law  requires companies with a data ethics policy to provide information on compliance, while companies  without a data ethics policy must explain why they do not have  a policy – much like they do today on  corporate social responsibilities (CSR). The law enter ed into force on 1 January 2021 and a guide for  businesses  on how to include data ethics in their annual reports has been developed ;   Cyber security directive: This directive, properly known as the Directive on security of network and  information systems (NIS) , requires Member States to adopt a national cyber -securi ty strategy.  Denmark’s current  national cyber -security strategy  was published in May 2018 , and a revision is  expected in 2021 ;   On 30 May 2017, the Danish parliament adopted an amendment of the Danish Road Traffic Act  allowing the testing of self -driving cars. According to the amended Act, any company that wishes to  carry out testing of self-driving cars must apply to the Ministry of Transportation for a permit.   The Danish strategy recognises the importance of international standards  in AI. In t his regard, the Danish  Government will initiate work to develop national technical specifications based on the specific needs of  Danish busi nesses. In particular, the Strategy for Denmark’s digital g rowth  foresees to:    Support the development of international standards for small and collaborative robots (c obots).   5.7.5  Infrastructure   Data is an essential prerequisite for the use of AI. Hence, the Danish G overnment recognises the importance  of facilitating access to data and making it available for citizens, businesses, public authorities and  resea rchers. Concrete ly, the Danish G overnment is developing  the following policy initiatives related to  data infrastructure :   Common Danish language resource: The aim is to foster language technology solutions by providing  access to a high -quality shared language reso urce. In June 2020, the Danish G overnment, in  collaboration with municipalities and regions, launched the website sprogteknologi.dk  where  metadata about existing language resources are gathered and displayed. Future action s include the  development of further Danish language resources, e.g. a central word register and the development  of a time -coded and transcribed speech corpus in Danish ;   Access to public sector data: the need to prepare a strategy for data in the public se ctor which will  encourage the use and dissemination of public -sector data. A concrete example:    Access to Danish health data:  
  47 o The Danish health data is internationally unique because many health registers and  databases cover the entire population over many years. It is possible to combine various  sources of health data (e.g. national health registries, clinical quality databases, biobank  samples and health record data) and other data (e.g. socioeconomic data) by using the  unique personal identification numbe r. This provides good opportunities for valuable  research, quality development and the development of new innovative solut ions to the  benefit of patients;   o To support researchers in accessing health data the Danish Government  and Danish Regions  have launche d a common entry for health data. The entry will consist of an overview of  available health data and a digital entry for guidance and application for access to health  data for research.      The Danish Life Science Strategy from April 2021 includes an initia tive to explore potentials for  establishing a secure national analysis platform for secondary use of health data. The aim is to  support data users in accessing health data and other data from various  data sources  and  performing advanced data analysis (e .g. machine learning and algorithm training) with the use of  comprehensive data types (e .g. genome data and imaging data) in a secure way;    Development of digital export certificates: the government supports the development of digital  certificates for exported  goods (in particular in the food sector) aiming at improving traceability and  transparency of the export process. The use of big d ata from the system will be used for smarter and  more  focused guidance for exporters;    Fostering the Open Science Policy : the Danish Government’s policy of Open Science is focused on  three important elements, including open access to scientific pub lications, research integrity and open  research data.   In addition, the policy framework for AI is further strengthened with initiatives for a good digital and  telecom infrastructure , including a modernised telecommunications agreement and a 5G action plan:    Cloud technologies: the need to establish a strategy for fostering data storage in the cloud to allow  cheap access to massive computati onal power and storage capacity;    A new national strategy for digital research infrastructure  was launched in 2019  comprising  recommendations for a strengthened national cooperation with respect to digital research  infrastructure .  5.7.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The Danish G overnment believes that it is increasingly important at national and l ocal level to use data and  digital technology in developing climate neutral and circular solutions.   In order to meet the Danish ambitious target of cutting carbon emissions by 70 % by 2030, 13 climate  partnerships between the government and 13 industrial sectors  have been set up. In March 2020 they  published their first set of recommendations inc luding many recommendations for the use of AI and data,  especially on setting up data -sharing.   The Danish G overnment continually works on securing a responsible digital economy where trustworthy,  ethical and secure use of data and AI goes hand in hand with  the ability to provide innovative solutions. Thus,  partnerships on the responsible use of energy and resource data, and data for smart city solutions for making  data available for data driven solutions that can lower energy and resource consumption are un der  investigation.   In addition, an ongoing project within the framework of the Danish strategy for AI is investigating the use of  public datasets for AI, which has the potential to strengthen the green transition in Denmark. Several of the   upcoming  high-value datasets mandated by the Open Data Directive – including environment and climate  data, or location data in the transport area – can contribute to the development of AI technologies.    As part of the Danish national AI strategy , the Danish G overnment and the Danish municipalities and regions  have established an investment fund to boost the use of AI by municipal and regional government authorities.  In total, the fund will allocate approximately EUR 27 million in 2019 -2022 for testing, scaling  and  encouraging the uptake of AI in the public sector, with a particular focus on healthcare, public administration  and the green transition.  
  48 Selected signature projects focus on the use of AI to tackle climate change:    Forecast tools for planning, mapping  and warnings for flood prevention and management in rural  and urban areas;    Energy management and optimization of existing building stock;    Intelligent fleet management and smart traffic patterns.   COVID -19 pandemic   The Danish G overnment has allocated a total of DKK 150 million  (approx.  EUR 20.1 million)  for research and  developmen t in the fight against coronavirus . Part of this budget will go to 10 new research projects  conducted in Danish universities and hospitals . The research projects will receive funding between DKK  750,000  (approx . EUR 100,000) and DKK 7.4 million (approx. EU R 1 million).  The funding programme also   support s small and medium -sized companies with innovation and development projects that can help the  society during the corona crisis.   In addition to the governmental funding, The Novo Nordisk Foundation , an international foundation focusing  on medical treatment and research  and primary owner of Novo Nordisk , has awarded a total of DKK 82.5  million  (approx.  EUR 11 million)  for 45 projects that aim to mitigate the short -term health -related effects of  the COVID -19 epidemic.   As AI is a cornerstone in the fight against the coronavirus, part of these budgets also suppo rt the exploit of AI  within the COVID -19 medical context. By means of examples, several funded projects using AI as a key  technology against COVID -19 are presented below:    Project on machine learning models based on Danish registry data: the objective of this project is to  identify – based on machine learning algorithms – cancer patients who are at high risk of having a  surgically complicated course of treatment. During the corona pandemic, these identified patients  could be prepared for surgery via optimi sation outside the hospital;    Project using AI to predict the course of the disease for COVID -19 patients: based on medical records,  gene analyses (genome sequencing) as well as detailed studies of the immune system, the project  will develop a model that ca n predict which patients will need intensive and respiratory care;    Project on real -time risk assessment of patients with COVID -19: AI is used to analyse patients’ data  in order to develop new, data -driven decision support models to the advantage of future patients.  Specifically, by employing the analyses about patient records and treatments, the project aims to  model the risk of intensive care and ventilator breathing support of newly diagnosed COVID -19  patients;    Project on Corona Application Tool for Colla borating Hospitals ( CATCH ): AI employs patients’ data to  identify the key factors contributing to severe illness, and this will generate updated risk  assessments for the patients from their admission and  onwards;    Project on imaging analysis for COVID -19 diagnosis: This project employs AI to characterize the type  of infection that is shown on x -ray images of lungs in order to detect the degree of infection and the  similarity with COVID -19 infection.   5.7.7  Monito ring and future update   The outlined strategy constitutes a first step towards the development of AI in Denmark. As new challenges  will arise in the future, it will be necessary to adjust existing initiatives and to define new policy actions. To  this purpos e, Denmark is currently consid ering the most effective way to address and , if needed , revise the  existing national AI strategy from 2019.  
  49 5.8 Estonia   In July 2019, an expert group led by Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications  and the Government  Office presented  a policy report  together with proposals to advance the up -take of AI in Estonia (Estonia,  2019a ). Based on the proposals, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications presented  Estonia’s  national AI strategy  (Estonia, 2019b ). Estonia’s strategy provides a comprehensive overview of both existing  and proposed policy measures, along with their objectives, deadlines and budget estimations. The objective of  the strategy is to fully harness the potential of AI by developing and imp lementing policy measures in the  following areas:   Encouraging the use and development  of AI applications in  both the public  and private  sector;    Providing direct support to research  in AI and incre asing  the relevant skills and competenc ies to do  so;   Develop ing a legal environment to facilitate the uptake of AI.   With regards to  funding, the Estonian G overnment estimates an investment of at least EUR 10 million in  2019 -2021 for the implementation of its AI strategy.   5.8.1  Human capital   Estonia’s strategy foresees s everal reforms to the formal education and training  systems in order to  increase skills and competenc ies in AI. Reforms at the level of preschool, primary and secondary education  will be primarily covered through an upgrade of the ProgeTiger P rogramme , which offers technology  curriculums to schools. Awareness rising about the possibilities of AI is also supported through the technology  compass  offered by the Estonian Education and Youth Board. Reforms to the higher education include the  Master’s programme in the field of data science and AI (in autumn 2020 the first students were admitted to  the course  at the University of Tartu), the promotion of elective courses on AI in postgraduate disciplines  (including also non -ICT disciplines), and the increase of PhD scholarships  in AI-related fields.   Additional further education trainings are in preparation and include among others online courses for citizens  to raise the public awareness of AI and a training programme targeting employees of companies developing  AI solutions. The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications has developed training courses and  instructional materials in AI for managers and develop ers in the public sector, courses to raise awareness of  AI in the public sector and data governance training courses aimed at data stewards and upper management  to support the development of AI. In this respect, the University of Tartu is also providing a MOOC  on AI. In  addition, an Estonian language version of Elements of AI  has been launched by TalTech in November 2019.  The importance of provid ing a digital focus on lifelong learning was already anticipated in the Estonian  lifelong learning s trategy 2020  published in 2014.   5.8.2  From the lab to the market   To foster AI developments, Estonia foresees to increase the capacity of AI research . This is achieved by  developing AI-related research  support measures and by increasing the capacity and awa reness of funding  opportunities. The uptake and development of AI in the private sector will be supported through existing  funding measures such as innovation vouchers , development vouchers  and product development grants .  Other existing policies, such as the Technology Competence Centre ( TCC) and in particular the Competence  Centre Specialised in Machine Learning and Data Science ( STACC ) are providing support measures for  companies to develop in novative AI products and services.   In addition, the Estonian G overnment is preparing an innovation competition to promote AI developments  based on governmental datasets. Another funding scheme provides financial support to pilot projects at  various levels of their technology readiness. These instruments will be complemented with new funding  measures  to foster the digital transformation of compan ies (including AI and robotics) across all sectors.  Flexible and sufficient funding opportunities for the AI uptake in the public sector has been earmarked  through structural funds, joint procurements and new upcoming funding measures. Lastly, sandboxes ar e  currently developed to foster testing and developing AI applications in the public sector.       
  50 5.8.3  Networking   To improve networking and collaboration  opportunities, the Estonian G overnment is developing a policy  tool to monitor available technology developments on the market and to liaise companies with R&D  institutions. As a part of the European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIH) network, AI & Robotics Estonia is  established. The cent re will be operational in June 2021 and it will allow SMEs from all sectors to obtain free  services to develop knowledge -intensive solutions in the field of AI and robotics. Dissemination and uptake of  AI is also targeted in the public sector among others the identification of use -cases, the organisation of  meetings, conferences and a website to share experiences and good practices.   One of the actions of the AI strategy to foster public and private sector cooperation is ordering and making  available AI cor e components, which can then be further trained by the subsequent institutions on the basis of  their data and needs. The first such core component was made available through a public sector code  repository in autumn 2019. A company called Texta concluded a  memorandum of understanding with the  Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications to offer a free open -source text and data analysis sof tware   to all state authorities. As of 2021, there are five different core components  made available to the public,  including machine translation, speech synthesis, speech recognition and topic tagger. Another  AI core  component includes the development of an open -source chatbot established in cooperation with public bodies,  spell corrector, process analyser, customer contact classifier, abstract generator, and anonymization toolkit.  There are various networking  events taking place to increase awareness of AI solutions, among others aimed  at presenting the results of AI projects.    5.8.4  Regulation   With respect to regulation , the Estonian strategy foresees amendments to the legislation to facilitate the  development and  uptake of AI. Introducing a new AI specific regulation is not planned at the moment, instead,  modifications to the existing legal framework (Administrative Procedure Act) are envisa ged. In addition, the  Estonian G overnment released voluntary procurement guidelines  that aim to give an overview of the most  common issues as well as p ossible solutions that could be considered in a data science project. Finally, the  Estonian G overnment is currently working on a self -assessment questionnaire for developers of AI that is  based on the Assessment List accompanying the Ethics guidelines for t rustworthy AI .  The Estonian G overnment is also working on national metadata standard and data quality framework, which  will be implemented in a combination  of guidelines and mandatory binding legislation.   5.8.5  Infrastructure   The Estonian strategy devotes salient attention to data infrastructure policies . It includes data governance  tools, instruments to increase the availability and responsible use of data, the c reation of a Chief Data Officer  in various – and potentially all – ministries, the compilation of data catalogues/sharing platforms, and the  provision of funding for data audits. The project  on the compilation of data catalogues has been successfully  finalised and will be further developed. The data catalogue will contain all data from the public registries and  will include metadata providing more information abou t the type of data and its availability. The open data   portal will give access to all public data without restrictions.  There is currently a project underway to develop  a data management tool, which will initial ly focus on metadata management.  Finally, the recommendations  of the Open s cience in Estonia  report will be further developed in to cost -effective solutions for implementing  open science principles at the national level.   To foster the telecommunication infrastructure , the Estonian G overnment continues the completion of an  ultra-fast broadband fibre optic cable network and foresees activities to support the rollout of 5G network as  highlighted in the Digital a genda 2020 for Estonia , released in 2018 and in the upcoming Digital Agenda  2030 (expect to be approved by the parliament in autumn  2021 ). In addition, Estonia joined the EuroHPC   project to enjoy the benefits of supercomputing.   5.8.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   In January 2020 the Estonian Prime Minister, presenting the  on plans e -health, e -state and ener gy revolution  at the World Economic Forum, mentioned the fight against climate change and the development of AI as  priority pillars  of the future.  Following the need of finding innovative solutions  to respond to global challenges 
  51 such as combating climate change, the Estonian Prime Minister encouraged entrepreneurs from Estonia and  the Kansai region  to establish business contacts during a business seminar in Kyoto in February 2020.   Currently Estonia has several ongoing research pro jects that combine AI -related techniques to create a more  sustainable environment:    Ice map based on satellite date : The purpose of the ice map solution  is to compile raster maps  and satellite images for monitoring the snow and ice cover of Estonian coastal waters and large  lakes (Lake Peipus). The maps and images are based on the European Space Agency’s as well as  EUMETCast satellite data, which is made available via national satellite data centre ESTHub, in  addition to in situ  measurements of ice. The technology of raster maps and satellite images is based  on the supervised machine learning  approach, as much as possible. Ships, icebreakers, Police and  Border Guard Board, Rescue Board will use ice maps in order to give warnings about ice conditions  and to rescue people who have drifted with ice. Using such, already existing satellite data, re duces  the need for in situ  monitoring and increases the accuracy of data -based decisions. Ice map project  will be finalised by the end of 2021;    Remote monitoring of forest resources: The purpose of the project is to create an information  technology solutio n that enables the compilation of raster maps of Estonian woody vegetation (tree  species, height, forest reserves and site clearance). The maps will be constructed using multispectral  satellite data, aircraft scanning data (LIDAR) and machine learning meth ods. The data processing  should be as automated as possible and with minimal manual work by the user. The main input data  for the processing are Sentinel -2 MSI multispectral satellite images obtained from the national  satellite data centre ESTHub. The outp ut of the project are four different maps: map of forest clearcuts, map of tree species composition prediction, map of forest height prediction, map of forest stem  volume prediction. With the help of such maps, it is possible to assess the forest resource s and plan  economic decisions on this basis. The project was finalised in July 2020;    Monitoring and species identification using images and AI: The purpose of the project is to  create a prototype based on AI (machine learning)  platform for identifying anim als and birds using  image data (photos and videos from trail cameras). Prototype will contain machine learning  models  for identifying wild animals and birds in Estonia by Estonian Environment Agency. Instead of  manually viewing wildlife image data (46  000 photos manually analysed in 33 hours), the AI will  analyse these images in 1 -2 hours. The project will begin in few months and will be finalised in 2021.   COVID -19 pandemic   As for the COVID -19 emergency, during the first phase of the crisis, the chabot Suve helped Estonians and  foreign residents of the country in finding official information about the coronavirus situation. Since then, the  Estonian G overnment has undergone several projects and are currently developing an open-source AI -based  chatbot solution. Various governmental agencies are using transcription and analysation in customer  communication to understand the root causes of customer inquiries and thereby reduce the number of calls  and improve satisfaction with public services.   5.8.7  Monitoring and future update   A working group will be set up to monitor the implementation of this action plan, to initiate additional policy  initiatives if necessary and to start the preparation of Estonia’s long -term AI strategy for 2022.     
  52 5.9 Finland   In October  2017, the Finnish Ministry of Economic Af fairs and Employment published its  national AI strategy  entitled Finland’s age of artificial i ntelligence  (Finland, 2017).  This report fits under the umbrella of a broader  Artificial Intelligence P rogramme  in Finland (also labelled as AI Finland) with a view to establishing AI and  robotics as the cornerstones of success for Finnish companies.   The strategy highlights Finland’s pos sibilities in the global market  along with its strengths and weaknesses  in  AI. It describes how AI will transform society and provides a range of policy actions and recommendations for  Finland to thrive in the age of AI.  The goal was  to position Finland as a leading country in AI. Finland has thereafter  adopt ed an open data  policy and aimed to  create  adequate conditions for a prosperous d evelopment of AI. Overall, the strategy   strive d to:   Increase the competitiveness of business and industry;    Provide high -quality public services and improve the efficiency of the public sector;    Ensure a well -functioning society and wellbeing for its citizens.   In 2018 the national AI strategy was complemented with a policy report on Work in the age of artific ial  intelligence  (Finland, 2018) . It is a thematic report that reflects on the impact of AI on lab our market  dynamics a nd skills requirements. In 2019  the Finnish Ministry of Economic Affairs  released the  final report of  Finland’s Artificial Intelligence P rogramme , entitled Leading the way into the age of artificial i ntelligence   (Finland, 2019).  On pages 80 -82 of this report , the Finnish G overnment provides investment figures for   several flagship policies . For instance, the AI Business Programme has been allocated EUR 100 million over a  four-year period. The Finnish Centre for Artificial Intelligen ce (FCAI) was granted EUR 8.3 million in flagship  funding for 2019 –2022.   In November 2020, Finland has launched an updated AI strategy: t he Artificial Intelligence 4.0 P rogramme   promotes the development and introduction of AI and other digital technologies in companie s, with a special  focus on SMEs from several industrial and service sectors.   5.9.1  Human capital   The presence of a well -established, harmonised and effective education system is one of Finland’s main  strengths. As a result, Finland has a highly educated and tech -friendly population. However, current available  skills directed to the utilisation and dev elopment of AI and robotics are mainly present in technological and  mathematical fields, which are often too broadly defined to support soc iety in these times of change. Hence,  the Fin nish Ministry  of Economic Affairs and Employment  proposes an active refo rm of education systems  towards the provision of high -quality courses in AI. The reform should  not only include AI -oriented courses but  should  also incorporate  communication and social skill s, problem solving and  creativity.   A Competence and Innovations C ommittee has been  established under the Artificial Intelligence Programme   to support education reforms . In particular, the Fin nish strategy provides the following policy  recommendations towards education and training in AI :   Guaranteeing AI literacy across the Fi nnish population (including elderly) to ensure that all citizens  have a basic understanding of AI applications . This can be achieved through MOOCs  to ensure  elementary knowledge on AI:   o Elements of AI  course: the Elements of AI is a series of free online courses created by  Reaktor and the University of Helsinki. The course series aims to demystify AI by offering a  basic ( Introduction to AI ) and more advanced (Building AI ) course on AI methods. With  the  objective to reach as many people as possible , the basic course is being translated in all  languages  of the European Union ;  o Online introduction course to Python;   Introducing Masters and Bachelors programmes at university providing courses in  AI. Examples:   o Master’s programme  on machine learning, data science and AI  at Aalto university;   o Master’s programmes  on data science or digital humanities  at University of Helsinki.    Incentives and training mechanisms for teachers to use AI in their courses and teaching methods.   Particular attention is devoted to the working -age population with policy recommendations targeting  vocational training and lifelong learning opportunities :  
  53  MOOCs  in AI and programming as a possible tool for further education of people in the labour  market;    Lifelong learning opportunities to train working -age population with the provision of personalised and  motivating learning methods;    To promote lifelong lea rning, a skills account or voucher will be created for all working -age people,  which they can use to update their skills and purchase the training they need.   As mentioned in the second AI report, about one million Finns are estimated to need reskilling/ups killing  training to adapt to changes in occupational structures. In order to close the gap of available skills and  the needs of the labour market , the Finnish strategy advocates modular education programmes to  address incompatibilities between current skil ls and new skills requirements:    Opportunities for expanding qualification contents will be integrated in education programmes to  facilitate adaptations to workforce’s skills needs.   5.9.2  From the lab to the market   To support AI developments from the lab to the m arket , Business Finland , Finland’s main funding agency for  innovation, plays an important role in providing finance and support to AI companies. Initiatives from this  agency are complemented with technical  support on research and innovation from VTT, the Technical  Research Centre of Finland.   In particular, the Finnish G overnment is implementing the following policy initiatives to encourage research  and innovation  in AI :   The creation of an AI maturity tool , which has been in use since 2019 to help  organisations increase   their business opportunities by  identifying their most important areas for improvement in AI;    The formation of a Finnish Centre for Artificial Intelligence ( FCAI) to promote both AI research, and  the use and application of  AI in companies and elsewhere in society . In September 2020, FCAI was  selected as the host of The European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems ( ELLIS ) unit in  Helsinki ;   The launch of an Artificial Intelligence Accelerator (FAIA) to facilitate companies in bringing AI  experiments into production . The accelerator is initiated as a joint venture by the Ministry of  Economic Affairs, Technology Industries of Finland and Silo.AI . The s tate of AI in Finland  report  was  published in two separate sets in September and November 2020 ;   The use of innovation vouchers to support companies  to innovate and grow;     The launch of the  AI Business Programme  that offers innovation funding, networking and  internationalization services for R&D, amo ng others;    The Hyteairo  Programme (Well -being and Health Sector’s Artificial Intelligence and Robotics  Programme) to support utili sation of AI and robotics in the well -being sector;    Support to the development of significant test environments and testbeds.   5.9.3  Networking   Fully exploiting the potential of AI requires seamless collaborations and networking between various players.   Finnish b usinesses have traditionally low thresholds in engaging in collaborations. In this respect, the AI  Business Programme supports 15  enterprise -driven  ecosystems55 organised in platform s to encourage the  share of competenc ies at different levels (e.g. innovati ve solutions, data, but also legislation, ethical  guidelines or standards).   Beside s this initiative, the Finnish G overnment highlights various support instruments and reforms to foster  collaborations in AI :                                             55  Open customer -centred ecosystem, CleverHealth Network, Communication network operations, Connected Intelligence, Corridor as a  service, Digital desig n and manufacturing excellence, Digital Fiber, Intelligent Industry Ecosystem, Intelligent Packaging, OneSea -  Autonomous Maritime Ecosystem, OuluHealth ecosystem, Research alliance for Autonomous systems, Smart building ecosystem,  Smart Otaniemi, Reboot I oT Factory.  
  54  Business Finland – Growth Engines : creating new AI business opportunities and growth areas in  Finland through an enterprise -driven partnership model of companies, research organisation s and  public actors;    Business Finland – Connected Intelligent Industries  supporting AI and digital collaboration a nd joint efforts of SMEs, large companies, R&D institutions and research organisation s at every stage of  innovation;    Business Finland – AI Business Progra mme : accelerating the global growth of the Finnish digital  service business;    Business Finland – Sustainable Manufacturing Finland Programme  focuses on renewing business  models and increasing productivity in manufacturing ecosystems, with emphasis is placed on  machine tool systems, (opto)electronics and photonics;    Support for the creation of Digital Innovation Hubs in Finland to foster the digital and AI  transformation of industries, particularly SMEs based on multi -actor networks and ecosystems;    AIPSE programme: a programme  to promote novel applications of AI in physical sciences and  engineering research with special focus on international collaborations;    DIMECC : a co -creation network to encourage breakthrough innovations and collaborations with  companies, universities and research institutions. It is a large network of R&D&I professionals from a  wide range of organisations providing support t o speed up innovations and to supply courses in  machine learning for industrial employees);    AuroraAI : a national AI programme to prepare Finland for a human -centric and ethical society in the  age of AI. It provi des a decentralised open network and data -based model for smart services and  applications. AuroraAI is speeding up the establishment of an ecosystem serving the needs of  citizens, public administration and industry.   To improve the international attractiven ess of Finland  for foreign AI talents and start -ups, the Finnish  Government launched the following initi ative:   Talent Boost  – International talents boosting growth action plan: a sectoral programme to make  Finland more attractive to international talents. To attract start -ups from outside the EU in particular,  this programme includes a Finnish Startup Permit .  In terms of monitoring and dissemination of the use and understanding of  AI to a larger population,  the Finnish G overnment provides following initiatives:    The development of a Finnish AI landscape  presenting a regularly updated list of top AI companies in  Finland . The landscape is an initiative of Finland’s Artificial Intelligence Accelerator ;    The Business Finland’s AI Business programme promoted the establishment of local AI Hubs in  Tampere and Tu rku and disseminated AI and platform economy knowledge in smaller localities;    A blog and forum on the Artificial Intelligence P rogramme  website of Finland used to share  understanding and information about the business impacts of the application of AI with concrete  examples.   5.9.4  Regulation   In December 2018  the Finnish Government has proposed a new information policy to promote the good  management and the effective utilisation of information. The government’s report on Ethical information  policy in an a ge of artificial i ntelligence  outlines principles for fair data governance, including guidelines  for  the use of information and ethical values .  Information poli cies discussed in the report relate to data access rights, data ownership, copyrights, security  and personal data protection. It constitutes the knowledge basis and a policy, upon which a roadmap with  prioritised actions can be built in the future. The dev elopment and deployment of AI raises uncertainty about  the application of the current legislation on these issues and increases the need for a reform of the legislative  and regulatory framework.   Policy recommendations or initiatives towards a reform of the legislative or regulatory framework  in  Finland include among others:    Reform of the National cybe rsecurity strategy  by the Finnish Security Committee in view of  developing comprehensive state security and expanding towards the fields of AI and digitalisation;  
  55  Act on Public Administration I nformation Management : defined the entire lifecycle of information in  public administration. This reform intends to ensure consistent management of the authorities' data  sets and secure data processing. It took effect on 1 January 2020;    A review of the Public Procurement Act  is needed in such a manner that it would enable effective  public -private co -development. In addition, public sector operators should be secured sufficient  resources and i ncentives to engage in such development, paying particular attention to sort out the  rights of  the outcomes of co -development;    The Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Finance are currently examining national regulation of  automated decision -making.  The impact assessment of algorithmic decision making is presented in a  policy report  released in 2019  and commissioned by the Finnish G overnment. The report is  entitled  “Algorithm as a dec ision maker?: Opportunities and challenges for the use of artificial intelligence in  the national regulatory environment ”;   The establishment of the Road Traf fic Act : the purpose of the new act, entering into force in June  2020, is to improve the smooth running and safety of transport and create preconditions for the  digitalisation and safe automation of traffic;    A new national intellectual property (IP) strate gy is currently in preparation to improve the present IP  situation in Finland.   In terms of ethics and values, the Finnish Government advocates the development of ethical foundations  ensuring a sustainable use of AI that rests on fundamental and human right s. The creation of ethical  principles are a first step towards a trust -based use of AI. It is should be based among others on principles of  transparency, reliability, and accountability, in which ownership and responsibilities are clearly defined. In  Febru ary 2019, the Prime Minister’s Office published a policy report commissioned by the Finnish G overnment  on Artificial intelligence in authority use - ethical and societal acceptance issu es. It studies the concepts of  ethics and acceptability in the context of technology development and application.   The Finnish G overnment has established an AI ethics committee to gain understanding on ethical principles  and to ensure that Finland’s AI deve lopment is human -oriented and based on trust. Policies directed to the  development of ethical guidelines  include:    Setting up an AI ethics challenge on the Artificial Intelligence P rogramme  website to incentivise  companies to contribute to the creation of ethical principles for AI;    Preparing the foundations for ethical guidelines in the public administration's eco system -based  AuroraAI programme;    Continuing the research project on Ethical AI for  the Governance of the Society ( ETAIROS ). This  project is funded by the Academy of Finland and has several Finnish universities as collaborators. The  objective is to study and co -create governance frameworks and tools, which respond to the challenge  of socially sustainable use of AI;    Helsinki's AI register (in partnership with the city of Amsterdam): Helsinki and Amsterdam have  launched open AI regis ters that track how algorithms are being used in the municipalities. A White  paper on the AI register was published on September 2020 to inspire other  governments/org anisations wanting to be transparent about  their use of algorithms and AI;    Online course on Ethics of AI : this course helps public administration, businesses and the general  public understand what the ethical u se of AI means and what it requires from both society and  individuals. The course offered by the University of Helsinki has been designed in a partnership  between the Cities of Helsinki, Amsterdam and London as well as Finland’s Ministry of Finance.   5.9.5  Infras tructure   While several data infrastructure initiatives are deployed at large scale, others are proposed in a restricted  environment and serve as regulatory sandboxes. In the public sector, regulatory sandboxes can for instance  serve to 1) pilot opportuniti es for second use of personal data by the public sector with consent of citizens, 2)  evaluate the usefulness for citizens and 3) prepare an appropriate legislative framework for successful  deployment.   In terms of data infrastructure with a regulatory sandb ox philosophy , the Finnish G overnment  propo ses the following policy initiative  among others:  
  56  Providing support to the MyData  service56: a human -centred, open and compatible data management  approach fostering data interoperability, sharing and protection of individual’s rights on personal  data.   A committee on Data and platform economy has been established to propose policy to facilitate the  construction and use of data resources in all sectors. These initiatives ar e complemented and in line with an  Open Sci ence P olicy to coordinate and foster a research community in which open science aims can be  reached and monitored.   To foster the digital infrastructure  for research purposes, the Ministry of Education and Culture has  developed a research infrastructure development programme  for data management and computing  with  research and innovation actors in 2017−2021. The dev elopment programme  foresaw an investment of EUR  37 million in data management and computing infrastructures and related services.  Finland is also  participating in the EuroHPC  initiative on the development of high -performance computing. The procurement  contract of LUMI , a new EuroHPC precursor to exascale supercomputers, h as been signed by the European  High Performance Computi ng Joint Undertaking  and the company Hewlett Packard Enterprise, the selected  vendor.   5.9.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The initiative of Business Finland – Growth Engines  aims at creating new AI business opportunities and growth  areas in Finland through cooperation networks between companies, research organisation s and public  actors.  Among others, the initiative foresees support through capital funding with an earmarked budget of  EUR 30  million in 2019.  A competitive bidding is organised to select the promising  ideas and to promote ecosystem  operators that generate at least EUR 1 billion of revenues.   In 2019  Business Finland selected 4 winning projects  on the competitive bid ding on Growth Engines. These  projects are estimated to generate nearly EUR 6 billion of new revenue in Finland, over EUR 9 billion in new  exports and as many as 100,000 new jobs over the next decade. The technology areas of the winning projects  are closel y related to the use of AI and curbing the climate change : atmospheric carbon sequestration  markets, smart ports, a marketplace for AI and new solutions for renewable energy production.  The winning  projects are:    Compensate project – Growth boost for the ma rket for carbon sequestration: Compensate is a non profit foundation that brings together people and companies to stop climate change;    Awake.AI project – Smart ports and shipping: The goal of Awake is to be the world’s most trusted  smart ports and autonomo us shipping platform and a global ecosystem orchestrator by 2025;    Silo.AI project – Marketplace for AI: The main goal of the Silo.AI ecosystem is to generate new  business by the operators through AI -driven solutions and processes and commercialize Finnish top  expertise;    Flexens project – From a trial on the societal scale on renewable energy production to a global  provider of comprehensive solutions: Flexens is a platform that offers combined solutions for the  cost-effective integration of renewable energy production.   In addition, t he Finnish Environment Institute ( SYKE ) – a research institute and government agency under the  Ministry of the Environment – supports environmental policies  by collecting environmental information  suitable to decision -making. To this purpose, they are developing new environmental information methods  that use deep learning, complex optimis ation and AI to enable the faster utilisation of information in addition  to welcome information produced by citizens.   In 2020, the Finnish Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment published a report analysis  focusing on  industrial platforms and data -enabled value creation linked to industrial ecosystems.   COVID -19 pandemic   The Finnish Centr e for Artificial Intelligence ( FCAI) is developing several projects  to manage the COVID -19  crisis by means of AI recogn ising that “ AI and machine learning methods can help in, for instance, outbreak                                             56  The following white paper published by the Finnish Ministry of Transport and Communications provides more details about the a im and  working of the MyData service: https:/ /mydatafi.wordpress.com/portfolio/publications/ .  
  57 prediction, tracking and epidemiological modelling, drug development, and healthcare management ”. The FCAI  together with the Helsinki Centre for Data Science ( HiDATA ) also published a series of webinars  to shed light  on how AI-based systems and data science could be of help while fighting against COVID -19.   Furthermore, an instant COVID -19 breath alyzer has been developed as part of a Co -created and Wellbeing  project funded by Finland's Helsinki -Uusimaa Regional Council , a joint regional authority for the region. The  developed technology uses AI to identify the novel coronavirus in air exhaled by patients   Furthermore, the Finnish Government has set up a website  to look for information on the coronavirus by  telephone and chat and has the intention to introduce an application  to trace chains of  virus transmission  which will be likely ready by August . The  application – called Ketju – was funded by the Finnish innovation  fund Sitra and was  piloted at Vaasa Central Hospital. Based on Bluetooth technology, it is meant to provide  confidential reporting of any encounters between users to trace COVID -19 contagions. Furthermore, the  Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare ( THL), in cooperation with Esri Finland Oy, produced an open map  application  displaying the data from the National Infectious Diseases Register about the confirmed cases in  Finland.   5.9.7  Monitoring and future update   In 2017, the Finnish Government has launched the Artificial Intelligence Programme  to draw up an AI strategy  for Finland. The programme has been finalised in spring 2019 and delivered among others three policy  reports with concrete policy actions as outlined above. In the final report, the steering gr oup of the Artificial  Intelligence Programme has produced an implementation plan for the comin g years and presents a vision for   Finland in the a ge of AI till 2025.  In November 2020, Finland has launched an updated national AI strategy.  The Artificial Intelligence 4.0 Programme  promotes the development and introduction of AI (AI) and other  digital technologies in companies , with a special focus on  SMEs . In the first interim report , published in April  2021, the programme presented a vision for the future of the Finnish manufacturing industry, stating that in  2030 the Finnish manufacturing industry will be clean, efficient and digital, As stated in the report, seamless  collaboration between high -speed telecommunications networks, cloud computing and AI are central to digital  transformation .     
  58 5.10 France    In March 2018, Emmanuel Macron, the President of the French Republic presented his vision and a 5-year  nationa l AI strategy. The French AI strategy is entitled AI for humanity  (France, 2018a) and has been  developed on the basis of the AI policy report  (France, 2018b) prepared by French Member of Parliament  (MP)  and renowned mathematician Cédric Villani.   The main objectives of the French AI strategy as highlighted by the French President are to:    Improve the AI education and training eco system to develop , retain  and attract world -class AI talent;    Establish an open data policy for the implementation of AI applications and pooling assets together;    Develop an ethical framework for a transparent and fair use of AI applications.   To this purpos e, the French G overnment will dedicate EUR 1.5 billion to the development of AI by the end of  2022, including EUR 700 million for research.   In 2021, the Prime Minister Jean Castex announced a renewed open and shared data strategy following a  2020 Report by  MP Eric Bothorel which includes data and datasets for AI.   Also, the 4th generation of the multi -year National Investment for the Future Programme is being framed in  2022. One sub -programme will be dedicated to AI and several other sub -programmes will incl ude actions  related to the National AI Strategy. This will allow updating the National AI Strategy funding and secure  budget slots corresponding to the EU renewed Coordinated Plan.   5.10.1  Human capital   In order to reduce the AI, data science and  robotics skills gap on the labour market, t he AI strategy will  continue to provide financial incentives to higher education and research institutions to increase the provision  of initial training at all levels, intermediate and expert, dual programmes and  the retraining or upgrading of  talent.  Initiatives to increase diversity in computer science and AI are being deployed.    The number of graduates at Masters’ level has doubled since 2016 and a new doubling target has  been set;    The range of training courses , in initial and part -time continuing education, summer or winter schools  and executive programmes altogether has increased rapidly in 2019 -2021, especially in the 4  Interdisciplinary Insti tutes of Artificial Intelligence (3IA)  created in 2019: Toulouse -ANITI , Nice-Côte  d’Azur 3IA , Grenoble -MIAI and Paris-PR[AI]RIE , but also in 3 other major education and research  centres specialized on data science, AI and Robotics: Paris-Saclay -Institut  data-IA, Institut  Polytechnique de Paris -Hi! and Paris-Sorbonne -SCAI;   Foster education of all players involved in the "algorithmic chain" (designers, pro fessionals, citizens) ,  including intermediate capacities for the working force  and enable each citizen to improve its digital  literacy to better understand the inner working of machines and the benefits of AI.   In terms of vocational training and lifelong l earning  initiatives, the French G overnment highlights:    The formation of the Grande Ecole du Numérique ( GEN): created to support training that helps to  integrate people at risk of unemployment to the job market by developing their digital skills;    The move towards  quality labelling, certification and integration into rich professional training paths,  including re-skilling and up -skilling, such as the efforts by the OPIIEC digital occupations observatory .  The deployment of AI technologies will have a major impact on the job market. According to France’s  Employment Orientation Council roughly half of the occupations could be automated  in the medium to long  term. To tac kle this issue, the French AI strategy devotes particular attention to a better understanding of  future labour demand and skill needs  to prepare successfully for professional transitions. The following  policy recommendation is targeting increased labour ma rket intelligence and forward -looking skills  predictions:    The creation of a public laboratory on the transformation of work to encourage reflection on the  ways in which automation is changing occupations and to provide support for professional  transitions.      
  59 5.10.2  From the lab to the market   The goals set by the National AI strategy extensively rely on applied research and innovation. The  responsibility for coordinating the research side of the AI national  strategy has been given to the French  national research in stitute for the digital sciences (Inria),  with a clear objective: to strengthen the entire  French AI sector , accelerate technology spinoffs or transfers, and develop cooperation programmes wit h the  industry . Among others, the research institute will coordinate the strategy’s implementation, provide scientific  and technological expertise and develop bilateral cooperation initiatives, in particular with Germany.   The network of interdisciplinary AI research institutes within universities relies on some form of specialisation,  directly linked to the regional academic and economic ecosystem. Incitation schemes have been developed,  implying that 1 euro of private partners’ investment in collaborative R&D&I programmes results in 1  additional euro of state funding.   So far, the National AI strategy has helped to create 180 additional  academic chairs and  300 additional PhDs  in AI disciplines.  Many other non -profit institutions help creating an innovation -friendly ecosystem and  translating the strategy into reality:    Several of the 16 Technology Research Institutes (IRT) or Energy Transition Institutes (ITE) help  leading partnering projects in AI, among which IRT-System X on Trustworthy AI , IRT Saint -Exupery  on  Complex Systems embedding AI, IRT nanoele c on hardware components, ITE Efficacity  in the Smart  City domain, ITE Vedecom in the automotive industry. The association of IRT and  ITE has developed a  cross -institutes AI Programme, called EngageAI ;   Several of the 53 French sectoral poles de compétitivité (Innovation Clusters) also develop active AI  ecosystem animation, with a view to disseminate AI in industry, such as Aix Safe Cluster  (Safe city  and secur ity), Systematic -Paris-Region  (Deep Tech), Paris-Cap-Digital , Medicen Paris Region  (Health),  Rouen Mov’eo  (Mobility), and the Toulouse Aerospace Valley ;   The Teralab Institute  provides technological resources and a whole ecosyste m of experts companies,  to remove scientific and technolo gical obstacles faced by organis ations wishing to exploit their data  and accelerate experimentation and technology transfer.   The AI for Humanity strategy prioritises  policy support for research and i nnovation to specific sectors  that  show sufficient maturity to embrace major AI transformations: health, transport, the environment,  defence and security . Hence, this will require sector -specific policy, including sector -specific data platforms  for data co mpilation and exchange, large -scale computing infrastructures and testing facilities. While many of  these aspects touch upon infrastr ucture (cf. below), the French G overnment advocates creating test areas  to facilitate the design and deployment of AI techn ologies :   Implement test areas and innovation sandboxes to facilitate experimentation in real -life conditions  while temporarily reducing the regulatory burd ens to help testing innovations;    The economic national operator bpifrance  (public investment bank France) also operates yearly  generic funding, prizes and labels schemes that target the digital transition at large but whose share  of AI projects has been steadily increasing. It proves essential to consider AI inno vation as an applied  and integrative endeavour.   5.10.3  Networking   Following initiatives are envisaged  to foster networks and collaborations in AI :   Inria will coordinate the network of French AI expertise by means of the development of the 3IA  Institutes and other research -oriented collaborative support mechanisms;    Trilateral French -Japanese -German research p rojects on AI: The French National Research Agen cy  (ANR) together with the German Research Foundation ( DFG), and the Japan Science and Technology  Agency ( JST) is announcing the first trilateral call for research proposals on AI. This call is intended to  support collaborative projects of trilateral research teams over 3 years, bringing together research  partners from France, Germany, and Japan;    Fostering of public -private laboratories, so called LabComs to encourage collaborat ive AI re search  and innovations;    Inria and the DFKI, signed a memorandum of understanding aimed at building a strategic partnership  between France and Germany on AI. The goal is to pool strengths in order to overcome obstacles in 
  60 the fields of health, cybersecurity , robotics and industry. More information about this collaboration is  presented on page 11 of the 2020 activity r eport  of Inria;    Participating to the Gl obal Partnership on AI ( GPAI): a declaration has been signed between France  and Canada to start a project on the creation of an international initiative to spur a responsible  development and use of AI in full respect of hum an rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and  economic growth. The GPAI collaborates with international partners and organisations to bring  together experts from industry, civil society, governments and the academic world. This initiative is  stirred by a  secretariat, hosted by the OECD in Paris, and it accounts for two Centres of Expertise in  Montreal and in Paris.   To foster the international attractiveness of AI  in France, the French strategy expresses the need for  policies to boost France’s appeal to expatriates and foreign talent by improving working conditions and  salaries of researchers.   5.10.4  Regulation   Ethical matters to ensure a fair and transparent use of AI te chnologies and algorithms are central to the  French AI strategy. In this regard, Cédric Villani ’s recommend ation  in the AI policy report  to create a “digital  technology and AI ethics committee in charge of leading public discussion in a transparent way, and organised  and governed by law” has effectively led to the creation early 2020 of a Pilot National Digital Ethics  Committee (CNPEN) . In the pilot phase, it has been tasked about 3 areas of AI ethics but will extend  progressively its outreach.   5.10.5  Infrastructure   The French strategy highlights the following data policy  initiatives:    The AI -specialized high -performance computer infrastructure Jean ZAY , inaugurated in early 2020  and currently running at 28 petaflops capacity (X 2 since inauguration);    The CASD secure Data Hub , a public interest group bringing together the State represented by  the  French National Institute of Statistics  (INSEE ), Groupe des Écoles Nationales d'Économie et  Statistique  (GENES ), the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS ), École Polytechnique  and HEC Paris to help exchange securely sensitive in protected data for R&D projects;    Data sharing in private sector: the French G overnment has funded many AI Challenges (3rd season  2020) to help sponsors tackle data valorisation and problem resolution through AI in cooper ation  with start -ups and other innovators, and also funded several data hub projects to foster the setting  up and development of sectoral data spaces (namely in agriculture, alimenta tion, logistics, health,  sport ), to be fully integrated in European data s paces ;   Encourage  the creation of data commons  fit for the AI age, including the provision of open data sets,  and more real -time open data . This perspective is reflected in the National plan for open s cience ;   Increased data portability: the right to data portability should be supported, allowing mig ration of  data from one service ecosystem to another without losing data history.   In terms of digital and telecom infrastructure  to encourage the development of machine learning and AI  algorithms, the French strategy strongly supports and participates  in the following policy initiative:    The GAIA-X project , initiated by Germany and France,  is to create a secure, federated data system  that meets the highest standards of digi tal sovereignty while prom oting innovation.   5.10.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The AI policy report, prepared by French MP Cédric Villani,  includes  a chapter entitled Using artificial  intelligence to help create a more ecological e conomy  with recommendation s to:   Fostering g reener AI : within this area, public authorities are called to suppor t a greener value chain  and the ecological transition of the European cloud in dustry;    Promoting the d issemination of ecological d ata: open ecological data (i.e. data on weather,  agriculture, transport, energy, biodiversity, climate, waste, land registry an d energy performance 
  61 assessments) are the key point around which green AI technologies can develop and promote  ecological transition.   Another AI policy report , published in 2019, on the prospective of AI in France commissioned by the Ministry  of the Territorial Cohesion and the Ministry of Economy and Finance, presents a similar signal. It highlights the  need to strengthen the national ambition for the use of AI to the benefit of the ene rgy sector and the  environment . Among others, it calls for the development of intelligent energy networks through the use of  Smart grids (based on smart meters and appli ances), and new generations of s upervisory control and data  acquisition  (SCADA)  with high levels of digitalisation and remote control interventions.  A cutting -edge  infrastructure can enhance the deployment of AI applications for the optimisation of energy consumption, a  higher quality service on the network, and better energy storage capacities.   With respect to the environment, the use of AI could be beneficial in the following areas:    Reduction of the use of natural resources;    Anticipating environmental risks;    Increasing the efficiency and integration of renewable energy sources.   Lastly, researchers in optimisation and AI at Inria Lille - North Europe  have successfully completed Perf-AI, a  research project executed in the framework of the European H2020 programme. Carried out in collaboration  with a start -up from the aeronautics sector, and based on the analysis of flight data, the project led to the  development of digital aircraft models enabling the optimisation of flight plans. Perf -AI thus offers a solution  to reduce the energy consumption of commercial airline s.  COVID -19 pandemic   In terms of AI -related policies to response specifically to the COVID -19 pandemic, following  collaborative   initiatives are ongoing or in preparation:    Within the framework of the GPAI a working group on AI and pandemic response ( AIPR) has been  formed to promote cross -sectoral and cross -border collaboration in this area. In November 2020, the  working group released a report  outlining its mandate and providing recommendations to foster and  support the responsible development and use of AI -enabled solutions to address COVID -19 and  future pandemics ;   The French Ministries of Social Affairs and Health Education and of Research and Innovation are  supporting 20 research projects  to fight against the COVID -19 of which one employs AI to  reconstitute the COVID -19 replication process, to model it, and to finally test  suitable inhibitors.   Furthermore, in the fight of the COVID -19 pandemic, the French National Institute of Health and Medical  Research ( INSERM ) and researchers at the University of Paris created a national phone line operated by  intelligent digital assistants. The name of this service is AlloCOVID  and it operates with AI –based virtual phone  assistants that can respond to more than a thousand people at the same time (24/7). In addition,  French  authorities have integrated new AI tools in the security cameras of the Paris metro system, which could be  expanded to other public transport means. The software was developed by French start-up DatakaLab  to  create anonymous data that will help authorities anticipate future outbreaks of COVID -19.  5.10.7  Monitoring and future update   Inria, the French national research ins titute for the digital sciences, has committed to play a prominent role as  coordinator of the national AI strategy. It is responsible for  its impleme ntation, in particular  on its research  and innovation side.   Launched in 2018 the first phase of the French  national strategy in AI, with a budget of EUR 800 million for 3  years, put a strong emphasis (1/3 of spending) on boosting research, with the creation of interdisciplinary  institutes 3IA, the extra financing of 180 PhDs and the opening of a petascale supe rcomputing facility.   The second phase of this strategy (2021 -2022) sets main priorities  on the upscaling of education and   training, development of embedded AI and trustworthy AI in critical systems in order to strengthen the  nationa l industrial base while accelerating the digital and ecological transition of companies thanks to AI.
  62 5.11 Germany    In November 2018, the German Federal Government launched its National AI strategy  jointly developed by  the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Ene rgy, and the  Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs  (Germany, 2018) .  The strategy presents the progress made in terms of AI in Germany, the goals to achieve in the future and a  concrete plan of policy actions to realise them. The range of policy ini tiatives outlined in the strategy aim to  achieve the following goals:    Increasing and consolidating Germany’s future competitiveness by making Germany and Europe a  leading centre in AI;    Guaranteeing a responsible development and deployment of AI which serve s the good of society;    Integrating AI in society in ethical, legal, cultural and institutional terms in the context of a broad  societal dialogue and active political measures.   The German  Federal Government published an interim report  presenting the main measures that have been  implemented of the German AI Strategy after one year in November 2019. It provides facts and figures o n  the implementation of the strategy, fields of actions and perspectives for the coming years.   In October, 2019, the Federal Governments Data Ethics Commission presented its ethical guidelines and  specific recommendations  on AI, a lgorithm -based decision making and the use of data.   In October 2020, the Study Commission on Artificial Intelligence - Social Responsibility and Economic, Social  and E cological Potential of the 19th German Bundestag presented its final report with specific  recommen dations for action , on which the German Bundestag concluded its deliberations on 5 November.   In December 2020, the  German  Federal Government has adopted an Updated AI strategy  (Germany, 2020).  The review draws up an interim balance, shows relevant developments at national, European and international  level, and sets out concrete measures to be implemented by 2022. The update report focuses on the  following fields of action: research, knowledge an d expertise, transfer and application, regulatory framework  and society. In addition, new initiatives will inter alia focus on sustainability, environment/climate protection,  pandemic control and international/European cooperation.   With the Economic stimulus and futur e package , the German  Federal Government committed to increase the  planned expenditure of EUR 3 billion for the promotion of AI by an additional EUR 2 billion, resulting in a total  of EUR 5 billion by 2025.   The summary below aims to provide the most recent  and updated picture of ongoing AI policies in Germany.57   5.11.1  Human capital   The German strategy proposes several  policy reforms and initiatives for formal training and  education , with special focus to the formation of educators, trainers and the general publi c in order to  guarantee a high -quality level of education in AI:    Expanding learning platforms such as the AI Campus  to develop a solid skill base in AI through  courses, videos, podcasts and knowledge exchange ;   Creation  of at least 100 additional professorships in the field of AI to ensure that AI has a strong  foothold within t he higher education system. AI professorships are for instance planned at the  centres of excellence for AI and in the scope of the Tenure Track Pr ogramme and the Excellence  Strategy;    Getting students more involved in STEM subjects as outlined in the STEM Action Plan.   On top of formal education and training reforms, the  German  Federal Government proposes a broad -based  set of instruments to expand and  upgrade AI -related skills of the workforce . As the required skills of  individuals will change significantly with the upcoming AI technologies, the  German  Federal Government  launches some large -scale qualifications initiatives with attention for lifelong l earning and for reskilling and  upskilling employees across their entire careers:                                              57  A comprehensive overview of national strategies, national expert platforms, and national programmes and initiatives on digita l  technologies (including AI) is also presented on the German Digital Technologies  portal.   
  63  The creation of the National skills s trategy  to promote advanced vocational training in digital and AI related aspects among others. The Mittelstand  4.0 centres of excellence  for SMEs has successfully  deployed and expanded AI trainer programmes  to suppor t skills development for businesses58;   The launch of INVITE (Digital Platform for Continuing Vocational Training) innovation competition  projects for the design of an innovative, user -oriented and coherent digital continuing education and  training area;    The formation of regional Centres of Excellence for Labour Research studying and organising labour  in an AI working environment and imparting the necessary skills to management and the workforce;    The expansion of AI education programmes such as the online cou rse on Elements of AI  (with a  governmental patronage) .  Other policy instruments aim to identify upcoming skills demand and to respond in a flexible way to the  digital and demographic changes of labour demand  on the job market. Hence, these initiatives aim at  satisfying and bridging the needs of both the workforce and companies:    The creation of a Skilled labour s trategy : a skills m onitoring system to identify which skills are  needed in the future;    The formation of regional Hubs of tomorrow to address companies and employees with tailored  information and innovative learning approaches in order to shape change.   The German  Federal Government also pay s attention to the possibilities and impact of AI in the cultural and  media sector . These include the funding and expanding of AI projects for the preservation, development,  accessibility, networking and communication of cultural  programmes as well as the development of AI skills in  categorising and verifying media content to ensure diversity of opinion.   5.11.2  From the lab to the market   Funding schemes and support initiatives to foster research in the field of AI  comprise among others:    Creation of Competence Centres for AI Research : The  German  Federal Government  has  established multiple national competence centres for AI research to strengthen excellence and  competitiveness and to become a leading centre for AI research. To support their  expansion and their  development into a national research network on AI the ministry has doubled the funding of the  competence centres until 2022. As mentioned in the Updated AI strategy  (p. 12), “ the plan is to  dovetail the existing centres at the universities in Berlin, Dresden/Leipzig, Dortmund/St. Augustin,  Munich and Tübingen and the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence with other application  hubs to be established to form a network of at least twelve centres and hubs ”;   The launch of a Reality Lab for Artificial Intelligence  in Civil Protection: operated by the German  Federal Agency for Technical Relief ( THW). This living lab it is meant to offer an interface between  the Security Research Community, AI researchers and industry. It will also link AI research and  developments with practitioner needs. The la b aims at testing and developing solutions that make AI  based technologies accessible and useable for practitioners. Another core task is the development of  data collection concepts, for which specific tools and equipment will be created to enable future A I  applications. The THW living lab is funded through special funding of the German Federal  Government from 2019 to 2022;    Gruender platform : online platform to support start -ups – including AI ones – from initia l research  to concrete AI applications;    Industrial Collective Research  programme fostering joint business and science research on collective  AI projects  in order to close the gap between basic research and industrial applications;    Advisory and funding services  to foster the growth of AI start -ups (e.g. EXIST  programme  focusing on university spinoffs) through for instance venture debt (e.g. Tech Growth Fund). This can  also include policies to promote company format ions in the field of top -rate research in human machine interaction.   Support initiatives towards innovation and testing  include:                                              58 For more information on human capacity building in AI in Germany, see Germany’s human -centred approach to AI  on the OECD AI  Policy Observatory.

The German  Federal Government also has research and innovation support programmes in targeted areas  with dedicated AI policies in specific sectors and geographical areas . The updated AI strategy in 2020  highlights following pri ority areas:  healthcare, environment and climate, aerospace, and mobility .  Examples of policy initiatives are mentioned below and in Section 5.11.6:    Digital innovations for the improvement of patient -centred care in the health care system : Within  the funding programme  "Digital innovations for the improvement of patient -centred care in the  health care system", the  German  Federal Government  has so far funded 22 projects for up to 36  months over the period 2020 -2023 with a total funding amount of approximately EUR 50 millio n.  The projects will investigate the benefits of smart sensors, smart data use, smart decision support  systems and smart communication in clinically relevant application scenarios. The projects should  contribute to demonstrating the potential benefits of AI methods in combination with the use and  evaluation of large amounts of data for patient care;    Research on AI technologies in agriculture, health nutrition, food chain and rural areas : The  German Federal Government initiated a government funding of AI tec hnologies in agriculture, health  nutrition, food chain and rural areas with a public announcement in February 2020. A total of 82  plans were submitted with overall 305 subprojects and a total funding about EUR 92 million;    Real-World Test Field for Digital Mobility : The  German  Federal Government  is funding this large scale research project  that combines elements of classical traffic planning with mobility and  innovation management, also using AI. A total of 10 sub -projects on digital mobility are being  implemented in parallel and scientifically monitored in order to deduce how digitalisation can  effectively contribute to achieving the climate goals in the m obility sector;    Data Space Mobility Germany : under the direction of the German Academy of Science and  Engineering ( acatech ), a stakeholder dialogue is currently taking place to jointly create a  comprehensive Data Space Mobility Germany by the end of 2021. Among other things, the aim is to  make available mobility  data (real and synthetic training and test data) that can be use d across  competitors for the research, development, validation and certification of reliable AI algorithms in  order to promote the development of autonomous driving  in Germany.   5.11.3  Networking   The German strategy highlights a wide range of policy initiatives to  foster networks and collaborations   across the business community, academia and public research centres. The aim of networking is to encourage  the development of multidisciplinary cutting -edge research and innovation projects and to fully exploit  synergies  and diversities across institutional players by promoting knowledge dissemination and transfers.   Support initiativ es of the  German  Federal Government to encourage collaborations include:    The formation of a Franco -German R&D network  (“virtual centre”): bi lateral funding and training  programme with bilateral AI clusters in specific industries (e.g. healthcare, environment, robotics,  mobility);    Expanding the Plattform Lernende Syst eme into an AI platform  to host dialogue and networking  between science, business community, civil society and the government. To foster networking and  increase the international visibility of German’s AI research, the  German  Federal Government   launched the map on AI . This map allows to discover innovative applications and projects on AI and  to identify and learn more about all research institutions active in AI (including the AI competence  centres and Digital Innovation Hubs);    Platform Industrie4.0 : a platform  with a holistic approach to the shaping of digital ecosystems. It  aims at supporting and p romoting innovations and collaborations in a digital economy, with recently  a more targeted focus on AI technologies;  
  65  The development of Next Generation Clusters : The aim of the in itiative is to transfer fundamental,  developable results from cutting -edge research into products and services, with a strong emphasis  on collaborative partnerships;    Further development of the Digital Hub initiativ e and the Hubs for Tomorrow  initiative in Germany,  in particular those related to AI, cybersecurity and other AI -related fields;    Establishment of the “ Civic Coding - Innovation Network AI for the Common Good ”: The  German   Federal Government  is develop ing an innovation  ecosystem that aims at fostering " AI for the  greater good ". It aims at providing know -how, financial assistance to AI projects, a matching  platform that brings together start -ups, NGOs, scien tists and governmental agencies, as well as a  collaborative data exchange infrastructure for non -profits and civil society actors. The  German   Federal Government will combine different  specific expertise, synchronize funding strategies and  provide support w ith a targeted infrastructure. It will establish Civic Tech Labs for Green , which  will focus on developing sustainable and broadly accessible IT infrastructure and tools. Moreover the  German Federal Government will facilitate data exchange among civil soci ety actors by means of a  newly established Civic Data Lab . A Civic Innovation Platform , which serves to provide a  marketplace for ideas  on the use of AI -technology for the common good  and facilitates access to  funding opportunities. The joint project is cu rrently underway with a variety of pilot projects and the  establishment of project infrastructure. The innovation network  was officially launch ed in May 2021   and start operation s at the end of  2021.   Another field of action is international cooperation on A I:    The German  Federal Government is working to ensure that the further development and use of AI is  aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG s). International networking and  collaboration  with developing and emerging countries plays an important role to enable everyone   to participate in the use of AI technologies and to develop AI applications for sustainable economic,  ecological and social development . The German Federal Government  is str engthening AI capacity  building and better access to open AI training data  in the Global South to support inclusive and fair AI  innovation . In addition to this, its initiative  FAIR Forward  is supporting the development of suitable  political and regulatory frameworks for AI, such as the framework by the governmental alliance  “Smart Africa”, which is developing regulatory recommendations on AI for 30 African member  countries;     The German  Federal Government  supports the establishment of international and multilateral  structures for networking and cooperation in the area of AI: Germany is one of the founding  members of the Global Partnership on AI  (GPAI), an inte rnational initiative to spur a responsible  development and use of AI in full respect of human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and  economic growth. The GPAI bring s together experts from industry, civil society, governments and the  academic world. T his initiative is stirred by a secretariat, hosted by the OECD in Paris, and it accounts  for two Centres of Exp ertise in Montreal and in Paris;    Germany also contributes to the ongoing work of the OECD on AI . AI is a priority area of the  OECD’s work in the field of  the digital transformation.  In May 2019 the OECD adopted its Principles  on AI, the first international standards  on AI agreed by governments. T he OECD.AI Policy Observatory,  launched in February 2020, aims to help policymakers implement the AI Principles  and is supported  by a Network of Experts on AI (ONE AI) . The German Federal Government supports the OECD  programme Artificial Intelligence in Work, Innovation, Productivity and Skills (AI -WIPS), whose results  and findings will make a major contribution to shaping the global AI debate.   Concerning efforts to foster the international attractiveness  of the country, the  German  Federal  Government aims to improve working conditions and remunerati on to draw in and retain and attract the  brightest minds. Along this side, the German strategy also proposes reforms of legislation to facilitate  immigration procedures for skilled workers. Notable policy initiatives to attract AI experts and researchers,  include:    Alexander von Humboldt Professorship: With a value of EUR 5 million, the Alexander von Humboldt  Professorship  is the most highly -endowed research award in Germany and draws top international  researchers to German universities. From 2020 to 2024, additional Humboldt Professorships can be  awarded in the field of AI; 
  66  Support to young female AI researchers: In order to increase the participation of women in German  research on AI, women will be promot ed in leading interdisciplinary research groups, with a particular  focus on reconciling work and family life. The selection process will be competitive.   Other initiatives aim to monitor current progress and uptake of AI  and to disseminate nation -wide  information about digitalisation and AI:    Strengthening the Observatory for Artificial Intelligence in Work and Society  (AI Observatory ) to  monitor the uptake and impact of AI in society a nd the future of work. The Observatory was launched  on 3 March 2020. Among others, the Observatory conducts impact analyses, scenario development  and trend monitoring of the use of AI and provides guidelines and recommendations for enhancing  skills, the de velopment of AI and use of it on the shop floor,  and social dialogue in the field of AI;    Monitoring the AI landscape by compiling indicators on the use of AI in the economy  and in higher  education and teaching  and in work and society ;   Establishing a Digital Work and Society Future Fund to set up an information and policy campaign in  the field of digital technologies such as AI and to promote multidisciplinary social technology design.   5.11.4  Regulation   As a body established by lawmakers, the Study Commission on Artificial Intelligence repeatedly examined  regulatory issues relating to AI. In its final report , the Study Commission provides recommendations for  actions. Among others, the Study Commission calls for sector -specific regulatory regimes for AI, while  ensuring principles of proportionality and  liability.   In line with these recommendations, the  German  Federal Government  launched initiatives to tackle among  others issues related to information management, data ownership, free flow of data, and standardisation.  Reforms of the legislation target ma ny domains, including codifying the rights of the labour force,  consolidating competitiveness of the industry and developing rules with respect to data use and protection.   Following initiatives provide initial steps towards a legislative framework for AI :   The launch of a Commission on Competition Law 4.0 serving as a political platform for a debate on  how to further develop competition and copyright law. In 2019 the Commission presented its report  on “A new competition framework for the digital e conomy ”. The Competition and Digitalisation A ct  adopted by the Cabinet on 9 September 2020 addresses several of the Commission’s  recommendations and implements them where this is essential to ensure functioning competition,  for instance when it comes to improving access to data;    The Federal Data Protec tion Act codifies data protection regulation and privacy (i.e. safeguard the  control on personal data), compliant with EU law;    Review and if necessary adaption of the legislation concerning the use of non -personal data as well  as copyright; inter alia: the  German  Federal Government’s Data s trategy  and Open d ata strategy ;   Implementation of the cyber security directive: this directive properly known as the Directive on  security of network and information systems (NIS) requires Member States to adopt a national cyber security strategy. In Germany it has been implemented by the NIS Implementation Act in June 2017.   The German  Federal Government advocates using an “ethics by design” approach throughout all the  development stages and use of AI -based applications. It recommends engaging in dialogue with other leading  regions to r each an agreement on joint guidelines and ethical standards on AI. Hence, the strategy foresees to  work on a legal and  ethical framework  aligned with European guidelines and where appropriate taking into  account recommendations of the national Data Ethics Commission. Several initiatives tried to define ethical  guidelines for AI in Germany:    Guidelines for developing and using AI systems : The Data Ethics Commission ( DEC) presented their  recommendations  in October 2019 containing general principles to ensure the ethical design and use  of data and algorithmic systems;    Ethical requirements to ensure transparency, verifiability and predictability of AI systems (e.g. ethical  guidelines  for self -driving cars).   Besides ethical guidelines and legislative reforms, standards form an essential aspect of an adequate and  effective regulatory framework. Stan dards ensure high quality products and services. They reinforce security  and open up possibilities towards collaboration due to higher degrees of comparability and interoperability. 
  67 Overall, standards for AI increase the public trust in the use and deploym ent of AI applications. With respect  to standardisation , the German  Federal Government proposes the following support initiatives:    The German standardisation r oadmap on AI describes the environment in which AI standardisation  operates, identifies existing standards and specificatio ns relevant to the field of AI, and outlines  further standardisation needs. Even though it is a national publication, it focuses primarily on  European and international standardisation efforts. In addition, it formulates concrete  recommendations for action  which are aimed primarily at industry, but also at stakeholders in quality  infrastructure, research and policy. The Roadmap was developed by the national standards  organisations DIN and DKE in cooperation with the  German  Federal Government as part of the  German AI Strategy, along with more than 300 experts from industry, science, the public sector and  civil society;    Funding for the development of data standards and formats to encourage EU -wide collaborations;    Funding for experts, particularly from SMEs and  start-us in order to support their participation in  international standardisation processes.   5.11.5  Infrastructure   Regarding infrastructure the  German  Federal Government foresees to expand the current data infrastructure  in order to create optimal conditions for the development of cutting -edge AI applications. The objective of  data infrastructure investments is to obtain a trustworthy data and analysis environment to strengthen  research in AI and to favour exchanges due to a more flexible data interoperability. In addition, the German AI  strategy aims to develop the current telecommunication and digital infrastructure to ensure a better  connectivity of t he network and to improve cyber security. Lastly, the  German  Federal Government is setting  up funding to foster learning capabilities and experimentation in AI by improving the digital infrastructure in  the education system.   In particular, the German stra tegy foresees the following initiatives for the improvement of the  infrastructure in AI :   Improving data sharing facilities by providing open access to governmental data and improving the  infrastructure for access to the Earth observation data;    Building a t rustworthy data and analysis infrastructure based on cloud platforms and upgraded  storage and computing capacity;    Setting up a National Research Data infrastructure ( NFDI) to provide science -driven data services to  research communities;    Improving security and performance of information and communication systems with particular  focus on resilience of AI -systems in case of attacks;    Providing funding from the Digital Pact for Sch ools programme to improve digital infrastructure in  schools;    Expanding the Learning Factories 4.0 initiative, which sets up professionally equipped laboratories  and puts them at disposal of stude nts for learning purposes in AI;    Introducing PLAIN – Platform  Analysis and Information System by the  German  Federal Government  as a blue print for government big data and AI applications.   Cornerstone initiatives in German’s preparation for the next-generation data infrastructure  are the GAIAX project and the Federa l Government Data Strategy . The objective of the GAIA-X project , initiated by  Germany and France,  is to create a secure, federated data system that meets the highest stan dards of digital  sovereignty while promoting innovation. The  Federal Government Data s trategy  identifies four concrete fields  of actions: the improvement o f data provision and access, the promotion of responsible data use, the increase  of data competenc ies in society and the development of a data culture for data sharing and use.   Notable examples of support programmes of the  German  Federal Government to crea te data infrastructures  to boost the development of AI applications, include:    mCloud : an open data platform that provides free access to data from the mobility, spacial and  weather forecasting sectors. The database is  constantly updated by the  German  Federal Government   with raw data and takes into account data from private providers from the mobility sector as well. It  is primarily aimed at users from administration, research and the business sector;  
  68  Mobility Data Mark etplace ( MDM ): it offers suppliers and users of mobility data a neutral B2B  platform to share, search and subscribe to traffic -relevant online data. The platform forwards the  data supplied by the data supp liers unchanged to the data clients. With its defined standards for  data exchange, MDM is nation’s biggest volume of information on traffic flows, traffic jams, road  works, mobility options, parking facilities and more;    Smart Data Innovation Lab ( SDIL): it offers researchers unique access to a large variety of big data  and in -memory technologies . Industry and science collaborate closely to find value in big dat a and  generate smart data from it. Projects focus on the strategic research areas of Industry 4.0, energy,  smart cities and personalised m edicine;    Research Data Centre (FDZ) at the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices: it offers  researchers and health policy makers access to claims data of all statutory insured people in  Germany. This representative and up -to-date database allows research on public health as well as  health services research with AI applications.    In terms of ICT infrastructure a nd high -performance computing , the German  Federal Government will  work with the different Länder to accelerate the expansion of the Gauss Centre for Supercomputing ( GCS) to  Exascale capability in addition to dev eloping the National Supercomputing Centre (NHR), especially taking into  account future peak demand for AI applications and for analysing large data volumes. Particular attention will  be paid to energy and resource efficiency as well as possibilities for i ndustrial use. A connection to GAIA -X and  the mobility data marketplace is planned here to create a new and trustworthy bridge to use by business   5.11.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The German  Federal Government’s National AI s trategy  explicitly mean to bring benefits for people and the  environment, and to fund AI applications to benefit the environment and the climate . To this end, the German  Federal Government has developed various support programmes and action plans to foster the role of AI in  tackling the climate change:    Lighthouses of AI for Environment, Climate, Nature and Resources : to boost the high potential  of AI to environmental sustainability, the  German  Federal Government published a funding  programme  (EUR 40 million) in August 2019. The programme funds solutions that use AI to help  solve environmental challenges and promote opportunities to use AI strategically for Environmental  and climate protection. It targets application -oriented research projects active in the following digital  ecological areas, e.g. in the fields of energy efficiency, resource efficiency, protection of biodiversity,  nature conservation, species protection, water management, sustainable consumption or eco -friendly  mobility. The projects can be funded for a period of three years with a maximum funding amount of  EUR 3 million;    Remote sensing : the national AI strategy highlighted the need to provide high -performance  infrastructure to improve the accessibility of earth observation data (p. 34). To respond to this need,  the German  Federal Government  is funding the analysis and evaluation o f remote sensing data with  AI-powered methods. Remote sensing enables monitoring activities at distance in existing  infrastructure, buildings, vegetation and crowds of people, including in areas that are difficult to  access;    Action plan for Digitalisation and AI in Mobility : To implement the national AI strategy, the  German Federal Government has drawn up the action pla n "Digitalisation and AI in m obility ". It aims  to make "Mobility 4.0" effective and sustainable by exploiting the great efficiency potential of digital  innovations and AI in mobility for all modes of transport and for the entire mobility system with  regards to the climate targets and the European Green Deal. In this context, the German  Federal  Government  promotes, among others, AI innovations for new forms of mobility, for automated and  connected driving as well as through the data -based funding programme mFUND . In order to actively  support the development of AI -driven mobility, the German  Federal Government  also plans to  establish AI centres for mobility in Germany, which will provide optimal networking for all  participants, inspire and facilitate the application of AI in the mobility sector and the rapid transfer  from research to  practice, and thus strengthening competitiveness in this field.      
  69 COVID -19 pandemic   The German Federal Government is currently funding a wide range of initiatives to foster the role of AI in  countering the COVID -19 pandemic and in creating a healthy envir onment for society:    The HiGHmed Use Case Infection Control: The infection control use case of the HiGHmed  consortium develops a software system to analyse various data sources from hospitals, with the aim  to detect potentially dangerous germs as early as possible. This automated early warning system  helps to protect patients from new infections, but also to understand their causes and how infectious  diseases spread. The software system is adapted to detect the pandemic SARS -COV-2 virus. The   German  Federal Government  is funding the HiGHmed consortium as part of the Medical Informatics  Initiative  with around EUR 41 million in the current development and networking phase 2018 -2022;    Chatbot/Voicebot at the German customs administration: The German customs administration  is planning to deploy an AI module in the field of information provision, which is intended to answer  questions from companies and private individuals in different wa ys. It is planned to use a chatbot on  the internet presence of the customs administration as well as the implementation of a voicebot to  automatically answer calls received by the hotline of the central information office. The primary goal  is to answer tho se questions without the use of human assistance, which are recurring, clear and  homogeneous in content. With the help of the implemented knowledge database, the AI module  should be able to cover the entire spectrum of responsibilities of the German custom s administration.  If automated processing is not possible, the chatbot forwards the query in writing to an officer or the  voicebot connects the questioner with a hotline employee. The project is an important contribution to  the improvement of the digital i nfrastructure of German customs in general and can help to avoid  unnecessary personal contacts at the customs offices, which can help to maintain the necessary  social distance in the event of a continuing pandemic. The project was initiated in June 2020, t he  technical conception completed in December 2020 and the final system introduction is foreseen for  June 2021. Afterwards a permanent use of the AI module is planned;    Participating in the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence (GPAI): Within the framework  of the GPAI a working group on AI and pandemic response ( AIPR) has been formed to promote cross sectoral and cross -border collaboration in this area . In November 2020, the working group released a  report  outlining its mandate and providing recommendations to foster and support the responsible  development and use of AI -enabled solutions to address COVID -19 and future pandemics;    Collaborative project on Imaging using AI : German hospitals are also participat ing in a  collaborative project on Imaging COVID -19 AI . The objective of this project is to enhance computed  tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID -19 by using AI. The project group will create a deep  learning  model for automated detection and classification of COVID -19 on CT scans, and for  assessing disease severity in patients by quantification of lung involvement;    Participation in EU -funded projects including AI and health : Finally, Germany takes part in the   EU-funded project EXSCALATE4COV  that exploits the most powerful computing resources currently  based in Europe to foster  smart in -silico drug design while increasing the accuracy and predictability  of Computer -Aided Drug Design. Specifically, the project involves three among the most powerful  supercomputing centres in the EU: CINECA  in Italy, the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre ( BSC) in  Spain and the Julich Supercomputing Centre ( JSC) in Germany. The collaboration also includes  pharmaceutical companies and major institutes of biology and bio -molecular dynamics from across  Europe.   5.11.7  Monitoring and future update   The German  Federal Government is publishing  regular  update s of its national AI strategy that includes a  stocktaking of the current policy actions  and concrete  steps for its implementation in the coming years.        
  70 5.12 Greece   Greece is currently developing its national AI strategy. The Hellenic Ministry of Digital Governance (MDG) is  coordinating the development of the national AI strategy, involving major stakeholders in Greece, as well as   experts from within the country and the EU.   AI is recognised as one of the main strategic axes of the Digital Transformation Bible  (DTB), the flagship  policy report that drives the d igital transformation in Greece . In one of its chapters, this flagship re port  highlights the scope and objective areas of the national AI strategy in Greece:    Determining the conditions for the development of AI, including the skills and trust framework, the  data policy as well as the ethical principles fo r its safe development and use;    Describing national priorities and areas for maximizing the benefits of AI to meet societal challenges  and economic growth;    Analysing the necessary actions related to the above priorities and proposing horizontal interventions  as well as at least one pilot application per policy area.   The development of the national AI strategy is in its final stage. A Working Group comprised of members of  major stakeholders in the AI ecosystem has been formed in order to provide feedback on current and planned  initiatives in the AI national ecosystems as well as recommendations on the structure and content of the  national AI strategy.   Finally, the Hellenic G overnment is expecting to publicly release its national AI strategy in 2021 .  5.12.1  AI to address societal challen ges  Climate and environment   By June 2021, da te of publication of this report , Greece  lacks policy initiatives for this section .59  COVID -19 pandemic   Greece has set up various  initiatives  with the  aim to employ AI and machine learning to research tackling the  COVID -19 outbreak :   The Meteo Operational Unit of the Institute for Environmental Research and Sustainable  Development ( IERSD ) employed machine learning to investigate  possible relationships between  COVID -19 epidemiological variables (number of confirmed cases and deaths) and meteorological  parameters (temperatu re, humidity, sunshine duration ), and the interaction of these variables with  social distancing measures. This stud y would unveil the relative impact of each meteorological  variables on the spread of the COVID -19 disease, therefore the possible influence of weather  conditions on the spread of SARS -CoV-2;   The General Secretariat for Research and Technology ( GSRT ) has launched the Flagship Research  Action  "Epidemiological study of SARS -CoV-2 in Greece through extensive testing for virus and  antibody detection, viral genome sequencing and genetic analysis of patients, in response to the  SARS -CoV-2 crisis". Thi s study aims to produce relevant databases for innovative computational  studies using AI and it is funded by the Ministry of Development and Investments under the P ublic  Investments Programme  (PIP);    The Institute Nanoscience Nanotechnologies Demokritos ( NCSR ) coordinates the BioASQ  project that  organis es challenges on biomed ical semantic indexing by means of machine learning and AI.  Specifically to the COVID -19, the NCSR launched a challenge to employ AI software tools of the  BioASQ project to answer scientific questions on the coronavirus in order to expand the  understanding  of this virus and to find new solutions.   The Greek Prime Minister recently agreed to collaborate with the American tech giant Microsoft within the  global programme  AI for Good . Among the point s of the collaboration both climate challenges and the  business impact of coronavirus belong to the points of this partnership.   In addition, Gre ece organised or participated in  a series of hackat hons to foster the role of AI in countering the  COVID -19 pandemic:                                              59  The AI Watch  portal will be updated to include AI policies  for this section  as they come available.   
  71  #HackCoronaGreece : In April 2020, a competition was organised with the support of the Ministry of  Digital Governance to collect and accelerate the implementation of new proposals to tackle the  pandemic COVID -19 in areas such as health, public administration, data analysis. The c ompetition  was designed and implemented by the companies Dataconomy and Data Natives, with the support of  eHealthForum  and EELLAK;    #COVIDhackGR : An initia tive of the Ministry of Digital Governance organised as a competition to  promote innovative digital solutions to tackle the COVID -19 virus;    Antivirus Crowd  hackathon: the first innovation marathon fo r digital applications and methodologies  that face the consequences of the epidemic supported by the Attica Region;    #EUvsVirus  hackathon: Greece participated  in the COVID -19 Smart Screening Tool  presented during  this hackat hon. This project is jointly developed by Luxembourg and Greece with the o bjective to roll out a generalis ed, scalable, yet resource -optimized strategy for de -confinement with a combination  of COVID -19 testing and surveying based on machine learning, blockchain, and AI. Another winning  project that was headquartered in Greece is the SERS4SARS  project which proposes to develop  reliable, cheap and quick solutions for detecting the virus based on AI.    
  72 5.13 Hungary   In September 2020, the Hungarian Government published  its National AI strategy , outlining the strategic  vision and actions for the development of AI in the period 2020 -2030 (Hungary, 2020).  The strategy has been  released by the Ministry of Innovation and Technology and developed  by the Artificial Intelligence  Coalition. In  October 2018, the AI Coalition  has been formed upon th e initiative of the Ministry as a partnership between  governmental institutions, prominent academics and practitioners from leading IT businesses. Made up of  more than 320 members60, the AI Coalition released an AI Action Plan in October 2019, and in 2020 it drew  up Hungary's AI Strategy fo r the Hungarian Government.   Hungary’s AI strategy  aims to support and boost all relevant sections of the AI value chain from data  generation and management, through basic and applied research, to utilisation  of the technology and raising  awareness of the p ossibilities inherent in practical AI applications. Through a multi -layered set of goals the  strategy aims to:    Strengthen the foundation  pillars  of the Hungarian AI ecosystem: data economy , research  development and innovation ( R&D&I ), AI uptake , education  and competence development,  infrastructure deployment,  and regulatory and ethical framework;    Focus on specific sectors  and technology fields with the highest acceleration potential for  Hungary: manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture, public administration,  trans portation, logistics and  energy;    Initiate transformative programmes  with long term ambitious goals that offer direct benefits to  citizens: autonomous systems and self -driving vehicles, health -consciousness in a digital world,  climate -driven agricultu re, data-wallet and personalis ed services, AI -supported development of  personal competenc ies, automated administration procedures  in Hungarian,  and energy networks  focused on renewable sources of energy.   5.13.1  Human capital   With respect to education in AI , Hungary’s national AI strategy has the objective to raise citizen’s awareness  on AI and to leverage human competencies in using and developing AI technologies. One the  key performance  indicators is to reach  up to 300 people with a PhD degree involved in an AI research topic and 8,000 citizens  receiving adult education. To this purpose, the strategy foresees a wide range of policy initiatives to reform  both the education system and competence building tools for the workforce.    Transformations of the educat ional system to prepare for the digital world take stock and build further on the  policy recommendations outlined in the Digital education strategy  that was released in October 2016.  More  closely related to the field of AI, reforms to the education systems  highlighted in the AI strategy include  policies targeting all education levels and reaching out to both students and teachers:    Introducing games f or improving high -level mathematical and logical skills from an early age and  identifying talented children and teenagers;    Developing AI -related general knowledge, skills and competencies in higher education among the  students by offering and promoting AI -specific programmes ;   Establishing PhD programmes in the field of AI and broadening the available collection of AI -related  doctoral courses;    Offering teacher training to prepare teachers in public education with the necessary skills to support  students in u sing and experimenting with AI.   Hungary’s AI strategy equally emphasise s the need to raise the awareness and understanding of AI  of  the population as a whole. To do so, it foresees to raise citizen’s digital and AI -related experiences through:    The establis hment of  the AI Challenge : training 100,000 people  in the basics of AI  using domestically  developed  online course material. It will also aim to raise the awareness of 1 million people via  interactive exhibitions, a website a nd online professional contents.   Besides, the national AI strategy presents several policies to support lifelong learning and reskilling of  the workforce . Among others, the following AI policies are fo reseen:                                              60  As of May 2021.   
  73  Expanding the circle of managers who are aware of AI technologies and training them to support the  implementation of AI innovations;    Training experts in priority sectors and the public administration;    Enhancing high -level mathematical and IT resear chers’ competencies for basic and applied research ;   Increasing the capacity development of data engineer competencies.   Finally, it is important to understand which skills will become increasingly important in the future. Hence, to  prepare for the future labour market needs  and to allow citizens to update their skills and compe tence  portfolio, the Hungarian G overnment calls for the establishment of:    Personalised learning methods : Personalised learning support and talent coaching for groups at  risk of falli ng behind in the labour market  (see also Section 5.13.2) .  5.13.2  From the lab to the market   To foster scientific research in the field of AI , the Hungarian strategy highlights the following policies:    Establishing a National Laboratory for Autonomous Vehicles : the National Laboratory for  Autonomous Systems  is a consortium led by the Institute for Computer Science and Control ( SZTAKI )  with the participation of the Budapest University of Technology and Economics and Széchenyi  University of Győr.

Activities  focus on research, development, and demonstration of the components and functional design of  experimental vehicles, cyber -physical manufacturing and logistics systems. T he Laboratory will  operate an autonomous vehicle laboratory and collaborate with the ZalaZon e autonomous vehicle  test track;    Creating  an AI Accelerator Centre : the objective of the centre is to support AI businesses in their  start-up and growth stage . The publication o f funds  for the selected tenders  is expected by mid 2021.   While basic and applied research in AI is important, it is equally crucial to provide opportunities to develop  high-potential ideas into successful products and services. In terms of po licies increasing the innovation  potential  in AI, Hungary’s strategy foresees the following:    Establishing an Innovation Centr e for Artificial Intelligence : the objective of th is centre  is to  build technology training research and infrastructure marketplace s for the promotion of AI in SMEs. It  is also used to disseminate and inform about events and social dialogues and to investigate about   training needs  on the labour market ;   Developing  corporate advisory services  based on AI (chatbots): w ithin the framework  of the  EDIOP 3.2.1 -15 Modern Businesses Programme (MBP) , led by the  Chamber of Commerce and  Industry (MKIK) , the development of such advisory services supports businesses in their digital  development. The development of the chatbot can be integrated in the planned voice -based AI  platform of the government.   To further support innovative efforts in Hungary, the national  strategy presents several transformative  programmes  with long term ambitious goals  in the fields of  autonomous systems and self -driving  vehicles, health -consciousness in a digital world, climate -driven agriculture, data -wallet and personalis ed  services, AI -supported development of personal competenc ies, automated administration procedures in  Hungarian, and energy networks focused on renewab le sources of energy.    Self-driving vehicles – autonomous systems   The Ministry for Innovation and Technology and the Ministry of Interior foresee to build the necessary  infrastructure and regulatory framework for the operation of autonomous transportation systems. This will be  done by equipping single -digit road networks with self-driving infrastructure  by 2025 and by harmonising  domestic and EU legislative environments and traffic policy regulations.   Health consciousness in a digital world   Various policy a ctions are foreseen to support the data -based economy in the health care sector. An ongoing  policy is focusing on the assessment of activities of businesses engaging in illegal data management, and on  deploying enforcement measures to ensure data protectio n and integrity. In the first half of 2021 , Hungarian 
  74 ministries will launch a campaign to promote the use of healthcare data . This will be complemented with  the mapping of digital healthcare applications  and the development of rating systems for healthcar e  data analytics applications. Finally, it is foreseen to adopt a legal framework with regard to the options of  secondary use of own or self -collected healthcare data.   Climate -driven agriculture   Project proposals are in the making, under the lead of the Mi nistry of Agriculture, to prepare for the  impacts of t he climate change . In particular, they focus on 1) the development and application of AI based, optimisation solutions in terms of plant production and stock farming and 2) the implementation of  predict ive, AI -based analytics methods to improve water, soil and air quality to enhance the efficiency of  management.   Data wallet and personalis ed services   To facilitate the development of a data wallet technology model , the Ministry of Innovation and  Technology  through the Digital Success Program me is supporting the creation of  a software solution to  facilitate citizens controlling the use, sale or disclosure of their data by third parties in a one -stop-shop  system. In parallel, Hungarian ministries are working on ensuring compliance with ongoing legislation on data  protection such as GDPR and on regulating the disclosure of data collected by service providers.   AI-supported development of personal competenc ies  The aim of this transformative programme is to deve lop personalised, data -driven, and digitally -assisted  ways of learning to fully support individual learning paths . It includes the establishment of an AI supported career advisory system. To this end, the Ministry of Technology and Innovation supports the  creation of  a personalised training recommendation service  that is tailored to individual life objectives  and based on public education, vocational training, tertiary vocational training and adult education offers. For   a smooth function ing of the system, ministries will aim to ensure interoperability of file system s. Cust omised  learning paths with dedicated training courses will be set up. This will be facilitated by the establishment of a  personal learning assistant that will primarily sup port citizens at risk of losing employment due to automation.   Automated administrative procedures in Hungarian   The objective of this transformative programme is to support the automation of administrative procedures  using AI -based services. This is done th rough the creation of language processing technologies  for the  Hungarian language . To this purpose, the Ministry of Innovation and Technology and the Ministry of Interior  are collecting both oral and written training data sets. The National Infocommunicati ons Services Ltd., as part  of the Ministry of Interior, is developing a telephone -based customer service for the public administration  using AI solutions.   Energy networks focused on renewable sources of energy   The aim of the transformative programme is to enable, with the help of AI, a shift to a future - and climate proof form of energy use. To support an efficient system integration of the production of  renewable energy,  the Ministry of Innovation and Technology  is planning to upgrade the energy network in frastructure. This  includes the development of  smart meters, and the implementation of smart -grid technologies . The use  of AI is foreseen  in the introduction of forecasting/projection procedures and distribution mechanisms.   The above transformative program mes are complemented with sector -specific development goals to increase  Hungary’s competitive position in the global value chain. To this purpose, the Hungarian strategy also presents  a wide range of policy actions that aim to start in 2021 in the followin g sector -specific focus areas :  manufacturing, healthcare, agriculture and public  administration.   Finally, innovation efforts are further encouraged by strengthening the organisational culture of  experimentation . Purposeful and tailor -made experimentation in AI  could be  fostered through:    The c reation of a corporate AI experimental and support fund : a fund to support companies in  reducing the costs of experimentation and undertaken risks until the "proof of concept" development  phase. The fund is expected to  be established by end of June 2021.      
  75 5.13.3  Networking   The Hungarian strategy emphasise s the importance of establishing  a broad -based and dynamic research  ecosystem driven by collaborative efforts  between national and international AI developers and  researchers.  The objective is to create and support at least 15 instances of cooperation in international  research projects in technological fields, from which two in defence technologies and five in in ternational AI  patents. Among the key technological fields, the strategy identifies image processing, language technology,  data anonymis ation, and machine -learning that could be applied in priority sectors such as healthcare,  manufacturing, agriculture, an d public administration.  Following initiatives are foreseen to expand domestic  and international collaboration opportunities in research and development:    Establishing  a National Artificial Intelligence Laboratory  (MILAB ): MILAB , coordinated by the  Institute for Computer Science and Control ( SZTAKI ), aims to promote and finance publications,  patents, technology transfer and industrial relations on key topics related to AI. Another important  goal is to co nnect the industry, universities  and research institute s operating in the field,  and to  jointly represent them in ma rket and international projects. The main research areas of MILAB are:   the mathematical foundations of AI , deep learni ng, natural language processing,  medical and  biological applications; biometric applications, data processing technologies for the protection of  personal data, agri -food industry, transport,  manufacturing, de fence and telecommunication;    Encouraging  industry -led networking in AI research : collaboration s between AI researchers and  users  (e.g., industry, public administration, healthcare) will be fostered through the implementation of  collaborative projects, join tly financed research and the creation o f an academic AI competence map;    Launching  a central Hungarian  AI portal  by the AI C oalition in which AI developers can present  local  case-studies to foster collaboration and a wareness.   In order to increase the international attractiveness  of the country, the Hungarian G overnment is  preparing a policy to attract major AI players from abroad:    Attracting international AI research centres  to Hungary: the objective of this initiative , mandated  by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Ministry for Innovation and Technology,  is to  incentivise International research centres  and companies to relocate their AI development centres to  Hungary.   Finally, the dissemination and uptake of AI  is fostered through:    Establishing  an Innovation Award for AI Application s: an event is planned annually to awa rd AI  applications per category  (across firm size and industry).   5.13.4  Regulation   Hungary’s nationa l AI strategy aims to ensure a responsible, reliable and human -centred utilisation of AI  technologies by means of the following policies:    Creating  an ethical framework : developing an AI code of conduct by the first half of 2021 in  collaboration between the  Ministry of Justice, the Ministry for Innovation and Technology, AI  Innovation Hub and the Central Statistical Office ;   Setting up  an Artificial Intelligence Regulation and Ethics Knowledge Centre : the aim is to  create and coordinate an extensive pool of experts to help resolve legal issues and matters of ethics  relating to the regulation of AI and the implementation of the strategy ;   Establishing  a regulatory framework  for AI: t he obje ctive is to amen d the current  regulatory  system to suit AI and to align it to EU regulations ;   Building data management regulation : the objective is to set up regulations for the use and  exchange  of public and private data and to define rules regarding d ata monetisation.   As there is no one -size-fits all solution, the Hungarian strategy calls for the development of sector -specific  regulatory frameworks , ensuring that the regulatory needs for AI development are adapted to the relevant  industry areas.    
  76 5.13.5  Infrastructure   Hungary’s  national AI strategy highlights that one of the core elements to foster the development and  adoption  of AI are data processing and data analysis. Against this background, there is a crucial need to  support the collection of data and its secondary use in b oth the public and private sector. To this purpose, the  Hungarian G overnment is setting up policy initiatives to develop a solid data infrastructure  that enables  data availability and encourages data sharing while ensuring necessary data protection of personal data  where needed.  The Hungarian strategy mentions its objective to support a minimum of 1000 agreements for  the secondary use of data. To enco urage data collection and use for AI developments, the Hungarian strategy  includes:    Establishing  a National Data Assets Agency : the objective of this agency  is to coordinate and  stimulate the strategic management of the data. It does not perform data proce ssing but aims to  encourage and support data utilisation;    Creating  a data market platform : the aim of this platform is to raise awareness of the economic  value of commercially viable data, and to encourage its secondary use. Its development will include  three phases: 1) creating a marketplace for the transmission of non -personal data of high quality, 2)  establishing commercial opportunities for the data assets including personal data and 3) broadening  up the platform to all relevant stakeholders and integra ting it with international data spaces;    Setting up  a public data portal : the aim of the public data portal  is to encourage the use of nonpersonal data created in the public sector .  By establishing a national Data  Assets Agency, complemented with a commercial and publi c data platform,  the Hungarian G overnment aims to bring the national data ecosystem to its full potential. It aims to  ensure  that the data market platform and the public data portal are n eatly connect ed and integrated.   In addition, the successful deployment of an AI -enabled economy can only be achieved in a well -developed  and cutting -edge infrastructure ecosystem . To this purpose, Hungary’s national AI strategy foresees:    Enhancing supercomputer capacities : the Ministry for Innovation and Technology and the  Governmental Information Technology Development Agency have the objective to increase the High  Performance Computing (HPC) capacity to 5 petaflops in Hungary as of 2022;    Hybrid cloud deve lopment  for research purposes: t he objective of this initiative is to ensure the  availability of research hardware and software that is well connected  with cloud service providers;    Establishing data centre s with large computing capacities .  5.13.6  AI to address so cietal challenges   Climate and environment   In order to reach the EU’s long -term climate strategy goals, it is crucial to support efforts to reduce pollutant  emissions and to encourage the proliferation of alternative technologies to this purpose. Understand ing that  the hydrogen economy is one of the foundations of climate protection, the Hungarian Ministry for Innovation  and Technology financed the construction of a Hungarian -American hydrogen -fuel cell -powered aircraft  suitable for passenger transport. This  project belongs to the Hungarian energy and c limate strategy  alongside  with AI, Industry 4.0 and 5G technological platforms.   In addition to these in itiatives – and as part of its national AI strategy – the Hungarian G overnment foresees   to launch transformative programmes  in the field of AI  with long term ambitious goals that offer direct  benefits to citizens and the environment : climate -driven agricul ture, energy grids focused on renewables, and  fully autonomous systems.   COVID -19 pandemic   Concerning the COIVD19 crisis the following initiatives are worth noticing:    The Hungarian State,  together with the European Union , funded a study on COVID -19 pandemic  prediction for Hungary; a hybrid machine learning a pproach . This study presents a hybrid machine  learning approach to predict the COVID -19 infection and mortality  rates in  Hungary, and it suggests  that machine learning can be an effec tive tool to model the outbreak ;   Scientific researchers at the Szeged Biological Research Centre ( SZBK ) have identified the receptor  through which the COVID -19 virus enters into a host cell. The discovery of this receptor has been 
  77 found using AI algorithms. The outcome of this research constitute s a new milestone in the research  towards a vaccine and opens new perspectives in the development of thera pies for COVID -19;   The phone application  VírusRadar  uses Bluetooth technology to acquire encrypted, anonymis ed data  about users in order to notify individuals that have been previously in touch (at a non -safe distance)  with infected ones.   5.13.7  Monitoring and future update   Hungary’s national AI strategy sets goals up to 2030 and outlines a related action plan extending up to 2025.  It is important t o emphasise, however, that the s trategy needs to be regarded as a livi ng document and  reviewed at lea st every two years due to rapid changes in technological development s.    
  78 5.14 Ireland   The Department of  Enterprise , Trade  and Employment (DETE ) in Ireland is leading on the development of a  national AI Strategy. The Strat egy is e xpected to be released in Q2 2021  (subject to Government approval).   The National AI Strategy for Ireland, entitled  “AI - Here for Good”, will provide a high -level direction to the  design, development and adoption of AI in Ireland. It will present an integr ated, cross -Government framework  giving direction for the steps needed to ensure that Ireland’s use of AI will benefit  the economy and society. In  line with the EU and OECD approaches, it is envisaged that  the main areas covered by the s trategy will  includ e: societal opportunities and challenges of AI; enterprise development and deployment of AI; RD&I;  human capital considerations; d ata; digital and connectivity  infrastructure; public sector use of AI; as well as  ethics, governance, standards and regulatory  framework.   The development of the s trategy has involved significant stakeholder engagement, including with industry,  with industry representative bodies, with academic and research communities and with a multi -stakeholder  group of experts. Consultations are continuing across the Government system and an online public  consultation has also been conducted. As part of the strategy development, a Top Team on Standards for AI  has been established, led by the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI).   An important flagship for the development of AI in Ireland is the SFI Centre for Research Training in Artificial  Intelligence  that was established in March 2019 with funding of over EUR 14 million from  the Science  Foundation Ireland and an additional EUR 3.3 million from the industry and academic partners. It serves as   Ireland's national centre for PhD -level training in AI , with a targeted uptake of 30 students per annum for the  next four years. The centre brings together five of Ireland's seven universities and a team of almost 60  supervisors across the country.   5.14.1  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   Ireland has a wide range of policy initiatives to foster the role and contribution of AI in achieving  EU’s climate  change objectives. To ensure the provision of high -quality data and to enhance possibilities for data exchange,  the Irish Centre for High -End Computing ( ICHEC ) has established various national  platforms :   Satellite Platform for Ireland ( SPÉir ): ICHEC has established the Satellite Platform for Ireland (SPÉir)  offering access to curated and pre -processed high -quality persistent data from the ESA Copernicus  programme  Sentinel satellites for use by research, public sector and enterprise organisations;    ERDDAP  server: ERDDAP is ICHEC's data server that provides a  simple, consistent way to download  subsets of scientific datasets in common file formats and make graphs and maps. This particular  ERDDAP installation has oceanographic data (for example, data from satellites and buoys);    Federated platform for Earth and u rban systems data: ICHEC is aiming towards establishing a  federation of State Bodies, including the likes of Geological Survey Ireland ( GSI), Environmental  Protection Agency  (EPA), Agriculture  and Food Development Authority ( TEAGASC ), Irish Meteorological  Service ( Met Éireann ), Marine Institute  and the Irish Centre for High -End Computing ( ICHEC ) to  implement a federated and seamless national “data lake” on FAIR principles.   In addition,  ICHEC  has a wide range of ongoing projects involving public sector  organisations:    National Wind and Solar Energy Forecasts : ICHEC has worked in collaboration with Bord na Mona  and  a number of national energy companies to improve the accuracy of wind and solar weather  forecasts;    Biodiversity analysis: ICHEC collaborated with NPWS (the Irish National Park and Wildlife Services),  Bat Conservation Ireland and  QUB (Queen’s University Belfast) to assess the effects of climate  change on the natterjack toad and bat populations of Ireland, and to establish a relationship between  their historical populations and climate fields;    Flood prediction  project: ICHEC uses ESA Sentinel -1 satellite data to monitor extreme weather  conditions and the catchment areas to forecast floods by integrating it with hydrological info rmation  such as groundwater levels and stream flow;    INFER  project: ICHEC worked with EPA on remote sensing of Irish surface water to develop products  for improved monitorin g of water bodies such as lakes.   Lastly, ICHEC  contributes to collaborative projects at European level, such as:   
  79  ESA AIREO  project: ICHEC is working with the European Space Agency ( ESA) for developing  community -driven standards, good practices and tools for developing AI -Ready Earth Observation  (EO) datasets;    ESA Space Networks: Ubotica  and ICHEC are working with ESA to develop a platform  for deploying  optimised AI models on-board  satellites and updating the models in -orbit to improve their accuracy  and perf ormance;    REDAP  project : The methods and tools developed in the REDAP project by ICHEC and a number of  European partner organisations helps regions across Europe to gain clarity into the characteristics of  energy demand  in the building and transport sectors. Understanding the energy demand is a  prerequisite for the development of green energy systems.   Furthermore,  the business ecosystem  is using AI for environmental sustainability . Several Irish SMEs and  multinationals a re developing AI solutions in the sustainable food chain, waste reduction, and sustainable  farming, among others.   Finally, various ministries and public agencies  are funding research centres and dedicated research  projects using AI to create a more sustai nable and green environment in the future.   Projects under the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland ( SEAI)   Forecasting Renewable Energy with Machine Intelligence ( FREMI ): This project seeks to increase the  accuracy of the current wind turbine forecasting methods and develop and deploy a tool capable of  assisting ener gy traders under the new market rules posed by I -SEM;   National Artificial Intelligent Dairy Energy Application ( NAIDEA ): This project aims to bridge the gap  between Ireland's dairy farmers and policy makers to further encourage and support the  decarbonisation of Ireland's agri -sector;    Smart Electric Buses ( SEB): Applying data analytics and AI techniques for optimal design and  operation for electrification of the public bus transportation system.   Projects under the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA)   National Landcover mapping  project : This project is using machine  learning algorithms to classify the  Landcover types in detailed boundaries, from aerial images;    CoronaEU project: The purpose of this project was to confirm if machine learning could be used to  screen air quality .

  80 COVID -19 pandemic   Concerning the current COVID -19 pandemic, in March 2020 the Irish Government launched a National action  plan on COVID -19 with the aim to minimise the risk of illness for all people, to lower the impact on individuals  at higher risk, and to reduce both social and economic disrupti on associated to the COVID -19 outbreak. As a  key action in this plan, a coordinated Rapid Response Research and Innovation  programme was launched to  enable the research and innovation community to respond to the immediate and pressing needs of society  arising from the pandemic. Several calls to apply for the funding in this programme have been developed  by  the Irish Research Council ( IRC), the Health Research Board ( HRB), the Science Foundation Ireland ( SFI), the  Enterprise Ireland  (EI), and the Irish Agency for Foreign Direct Investment ( IDA). Two calls with  funding lines  are foreseen:    A first call (phase 1), with typically funding up to EUR 200,000 per project, focuses on research in the  following areas: medical countermeasures, health service readiness, and social and policy  countermeasures to COVID -19. A total of 36 projects  have been awarded in phase 1;    A second  call (phase 2) focuses on the following thematic areas: infection prevention and control,  understanding the virus and hos t response, STEM -led solutions for stimulating and sustaining rapid  economic recovery.   While the calls do not specifically target AI -related developments, several awarded projects do use artificial  tools and algorithms in their innovative solutions to figh t the COVID -19 virus. To maximise the relevance and  the impact for society of ongoing research in the field of the COVID -19 outbreak, many research  organisations have signed a joint stat ement  to share research data and findings in this field.   Also Ireland’s national centre for Applied Data Analytics & AI ( CeADAR ) has offered its AI expertise  to help  companies, government agencies, medical centres and research charities develop AI tools to help track the  virus and monitor compliance of the general public. The centre can help organisations with large data sets to  apply machine learning techniques.   At the end of June 2020 the Irish Health Service Executive ( HSE) published new documents about the ongoing  commitment to develop the COVID -19 Tracker  application  for Ireland. Thi s national effort was carried out  within an unprecedented global collaboration between governments, indust ry and the scientific community  in  order t o fully align the results with the privacy principles and public health guidance issued by the EU  Commission , the OECD, WHO and the European Centre for  Disease Prevention and Control . In addition, the HSE  organised a Digital Academy Forum  in July 2020 for businesses and the research community to shar e their  digital transformation experiences during the COVID -19 pandemic.   Furthermore, the ultraviolet light robot Violet  is the output of 12 mont hs research in UV light disinfection  technology conducted at Trinity College Dublin and fast -tracked by the HSE that recognised its great potential  in fighting the COVID -19.  Finally on the business side of the COVID -19 crisis, the Border Enterprise Development Fund  – an initiative of  the Government of Ireland administered by Enterprise Ireland – supports the international competitiveness of  enterprise s in the Border Region in the context of Brexit and other market challenges including COVID -19. The  applicants’ projects focus on AI, robot ics, cobotics, machine learning, and big data.     
  81 5.15 Italy  In October 2020, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development released a draft version of its National AI  strategy  for public consultation (Italy, 2020). The strategy takes stock of policy recommendations from a  proposal for the Italian AI strategy  published in July 2020. The final version of the Italian AI strategy is  expected for the first half of 2021.61  The draft AI strategy provides a long -term vision for a sustainable development of AI with the following  actions to increase the development and com petitiveness of AI in Italy:    Improving AI education at all levels, and providing lifelong learning and reskilling opportunities to the  labour force;    Fostering AI research and innovation to enhance the entrepreneurial competitiveness;    Establishing an ethica l regulatory framework for a sustainable and trustworthy AI;    Supporting (international) networks and partnerships;    Developing a data infrastructure for AI applications;    Improving public services through a wider adoption and use of AI systems.   The Italian strategy envisages a public investment of EUR 2.5 billion.62  5.15.1  Human capital   The Italian G overnment envisages the following initiatives to strengthen AI education at all levels :   Supporting the progress of teachers’ digital skills;    Introducing applied AI courses in the Higher Technical Institutes ( ITS);   Fostering female participation in AI subjects;    Setting up a challenge to promote AI courses among students in the last two years of upper  secondary schoo ls and in the first three years of university (i.e. 16 -23 age group).   As for higher education , the Italian G overnment plans the following actions to integrate AI courses in  Bachelors, Masters and doctoral programmes:    Including AI credits in academic course s for Master and Bachelor degrees;    Creating national training programmes in AI, and interacting with stakeholders in the labour market  (companies, public services, tertiary education) to align education and required professional skills;    Developing an inves tment strategy for doctoral studies, and training skilled professionals in  cooperation with the industries where AI applications could most likely emerge.   In addition, lifelong learning will take the form of online courses in AI to upskill and reskill the workforce.  The strategy highlights that e -learning platforms emerged during the COVID -19 pandemic to improve Italians’  literacy in AI disciplines. This includes an initiative promoted by the Italian Ministry for Innovation (December  2020) based on the free -of-charge course “ Elements of AI ” create d by the University of Helsinki. Participants  will also have the possibility to obtain credits  for their professional curricula through personal training  accounts. In addition, the Italian strategy plans the following initiatives to foster AI education in both business  and public sectors:    Allowing tax credits for the participation costs of SMEs’ ma nagement in AI executive courses;    Consolidating the vouchers for advices on digital innovation from specialised managers;    Promoting trainings on AI and related technologies within the public administration, and covering at  least half of the civil servants in 3 years maximum.   Finally, as for the needs of  new skills the strategy envisages an observatory for AI and related socio economic impacts to monitor trends in the labour market and publish an annual report of policy  recommendations.                                                61  As a tentative target date .  62  This amount, mentioned in the  National AI strategy  released for public consultation in September 2020 , may still be subject to change.   
  82 5.15.2  From the lab to the market   The Italian AI research ecosystem  counts on a wide range of national centres of excellence like the  Artificial Intelligence and Intelligent Systems Laboratory ( AIIS) of the Italian Interuniversity Consortium for  Informatics ( CINI), the Italian Institute of Technology ( IIT), and the Insti tute for Calculation and Networks for  High Services ( ICAR) of the National Research Council ( CNR). In April 2021  the first laboratory dedicated to  Pervasive Arti ficial Intelligence Laboratory ( PAI Lab ) was inaugurated in Pisa.  The PAI laboratory was born  from the need to aggregate skills, infrastr uctures and resources to face the scientific challenges of an AI that  is transforming into a pervasive technology .  To increase the competiveness of AI industry , the Italian G overnment will expand the public funding and  will encourage public -private vent ure capitals. Furthermore, the g overnment envisages advisory services with  appointed innovation managers to accompany SMEs in the technological and digital transformation process.  The Italian strategy also plans the following actions:    Organising calls for new  AI solutions, the first two calls are set up as pilot projects to test the  methodology on 1) smart components (automation and robotics systems) and 2) the needs of the  public administration;    Increasing technology transfers to SMEs with vouchers to receive  advisory services from incubators.   The Italian G overnment also put in place  regulatory sandboxes to facilitate controlled experiments with  innovative  products , including AI . The initiative  called Sperimentazione Italia  grants the possibility to  companies, universities, research bodies, university start -ups and spin -offs from any sector  to test pilot  projects in the field of digitalisation and technological innovation, d erogating regulatory constraints.   Priority sectors  for AI developments in Italy are: industry and manufacturing, food and farming, culture and  tourism, health and well -being, environment, smart cities, and infrastructure and networks. In addition, the  Italian strategy presents several policy initiatives to encourage the uptake of AI in the public  administration . The Italian G overnment aims to enhance AI skills in the public sector (see Section 5.15.2),  public -private partnerships (see Section 5.15.3), open data and common data spaces (see Section 5.15.4). In  addition the Italian proposal envisages to:    Increase the procurement of AI innovations to achieve the national objectives of sustainability;    Introduce AI applications for administrative proceedings and p ublic services.   5.15.3  Networking   In terms of networking , the strategy proposal encourages the above mentioned centres of excellence to set  up an R&D network close to the industrial community. In total, 8 Competence Centres (set up by the Ministry  of Economic Dev elopment) and 12 European Technology Clusters (set up by the Ministry of Education,  Universities and Research) will be the basis of a national network of knowledge exchange and collaboration.  These nodes appear in the Digital Europe Programme for the period 2021 -2027  and are a backbone of the  pan-European networks together with the establishment of Digital Innovation Hubs.   The Italian city of Turin will be the headquarter of the Italian Institute for Artificial Intelligence  (I3A), this  structure will facilitate research and technology transfers and it will be the Italian reference in th e  development of AI technologies (including 5G, Industry 4.0, Cybersecurity).   The Italian proposal favours pan-European initiatives  like the Confederation of Artificial Intelligence  Laboratories in Europe ( CLAIRE ) and the public -private partnerships for electronic components and systems  (ECSEL ).  In addition, Italy takes part in the Global Partnership on AI ( GPAI), an international initiative to spur a  responsible development and use of AI in full respect of human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and  economic growth. The GPAI collaborates with international organisations to connect experts from industry,  civil s ociety, governments and academia. This initiative accounts for two Centres of Expertise in Montreal and  in Paris, and its secretariat is hosted by the OECD in Paris.   5.15.4  Regulation   The Italian strategy highlights that an ethical regulatory framework for AI has to ensure transparency,  accountability and reliability in order to stimulate citizens’ trust and engagement in a thriving AI ecosystem. 
  83 The 2020 Strategy for technological innova tion and d igitalisation  by the Ministry for Technological Innovation  and Digitalisation foresees the creation of an ‘Alliance for Sustainable Artificial Intelligence’ with the aim to  provide guiding principles for the development of trustworthy AI solution s. The national AI strategy also  emphasises the importance of campaigns to inform citizens on the characteristics, opportunities and risks of  AI as much as on its potential misuse.   For safe AI developments, it is as important to develop an ethics by design  approach as much as to ground it  in a binding legislative framework  at national level to protect citizens and businesses. In this respect, the  Italian strategy encompasses the following initiatives on legislation and related issues:    Adapt the consumer pro tection framework to AI consumers and the new market reality of AI  technologies;    Introducing a compulsory insurance to cover liabilities and damages from the use of AI technologies;    Encouraging out -of-court dispute resolution mechanisms based on the rules of unfair commercial  practices.   Lastly, to increase citizens’ engagement, there will be a national platform, like the European AI Alliance, for  consultations on ethical and social issues about AI.   5.15.5  Infrastructure   The Italian G overnment commits to define a d ata policy  that promotes collection, exchange and re -use of  data, while respecting privacy rights and ensuring interoperability based on standards. The Italian strategy  foresees the following initiatives:    Creating a data market platform to support SMEs’ da ta collection and exchanges;    Encouraging data sharing agreements to promote the data economy;    Fostering the provision and re -use of public data in public service;    Providing financial support to create an Italian Data Space with private a public stakeholder s.  Although not specifically mentioned in the nat ional AI strategy, the Italian G overnment also supports the  development of a digital and telecommunication infrastructure . The CINECA  computing centre is a not for-profit consortium made by the Italian Ministry of Education, the Italian Ministry of Universities and  Research, 69 Italian universities and 21 Italian National Institutions. CINECA aims to provide information  services to the Italian Ministry of Universities and Research, to the universities and the other consortium  members, to the scientific community, and to the public education sector. This is done by guaranteeing high performance infrastructure services for the Italian research system, and access to the Eu ropean network of  high-performance scientific computing cen tres. In addition, the Italian G overnment participate s in the Joint  Undertaking to develop a competitive European computing ecosystem ( EuroHPC ). In terms of connectivity,  Italy is expanding its ultra -broadband optical fibre network and explores ways to extent its 5G network.   5.15.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   In July 2020, the Italian Minis try of Economic Development released the proposal for the Italian strategy for  AI.63 This final proposal includes a chapter on AI for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which includes  the environment and energy targets to reach by 2030. The policy report highlights that, although Italy  worsened along the indicators of sustainable devel opment, it also holds leadership positions in the  development of AI -related technologies that could grant the country a recovery along the dimensions of  sustainability. To this end, the Italian economy should exploit and further develop the following compe titive  advantages:    Key environmental areas : key environmental areas in which Italy is excelling relate to the  appraisal of hydrogeological risks, the management of seismic hazard zones, and critical  infrastructures related to archaeological sites;                                              63 In October 2020, a draft version of the  National AI strategy  was released for public consultation.  
  84  Competit ive AI technologies the Italian economy can build on its competitiveness on soft robotics  and on the development of cobots/companion robots, along with the opportunity to employ AI within  industries;    Green energy and renewables: the production and distribu tion of green energy together with the  challenges of societal inclusion are key environmental priorities for the coming years.   To reap the benefits of these new technological shifts, the high -level working group that drafted the strategy  proposal calls for  improved legislative transparency and governance. More specif ically, it invites the Italian  Government to follow a policy coherence for sustainable development  by means of three pillars: 1)  better regulation; 2), demand -side innovation policies; 3) fiscal  incentives and policies to stimulate AI  investments for sustainable innovation and green energy. Specific recommendations also call for the inclusion  of vulnerable citizens during the implementation of AI policies.   COVID -19 pandemic   Along the initiating countries of France and Canada, Italy is among the countries that participates in the  Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence ( GPAI). The various working groups of the GPAI are currently  focusing on responsible use of  AI, data governance, the future of work, and innovation and commercialisation.  In addition, the experts involved also focus on the role  of AI in response to the COVID -19 pandemic.   The Italian Institute of Robotics and Intelligent Machines ( I-RIM) – a national non -profit association created to  promote the development and use of Intera ction Technologies for the benefit of citizens and society – is also  contributing to fight against the COVID -19. Among other, it maps national and international pilot projects   recently developed to respon d to the COVID -19 necessities in the healthcare and related sectors. Projects are  classified based on their application field, geographical region, Technology Readiness Level (TRL),  development status and category (research or commercial project).   Furtherm ore, given the unprecedented challenges to government, industries and society in the COVID -19  outbreak, many Italian companies and start -ups are producing innovative products or repurposing their  business, production and R&D capabilities to support the fig ht against coronavirus. Among these innovative  products  many employs 3D printing, robotics, sensors.   Italian hospitals are also participating in a collaborative project on Imaging COVID -19 AI . The objective of this  project is to enhance computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID -19 by using AI. The project group  will create a deep learning model for automated detection and classification of COVID -19 on CT scan s, and  for assessing disease severity in patients by quantification of lung involvement.   In addition, Italian businesses have participated in the pan -European #EUvsVirus  hackathon, which aimed to  collect and promote innovative ideas to fight against the coronavirus. Winning Italian projects proposing AI  solutions include: 1) aiLearning , which is an AI -based all -in-one platform aimed to simplify and improve exam  preparation, execution and evaluation, and 2) Jobiri , proposing an AI -based digital career advisor able to  digitalise employment services.   Finally, Italy takes part in the EU -funded project  EXSCALATE4COV  that exploits the most powerful computing  resources currently based in Europe to foster  smart in -silico drug design while increasing the accuracy and  predictability of Computer -Aided Drug Design.  Specifically, the project involves three among the most  powerful supercomputing centres in the EU: CINECA  in Italy, the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre ( BSC) in  Spain and the Jul ich Supercomputing Centre ( JSC) in Germany. The collaboration also includes pharmaceutical  companies and major institutes of biology and bio -molecular dynamics from across Europe.   5.15.7  Monitoring and future update   The Italian G overnment will set up an inter -ministerial cabinet for digital transformation under the Presidency  of the Council to implement the national strategy and to liaise with international organisations. The inception  of a forum will foster the dialogue between policy makers and stakeholders from economy and society.  Lastly, indicators will help to monitor the strategy implementation and they will feed in regular reports to the  Parliament.   
  85 5.16 Latvia   In February 2020 , the La tvian G overnment released  its national AI strategy on Developing artificial  intelligence s olutions  (Latvia, 2020 ). The objective of the Latvian strategy is to promote the uptake and  growt h of AI in the whole economy. The proposed strategy outlines policy  action s in the following areas and  devotes particular attention to the promotion of AI in the public administration:     Raising the awareness of and competenc ies in AI across society through  education reforms;    Promoting the adoption and development of AI in the public and private sector;    Engaging actively  in national and international cooperation;    Developing a solid legal and ethical framework for AI;    Unleashing the benefits of a well -develop ed data ecosystem;    Investing in a digital and telecommunication infrastructure to support AI developments .  The Ministry of Interior plans to spend approximately € 1.5 million on digitalisation with a focus on AI.   5.16.1  Human capital   Improving skills and competenc ies in AI -related fields  is essential  to accelerate the speed of AI  deployment, use and development. To this purpose the Latvian strategy advocates the integration of AI  themes in the general education system at all levels. The Latvian Government recognises the need to raise  the awareness and understanding of AI among all citizens, and in particular students, researchers and  professionals in the private and public sector. Taking the example of the Finnish course on AI Elements , Latvia  will develop an equivalent online course . The target audience of this course are expert level and management  level specialists to help support digital transformation. Furthermore, the Latvian G overnment intends to  prepar e a National Research Programme and to reform the education system.   5.16.2  From the lab to the market   In terms of research, the Latvian strategy highlights that several universities and research centres are  currently conducting  several  research projects in the fi eld of AI . The LU Institute of Mathematics and  Informatics  is active in the following research strands: speech recognition, semantic analysis, image analysis,  natural language analysis, computer vision and robot ics. The Riga Technical University  (RTU)  carries out  research among others in autonomous systems and robots, image and sound processing and smart sensor  systems. It has a dedicated Chair in AI and Systems Engineering focusing on machine training and data  mining.  In addition, the RTU  Institute of Industrial Electronics and Electrical Engineering  is coordinating the  NexIT project of the National Research Progra mme to foster  ICT services in the public sector and to  consolidate  data collection and processing. Finally , Latvia’s strategy presents a range of ongoing research  projects in the field of AI that are supported by the European Regional Development Fund and Horizon 2020.    The deployment of AI solutions in the industry and public administration will be encouraged through an  increased  pace of digitisation. T o this purpose, t he Latvian G overnment is preparing Digital Transformation  Guidelines by the se cond quart er of 2021 with  policy measures  to support the digital transformation. This will  include financial provisions and support programmes  for research and innovation  in AI. The Latvian strategy  identifies priority sectors  with a high potential for AI applicatio ns in the country, such as transport  (Intelligent transport systems), culture, justice (AI as support for decision making and drafting legislation),  agriculture (automated control), and translation. AI is also mentioned as an effective  tool to create a virtual  assistant platform in the public administration and to establish  an efficient information system in the  healthcare sector.   The Ministry of Culture plans to supplement the machine translation system with new language pairs that will  increase the availa bility of government content, e -services, and other content. In spring 2021, a machine  translation tool for Latvian -Estonian languages will be developed. A machine -translator for all EU languages  is expected to be completed within two years. The Ministry o f Education plans to improve skills in the field of  natural language processing. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development plans to  implement AI based proactive services model for citizens (based on real life situations and persons’  socio economic profile to proactively offer services).   Lastly , several value chain ecosystems  are currently developed by the Ministry of Economics. Three  strategic value chain ecosystem pilot s are being implemented – on Smart materials, Biomedicine and Smart  city - to enhance state -of-the-art research and innovation  in these fields . These priority areas are based on  
  86 Latvia’s Smart specialization strategy . The ecosystems bring together innovation a ctors from private, public  and academic sectors. AI is a key enabling technology to facilitate the implementation of above -mentioned  ecosystems.   5.16.3  Networking   To foster innovations in  AI, research and development should not be conducted in isolation but rathe r in  collaboration, by bringing together competenc ies from national and internatio nal organisations. The Latvian  Government encourage s joint projects and increase opportunities for public -private partnerships in AI . To  increase Latvia’s international visib ility and to attract foreign investments, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is  considering establishing  a platform to present Latvia’s achievements and good  practices in AI. Networking  opportunities are further channelled through Latvia’s Digital Innovation Hubs, being the Ventspils High  Technology Park , the Latvian IT Cluster Association  and the Institute of Electronics and Compu ter Sciences .   5.16.4  Regulation   As the proliferation of AI technologies brings along new regulatory challenges , the Latvian G overnment  calls for the development of a normative framework to define what is ethically and legally sound in the field  of AI. Latvia is  relying on its current national legislation  and on EU Directives defining regulations on product  safety ( Directive 2001/95/EC ) and liabilities ( Directive 1985/374/EEC ). However, the government recognises  the need to provide more clarity on these issues, in particular on AI goods and services. Hence, it will work on   a new legal environment for AI and will set up regulatory sandboxes to facilitate testing of AI concepts and  ideas.  Regarding ethics, the government adopts the European ethical guidelines  outlined by the European  Commission for the Efficiency of Justice.   5.16.5  Infrastructure   Given that data is an important driver for the development o f AI applications,  the Latvian G overnment has  adopted guiding principles for e -government and data governance in the public administration. These  measures  aim to foster the development of new information systems towards open data  and to  facilitate the path towards the creation of single data centres. In June 2017, Latvia has launched an Open  Data Portal  to harmonise data collection and encourage data sharing.  A survey targeting practitioners has  also been launched in March 2019 to understand their data needs and to obtain recommendations and  feedback on the data published i n the open data portal. The Ministry  of Environmental Protection and Regional  Development ( VARAM ) has been appointed as national authority to coordinate open data policies and  initiatives in the public administration. In the third quarter of 2019, an information report entitled “Lat vian  Open Data Strategy” was  published. This report lays the foundations for strategic policy actions for the period  2019 -2022 towards an open data governance in the public administration.   Latvia has currently two High Performing Computing Centres : the High Performance Computing Unit at  the Ventspils International Radio Astronomy Centre ( VSRC ) and  the RTU Scientific Computing Centre . Besides  these two centres, the Institute of Electronics and Computer Sciences  (EDI), an independent scientific institute,   has also invested in a high performance computer allowing to explore and analyse big data with cut ting-edge  techniques in AI.  In addition , the Latvian strategy mentions the need to increase computing capacities through  investments in cloud services and quantum computing.   5.16.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   During a meeting at the European Parliament in January 2020, the Latvian President called for a responsible  use of technologies and AI in the public and private sector to facilitate the European Green Deal and to  counter the ongoing climate change.   In a similar vein, the Latvian national AI strategy  foresees a high potential in Latvia to develop AI applications  for the environmental protection. In particular, it highlighted the analysis of satellite images to det ect the  presence of hazardous substances in the environment. Changes in soil and foliar may be noticed in certain  light spectra, which may indicate contamination. Drones (unmanned aircraft) could be used for the  observation of protected areas and to detect  changes to the climate.   Witnessing that data quality is essential for the training of AI systems, the Latvian national AI strategy  recommends an open data governance across the scientific and business community. With respect to the 
  87 climate change, this in cludes data sharing initiatives of the data repository of the Latvian Environmental,  Geological and Meteorological Centre ( VSIA) containing meteorological radar images, measurement s, and  forecast data. Data sho uld be made available in a structured, machine -readable format for the use of AI and  machine learning algorithms.   COVID -19 pandemic   In March 2020, the Latvian tech start -up community HackForce organised a virtual hackathon  and created  solutions to help with COVID -19 crisis. The hackat hon encompassed “medicine and healthcare – digital  technology solutions and prototypes” among its key topics. Participants with the most innovative idea s were  rewarded with funding to develop their projects. The Latvian Ministry of Economics and the Latvian  Investment Development Agency contributed  EUR 25,000 to the prize p ool of the  hackathon .  5.16.7  Monitoring and future update   The implementation of the Latvia n strategy will be monitored and evaluated on a regular basis and adjusted  with additional policy initiatives where needed.  Currently planned key initiatives are digitalisation with a focus  on AI, supplementation of new language pairs for machine translati on systems, skill improvement in the field  of natural language processing, analytical machine learning tools for crime investigation and development of  an AI -based proactive services model for citizens.     
  88 5.17 Lithuania   In March  2019, the Minis try of Economy  and Innovation released the Lithuanian artificial i ntelligence s trategy:  a vision for the future  (Lithuania, 2019).  The aim of the strategy (p. 4) is to " modernise  and expand the  current AI ecosystem in Lithuania and ensure that the nation is ready for a future with AI ". The strategy has  been drafted by a working group consisting of representatives of the private sector, academia and  governmental institutions.   The strategy provides an overview of the current AI landscape in Lithuania and a range  of policy  recommendations in key areas with the aim to:    Improving  the skills and education  in AI for all  citizens;   Strengthening the national  research and innovation ecosyst em in the field of AI;    Increasing the deployment, development and use of AI in all economic activities, including both the  private and public sector ;   Promoting national and international collaborations in AI and enhancing network opportunities;    Developing  an ethical and legal framework  for a sustainable and transparent  development of AI  applications;    Establishing a responsible and efficient data ecosystem for AI .  The Lithuanian strategy does not include concrete policy initiatives but merely serves as a guiding document  for all actors in the country with policy recommendations. It does not outline financial provisions for the  implementation of the strategy.   5.17.1  Human capital   With respect to education, the Lithuanian strategy advocates the development of skills and competenc ies  in AI at all education levels , emphasising the need to start teaching  AI foundations  at an early age.  Reforms to the primary and secondary educa tion system could target AI basics for children as a learning  objective, and could include more courses to develop technical skills. In addition, the Lithuania n Government  recommends to modernise STEM teaching subjects and to provide dedicated support to t eachers to foster the  quality of their education duties in AI. Master programmes  and PhD scholarships in AI  should also be  introduced in curricula of higher education systems . AI-related courses are particularly important  for those  study areas that are at risk of automation. Universities could develop a website portal to attract prospective  students to AI -related programmes . Finally , the Lithuanian strategy highlights the need for lifelong learning  opportunities and vocational training programmes  in AI. Tra ining in AI for citizens could be done by  means of massive open online training courses. Overall, the main objective of education in AI is to prepare  current and future workforces to the upcoming needs of the labour market.   At the moment of publishing this  report (June 2021) there are two new undergraduate level AI programmes  at Lithuania’s universities, and five undergraduate and graduate level programmes are pending approval.  Most of the higher education institutions incorporate AI modules in their IT and  technology -related study  programmes. Currently, there are nine higher education institutions and scientific institutes carrying out  research in various fields of AI.   Since mid -2020, the Elements of AI  course is  available in Lithuania and accessible to all its citizens in  Lithuanian. The Lithuanian partners of the project are the Kaunas University of Technology and the AI Boost  initiative  at the Agency of Science, Innovation an d Technology. Around 20% of Lithuania’s population has  been actively invited to take on the course.   5.17.2  From the lab to the market   The Lithuanian strategy presents policy recommendations for the growth of research and development in  the field of AI . To this purpose, the government will establish a national research centre in AI and increase  the financial support to AI research by developing new funding programmes  with the aim of meeting the  standards set out by the European Commission (i.e. increasing  funding for AI research by 70% by the end of  2020).   To foster  innovations in AI , the government advances a range of policy recommendations towards  increased adoption of AI in both the private and public sector. A vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem could be   encouraged by means of an AI start -up hub and Digital Innovation Hubs. Incentive mechanisms to increase  
  89 the visibility of AI leading firms through awards such as seals of excellence or an AI badge are also  considered. In the private sector , the Lithuanian  Government identifies the following priority areas with  high AI potential : manufacturing, agriculture, healthcare, transport and energy.  In the public sector, an  Advisory Board will be created to advise on future AI policies and to foster an innovative cu lture in the  public administration . Regulatory sandboxes will be established to provide optimal conditions for testing  promising AI solutions. Lastly , guidance is foreseen to adopt and implement AI systems.  The AI Boost initiative   is consulting young companies about their AI products with the goal to help at least 50 start -ups in  developing at least 20 working prototypes of their AI solutions.   5.17.3  Networking   The AI ecosystem is further strengthened with policies towards netwo rking and opportunities for  partnerships  across all relevant stakeholders . Research centres, businesses and public organisations are  encouraged to join forces and to increase knowledge transfers among  each other. The strategy  presents  policy recommendations to  stimulate  both national and international collaborations. To promote networking  within the country, the government will set up and promote AI meetings and conferences and will foster the  creation of communities of AI exp erts. At international level, the strategy recommends to strengthen its ties  with adjacent countries Latvia and Estonia and to set up shared initiatives with extended neighbours of the  Baltic region. Finally , Lithuania should continue supporting initiative s at the European Union level and beyond,  seeking  among others  to cooperate  with global leading companies in AI.   The AI Boost initiative  also organise s outreach activities such as  the AI BOOST  2021 Conference , which is a  two-day event with keynotes and panel discussions around various tracks, including AI for business, AI for  society and AI for Government .   5.17.4  Regulation   To create a solid foundation for trustworthy developments o f AI, the Lithuanian strategy sets out  recommendations for the creation of an ethical and legal regulatory framework . To this purpose, the  government will establish an AI ethics committee to develop a proposal for ethical guidelines. Lithuania  strongly recommends the development of ethical principles and legal rules to overcome the current ethical  and legal vacuum in th e country. The development of this regulatory framework could take advantage of  existing regulations at European level. Analyses of good practices could also be useful. Overall, new rules and  regulations should aim to ensure explainability, transparency, fairness, trust, verifiability , safety and security  against attacks.  The creation of a national interdisciplinary centre on AI is also considered to promote  discussions of surrounding issues on ethics of AI.  In addition, guidelines for unbiased algorithms a re being  developed to assist developers and managers in assuring that their AI products do not discriminate women,  disabled persons, and other  disadvantaged groups.  Finally, Lithuania adopted a law on autonomous driving   that allows operation of self -driving cars without a driver being present.   5.17.5  Infrastructure   The Lithuanian strategy emphasises the need to create a stable and AI -friendly data environment , with  focus on the p ublic sector. The government highlights the existence of an open data portal Open.data.gov.lt .  This portal provides an initial step towards the establishment of an open data ecosy stem, but the current  version is still limited in usability due to a large portion of data being uploaded in closed format. Hence, the  government encourages setting up a centralised hub for open data with enforced standards for data  management and sufficie nt data literacy for a proper use of the data. Finally, the data infrastructure should  aim at meeting international standards with respect to findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR)  principles, and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).   5.17.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   In 2020 , the Lithuanian Government has developed a Long-term investment plan for economi c stimulus .  Specifically, The Ministry of Finance prepared this plan in cooperation with other ministries and with the  Government Strategic Analysis Centre ( STRATA ). It identifies five priorities related to human capital, digital  economy and business, innovation and research, economic infrastructure as well as climate change and  energy . 
  90 The fifth priority  about Climate change and energy  explicitly focuses on increasing  the use of renewable  energy sources (RES) and on enhancing the efficiency and competitiveness of the energy sector. The  objectives include : the development of offshore wind infrastructure; the installation of RES in households,  industrial and public build ings of private and legal persons; the modernisation and development of heat  supply networks and the renovation of buildings; the replacement of petroleum gas appliances in multi apartment buildings by other energy sources; and the generation of electricit y by using liquefied natural gas.   A non -negligible part of the initiatives planned for the development of a more sustainable economy will  probably rely on AI and will benefit from the policies in the second pillar on digital economy and business.  Investmen ts in this pillar will target industrial digitisation, the support of new e -businesses, the development  of innovation sandboxes and the preparation of 5G networks.   In addition to these initiatives, in 2019 the Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology (MITA) organised a  conference  on GovTech Baltic Leaders  in collaboration with GovTech Lab L ithuania . The conference objective  was to bring together representatives from both the public and private sectors to discuss how tech start -ups  can help to achieve sustainable development, and what role GovTech could have in solving the climate crisis.   More recently, in July 2020, MITA announced a call for proposals  to support the development of Green  industry innovation. The call foresees investments  from EUR 10,000 to  EUR 2 million per project.  The  innovation areas include  bio-technologies, new products from recycled materials, environmental technologies  and technologies to modernise production processes while reducing their negative impact on the environ ment,  such as digitisation, automation, robotisation.   COVID -19 pandemic   The Lithuanian Long-term investment plan for economic s timulus  includes  funding for a wide range of  scientific and business activities to counteract the COVID -19 outbreak. Within this specific field, it includes  funding f or scientific research, the development of products, accelerating related start-ups, health  infrastructure , advanced clinical trials, innovative treatment methods, digital health innovations and tele health services .  The Ministry of Economy and Innovation  introduced an AI -powered robot ViLTė  providing official COVID -19  related information. This virtual conversation robot is now embedded in the Government’s website . Using AI  algorithms it answers citizens’ questions  posed in Lithuanian or English about coronavirus related issues .  Reinforcement learning techniques allow the robot to become smarter each time it receives an additional  question.   It is worth noticing that ViLTė was actually ideated during the Lithuanian e dition of the hackathon Hack the  Crisis , specifically designed to respond to the COVID -19 crisis  and co-organised by a GovTech team from  MITA. Specifically, the project GovTech Lab  by MITA aims ‘to boost the innovation ecosystem within the fields  of GovTech and AI by increasing the number of GovTech and AI companies, encouraging organisations to  integrate and use GovTech and AI solutions, focusing on raising  awareness about such innovations and  ensuring the accessibility of knowledge and experts for those, who aspire to create AI or GovTech products.   In June 2020, the Minister of Energy, the acting Minister of Economy and Innovation, and the Minister of  Finan ce opened the four -day online conference Fintech Week Lithuania . This event revolves around AI and  data economy from a fintech perspective. It hosted the Lithuanian fintech company Bankera that was  previously awarded - in the Digital Finance category – in the #EUvsVirus  hackathon to develop innovative  solutions to overcome COVID -19. In this latter hackathon, the L ithuanian awarded projects proposing AI enabled solutions are:   Katana ML : a project aiming  to forecast COVID -19 cases for 20 days ahead with machine learning  techniques;    Teachers Lea d Tech : a project to support the use of  3D modelling and virtual reality and as such to  improve learning experiences at schools.   5.17.7  Monitoring and future update   Lithuania is considering a review and, if necessary, an update of its national AI strategy in 2021. Investment  measures are being planned to support the development of language resources for use in AI, as well as  support schemes for AI start -ups, and for businesses performing AI transformations.      
  91 5.18 Luxembourg   In May 2019, the G overnment of Luxembourg published its national AI strategy, entitled Artificial i ntelligence:  a strategic vision for Luxembourg  (Luxembourg, 2019).  The strategy is part of a broader policy programme   called Digital Luxembourg  aiming at coordinating and strengthening Luxembourg’s effort s in the digital  transformation towards the development of a solid digital society.   The strategy acts as a vision paper outlining the ambitions of Luxembourg in the field of AI and presenting  strategic policy recommendations in key areas to achieve them. The policy vision of Luxembourg’s strategy is  to support the development of a human -centric AI based on an efficient and su stainable data -driven  ecosystem. It aims at position ing Luxembourg as a leading digital society in the world. To ac hieve these   object ives, the strategy advances a range of policy recommendations in the following key areas:    Enhancing the skills and competenc ies in the field of AI and providing opportunities for lifelong  learning;    Supporting research and development of AI, transforming Lu xembourg in a living lab for applied AI;    Increasing public and private investments in AI and related technologies;    Fostering the adoption and use of AI in the public sector;    Strengthening opportunities for  national and international networks and collaborat ions with strategic  partners in AI;     Developing an ethical and regulatory framework, with particular attention for privacy regulation and  security to ensure transparent and trustworthy AI development;    Unleashing the potential of the data economy, as a cornerstone of AI development.   The national AI strategy of Luxembourg does not disclose financial provisions or estimations for its  implementation.   5.18.1  Human capital   With respect to formal education , the G overnment of Luxembourg recommends reforming the second ary  and higher education systems and vocational training programmes  to include AI -related courses in their  curricula. The strategy also emphasises the importance to increase the digital literacy and basic AI knowledge  of citizens to prepare them for the di gital transformation. To optimise lifelong learning opportunities  for  the workforce, it is advised  to develop tailor -made learning experiences. This could be done in collaboration  with leading AI companies to make sure that newly acquired skills and compet encies fit the need s of the  labour market .   As outlined in the Digital Luxembourg's progress r eport 2020 , several initiatives to su pport advanced digital  skills are currently ongoing  in these directions . At the earliest education levels, initiatives such as Kids life  skills and Kniwwelino  aim to prepare pre -school and primary school children for computational thinking and  coding. In 2020, the government presented Einfach Digital , a ne w national approach to digitalis ation in the  classroom that centres on critical thinking, creativity, communication, collaboration & coding. In addition, t he  Luxembourg Tech School ( LTS) has expanded its course offer in AI. Such initiatives are complemented with  learning opportunities in AI for the labour  force  as offered by AI academy Luxembourg  (training modules for  decision makers, technical professionals, data scientists & engineers), Lifelong -learning.lu  (platform with  trainings in IT and telecom munication), and the Elements of AI  course, among others.   To fully grasp whether the needs for AI -related skills for the public and private sector are met, the  government is also planning to map the current educa tion offer and to integrate AI courses in those  disciplines that are subject to benefit most from AI. This mapping information  could feed into existing policy  programmes  such as Digital Skills Bridge  and the rec ently launched Talent Attraction S trategy  to further  improve the fit between workforce’s skills and the needs of the labour market.   5.18.2  From the lab to the market   To foster the creation of marketable products and services  in AI, the G overnment of Luxembourg has the  ambition to transform the country into a living lab for applied AI . This will be done by encouraging a  research culture in AI through the establishment of world -class testing facilities and regulatory sandboxes  and through the development of research centres such as the Luxembourg Digital Innovation Hub  hosted and  managed by Luxinnovation . To further increase innovations in AI  with a particular focus to SMEs and start ups, the strategy advocates the use and ex pansion of existing financial funds such as The Future Fund , the  
  92 Digital Tech Fund  and the Société Nat ionale de Crédit et d’Investissement ( SNCI) bank. With the aim to  improve the quality and efficiency of public services , the G overnment of Luxembourg is also setting up  policy recommendations to foster AI innovations  and use in the public sector. This is done among others by  identifying potential projects that could provide human -centric AI solutions for citizens and by sharing good   practices with the (international) AI community.  A call for projects  was launched  for ministries to submit ideas  for AI -based initiatives that would help them optimise or expand their services in November 2019. The call  drew a total of 14 projects from seven different administrations: six winning teams received funds to  kickstart its projec t along with guidance on procurement, design and service provider selection. After 6 to 9  months of development, a completed proof of concept and mock -up will help determine if the project should  move forward. Also, a team of legal experts on data and tech nology evaluated and assisted the finalists. This  learning experience brings lasting value to Luxembourg’s public administration. A second call was launched in  the beginning of 2021.    Other instruments at hand to reinforce customer -oriented services are the creation of a centralised data  ecosystem for public data and the Digital by Default  initiative that aims support the digitalisation and  simplification of the public administration.   5.18.3  Networking   The strategy of Luxembourg also includes several policy recommendations for increasing national and  international partnerships in AI . The National Researc h Fund has dedicated funding for collaborative  public -private research in fields as advanced robotics and digital manufacturing. Through the use of public private partnerships (PPPs) the government is also prioritising more multidisciplinary research. The  government has for instance recently launched an AI Laboratory  in Luxembourg in partnership with NVIDIA.  In  addition, the strategy mentions the active participation of Luxembourg into European -wide initiatives as  CLAIRE  and Copernicus .   5.18.4  Regulation   A new regulatory framework  will be put in plac e to remove barriers to AI development. To ensure  ethical  guidelines  for a trustworthy, trans parent and sustainable AI, the G overnment of Luxembourg i s setting up a  technology &  ethics advisory committee. Collaborations among governmental bodies aims also to ensure the  adoption of proper corporate governance in AI.  The government will also engage with the National Data  Protection Authority to develop regulations with respect to privacy and data protection. The regulatory  environment will aim to enhance qual ity, accessibility and transparency of data . Finally, the  Luxembourgish institute for standardisation ( ILNAS ) will be consulted to coordinate standardisation processes  in AI.  5.18.5  Infrastructure   The successful development of cutting -edge AI technologies requires a well -developed data and  telecommunication infrastructure . To this purpose Luxembourg is heavily investing in data centres,   computing  infrastructure  and ICT resources. The Luxembourg Commerci al Internet eXchange ( LU-CIX) for  instance provides access to six data centres, with a fast and reliable network stability and high -volume data  transfer speeds. Luxembourg is also participating in the European initiat ive on High -Performance Computing  (EuroHPC ) aiming to develop expensive computing resources.  In this respect, the supercomputer MeluXina  will  be developed. It will be a petascale supercomputer, capable of executing more than 10 Petaflops, 10 million  billion calculations per second and powered by green energy from a  cogeneration plant powered by waste  wood. This new supercomputing system is expected to be operational early 2021 and will rank in the world's  top 30 supercomputers. MeluXina is funded via a joint investment of about EUR 30 million from the European  Union  and Luxembourg.   5.18.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   Luxembourg has set up the first European national partnership  on AI with NVIDIA. The Government of  Luxembourg  together with the country’s scientific community and NVIDIA will set up a joint research  laboratory for AI. Focusing on using AI and high performance computing to search for solutions to  major 
  93 societal challenges  including space resources research , which could include green energy, climate and the  environment.   In January 2021, the Ministry of the Economy , among others, sponsored the event Cleantech Forum Europe   that took  place in Luxembourg. This forum deals with topics related to digitisation  and data as the key to a  cleaner future  also investigating the potential of AI and data platforms as tools to collect and analyse data  for a cleaner future. Fur thermore, the Luxembourg CleanTech Cluster  engages with transforming urban life  globally by means of sustainability, quality of life and embedded intelligence.   COVID -19 pand emic  The Luxembourg national innovation agency – Luxinnovation  – plays a crucial role in countering the COVID -19  pandemic. First, it manages the Luxembourg HealthTech Cluster  that brings together national players involved  in innovative health technologies. Its aim is to promote the development of new and existing companies  through innovation, thereby contributing to economic growth and job creation, notably in the area of digital  health. Furthermore, Luxinnovation provides support to the Ministry of the Economy to launch a call for  projects StartupVs COVID 19 which will offer 20 selected start -ups up to  EUR 150,000 in public funding.  Although this call is not directly geared towards AI, it may contain AI -related projects among the selected  applica tions.   Luxembourg is also headquarter to the COVID -19 Smart Screening Tool  presented within the context of the  #EUvsVirus  hackath on. This project is jointly developed by Luxembourg and Greece with the objective to rollout a generalis ed, scalable, yet resource -optimis ed strategy for de -confinement with a combination of COVID 19 testing and surveyin g based on machine learning, blockchain, and AI techniques. The result would be a  risk-based approach for targeted COVID -19 testing that could be used in any de -confinement situation .  5.18.7  Monitoring and future update   The inter -ministerial coordination group, under leadership of the Prime Minister, will set up a governance  mechanism to continuously follow up on strategic initiatives that support Luxembourg’s AI development. It will  regularly assess the strategic vision and set up a framework for upcoming action s in the future.  
  94 5.19 Malta    In October 2019, the Maltese G overnment published Malta’s national AI strategy  (Malta, 2019a). The objective  for Malta is to ga in a strategic competitive advantage in the global economy in the field of AI. To achieve this  objective, the policy report presents three pillars to lay the foundations for Malta’s AI strategy:    The creation of a solid AI ecosystem based on investments, st art-up support and innovation;    Support for increased adoption of AI in the public sector;    Support measures for the adoption of AI in the private sector.   The successful achievement of these objectives relies on three horizontal enablers that cut across the three  aforementioned areas: education and workforce, legal and ethical framework and infrastructure. The national  AI strategy of Malta has been based on Malta’s AI workforce high-level policy document  that was released in  March 2019 for public consultation (Malta, 2019b).   Malta’s government has launched a dedicated web portal malta.ai  to outline and present the progress m ade  in implementing the national strategy in AI.   The Maltese  AI strategy lacks inclusion of  financial provisions or estimations for its overall implementation.   5.19.1  Human capital   With regard to human capital, Malta will introduce fundamental changes to the educ ational system . In  first instance educational courses and study programmes will incorporate AI  and will cross -link with  other disciplines such as healthcare, marketing, sociology, and physics, among others.  The Maltase strategy  proposes a range of policies towards the reform of primary, secondary and higher education systems as well  as support for teachers to enhance their course offerings in AI:    At early age levels and for primary education levels, the Mini stry of Education and Employment will  support initiatives , such  as 1) the AI Family Challenge:  a programme  for children with AI hands -on  workshops and 2) the AI Olympiad:  focusing on learning and using AI m ethods. The Ministry will also  introduce AI traini ngs in the secondary education system;    In higher education, several Master programmes , PhD scholarships and postgraduate programmes  in  AI will be introduced in the upcoming years. These will be developed and coordinated by the Malta  College of Arts, Scienc e & Technology ( MCAST ) and the University of Malta ( UoM), among others;    The Ministry of Education and Employment will provide support for teachers on how AI solutions  could be  incorporated in the education curriculum of teachers. This will be done in collaboration with  the Malta Union of Teachers .  With respect to education reforms, the Malta College of Arts, Science & Technology has released an AI  Strategy and action p lan 2020 -2025  in which it outlines policy actions towards the introduction of AI in  education systems in Malta (2019c).   Reskilling the workforce  is key to get prepared for the upcoming opportunities brought along by innovative  AI technologies. Malta's AI strategy makes references to both lifelong learning and the screening of labour  market for upcoming skills demand. The strategy proposes the followi ng actions among others:    Set up of a think tank to assess the more vulnerable skills and jobs  due to automation and AI  in order to propose a transition plan;    Employment reforms and safeguards to offset the impact of automation;    Creation of a national reskilling programme to facilitate peoples' transition into areas that are  complementary to AI based tasks or that require stronger elements of creative thought and cognitive  aptitude;    Promoting access to training for the workforce through the Investing in s kills programme ;   The eSkills Malta Foundation  can provide advice on reforms in the ICT e ducational offerings and AI related courses for professionals;    Promoting continuous learning  and Massively Open Online Courses (MOOCs) to keep up with the  speed of change due to AI technologies.     
  95 5.19.2  From the lab to the market   Malta's strategy foresees  increas ed research activities, dedicated  investment instruments , start -ups  development  and innovation support in both the public and private sector .  Both the University of Malta and the College of Arts, Science & Technology will be supported with public  funding t o increase applied research output in AI . According to Malta’s strategy, financial support for AI related research could be partially funded through the R&I FUSION Programme  which has an annual budg et  of EUR 2.2 million.   The government will provide additional funding  to governmental accelerators and incubators in order to  support AI -related businesses and start -ups. The accelerator YouStartIT , run by the MITA Innovation Hub, will  be given funding to develop an AI -based programme  to help the early start -up of AI businesses. Extra public  funding will also be attributed to the TAKEOFF Seed Fund Award , a seed funding initiative to researchers and  entrepreneurs. In addition, the government will organise events where  AI start -ups and scale -ups can meet  and team up with angel investors and venture  capitalists . Lastly , the government will establish an investment  fund, and will encourage co -investments from the public and private sector . It has also reformed the Seed  Investments Scheme  with more favourable tax credit conditions for innovative AI firms.   Other p olicy measures to accelerate private sector AI adoption  in Malta contain, among others:    Creating  a Private Sector AI Readiness Index to assess the digital and AI maturity of business a nd to  identify where to provide government guidance and policy actions. This index will be updated  annually;    Increasing the awareness and knowledge of the private sector on the benefits of AI and improving  their trust in AI (as outlined in the section on R egulation).   Malta's strategy emphasise s that policy measures enabling the use, development and integration of AI will be  targeting businesses of all sizes, but particular attention will be given to SMEs as it constitute s a large   proportion of Maltese businesses.   With the  uptake of AI in the public sector  Malta aims to improve the economic and social well -being of  citizens and businesses, to provide better services and to increase the efficiency of internal operations in the  public administration.  The responsibility for fostering the deployment of AI in the public administration will be  done by respective Ministries and Chief Information Officers. In addition, a Technical Committee will be  established to review the architecture of AI solutions in the public administration.  Overall, the strategy  foresees the  following range of initiatives  for the public sector :   Promoting  AI pilot projects in the public sector and providing  support along the entire implementation  phase, from use -case selection, prototype and testing until successful implementation . Malta’s   strategy highlights pilot projects on AI in traffic management, education, healthcare, customer  service, tourism, better utilities and energy ;   Enabling  automation and better use of d ata across public sector;    Supporting public procurement for  emerging technology solutions;    Increasing t raining and awareness programmes to support AI in the public sector.   5.19.3  Networking   The AI strategy of Malta foresees the development of a detailed framework  for collaboration between  industry, educational and research institutes. This includes the design of a collaboration model, tools,  guidelines, and relevant standards that facilitate interactions. The strategy highlights  the need to promote  collaborations at different levels of granularity (e.g. both nationally and internationally oriented) and  emphasise s the importance of collaborations across institutions of both public and private sectors, ranging  from research institutes, private companies of any size l evel (with particular importance for start -ups), and  educational institutions. Support actions for collaboration in AI includes, among others:    Supporting cross -sector sharing, co-innovations  with the (inter)national community ;   Increasing opportunities for collaborations with the government by opening up calls for proposals for  researchers, businesses and public sector representatives on Maltese web portal for AI ; 
  96  The launch of a Digital Innovation Hub with a focus on AI, wh ich will serve as a collaboration  platform to foster AI opportunities in the public and private sector by bringing research and  innovation communities together.   Besides support for enhancing collaboration, the strategy of Malta is also proposing initiative s towards  increasing the international attractiveness  of the country  for international talents, entrepreneurs and  investors :   The launch of a Start -up visa, which provides a simplified procedure for start -up founders and their  families members from outside the EU to reside and work in Malta;     Malta’s Key Employee Initiative  provides fast -track services to highly -specialised t hird-country  professionals employed in Malta;    The government has re -introduce d the Qualifying Employment in Innovation and Creativity  (Personal  Tax) Scheme. This measure facilitates emplo yment of non -residents in roles which are currently not  addressed by the local labour market by temporarily easing the tax expenses incurred by such  individuals through a fiscal incentive.   In terms of dissemination and uptake of AI , the Maltese high -level workforce suggests:    To organise promotion campaigns and outreach programmes to highlight the benefits of AI.  The  Maltese strategy announce s a public investment of EUR 1 million per year for this activity.   5.19.4  Regulation   The development of a legal and ethical f ramework  is a salient step towards a successful adoption and  subsequent widespread deployment and use of AI across the economy. In October  2019, Malta published its  strategy towards trustworthy AI  (Malta, 2019d).  It outlines Malta’s vision for an ethical and trustworthy AI and  sets out fo ur ethical AI principles to achieve this:    Human autonomy;    Prevent harm;    Fairness;    Explicability.   Complementing this ethical framework, Malta’s government has also set up the following policy initiatives  towards the development of an ethical AI:    The c reation of a National Technology Ethics Committee to oversee the Ethical AI Framework and to  ensure its monitoring an d implementation;    The l aunch of a national AI certification framework: a certification  issued by the Malta Digital  Innovation Authority ( MDIA ) that serves as a valuable recognition in the marketplace that the AI  systems of successful applicants have been developed in an ethically aligned, transparent and  socially  responsible manner.   To encourage the adoption of AI, particular emphasis is placed to the development of r egulation and  legislation , including:    A Technology Regulation Advisory Committee will be appointed to advise on legal matters and  develop legal guidelines where needed (legislation to clarify IP ownership rights and liability in AI will  be a priority);    Malta i s setting up a regulatory sandbox for AI providing regulatory exceptions to firms to foster  testing of AI solutions. In addition, a Data sandbox will be developed to provide guidance on how data  protection rules apply.   In terms of standardisation , Malta's AI strategy emphasise s the importance to collaborate with international  organisations on emerging standards and norms in AI. This goes along with the provision of a common  definition on AI aligned with the one provided by the EU High -Level Expert Group on AI.     
  97 5.19.5  Infrastructure   The delivery of AI research, development and adoption can only be achieved in a well -developed and cutting edge data and ICT  infrastructure . As highlighted in Malta's strategy, an enabling infrastructure should be  part of a holistic AI  strategy and contains various dimensions such as data and connectivity resources,  compute capabilities and data sharing platforms for all institutional players, ranging from research institutes,  regulatory authorities, and start -up ecosystems to innovatio n hubs. Among others, the strategy proposes to  set up the following initiatives:    Investing in Malte se language resources to foster language technology solutions;    Supporting  data centres to meeting the growing needs of computing power and storage. Malta  Entreprise , Malta’s economic development agency, will offer incentives and support measures in this  regard;    Increasing access to open data with the launch of Malta Data  Portal , an open data repository  developed by the Malta Information Technology Agency ( MITA);   Providing  cost-effective access to computing capacity through various initiatives such as  supercomp uting cluster A.L.B.E.R.T , and Malta’s participation in the European Initiative EuroHPC  to  develop a pan -Europea n supercomputing infrastructure;    Enabling  access to cloud platforms for the public and private sector by means of initiatives such as  Malta Hybrid Cloud  procured by MITA.   5.19.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The Government of Malta has committed to establish itself as a c entre of Climate Friendly Travel. In doing so,  it puts itself on the forefront in addressing the climate change by promoting climate -friendly travel through  reduced emissions  with the ultimate objective of carbon neutrality.  The Maltese G overnment made this  statement during the SunX Malta’s first Annual Climate Friendly Travel Think Tank  in February 2020.  SunX   Malta has been established through support from the Ministry for Tourism & Consumer Protection, a nd Malta  Tourism Authority (MTA).  This company aims at contributing to the global effort of converting the threat of  the ongoing climate change. In collaboration with the Swiss -based company Wisekey, it launched the Tourist  Digital Identity  using Blockchain AI and IoT technologies.   COVID -19 pandemic   During the COVID -19 pandemic, the Mater Dei Hospital  deployed a new robot which can process 800  coronavirus tests per day and release the results within few minutes.   5.19.7  Monitoring and future update   The national AI strate gy of Malta sets out a vision at long -term, aiming to transform Malta into a leading  economy in the field of AI by 2030. The policies outlined in the strategy are meant to be undertaken in the  period 2019 -2022. Their implementation will be monitored and ev aluated at regular basis. Malta’s web portal  on AI  will be used to release forthcoming information on the progress of the strategy’s implementation.   
  98 5.20 Netherlands   In October 2019, the Dutch G overnm ent has released its Strategic a ction plan for artificial i ntelligence   (Netherlands, 2019) . The strategy  presents a range of policy initiatives to strengthen Netherlands’  competitiveness in AI on the global market. The vision of the Dutch AI strategy relies on three strategic pillars,  aiming at:    Capitalising on societal and economic opportunities: policies encouraging the adoption, use and  development of AI in the private and public sector and promoting the use of AI to tackle societal  challenges;    Creating the right conditions: policies supporting education and s kills development in AI; fostering  research and innovation in AI, facilitating the access to qualitative data and improving the digital  infrastructure;    Strengthening the foundations: including policy actions related to ethical issues, such as trust, human  rights, consumer protection, and safety of citizens.   The strategy contains an extensive list of initiatives aiming at fostering AI in the economy through policies  related to education, R&D and innovation , networking, regulatio n and infrastructure.   The Dutc h strategy mentions in an annex that the yearly governmental budget for AI innovation and research  is estimated at EUR 45 million per year. In 2019 this budget was EUR 64 million. In 2020 the Netherlands  funded an additional EUR 23 .5 million for the Public  Private Partnership the Dutch AI Coalition. In April 2021  an investment programme was granted to maximise the possibilities of AI for the Dutch economy and society  by investing an additional amount of maximum EUR 276 million in the upcoming years.   5.20.1  Human c apital   Formal education and training reforms are foreseen through policies targeting increased digital literacy in  primary and secondary education and providing more opportunities to develop skills and competenc ies in data  science in higher education ( National Data Science Trainee programme ). A national online course on AI  is also  available for civil servants in the Net herlands. Vocational training initiatives funded by the Regional  Investment Fund  will target more closely the future (digital) needs of the labour ma rket. Further training and  lifelong learning are foster ed with the STAP -scheme  – a EUR 200 million investment to create training  opportunities in AI and digital skills for individuals – and with a m ulti-annual programme for the improvement  of Lifelong Dev elopment , with a focus on digital skills.   5.20.2  From the lab to the market   In order to stimulate basic and applied research in AI , the Dutch Research Council  is supporting a new  research programme on AI. To complement  this initiative, the Dutch AI -coalition proposes the establishmen t  of an AI Competence Centre. In order to  create favourable conditions for compan ies to invest in AI, the Dutch  Government improves access to innovation funding and venture capital through Innovation Credits , the Seed  Capital Scheme  and the Dutch Venture Initiative . In addition, the Chamber of Commerce of fers hands -on  information on AI, which could support companies in their innovation efforts.   The Dutch G overnment  also developed the Knowledge and in novation Covenant ( KIC) funding . This funding is  provided by knowledge institutions, the business community, governments and other public parties that jointly  invest  in innovation. KIC 2020 -2023 supports fundamental and practical research in public -private  partnerships and focuses on key enabling technologies such as  energy transition and  sustainability,  agriculture, water and food, health care, and safety. AI is a key enabler in each of these areas .  Concerning R&D&I, fiv e projects in the field s of AI, regenerative medicine, health data infrastructure, quantum  technology and hydrogen/green chemistry  received funding from the National Growth Fund . The Netherlands   AI Coalition ( NL AIC ), a public -private partn ership consisting of more than 400 participants, received a share  of EUR 276 million to fund the first phase of its project  on AI , called  the AiNEd Programme  (Netherlands,  2021) . It aims to accelerate  the development and application of AI.  It focuses on large -scale projects for 1)  accelerating i nnovative AI applications , 2) strengthening the knowledge base of fundamental and applied  research , 3) increasing the capacity for AI educating and training , 4) developing human -centred AI  with ethical  and legal frameworks  and 5) making data available for AI .    
  99 5.20.3  Networking   The Dutch G overnment highly values collaborations and public -partnerships  (PPPs)  in AI , such as the  Netherlands AI coalition, in which the gover nment, the business sector, educational and research institutions,  as well as civil society organisations collaborate to accelerate and connect AI developments and initiatives.   Other examples include initiatives such as Commit2Data  and VWData  with a focus on big data.   Furthermore, the strategy highlights examples of national collaborations in using AI applications in the legal  environment (e.g. document automation and due diligence based on AI) and the public domain (e.g. chatbots).  Finally, collaborations across the national borders are encouraged by strengthening Netherlands’ partnership  in European AI consortia (e.g. European Partnership on Artificial Intelligence, Data and Robotics , AI4EU , CLAIRE   and ELLIS ) and international AI collaborations such as Holland Innovation Network  and the Coalition of the  Willing .   In addition, the Netherlands takes part in the Global Partnership on AI ( GPAI), an international initiative to spur  a responsible development and use of AI in full respect of human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and  economic growth. The GPAI collaborates with international partners and organisations to bring together  experts fr om industry, civil society, governments and the academic world. This initiative is stirred by a  secretariat, hosted by the OECD in Paris, and it accounts for two Centres of Expertise in Montreal and in Paris.   5.20.4  Regulation   Regarding regulation, the Dutch G overnment advocates an ethical, trustworthy and responsible use of AI with  respect for human rights and consumer protection, and based on a well -developed legal framework. Policy  actions relate to various research activities on ethical, legal and transparency  aspects, and responsible use of  AI. The Netherlands AI coalition has for instance developed the concept of ELSA labs  (ELSA refers to Ethical,  Legal an d Societal Aspects ) to enhance synergies between research, education and organisations  on human centric AI. The Dutch G overnment also highlights its active participation into High Level Experts Groups and  European Directives on these issues.   Several reforms to the legislation are ongoing to support the protection of public values and encourage the  use of AI in a trustworthy environment:    Amsterdam's AI register (in partnership with the city of Helsinki): Amsterdam and Helsinki have  launched open AI registers  that track how algorithms are being used in the municipalities. A White  Paper  on the AI register was published on September 2020 to inspire other  governments/organisations wanting to be transparent about their use of algorithms and AI;    Experimental Law on s elf-driving vehicles : In effect since  July 2019, public road tests involving self driving vehicles without drivers present are allowed under certain conditions;    Principles of good governance and consumer protection for the use and development of AI have been  amended in the Freedom of Information Act, the General Administrative Law Act and the General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  The Dutch G overnment has also implemented the Law  Enforcement D irective in its national legislation, which contains provisions regarding automated  decision making for law enforcement.  Related to this latter issue, the government has adopted a law  to prevent discrimination in recruitment  when automated systems are used;    The Dutch G overnment has developed guidelines for applying algorithmic data analysis , with the  intention to translate them into legislation.   5.20.5  Infrastructure   The Dutch strategy includes policy initiatives to foster the data infrastructure and to provide  foundation s for  data use and sharing. It include s the promotion of FAIR principles for private data sharing, the participation  into the Commo n European Data Space  and the creation of an inventory of data sharing solutions. In terms of  digital and telecommunication infrastructure, the Dutch strategy mentions among others the Digital  Connectivity Action Plan  (aiming at setting up a high -quality connectivity) and the government investments in  supercomputing power (e.g. supercomputer at SURF ).       
  100 5.20.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The NL AIC  coalition highlights energy and sustainability as one of the ke y areas for AI applications. AI is a  cornerstone technology to reduce energy consumption and develop innovative projects with positive climate  impact. A dedicated Energy and Sustainability working group has been created to bring together ongoing  initiative s and to create  preconditions for cooperation  in this field  (e.g. by  making agreements  on data access  and use) .  The Dutch  Water Partnership  (NWP) is a network of Dutch organisations, i ncluding government agencies, from  the water sector with the goal to collaborate  on developing  sustainable water solutions . This partnership  highlights  the importance of  AI and machine learning to augment human -based know -how to improve  efficiency and free up resources in the water sector, therefore positively contributing sustainability and  environmental challenges.   In January 2016, the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute ( KNMI ) has created the KNMI DataLab . This  project aims to facilitate and coordinate innovations in the fields of climate change, weather forecasting and  seismology. The KNMI Datalab brings value and support to collaborating partners by sharing its knowledge in  these research fields and by providing access to the data available at KNMI. Big data management, data  analy tics including machine learning and deep learning are becoming increasingly  important in the supported  projects of the DataLab.   COVID -19 pandemic   Emerging technologies as AI and big data spur the development of cutting -edge innovations an d provide relief  on many fronts to fight against the COVID -19. The Invest in Holland  network, which provides support to the  Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, identifies various appli cation areas in which AI is used in the Netherlands  to overcome COVID -19:   Using AI in medical imaging for diagnosis;    Using AI to assess risk;    Using AI to flatten the curve.   Overall, the following initiatives and innovativ e applications of AI have recently appeared in the Netherlands  towards COVID -19:   The National Institute for Public Health and the Environment ( RIVM ) leads the way in using  novel  tools to track and model the spread of  the virus with AI and machine learning. The national institute  uses the Infection Radar  that employs  statistical analysis techniques falling into the machine learning and AI category. The Infection Radar belongs to Influenzanet , a European partnership among  several universities and gove rnments in Europe;    A team f rom the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) prompted more than 30 other EU hospitals  to  submit longs’ radiographs in order  to develop a powerful algorithm that could accurately diagnose  coronavirus cases through CT scans within seconds. This initiative is a response to the  ongoing   European campaign to develop a deep learning -based model for the automated detection of  abnormal ities on chest CT and for quantifying lung involvement. Specifically, Imaging COVID -19 AI is  a collaborative  European project to enhance computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID -19  by using AI. The pro ject group will create a deep learning model for automated detection and  classification of COVID -19 on CT scans, and for assessing disease severity in patients by  quantification of lung involvement;    The Maasstad Hospital  in collaboration with Holland AI  developed an algorithm based on AI in order  to assess the portion of affected lung tissue in patients poten tially positive to the COVID -19;   An initiative , coordinated by Amsterdam UMC hospital together with VU University Amsterdam and  Maastricht UMC, aims at increasing the use of AI to combat the corona virus. The objective of the  initiative is to include all Dutch hospitals and the National Intensive Care Evaluation Foundation  (NICE) to jointly step  into novel AI -based researches to predict whether a patient infected with COVD 19 will become in need of ventilation ;   Within CLAIRE , a large  European network of AI experts, the University of Leiden  have developed AI  applications that take advantage of the enormous amounts of health data generated  by intensive  care departments. Specifically, this data feed into self -learning algorithms meant to help doctors  making forecasts and taking decisions, for example about patients’  future needs of intensive care;  
  101  The Dutch  Water Research Institute  (KWR) employed AI techniques to create a measurement method  that monitors sewage water and detects the presence of RNA traces of the virus which would come  from infected people. Spe cifically, the software combines machine learning with wastewater  monitoring. This  method was developed as part of the Sewers4COVID  project  within the #EUvsVirus   hackathon teaming up with Greek, Spanish , and British participants;    The Delft University of Technology  implements algorithms using available data to forecast  future   COVID -19 outbreaks . Specifically, they proposed the Network Inference -based Prediction Algorithm  (NIPA) to forecas t the future course of COVID -19;   Medical researchers from the Unive rsity of Ams terdam Medical Cent re and the Maa stricht University  Medical Cent re are collaborating on a project  using AI and big data to find out how patients can be  treated for coronavirus ;   A Medical Drone Service  was delivering medical goods during the COVID -19 outbreak .  5.20.7   Monitoring and future update   The Government  of the Ne therlands  is implementing the actions from the national strategic action plan on AI.  An overall update of the national strategy for digitalization (and AI) will follow in Q2 2021.  Focus will be on  requirements for human -centric AI, a vivid research and inn ovation ecosystem (public private partnership),  human capital, international cooperation, deployment (SMEs) and applications: public sector use, smart  industry and AI for societal challenges: health, energy transition, agriculture, mobility.   
  102 5.21 Norway   The N orwegian G overnment presented its National AI strategy  in January 2020 (Norway, 2020a). The  objective of the strategy is to outline the policy act ions for the coming years in order to maximise the  opportunities that AI can bring along for Norwegian individuals, for businesses and industry, and for the public  sector. To achieve this outcome, the national AI strategy highlights the following policy in itiatives:    Expanding the offer of education programmes and workplace trainings in the field of AI in order to  create a solid basis of digital skills and capabilities;    Strengthening the Norwegian research in AI;    Enhancing the innovation capacity in AI in bo th the private and public sector;    Outlining ethical principles for AI in order to allow fair, reliable and trustworthy AI -related  developments;    Establishing digitalisation -friendly regulations as to define the legislative framework in which AI  developments  take place;    Constructing a strong data infrastructure ensuring open data  and data sharing  across sectors and  business areas. D edicated opportunities for language data resources a re established through The  Norwegian language bank  at the National library ;   Deploying a telecommunication infrastructure that provides high -capacity connectivity and  computing power, and that ensures security in AI -based systems.   While the national AI strategy mentions various provisions to finance specific projects, it does not provide the  total amount of funding for the implementation of the strategy.   5.21.1  Human capital   The AI strategy strongly emphasised the need for incre ased digital competence at all levels of education and  for those already employed. In order to prepare the current and ongoing workforce with the appropriate digital  skills and technological literacy, the Norwegian Government has started reforming educatio n programmes at  all education levels. At the primary and secondary education  level,  the Norwegian G overnment foresees  the following:    Increa sed prominence of digital skills at schools: curricula of primary and secondary education have  been reformed as to include  more programming and computational thinking.   At the level of tertiary education , the Norwegian Government are  setting up support funding to which  universities and higher education institutions can apply to develop further education programmes. In add ition  to introducing education reforms, it is equally important to establish a solid knowledge base of the available  programmes in AI and to monitor the offer and trends in study places and candidates in AI. Policy initiatives  towards the adaptation of edu cation programmes include among others:    Expanding ICT -related programmes . The number of new study places for ICT has increased by more  than 2 ,150 compared to 2014. The seats of higher learning are developing dedicated programmes in  the field of AI at bache lor and master level, with subjects as algorithms, robotics, machine learning,  computer vision, deep learning and big data analysis . The number of student places in these areas  are increasing each year as a result of rising demand both from students and in dustry ;   Offering comprehensive education opportunities to schoolteachers in AI through the Centre for  Computing in Science Education ( CSSE ) and Centre for Teaching and Learning in Science and  Technology ( KURT ). An example of such course is ProFag programming  course in AI -related subjects  for schoolteachers;    Increasing opportunities for PhD positions on AI -related topics and allowing employees ( Industrial  PhD scheme ) to undertake a PhD project that is relevant to their company’s profile.   As AI is expected to bring about changes in many jobs, the Norwegian strategy also highlights the importance  of anticipating the pace of change to the labour market and preparing for the future labour demand. Hence,  opportunities for upskilling, reskilling, and lifelong learning  are put in place. In particular, the following  initiatives are presented:   
  103  A report  to the Storting – the supreme legislature of Norway  – on skills reforms and lifelong learning   (in Norwegian only) . The report  outline s a concrete action plan and policy initiatives  to close  the gap  between what the labour market needs in terms of skills and the skills that employees actually have ;   Funding for the development of flexible continuing education schemes that are geared towards the  needs of the jobs market, particularly the skills  that are required to digitalise businesses. In 2021,  initiatives that will enhance digital competencies, Cyber security and green transition  / sustainability  skills will be prioritised ;   Leveraging the benefits of ma ssive open online courses (MOOCs ). In th is respect, the online course on  Elements of AI  has been launched in Norwegian in 2020 in cooperation with the Norwegian  University of Science and Technology ( NTNU ). The  Minister for Regional Development and  Digitalisation has also endorsed the follow -up course Building AI  in Norway;    Preparing a strategy for digital competence in the public sector.   Overall, the provision of study programmes and workplace trainings in AI should aim to anticipate the needs  in the labour market and to integrate AI into established study programmes and job positions where relevant.   5.21.2  From the lab to the market   The promotion of scientif ic research  is essential to achieve ground -breaking innovations in AI. To this end,  the Norwegian Research Council allocated a budget of EUR 145.7 million to research, innovation and  advanced ICT applications in 2018.64 Although the Research Council has no dedicated programme towards AI  funding, 40 percent of budget allocations to ICT research in 2019 have been targeting projects related to AI,  robotics and big data, which represents a total amount around EUR 40 million. The f ollowing policy initiatives  and action plans are proposed to leverage AI research in Norway:    The Norwegian Centre for Research -Based Artificial Intelligence Innovation ( SFI NorwAI ) has been  launched in 2020. It is a new research centre on AI and big d ata. The purpose of the centre is to  develop cutting -edge theories, methods and technologies for efficient and responsible use of data driven AI in innovative industrial solutions. NorwAI is run as an integral and complementary part of  the Norwegian  Open AI Lab ( NAIL), both of which are formally hosted by the Department of  Computer Science at NTNU .   Increasing long -term research opportunities in AI -relevant technologies through dedicated research  centres, such as the programme BigInsight – Statistics for the knowledge economy  and Sirius –  Centre for Scalable Data Access  and dScience - Centre for Computational and Data Science  at the   University of Oslo (UiO) . Among others these centres address topics of statistical and machine  learning methodologies, scalable data access and high -performance computing;    Stimulating private investments in research through  deductible tax schemes for donations to  scientific research;    Increasing the participation in European research programm es. To this end, the Research Council of  Norway has establish ed the Norwegian Artificial Intelligence Network for Europe  (NAINE ). The goal is   to promote Norway’s priorities and increase its participat ion in Horizon 2020  and Horizon Europe .  Besides stimulating scientific  research in A I, the Norwegian G overnment takes a strong position in enhancing  the country’s innovation capacity  using AI. At the level of the private sector, policy instruments aim to  support  businesses in developing and adopting AI technologies. While the Research Cou ncil of Norway is more  dedicated towards promoting research, other institutions are more directed to the encouragement of  innovation, value creation and growth in businesses and industry:    Innova tion Norway : supports companies in developing their competitive advantage and enhancing  innovation. In recent years, Innovation Norway’s portfolio has seen a growth in the number of digital  projects. In 2020 the number of ICT projects tripled compared to 2 019. In terms of AI, it has  established the Tech City Executive Accelerator ( TEA) initiat ive providing international scaling and  support for companies oriented towards AI and IoT;    The Industrial Development Corporation of Norway ( Siva): a governmental corporation that aims to   unleash the national innovation capability through support from incubators, business gardens and  accelerator schemes (e.g. Norwegian Catapult scheme );                                             64  The average exchange rate of 2018 has been used to convert Norwegian Krone in Euro.  
  104  Invest inor: state -owned venture capital company providing various types of venture capital support  schemes.   The national AI strategy provides various examples of projects in which policy support was given to promote  innovation efforts. Earth Science  Analytics AS leads an industry innovation project on machine learning in  seismology that received governmental funding through the PETROMAKS 2  programme.   Furthermore, innovation efforts are encouraged through the tax incentive scheme SkatteFUNN . Although not  specifically directed towards AI, SkatteFUNN  allows  all businesses  to apply for a tax deduction for their  R&D  expenses . It is a rights based scheme that favours SMEs in particular.   Lastly , in 2018 the national government has released a comprehensive review of business policy instruments   (in Norwegian only)  directed to promote value creation and sustainable innovation throughout  the country.  The recommendations from the review aim to make the policy instruments s impler to understand and  accessible to  businesses.   With respect to the public administration , the national government emphasises the tremendous potential of  AI in disrupting the way in which the public sector will work in the future. I n particular AI in the public sector  can contribute to enhance decision -making, and improve the efficiency and quality of services through the use  of e.g. natural language processing and predicting tools. To fully leverage the benefits of AI in the public  sector , the national AI strategy foresees the following policies:    Facilitating the experimentation with and adoption of AI in public administration. Examples of  projects using AI in the public sector:   o AI in residence verification: A project conducted by th e Norwegian State Educational Loan  Fund ( Lånekassen ) for the residential verification process of students using machine  learning tools;   o Automatic posting of invoices: The Norwegian Government Agency for Financial  Management ( DFØ) is testing solutions of automatic posting of invoices using AI  technologies;    Enhancing the possibilities of innovative public procurements.   5.21.3  Networking   To increase the networking and collaboration opportunities, following policy initiatives are proposed:    Facilitating the development of Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs): During Horizon 2020, Norway  established four DIHs, affiliated with GCE NODE  in Agder, SINTEF , Oslo Cancer Cluster  and Digital  Norway , acting as enablers for SMEs. A new generation of DIHs will be launched soon, from which  some will be directed to leverage the potential of AI;   Providing support to networking opportunities, such as the informal learning arenas : Eik idéverksted,  which is a platform that brings together academics and business communities and offers a range of  courses, workshops, seminars and projects on technological innovation;    Strengthening the Norwegian AI Research Consortium ( NORA ): a consortium that comprises  Norwegian universities and research institutions engaged in research and education in AI;   Encouraging sharing of good practice s across sectors and enterprises and facilitating public -private  partnersh ips. It is a crucial policy to unlock the innovation potential of AI. One initiative in the pipeline  is the establishment of the Digital Clearinghouse Norway, a cooperation forum for consumer,  competition and data protection enforcement bodies. In addition , the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency  (Difi) can serve as a pivot institution in establishing common use cases/user journeys and sharing of  good practice s;   Supporting organisations that facilitate networking and collaborations such as DigitalNorway , which  helps businesses in their digital transformation and provides guidance throughout the innovation  process. It coop erates with research and educational institutions, business clusters and innovation  communities;    Forum for AI in the public sector – a forum for practitioners working on AI in the public sector.      
  105 5.21.4  Regulation   The national AI strategy aims to encourage the d evelopment and use of AI based on ethical principles and  with respect for human rights and democracy. This does not only call for a strong ethical framework, but also  requires a solid regulatory governance to ensure that individual and collective rights ar e enforced.   In terms of ethical principles , the Norwegian G overnment aims to promote responsible, accountable,  transparent, and trustworthy AI, while safeguarding the integrity and privacy of individuals. To this purpose,  the following policy initiatives a re foreseen:    Developing guidelines for trustworthy use of AI, in line with the recommendations made by the High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission;    To complement these ethical principles, a report on research ethics  has been recently published by  the National Committee for Research Ethics in Science and Technology. It outline s ethical guidelines  related to the responsible use of autonomous systems, social responsible research and big data;    Encouraging the educational institutions to consider how privacy and ethics can be given a central  place in their programmes in AI;   Partici pating to European and international forums to promote a trustworthy AI environment, notably  aligning efforts to and engaging with international institutions such as the European Commission, the  United Nations, the OECD, the Council of Europe and the Nordi c Council of Ministers and Nordic –Baltic  cooperation;    Stimulating the public debate on the ethical use of AI.   In terms of regulation, the national AI strategy emphasises the need to modernise the existing legislative  framework  to adjust to the coming need s of new technological developments such as AI. It is important to  develop a legislation that is technology -neutral where possible . Where legislation cannot be generalised,  sector -specific or technology -specific rules should be put in place. T he following policy initiatives  address  regulation that is relevant to AI:    Developing digitalisation -friendly regulations that solves challenges of semantic interoperability  across sectors . The access and control of data is for instance regulated through the Personal D ata  Act and other sector -specific regulations such as the Health Register Act;    Expanding the regulations in the health care sector regarding the use  of health data. Two proposals  have been put forward to make secondary use of health data easier for analysi s and decision  making . The first proposal to enable the Health Data Programme and the Health analysis data  platform  took effect  in January 2021 . The second proposal proposes amendments to the Health  Personnel Act regarding the Duty of confidentiality and t he right of disclosure  in order to enable the  use of algorithms for decision support on health data . This is still ongoing ;   Proposing regulatory sandboxes in AI: specific legislation to allow for testing, developing and  monitoring AI concepts in a protecte d environment. In 2020 the Norwegian Data Protection Authority  (DPA) establish ed a regulatory sandbox for AI in order to promote the development of et hical and  responsible AI solutions. A call for projects received 25 applications, from which four projects have  been chosen  to work together with the DPA in the sandbox  in the first round ;   During the COVID -19 crisis, a temporary regulation that authorised fully automatic processing was  added to the National Insurance Act. Many of the new solutions that were established by the Labour  and Welfare administration ( NAV) to tackle the challenges associated with COVID -19 are fully  automatic. In the autumn of 2020, the Storting adopted a government proposal to permit fully  automatic case processing in NAV on a permanent basis. The statute was added to the NAV Act and  entere d into force on 4 December 2020 ;   Developing a regulatory framework for the public sector, building on the recommendations of the  Digital s trategy for the public s ector 2019 -2025  (Norway, 2020b);    Considering the recommendations from the Law Commission on the Archival Act  (in Norwegian only)  and the Law Commission on the Public Administration Act  (in Norwegian only).  These legislations aim  to provide transparency and accountability in public administration systems where  AI is used.   Besides the development of a le gal framework and ethical rules for AI, the national strategy of Norway  highlights the importance of standardisation to foster interoperability  and coordination among various  economic players. To this aim, the following policies are essential:  
  106  Developing g uidelines on standardisation, including IPR, to facilitate collaborations in AI in the  business sector;    Promoting and participating to international standardisation activities related to AI, in particular for  Norwegian SMEs.   5.21.5  Infrastructure   As highlighted in the national AI strategy, data is a vital element for AI as it acts as the cornerstone on which  AI technologies are built upon. This calls for the development of a strong data ecosystem  to improve the  collection of quality data, to facilitate data shari ng and to promote open data policies. The national AI  strategy foresees the following policies:    Promoting and further expanding open public data and data sharing between public -sector agencies  through initiatives such as National Data Directory on https://data.norge.no/ , the Health analysis  platform with national health data and geospatial data on Geonorge.no ;   The Agency for Digitalisation ( Digdir), in cooperation with Digital Norway, created a Data Factory that  serves as a knowledge hub to promote data sharing industry. The Data Factory supports small  companies to develop business ideas and cr eate value from data and data sharing;    Encouraging data sharing between businesses in the private sector by providing clear guidance on  issues related to data protection, privacy and security;    Supporting and develop ing data sharing methods  and standards .  A report  to the Storting on the data -driven economy  (in Norwegian only) was presented to the parliament in  March 2021.   Understanding that the deployment of AI will need the support of a solid infrastructure, the national AI  strategy presents a range of policies to foster the quality and capacity of the telecommunication and  ICT infrastructure  in Norway . In April 2021 t he government put forward a report  to the Storting on mobile,  broadband and internet services  (in Norwegian only),  focusing especially on the need for secure and robust  electronic communication services :   Expanding the high -speed broadband network and supporting the rollout of 5G infrastructure;    Setting a new target that 100 per cent of households and businesses should have access to 100  Mbit/s by 2025 . The old target  of 90  per cent being offered high -speed broadband of more than 100  Mbit/s  was reached in 2020;    Participating in pan -European initiatives for the development of high -performance computing such as  the EuroHPC  initiati ve;   Establishing data centres with cutting -edge telecommunication infrastructure to facilitate the access  to computing power and cloud services.   The increasing use of data and computing power in the digital society requires appropriate policy mechanisms  towards security. The national AI strategy of Norway foresees the following policies to maximise the  efficiency of cyber security :   Developing Norway's capacity to detect and respond to cyber -attacks using AI, in line with the  recommendations made in the National strategy for cyber security  and the National strategy for  cyber security competence  (in Norwegian only);    Expanding the role of the Norwegian National Security Authority ( NSM) to the provision of guidance  to enhance security in AI -based sys tems.   5.21.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The Norwegian National AI s trategy  explicitly envisages investments in AI within areas Norway has distinctive  advantages like health, seas and oceans, public administration, oil and gas, energy and mobility. The  Norw egian Government wants to facilitate the development of data centres in Norway. Norway offers  scalable access to  renewable energy  for such enterprises. S everal initiatives are ongoing or planned and use  AI to promote a more sustainable environment:  
  107  Supporting the creation of educational programmes both for digital skills  and for  employees who  must adapt their skills as a result of digitalisation and the transition to a green society;    Encouraging investments in autonomous ships: the Norwegian shipping industry is moving towards  autonomous shipping . These ships will be fully autono mous as they will be remotely controlled  using AI -related technologies and will emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions, improve local air  quality and produce less noise. The state -owned institution ENOVA  has f or instance provided around  EUR 11 million to establish an autonomous transport chain across the Oslo fjord.   Efforts to lift Norwegian companies into the future and to support AI -based technologies promoting  sustainable development, include the creation of  the Cluster for Applied AI . It is a specialised industrial cluster  initiated by Smart Innovation Norway  and .the Norwegian Institute for Energy Technology ( IFE) among other  research partners. Kjell Reidar Mydske, Head of the Cluster for Applied AI, highlights several successful usecases from the industry  that develop sustainable AI solutions:    The company Völur  is us ing AI to obtain smarter and greener food value chains in the food  production industry. AI helps to increase the efficiency of meat production, which can reduce the  climate footprint from agriculture;    The company eSmart Systems , is transforming the landscape of energy provision through the  development of AI -powered electricity grids. AI is used to detect and geo -locate defections to the grid  which significantly improves the maintenance of the distri bution infrastructure and energy  consumption;    The company Spacemaker  develops an AI -based solution that generates building sites with a more  sustainable urban planning , and companies such as Loopfront  and Material Mapper  use AI to  facilitate re -use of building materials from demolishing sites , thus facilitating the circ ular  economy; Companies Scantrol Deep Vision  and CreateView  are both active in the fish ind ustry. The  former developed an AI -powered tool for a more efficient and sustainable fish catch, while the latter  uses AI -driven image sensors to reduce both production costs and the ecological footprint in  aquaculture.   Also within the scientific research community , Norway is increasingly using AI in the fields of energy and  climate. Researchers from the national Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research -Oslo  (CICERO ) has for instance started to employ machine learning to deepen climate and environmental issues.  Finally, SINTEF , established a whole cluster of AI projects  among which SEAVENTION  is about the  management of operations underwater and resource management by means of autonomous functions.   COVID -19 pandemic   Within the scientif ic research community, the Norwegian Centre for E -health Research ( NSE) has the goal to  accelerate the development and implementation of policy on eHealth, especially employing technologies of AI  to enable the reuse of data for the creation of an intelligent healthcare system that learns from its own data  and can shape healthcare into a continuously improving system.   From the business perspective, NEC OncoImmunity ( NOI) has for instance adapted their cancer -fighting AI  technology to combat COVID -19. This company has received advice and support from the community of the  Oslo Cancer Cluster  Incubator, whic h is supported by the Norwegian G overnment.   Finally, COVID -19 has been highlighted as a catalyst for digitalisation in a report  released in May 2021 by the  Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation (Norway, 2021). The report showcase s initiatives  that can contribute to or inspire digital business development in all parts of the country.   5.21.7  Monitoring and future update   The Norwegian strategy is intended to unlock to full potential of AI for citizens, business communities and  public administration. Its implementation and progress will be regularly monitored and adjusted where needed  with additional policies in the field of AI. The strategy does not mention the frequency on which updated  strategy reports will be released.    
  108 5.22 Poland   In December 2020, the Council of Ministers adopted the Polish national AI strategy, entitled  Policy for the  development of artificial i ntelligence in Poland from 2020  (Poland, 2020 ). The progress and milestones in  developing the national AI strategy were highlighted in  a roadmap  released b y the Ministry of Digital Affairs .   It is focused on actions on society, education, science, business, public affairs and international relations  under the strategic mission of protecting human dignit y of people and supporting condition of fair competition  in global rivalry. Poland implements the Trustworthy AI ethical framework and launches mechanism of  flourishing polish ecosystem of AI in ethical, legal, technical -operational and international dimen sions.   In particular, the Polish strategy is providing strategic guidance and policy initiatives to develop a holistic AI  ecosystem with the aim of meeting the following objectives:    Reforming the educational system and providing lifelong learning opportuni ties in AI -related fields;    Encouraging growth and innovation of AI companies through dedicated support in AI research ,  including the provision of sufficient financial resources ;   Increasing national and international partnerships in AI;    Creating a data ecosystem with trustworthy and high -quality data and increased data exchange  mechanisms;    Reinforcing the digital infrastructure, regulatory framework and test environments to foster the  develo pment of AI innovations.   In terms of funding, the Polish strateg y presents the main public programmes supporting the development of  innovation and innovative enterprises, which also enable financing projects related to the development and  implementation of AI -based solutions.   Poland established a governance centre for the national AI strategy,  located at the Chancellery of  the Prime  Minister  and under the chair of  the Minister of Digital Affairs  and the  Council of Ministers Committee for  Digital Affairs . The centre includes the  Task Force on AI Policy enforcement , the Scientific  Council for AI, the AI  Observatory for  the Labour Market, the Observatory of international AI Policy, as well as the Legal Task Force  for changing regulations.    5.22.1  Human capital   Educating the population to gain awareness of the benefits of AI and t o acquire the necessary competenc ies  and skills to develop AI applications is an essential element to prepare for the transformations and challenges  that AI will bring alon g. To this purpose, the Polish G overnment is setting up a range of policy initiative s to  reform the educational system. To foster AI and digital competenc ies of students in preschool, primary and  secondary education , the Polish G overnment proposes to increase courses in IT, to create traineeship  programmes  in AI in various disciplines, to develop programming and coding courses (such as R and P ython)  and to train students in data processing. Winter and summer schools in the field of AI are also considered for  younger students to prepare them with basic knowl edge in AI. The revision of children’s’ and students’  curricula should not only focus on acquiring technical skills but should equally target soft  skills  such as critical thinking, empathy and interpersonal skills.    In terms of higher education , the Polish  strategy foresees the development of Master programmes  in AI  with modular courses to prepare students to particular key sectors such as healthcare and logistics. An  Academy of Digital Applications will be set up to develop courses in AI, machine learning and cybersecurity at  university level and will target around 1000 students. This initiative will be complemented with the ‘Algorithm  and Programming’ championships that challenges above -average students of higher education to solve  complex algorithmic and programming problems. Finally , the Polish Academy of Sciences has established a  Doctoral School on Information Technology and Biomedicine  providing PhD scholarships in AI related fields. To  facilitate the transition of PhDs to the labour market, the Ministry of Science and Higher Education is  providing grants to doctoral students to be employed by an entrepreneur while he/she is still conducting its  basic research at the university.   Besides policy initi atives to support form al education in AI, the Polish G overnment is aiming to raise the  awareness of AI to the citizens in general and to foster a culture of lifelong learning  for the workforce in  particular. Raising the public awareness  will be encouraged among others through the development of  Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) and the creation of an online platform providing an overview of the  
  109 educational offerings in AI. Entrepreneurs will be informed about the available competence programmes  for  lifelo ng learning trainings in AI. Finally, the upgrade of AI competenc ies will also be encouraged in the public  administration.   5.22.2  From the lab to the market   To foster basic and appl ied research in AI, the Polish G overnment will set up a Virtual  Research Institut e  for Artificial Intelligence  (VIR) , in collaboration with businesses, academia and non -governmental  organisations. The VIR for AI will support the Council of Ministers Committee for Digital Affairs in coordinating  research challenges of the Polish AI Stra tegy. T he NASK Public Research Institute  will take up this role as a  Centre for  CyberSecAI . This institute  is primarily focused on monitoring, tes ting and responding to threats on  AI systems and on  standardising and certifying cyber security procedures for AI systems. Furthermore,  research and innovation in AI will be encouraged through  a wide range of funding mechanisms , supported  by funding programmes  of the Polish Development Fund ( PFR), the Digital Poland Project Centre ( POPC ), the  National Centre for Research and Development ( NCBR) and the Polish National Science Centre ( NCN). It  includes funding instruments such as public procurement (with the objective to earmark at least 10% of  budgets of governmental entities to AI) and other dedicated funding in the field of AI.  In addition, the C ouncil  of Ministers Committee for Digital Affairs will set up guaranteed credit and loan programmes  to foster AI  developments in Polish industries.  These instruments could be complemented with  European funding schemes  (e.g. Horizon2020 , Horizon Europe  and Digital Europe),  venture capital  and crowdfunding initiatives. The Polish  strategy identifies the following priority sectors  with the highest potential to benefit from AI applications:  industry, healthcare, trans port and logistics, agriculture, energy, public administration, trade and marketing,  construction and cybersecurity.   With respect to the public sector, the Polish strategy highlights the need to further develop support  programmes  such as GovTech Pol ska to increase the implementation of AI in the public administration.   5.22.3  Networking   To foster the competitiveness of the Polish industry and to strengthen the research competenc ies of the  scientific community, the Polish strategy proposes various policy init iatives to encourage a culture of  collaborations in AI developments . The Future Indust ry Platform , the Virtual Research Institute  and the  GovTech programme  have recently been created to respond to the traditional lack of cooperation. The  objective of these programmes  is to create synergies across the research and industry community and to  serve as a platform for sharing expertise and partnership opportunities. The development of a collaborative AI  ecosystem will be further encouraged throug h Digital Innovation Hubs  which aims at fostering the dialogue  between the public administration, the in dustry and scientific community . Lastly , AI Challenges Platforms  similar to kaglle.com will be set up to foster collaborative research and developments of AI applications.   In addition, an Innovation Map  has been established to monitor the scale and deployment of newly applied  technologies in local government, scientific research centres and public administration. The data registry  contains innovations based on new technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and AI. The map is a  collection of good practices that can be a source of inspiration for other economic players and potentially l ead  to research collaborations.   In addition, Poland takes part in the Global Partnership on AI ( GPAI), an international initiative to spur a  responsible development and use of AI in full respect of human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and  economic growth. The GPAI collaborates with international partners and organisations to bring together  experts from industry, civil society, governments and the academic world. This initiative is stirred by a  secretariat, hosted b y the OECD in Paris, and it accounts for two Centres of Expertise in Montreal and in Paris.   5.22.4  Regulation   In order to create a trustworthy and sustainable environment for the development of AI , the Polish  Government will set up a range of observatories and chairs to tackle ethical and legal issues. An AI  Observatory for the Labour Market will be established to analyse the impact of AI on the labour market and  to propose legislative and regulatory reforms  for social policies.  An Observatory of international AI policy and  Digital Transformation will be formed to monitor European and international policies and regulations. Its task  will be to coordinate and formulate recommendations for international initiatives . 
  110 As part of the Virtual Research Institute for AI, a Department of Ethics and Law will be set up to analyse the  challenges related to law and ethics in AI and to come up with recommendation for legislative reforms and  ethical guidelines. The Council of Mi nisters Committee for Digital Affairs will be entitled to set up a legal task  force to analyse and formulate legal initiatives.   The Polish G overnment will support mutual recognition of interoperability standards and certification or  compliance procedures o f trustworthy AI. The priority of this policy wil l be securing trade secrets.   5.22.5  Infrastructure   Recognising that data is  an essential enabler  for the developme nt of AI solutions, the Polish G overnment is  setting up data policies  to ensure the availability of high -quality data and to improve interoperability and  data sharing. To this purpose , the strategy foresees to further extent the open data platform  containing open  data collections of the public administration. In the same vein, virtual data warehouses will be created in  which companies can share their industrial  data in trustworthy and cyber secured data spaces . These  warehouses will act as API interfaces with transparent interoperability rules and clear data protection  regulations to foster cooperations across companies  in decentralised networks of like -minded members . The  government will also investigate the use of data trusts. Overall, the governments’ objective will be to  incentivise pu blic institutions and businesses towards data collection and data sharing. To do so, the Ministry  of Digital Affairs  will create an inventory of available data sources, which could be classified by sector (e.g.  medical, energy, industrial, agricultural or transport). To facili tate data analyses, the Polish G overnment  intends to invest in cutting -edge digital and telecommunication infrastructure , such as high computer  performance centres  and increased connectivity through 5G networks .  5.22.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   As a part of the National Recover y Fund, Poland plans to invest in  AI initiatives, which support the aims of the  European Green Deal. It focuses on the convergence of  energy  sources,  shifting factories to circular  product ion, making green and smart building s and infrastructure, reducing  emission s of transportation, and  launc hing the Space, Earth and Seas O bservatories for climate change. The aim is also to  make development  more sustainable  in cooperation with local governm ents.  COVID -19 pandemic   Global trends and threats, such as the COVID -19 pandemic, are significantly accelerating the digitalis ation of  many areas of society. In this respect, it is crucial to take advantage of all the opportunities and benefits  associated with the development of AI, and at the same foster the creation of regulations and laws on the  operation of robots and self -learning devices for a better health environment.   Poland participates in the development of AI -based solutions to fight the COVID -19. The polish website for  govTech initiative, the GovTech Polska , presents the output attained by Polish teams in the context of the  #EUvsVirus  hackatho n. Specifically, the results relate to:    Analysing SARS -CoV-2 mutations in order to frame stochastic models and employing machine  learning to predict the future genome modifications. This project ( COVID -19 Genomics ) can increase  the chance of successful vaccines;    Identifying fake news with a community -driven platform, Dubio , which  employs machine learning  algorithms to detect identifying suspicious content. Poland in this case collaborated in a team from  Belgium and Germany, and from other non -EU countries (USA, C anada, UK, Israel, Venezuela);    The Po lish Press Agency (PAP) and Gov Tech Polska have decided to offer an open source code to  fight disinformation. This tool, FakeHunter , which is AI -based and can verify fake information almost  immediately.   5.22.7  Monitoring and future update   The Polish strategy will be monitored and evaluated on a yearly  basis.     
  111 5.23 Portugal    In June 2019, the Portuguese G overnment presented the national strategy AI Portugal 2030  (Portugal, 2019)  to set out challenges and opportunities of the growing AI ecosystem in Portugal. This strategy presents the  plan to foster the use o f AI in the public and private sector during the coming years. The plan concentrates its  actions on inclusion, education, qualification, specialisation and research as people are the main engine of a  successful AI deployment.   The national AI strategy of Po rtugal does not disclose financial figures, or estimations, for its implementation.   5.23.1  Human capital   One of the main strategic objectives is human development , particularly the enablement and reinforcement  of the population vis -à-vis challenges and priorities  set by the AI technologies. This objective will go along of  its main axes: increasing the overall level of AI education, upgrading the labour force qualifications, and  fostering the specialisation in AI fields.   The strategy emphases the importance of digi tal and AI education for the future generations. In this respect, a  well-developed education infrastructure will include training in AI for earlier  educational levels as much as for  higher ones like bachelors, masters, post -graduates and PhDs. Finally, the  strategy aims to encourage  students' specialisation in computer, data science and STEM subjects to create a highly qualified labour force  in AI related areas.   The following actions aim to  nurture talent and skills in AI :   Teaching young students fundamentals of machine learning through the Ciência Viva Clubs ;   In 2019, as part the program me Ciência Viva no Laboratório - Criar Futuro , 270 high school students  have participated in a two -weeks summer school aimed at gaining literacy  on AI applications and  societal impacts, data science and machine learning;    In 2019, as part of the 6ª Conferência Professores Espaciais , the European Space Education Resource  Office  (ESERO Portugal) along with Ciência Viva promoted a lecture on Data Science and AI and a  workshop on AI applications for space education. A hundred teachers participated in the lecture an d  sixty teachers participat ed in the workshop;    In 2020, the Director -General for Education and  the SeguraNet  Awareness  Centre have launched a  MOOC  on AI in education. The first sessio n counted about 2000 participants. The seco nd session is  ongoing ;    In the last  two years, public higher education institutions have launched about twenty graduate and  postgraduate de grees on data science and  AI. Specific courses have also been introduced in ongoing  “classical” postgraduate degrees;    In 2020, higher education institutions  have launched several executive programmes, advanced  courses, summer or wint er schools on AI -related (e.g. big data, m achine learning, business analytics,  computer v ision).   The strategy targets the most skilled individuals as the labour force to enrol in AI and data science  qualification programmes. Increasing the stock of active employees with digital and AI skills is crucial to meet  the new labour demand in AI. The strateg y supports actions to increase digital and science competenc ies in  the public sector.   The following actions aim to re-skill and up -skill citizens and to offer lifelong learning  opportunities:    Creating Regional/local Networks for Digital Qualification to re -skill and up -skill professional training ,  e.g.: the Portuguese polytechnic institutes (located in different Portuguese regions) are offering short  courses under the Upskill P rogramme . This program me involves different s takeholders (e.g.  companies, higher education, public administration institutions) and aims at upskilling qualified  people  who are unemployed to meet the ICT -oriented labour market demands . The first edition  covered training areas relevant to AI, such  as Systems Applications and Products (SAP) – Analytics  (e.g. competences on data processing for Business Intelligence and Data Analytics), and Customer  Relationship Management (e.g. competences on supervised and unsupervised learning and automatic  processing) ;   Setting up e-learn platforms with courses on AI and other specific application domains : in 2019 the  NAU – a massive open online course platform - developed by the National Foundation for Scientific  
  112 Computation – was launched for the Portuguese -speaking communities. Higher education institution s,  and research centres can disseminate their courses through thi s platform ;   In 2019, the National Institute of Administration  (INA) has defined digital skills as one of its three  new strategic areas . The Training  Program me for Digital Transition in Public Administration  – one of  the four programs under the digital skills strategic area – aims to empower works with skills in the  emergent digital technologies essential to public service (i.e. AI, big data and inno vation in digital  environment);    Supporting HPC Competence Centers  - national centers that offer education and training  opportunities on HPC and r elated advanced computing tools.   5.23.2  From the lab to the market   Supporting AI products and services from the lab to the market will stimulate knowledge -intensive research  and the entrepreneurial ecosystem on AI. Policy actions aim to create  a community of young, vibrant,  knowledge -intensive companies that can develop A I cutting -edge technologies. To this purpose, the following  policy initiatives establish a strong research and entrepreneurial ecosystem in AI :   Supporting a pplication -oriented and fundamental research, e.g.: in 2020, an International Research  Progra mme  together with an Observatory were launched in Montesinho. Earth observation is one of  the five strategic areas of the Observatory, which includes the use of satellite information integrated   in advanced processing systems and AI;   Developing a Centre of excellence for AI R&D;    Promoting new and innovative solutions to simply the public administration ( SIMPLEX  programme) .  Since 2018, public funding has  also been specifically allocated to AI research and innovation aiming  at publi c services and processes optimis ation (i.e  through project s such as  DSAIPA  and SAMA );   In 2020, under a call on advanced computi ng, launched by the Portuguese Foundation for Science  and Technology (national funding agency), eighteen AI -related projects out of 129 approved projects  had access to RNCA  supercomputers and Cloud in frastructure;    Launching Innovation funding programmes;    Creating sandboxes and testing facilities;    Refining the innovation vouchers;    Reinforcing the national funding management and identifying KPI for investment evaluation.   In addition, the Portuguese strategy promotes research and innovation in specific scientific areas. Accordingly,  the following priority sectors will be promoted to "living labs"  for experimentations in AI:    Urban transformation (sustainable cities);    Sustain able energy networks;    Biodiversity (green and blue economy);    Autonomous driving;    Cybersecurity;    Quantum materials;    Adaptive learning curricula for students.   Specialised AI services  will also make use of:    Natural Language Processing (for automatic translati on and other automatable services);    Real time AI (for securing business and financial transactions);    AI for software development;    AI for edge -computing.   Other policy initiatives not explicitly mentioned in the AI strategy report, may contribute to the crea tion of a  vibrant enterprise ecosystem in Portugal, such as incentive systems  for technological R&D in companies,  Startup Portugal , Incubation vouchers , Industry 4.0 national s trategy , and t he Action p lan for the digital  transition  among others.   Policy actions towards advanced use and deployment of AI in the public administration include among others,  LabX  – aiming to create a culture of experimentation and innovation in the public sector –, and InnoLabs  to  share good practices across the public administration.    
  113 5.23.3  Networking   There is a widespread consensus that AI will profoundly transform the world with powerful solutions to many  societal and economic challenges. To fully leverage this transformation, a collaborative and networking  approach is essential . The Portuguese strategy favours the establishment of partnerships between public  and private institutions, and it advocates that joint undertakings should include European and international  collaborations. Support actions to networking and collaborations include:    Extending collaborative laboratories ( CoLabs ) and Digital Innovation Hubs ( DIHs). A renewed national  DIH network will shortly be announced;    Increasing partner ships with Member States through collaborations on electronics and systems ( Key  Digital Technologies ), high -performance computing ( EuroHPC ), Smart Networks and Services  (5G and  beyond), and the Quantum Technologies  (H2020);    Fostering long -term collaboration between academia and companies through framework contracts  and data/technology sharing platforms;    Increasing the participation of the Portuguese entities in the European Framework Programme,  Horizon Europe and Digital Europe Programme;    Participating to European Networks  (e.g. Big Data Value  Public -Private Partnership ), European AI  excellence centres and other European DIHs ( e.g. DIH on cybersecurity at Leon or the DIH on IoT in  Salamanca).  Portugal also participates in  the EuroCC  project on high -performance computing , the  National Network on Advanced Computing ( RNCA ) and joint AI -related projects funded under the FCTUTAustin Progra mme  on Advanced Computing .  The strategy also emphasises dissemination campaigns  to promote Portuguese AI  in and out the national  borders. These campaigns are essential tools of digital inclusion as they inform the whole population on the  benefits of AI technologies. International campaigns instead are crucial to attract international AI and ICT  talents to study and work in Portugal. Hence, the following actions will sponsor the national and international  attractiveness of AI:    Promoting the attractiveness of Portugal for foreign talents, students, researchers and experienced  professionals,  while reducing border obstacles;    Supporting n ational stakeholders’ participation in the AI4EU platform , the EU AI on -demand p latform  and ecosystem ;   In Feb ruary 2021,  AI Portugal 2030 launched Forum IA , an online platform to raise awareness on AI  among citizens and relevant stakeholders of the public and private sector . This forum also aims to  foster networking among the participants.   5.23.4  Regulation   Legal, regulatory and ethical frameworks  are essential to develop standards in AI as for transparency,  accountability, liability and ownership. In this respect, the Portuguese strategy proposes the following actions:    Creating an ethical committee to define  guidelines for AI and Automation;    In Dec ember  2020 the Agency for Administrative Modernisation  (AMA) has launched a guide (in beta  version) for ethical, transparent  and responsible  AI;   Supporting the development of a legal and regulatory framework to identify liabilities when AI  decision making;    Supporting companies and regulators to find appropriate legal frameworks.   As proposed in the Action plan for the digital t ransition , general principles  have been established  for the  creation and regulat ion of Free Zones for Technology (F ZTs). FZTs are physical spaces to support  the  demonstration and testing of new technologies, through the creation of specific and adapted regu latory  regimes. These  regime s aim to promote a culture  of experimentation in Po rtugal, including for AI-based  solutions and robotics.  The government is finalis ing the legislative process for the creation of FZTs .  5.23.5  Infrastructure   The Portuguese strategy envisages the following actions to support the AI infrastructure:  
  114  Creating the National Data Infrastructure, a centralised repository for administrative data. This action  also provides guidelines about data sharing in the scientific community, likewise the Open Data  Policy  of the Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT);   Establishing supercomputing and quantum computing facilities thanks to the Advanced c omputing  Portugal 2030  (Portugal, 2018) that defines the objectives of high -performance computing in  Portugal;    In 2021 the new Vision  supercomputer was installed at the University of Evora. It is designed to  enhance the application of AI methodologies to the various national strategic domains. With a  maximum performance of 10 petaflops, this supercomputer allows machine learning and de ep  learning techniques to be tested and optimised within the National Network of Advanced Computing;    Infrastructures for piloting and testing will be created  for several technologies, including AI and  robotics ;   The Sines 4.0 , Hyperscaler Data Centre  and EllaLink submarine cable  contribute to foster  interoperability and connectivity between Europe and Latin America.   5.23.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The Portugal Space Agency , together with the Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT), the European  Space Agency and Unbabel Labs, launched the AI Moonshot Challenge  with a EUR 500,000 award for  combining AI and space technologies to tackle the major sustainability issues. Specifically, this competition  calls participants to find solutions for the detection, loca tion and monitoring of maritime waste along the  water column on a planetary scale. Teams will have access to AI resources, Earth Observation Data from  satellites and supercomputing capacities.   The MIT Portu gal Programme  collaborates with several partners to the Mission Control for Earth Challenge   that envisages accelerating positive change for Spaceship E arth’s ocean and land subsystems to address the  urgent needs of a changing planet and climate. This collaboration aims to employ AI tools, science and  technology for the ‘betterment of humanity’.   COVID -19 pandemic   The Portuguese National Funding Agency for  Science, Research and Technology ( FTC), within the general  context of its supports to R&D activities in the field of Data Science and AI in Public Administration, has  launched  a new competition  aimed at data processing within the current pandemic of the COVID -19. The  objective is to support R&D projects with an emphasis on supporting citizens and health care services.  Twelve  projects were approved, of which six with access to RNCA  resources.   Connect Robotics  from Portugal operates with the support of the European Space Agency, and during the  COVID -19 offered a service of urgent delivery by means of drones. Connect Robotics could deliver within  minutes goods that would take much longer to reach quarantined or locked -down populations. The solution  consists of autonomous drones and a web platform for operation, using Galileo satellite constellation in  addition to GPS, Connect Robotics attains a higher precision in locating individuals.   5.23.7  Monitoring and future update   The Portuguese AI strategy will undergo annual reviews and updates by the Ministry of Science, Technology  and Higher Education and the Ministry of Economy and Digital Transition . 
  115 5.24 Romania   Romania has initiated various  efforts for the development and implement ation of  a national policy framework   on AI . In 2020, Romania  endorsed  an EU-funded project for the creation of  this framework  for the  period   2021 -2027. The forthcoming AI framework will target  the development of education and skills in AI, the  increase of  AI R&D and innovation in the public and private sector , the establishment of networks and  collaborative platforms in AI , the adoption of ethical guidelines and measures to govern data protection and  ensure cybersecurity. The development of the framework involves  governmental institutions , academia and  the private sector, and is supported by consultancy services . The implementation of the AI policy framework  will start in the period 2021 -2022 .  5.24.1  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   By Ju ne 2021, da te of publication of this report , Romania lacks policy initiatives for this section .65  COVID -19 pandemic   Romania collaborates with Germany, France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, India, USA, Colombia, Latvia, United  Kingdom, New Zealand, Turkey, Greece, to the project Dattum.ai , a global collaborative ecosystem  to facilitate  the sourcing of trusted COVID -19 data. Dattum aims to employ high granularity data to provide analytics for  treatment schemes, medical experiments, and vaccine evolution. This project was awarded within the Health  and Life Challenge of the #EUvsVirus  hackathon organis ed by the European Commission.   In addition, the Rumanian Government set up a National Emergencies Platform  to inform citiz ens about all  sorts of issues (from updates on the alert status to domestic violence and more) coming out during the  COVID -19 pandemic. A specific platform  to fight fake news and divulgate correct informa tion was also  established by the Government to correctly update citizens during the pandemic.                                                 65  The AI Watch  portal will be updated to include AI policies  for this section  as they come available.   
  116 5.25 Slovakia   Slovakia includes AI policies into a broader digitalisation strateg y. In July 2019, the Slovakian G overnment  published the Action plan for the digital transformation of Slovakia for 2019 –2022  (Slovakia, 2019a). This  action plan contains concrete steps to build a sustainable, human -centric, and trustworthy AI ecosystem  within the long -term Strategy of the dig ital t ransformation of Slovakia 2030  (Slovakia, 2019b). While the  strategy provides the broader picture, the action plan details concrete policy measures over the period 2019 2022.   The Slovakian Action Plan sets out the following list of short -term policy  initiatives:    Supporting the digital transformation of schools and education to promote skills for the digital era;    Strengthening the digital basis of the data economy;    Improving the capacity of public administrations to use data for the benefit of citizen s;   Supporting the AI ecosystem.   With regards  to funding, the Analysis for budgetary implications for public administration  (i.e. Analýza vplyvov  na rozpočet verejnej správy) accompanies the Acti on plan with general information on government budget for  the coming years. Precise estimates of AI budgets will come at a later stage .  5.25.1  Human capital   The Slovakian strategy aims to stimulate an AI education in line with current and forthcoming needs of bot h  public and private sectors. It proposes  formal education and training reforms  along the following  initiatives:    Reforming the education system to train employees for new professional requirements and  satisfying the future labour demand. The plan is to explore and analyse emerging needs in order to  make informed changes in educational paradigms and systems (e.g. teaching of algorithmic thinking,  creativity and problem solving, teaching support, transformations at all levels of education);    The Ministry of  Education envisages a programme to digitalise the education until 2030  by  means of updated ICT infrastructure for the education system and qualitative improvements to its  programmes. On the latter point, AI subjects will enter educational programmes to st ir digital  competenc ies and skills;    The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Investments, Regional Development and  Informatisation of the Slovak Republic (MIRRI ) are setting up an expert group to coordinate  educational activities on AI . This expert gr oup will examine international and Slovakian  educational programmes in order to frame suitable reforms. Consultations with relevant stakeholders  as school, public authorities and business sector will al so feed the educational reforms;    The MIRRI is launchin g in-house, off -the-shelf, and customised introductory courses on AI for the  employees of the public sector. At present, these courses entail proof of concepts and they have  various aims like – among others  – building a national vocabulary of existing and emerging AI terms,  and helping public employees to familiarise  with the main AI concepts and regulatory trends.    Besides the strong emphasis on reforming the formal education systems, the Slovakian strategy also focuses  on creating lifelong learning opport unities and vocational training  in AI with the following actions:    The Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Labour are planning a policy initiative to support  lifelong learning opportunities for employees . These ministries will collaborate with univers ities  to scrutinise the new requirements (e.g., new technological and digital knowledge associated to AI) of  the labour market and formulate specific trainings for both employed workforce and job seekers;    The MIRRI  will collaborate with relevant ministries to analyse the digital skills inside Slovakian SMEs  and formulate standards to increase the digital literacy of SMEs’ employees.   5.25.2  From the lab to the market   The Slovakian strategy proposes the following policies to  increase the research potential in AI  of both  public and private sectors:    The MIRRI  and other relevant ministries support the creation of a  number of  national platform s  for AI research and usage , e.g. the Kinit.sk  and the Slovak.AI  platform, which will strengthen AI  
  117 research and education further to attract international talents, increase networking opportunities and  develop AI ethical principles;    The MIRRI  and relevant ministries will prepare and disseminate calls for grant on basic and  applied research in AI . Direct financial support of this kind aims to increase the Slovakian’s  research capacity in AI;    The MIRRI  will collaborate with the Ministry of Educa tion and the Ministry of Economy to increase  private sector research in AI  by creating investment opportunities for AI companies and  encourage the AI start -up ecosystem;    The National Security Authority and the MIRRI  are establishing a national competence a nd  coordination centre for cyber security  to develop new technologies like encryption and to  evaluate the use of AI in automating security procedures.   Since turning high -potential ideas into successful products and services is as important as AI research, the  Slovakian strategy envisages the following policies to increase the innovation potential in AI :   The Ministry of Transport is establishing a range of policies to support smart mobility  (e.g. self driving cars and sophisticated transport services) allowi ng collaborations between public and private  sectors to innovate in this particular field. An action plan will better define tasks, responsibilities and  priorities of participating stakeholders. The Ministry is also:   o Assessing the need to review regulations for smart mobility;   o Setting up a Smart Mobility Lab to increase basic and applied research opportunities;   o Facilitating proofs of concepts in smart mobility and creating test environments for self driving cars.    The MIRRI  and the Ministry of Econ omy are developing a manual to deploy AI with guidelines and  hands -on support to companies that start using AI, this will improve the long -term innovativeness of  Slovakian companies in AI;    Finally, the Slovakian G overnment supports the following policies t o foster innovations in the public  sector:   o Establishing a platform, like the US public platform challenge.gov , where public  administration could launch calls for innovative digital and AI solutions to fix issues they  may be facing;   o Creating an open API platform to increase the variety of services for citizens, and to open  data to a wider public enhancing the innovation potential of AI matters.   5.25.3  Networking   Many of the previous policies indirectly increase networking  opportunities  and part nership, however the  Slovakian G overnment supports hubs and platforms also with the following direct actions:    The MIRRI  collaborates with the Slovakian Ministry of Economy and the IT Association of Slovakia, on  a feasibility study to  create the European Digital Innovation Hub  in Slovakia;    The creation of a civil organisation s, such as  Kinit.sk  and Slovak.AI , to build an AI ecosystem by  enhancing collaborations and networking.   The Slovakian strategy also has a dedicated policy to increase the international visibility  of AI education  by making it more accessible to foreign students:    The Ministry of Education is launching an education initiative on A I to teach AI courses in English  and with “blended learning” methods that would attract talented foreign students.   The MIRRI  launched a web portal  to collect AI project proposals from public sector institutions, so to measure  the dissemination and uptake of AI in Slovakia. Soon the portal will also include analyses and summary  details of the submitted projects. In addition, there will be a survey to measure AI uptake by companies and  companies’ attitude towards AI.   Finally, the Slovakian strategy will use AI to  prevent dissemination of fake news and disinformation:    The Security Council will establish a working group on disinformation and fake news  which is  going to use AI technologies against disinformation and fake news.     
  118 5.25.4  Regulation   Building trustworthy AI sys tems requires proper ethical guidelines  aiming to define concepts of integrity,  explainability, and reproducibility in AI. To this purpose, the Slovakian G overnment proposes to work on:    Principles for a transparent and ethical use of AI : the objective of t his policy launched by the  MIRRI  and the Ministry of Economy aims to define guidelines for a trustworthy use and responsible  deployment of AI. Among others, the policy initiatives related to ethical guidelines will include:   o The launch of a public survey to  obtain the point of view of citizens and companies on  ethical AI. The results of the survey will help policy makers to define ethical guidelines;   o The MIRRI delivers on its commitmen t to ethical and trustworthy AI  by appointing members  of the Standing Committee on Ethics and Regulation of AI (CERAI) . The Commission  was  established as an  independent, professio nal and advisory body of MIRRI;   o The MIRRI collaborates with  international and European platforms, such as the Ad hoc  Committee on Artificial Intelligence  (CAHAI ), to address  gender and algori thmic biases to  enhance societal equality and to work on  an international framework of solutions.   In addition, the action plan emphasises the need for a modernisation of regulations and legis lation. In general,  the Slovak G overnment advocates the creation of a goal-oriented and dynamic regulation  that leaves  more freedom for experimentation. Such a dynamic regulation would enhance the scope for innovative  developments and would be less restrictive in an environment that is ra pidly changing due to constant  evolving technologies. To this purpose, the strategy proposes:    The development of a legal framework for data : the MIRRI  is currently preparing a new Act on  Data to better define regulations on data protection, disclosure principles, data access and open data  regulations;    A revision of the  regulatory environment for AI : an advisory group consisting of experts from  academia,  businesses and governmental institutions will be set up to provide dedicated  recommendations on the need to revise the current legislation, in particular on issues such as data  management, cyber sec urity and intellectual property;    The MIRRI coordinates na tional efforts  across ministries and public bodies in response to the recently   published European proposal for a legal framework on AI.    5.25.5  Infrastructure   One of the main goals of the Slovakian strategy is to become a dynamic data economy since data is the  fuel for a successful development of AI. To this purpose, the Slovakian G overnment will put in place digital  data platforms to let high -quality and trustworthy data accessible for the needs of AI. The strategy includes  the following polic y initiatives for the data economy:    Creating an Institute for trustworthy data  to provide open access to high value databases from  the public administration after controlling validity, constancy and credibility of the data;    The MIRRI  will provide  public ad ministration with analytical tools for data management.  So,  the public administration will receive user -friendly SQL and machine learning tools for data  simulations, visualisations and statistical calculations to facilitate policy making. With this help, e ndusers in the public sector can run data analytics without technical issues on data management;    Setting up a Personal Information Management System  (PIMS), a centralised data repository  with data collected by the public administration  about citizens. The  PIMS will comply with data  protection and data sharing regulations by allowing citizens to give their consent on these issues;    The Ministry of Environment is setting up a platform for sharing harmonised spatial data  in  compliance with the INSPIRE directiv e.  Lastly, the Slovakian strategy envisages actions to boost the digital and telecommunication infrastructure:    Setting up a national high-performance computing  competence centre, and participating to the  European EuroHPC  that pools European resources to develop supercomputers;    Supporting the completion of a gigabit fibre infrastructure  and the 5G for Europe Action Plan .  Both initiatives aim to increase internet connectiv ity and achieve the goals of the EU gigabit society.    
  119 5.25.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The non -profit institute KInIT , founded in 2020, is dedicated to intelligent technology research . It bring s  together and nurture experts in AI and other areas of computer science, with connections to other disciplines ,  such as  information security, web and user data processing (including false information and malicious  behaviour modelling), processing an d comprehension of natural language, data analysis for green energy ,  ethics and human values in intelligent technologies.   The Slovak Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence, Slovak.AI  was created in 2019 to support excellence in  the field of AI by bringing together all relevant stakeholders such as businesses, research communities, and  governmental institutions. In this endeavour, the platform highlights the increasing importance of AI  in solving  major societal challenges such as climate change , safety, health, and food security.    In July 2020,  the President of the Republic of Slovenia was on a visit in Bratislava to strengthen the  relationship between Slovakia and Slovenia. During his visit, a Slovenian -Slovak business forum  was held with  individual business meetings between participants from both countries. Both Slovenia and Slovakia attach  great importance to sustainable deve lopment, with an emphasis on the green agenda and digitalisation and in  particular on the circular economy , smart technologies, e -mobility and AI. Slovak companies will exchange  views with Slovenian companies on breakthrough solutions in these areas.   COVID -19 pandemic   A government page provides digital screening tools  to check symptoms and find relevant information about  COVID. A portal  for education also guides pupils and t heir families throughout the school trainings interrupted  by the pandemic.   5.25.7  Monitoring and future update   The Slovakian G overnment will monitor policy implementations on annual basis. It will update the AI measures  of the national Action Plan in accordance with the 2021 review of the Coordinated Plan on AI.   The Slovakian G overnment recently published a strategy and action plan  to improve Slovakia's position in the  Digital Economy a nd Society Index ( DESI) until 2025 , which covers and extends part of the existing measures  of the national AI  strategy outline d above.        
  120 5.26 Slovenia   In May 2021 , the Sloven ian G overnment adopted its  National progra mme  (NpUI) promoting the development  and use  of AI in the Republic of Slovenia  by 2025  (Slovenia, 2021 ). The programme results from consultations  among relevant ministries, national experts, industrial representatives through the ICT Association of Slovenia  (ZIT) of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Slove nia (CCIS), researchers and practicioners in the field  of AI through the Slovenian Artificial Intelligence Society ( SLAIS ), and stakeholders of t he Strategic Research  and Innovation Partnerships on Smart cities ( SRIP CS&C ), Factories of the future ( SRIP FoF ), and civil society  through the Slovenian Digital Coallition ( SDC) to mention some.   The NpUI entails a programme of strategic objectives and concrete measures to foster Slovenia’s research  and innovation capacity and internationa l competitiveness in the field of AI from 2020 to 2025. The  programme  encompasses holistic strategic actions since AI is a multidisciplinary field, therefore the strategic  targets are:    Creating a supportive ecosystem for research, innovation and AI deployment;    Strengthening technological and industrial capacities in the field of AI;    Implemen ting reference AI solution s in the industry, public sector, public and state administration and  society;    Enhancing international cooperation;    Ensuring an appropri ate ethical and legal framework to increase public trust in AI;    Launching a National AI Observatory;    Establishing a cutting -edge data and computing  infrastructure  for AI .  Slovenia has earmarked EUR 1 10 million  of public funding to implement these strategic  objectives until 2025.   5.26.1  Human capital   The NpUI aims to reinforce human resources in AI along three lines by means of the following actions: 1)  updating formal educational curricula at all levels providing AI related knowledge and skills , 2) supporting  professionals in acquiring AI skills at work, 2) raising general awareness, understanding and knowledge of AI  in the entire population.   The Slovenian G overnment aims to update  the education system , from primary school to secondary level,  to include relevan t digital and computational thinking topics, and promote and integrate AI related topics to  tertiary level curricula . The objective is to provide future generations with the necessary skills and  competenc ies in AI and to anticipate labour market trends. In  this respect, the NpUI emphasises that  education should be equally accessible by all social groups, and it envisages developing platform s for distant  learning methods an d trainings. In particular, the  programme  places utmost importance on the following  policy initiatives:    Systematically reviewing and modernising the primary and secondary education programmes, by  including new digital technology related courses and by expanding existing courses on computer and  information technology;    Introducing and showcasing AI use across many disciplines (e.g. history, biology, art) in primary and  secondary schools to show usefulness and benefits of AI;    Systematically reviewing the curricula  of tertiary education to integrate relevant AI courses and  programmes;    Introducing inter -disciplinary programmes within tertiary education to integrate AI in key disciplines  like data science, humanities and law.   Life-long learning and upskilling opportunities  are foreseen  to keep pace with the evolving needs of the  labour m arket. The following policies will help both public and private sector to embrace a professional  upgrade towards AI:    Supporting general training and re -skilling programmes for employees to acquire new skills and  professional qualifications in AI;    Supporting training for decision makers in private and public sector about opportunities and threats  of AI;    Launching AI training  programmes for professional s using AI models, methods and algorithms in the  development and implementation of products and ser vices in priority areas ;  
  121  Introducing educational programmes for companies and public administration on the advantages and  disadvantages of AI, and on the need of a legal and ethical framework that facilitates AI  development and use;    Developing a web platform with online courses to acquire advanced professional digital skills,  especially in the fields of AI and data sciences.   5.26.2  From the lab to the market   The Slovenian G overnment promotes research excellence and increases the scientific and innovation   capacity in the field of AI  in both the public and private sector. The following policy measures target all  industry areas with demonstrated potential for AI developments, and they aim to support innovative ideas  across all technological readiness levels (TRL ):   Public co -financing to support AI centre of excellence  and basic AI research (TRL 1);    Support to collaborative projects (TRL 2 -4) in the intersection of AI technologies and related  technologies (e.g. big data, HPC, IT security, language technologies, IoT, blockchain , quantum  computing );   Support to inter -disciplinary innovation projects at final stage of development (TRL 5 -8) in various   areas (e.g. public administration, culture, environment, energy, agriculture, smart cities, transport,  smart manufactu ring);   Support to reference implementation projects in selected priority areas (h ealth and medicine, Industry  4.0 and robotics, culture & language technologies, public administration, sustainable food production  and environment and spatial planning).   The NpUI also supports the Slovenian stakeholders that participate in the EU framework programmes for   research,  innovation  and deployment  such as Horizon Europe  and Digital Europe . Furthermore, specific support  addresses Slovenian firms and institutions that develop standards in the field of AI. Besides targeting  research and innovation on AI standards, the Slovenian G overn ment also promotes collaborations with  national, EU and international standardisation organisations.   According to the Slovenian G overnment the key priority areas  (i.e. with the highest potential  for successful  reference implementations of AI technologies ) for the development of AI solutions are: Health and Medicine,  Industry 4.0 and robotics, culture & l anguage technologies, public administration, sustainable food production  and environment , and spatial planning.   Finally, the Slovenian NpUI highlights the i mportance of proper technical data and computational  infrastructure (e.g. HPC, Edge AI) and testing and experimental facilities  to facilitate the development of  AI tools and algorithms.  The c urrent Open data platform for data sharing ( OPSI) remains the central hub for  further development of data sharing infrastructure and practices. The first EuroHPC world -class  supercomputer Vega  remains the main computational infrastructure for further adaptation to AI use. On the  other hand, Edge -AI infrastructure has been developed for the Factory of the Future (FoF) digital twin  demonstration centre at the Fa culty of Mechanical Engineering  (University of Ljubljana ) within  the FoF  Strategic Research and Innovation Partnership.   5.26.3  Networking   The NpUI presents a wide range of policy initiatives to foster networks and collaborations  across the  business community,  public sector,  academia and public research centres. Networking will encourage  multidisciplinary cutting -edge research and innovation projects, and it will enable synergies and cross fertilisation among all players by promoting knowledge dissemination and transfers. National and  international collaborations will benefit from the following actions:    Establishing a central coordi nation body, like the Slovenian Digital Coalition , to support collaborative  efforts among all relevant national stakeholders in the development of AI;    Creating a supportive environment for a Digi tal Innovation Hub (DIH) on AI;    Strengthening  Strategic Research and Innovation Partnerships (SRIPS) that have AI -related projects  like Smart cities ( SRIP CS&C ) and Factories of the Future ( SRIP FoF ) among others;    Supporting the Slovenian researchers and institutions to engage actively in the European  programmes for AI like CLAIRE , ELLIS , AI4EU , and in the national smart specialisation platforms (S3);    Encouraging active collaborations with international organisations such as the Council of Europe, the  European Commission, the OECD, and UNESCO;  
  122  Supporting the work of the International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence ( IRCAI ) located in  the premises of the Jožef Stefan Institute in Ljubljana. The IRCAI operates under the auspices o f the  United Nations Organisation for Education, Science, and Culture (UNESCO) to develop AI-based tools,  products and services and provides policy support to AI so that UNESCO Member States will attain  the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) sooner.   In addition, Slovenia takes part in the Global Partnership on AI ( GPAI), an international initiative to spur a  responsible development and use of AI in full respect of human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and  economic  growth. The GPAI collaborates with international partners and organisations to bring together  experts from industry, civil society, governments and the academic world. This initiative is stirred by a  secretariat, hosted by the OECD in Paris, and it accoun ts for two Centres of Expertise in Montreal and in Paris.   The Slovenian G overnment also envisages the following policies to raise the trust,  awareness and  knowledge about AI,  to enhance public trust in AI, and its dissemination and uptake in the economy:    Establishing and strengthening the dialogue with media and opinion leaders that can inform and  raise awareness around activities, opportunities and risks of AI;    Organising conferences and workshops to spread knowledge about AI, and establishing an AI  Ambass ador to inform about the national activities on AI;    Launching a communication platform to collect and disseminate good practices and case studies on  the deployment and use of AI in society ;   Support ing NGO networking and coordination for participation in activities of research, development,  deployment and use of AI at national and EU level.   Finally, the Slovenian G overnment envisages a national AI Observatory  to monitor the development and  uptake of AI in Slovenia with a suitable methodology and indicators. This activity could be  coordinated and  implemented in cooperation with the Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia ( SURS ).  5.26.4  Regulation   The successful deployment of AI lies on defining principles for a human -centred, trustworthy, fair, transparent  and sustainable development of this emerging technology. This requires a clear ethical framework  backed  by a strong legal environment . To this p urpose, the Slovenian NpUI proposes the following main measures :    Analysis of the appropriate legal and ethical framework for the development, implementation and  application of AI-based systems, especially in decision -making systems on the rights and oblig ations  of natural and legal persons in terms of the adequacy of different AI models;    Establishing an ethical framework to supervise and certify ethically sound AI solutions;    Creating a national supervisory mechanism to verify the compliance of AI systems with both the EU  legislation and the EU’s ethical guidelines ;   Including  humanities, social sciences, legal and security experts and NGO representatives in activities  related to AI, in the support pillar of the Slovenian Digital Coalition .  The NpUI highligh ts that the design of both ethical and legal frameworks should emerge from the  collaboration of relevant international organisations  (e.g. EU, UNESCO, Council of Europe) to ensure conformity  with supra -national legislation and regulations. In addition, the  NpUI foresees an annual conference to inform  citizens and relevant stakeholders about regulatory frameworks in place.   The NpUI also mentions that a legal and ethical AI would enhance cybersecurity by detecting frauds and cyber  threats, and by enabling aut horities to enforce laws and fight crimes more effectively. On this point, the  Slovenian G overnment envisages  pilot project s to use AI in cybersecurity  and one to enhance the efficiency of  police work .  5.26.5  Infrastructure   An appropriate data and telecommunication infrastructure is crucial to collect, share and analyse big data  that feed into AI algorithms. This infrastructure should provide reliable and high -quality data that a wide  range of users could share in robust and accessible ways.   A well-developed data infrastructure  to deploy AI includes the following policies:  
  123  Creating national data spaces to develop AI in different areas (e.g. production, environment, mobility,  health and medicine, finance, energy, agriculture, public administration, skills), and setting up a  national platform with AI tools and algorithms developed in Slovenia;    Supporting the integration of data spaces at EU level;    Raising awareness on risks and opportunities of sharing data across economy, publi c sector and  research community;    Equipping the national infrastructure portal clarin.si  with linguistic resources and technologies;    Establishing a national IoT platform to deploy AI to the benefit of smart c ities and communities.   With respect to telecommunication infrastructure , the Slovenian G overnment highlights the importance of  high-performance computing, cloud services, and broadband infrastructure to manage large amounts of data.  To this purpose, the NpUI foresees the following policy:    Supporting the pan -European initiative for high -performance computing ( EuroHPC ), and setting up  HPC facilities in Slovenia, to develop AI algorithms and applications. On this p oint, Slovenia is rolling  out the HPC project RIVR VEGA  to establish a national high -performance computing infrastructure.     Access to the national supercomputing infrastructure is based on the principle of open  science – open  research infrastructure and is free of charge for all researchers working in Slovenia. The new infrastructure  enables Slovenian researchers to cooperate on an equal footing at international level and provides them a  competitive advantage.   5.26.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   At the 50th annual meeting  of the World Economic Forum in Davos in January 2020, the Slovenian Prime  Minister remarked the relevance of AI in modernising  the public sector and in addressing the key societal  challenges including climate and health.   In May 2020, the agreement  to establish the International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence ( IRCAI ) in  Ljubljan a was signed by the Slovenian Minister of Education, Science and Sport and the Deputy Prime Minister  with the UNESCO Assistant Director -General for Communication and Information as the representative of the  Director -General. The  activities of the  IRCAI should not only maximis e the benefits of AI to achieve the  sustainable development goals (including the one on climate action), but also  accelerate  a multi stakeholder mechanism to put AI under the verification  of ethical, legal, openness and policy challenge s.  In July 2020 a delegation  of 15 Slovenian companies and institutions in the field of green technologies   and innovations accompanied  the President of the Republic of Slovenia on his official vis it to Bratislava.  During the visit a Slovenian -Slovak business forum was held with individual business meetings between  participants from both countries. Both Slovenia and Slovakia stress  the importance of sustainable  development, with an emphasis  on the green agenda and digitalisation  in the contex t of circular economy,  smart technologies, e -mobility and AI. Slovenian companies could  exchange views with Slovak companies on  breakthrough solutions in these areas.   In July 2020, SPIRIT Slovenia in cooperation with the Embassy of the Republic of Slovenia  in Tokyo and  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, prepared a web conference  for Japanese companies interested in  investing in Central and Eastern European countries. The content of the conference  especially revolved around:    The current economic situation in Slovenia and the consequences caused by the COVID -19 pandemic;    Business opportunities in the field of mobility, smart grids, and fintech;    Slovenian high -tech research institutions (energy stor age, AI, robotics).   COVID -19 pandemic   Within the framework of the GPAI, to which Slovenia is participating, a working group on AI and pandemic  response ( AIPR) has been formed to promote cross -sectoral and cross -border collaboration in this area. In  November 2020, the working group released a report  outlining its mandate and providing recommendations  to foster and support the responsible development and use of AI -enabled solutions to address COVID -19 and  future pandemics.   The IRCAI in Slovenia has also launched an "intelligent" media watch on c oronavirus called Corona Virus Media  Watch  which collects global and national news from a selection of media with open online information. The 
  124 tool, also developed with the support of the OECD and the Event Registry  information extraction technology, is  a useful source of information for policy makers, the media and the public to observe emerging trends related  to COVID -19. As part of the platform Corona Virus Medi a Watch, the University of Ljubljana  developed a social  distancing simulator  which allows an interactive  exploration of social distancing on the spread of contagious  diseases. Other functionalities proposed by the Virus Media Watch are similarity measures between countries  in people mobility patterns  and search engines  on scientific medical literature.   From  April 2020 to October 2020, the  National COVID -19 Prevalence Study  determine d the number of peo ple  infected with COVID -19, the number of  asymptomatic individuals who did not  know they were infected, and  the number of  recovered people . The study used Bayesian approaches, machine learning and AI methods for  data collection and analyses .  Several research projects use AI algorithms to analyse and fight against the COVID -19 virus. Researchers of  the Department of Knowledge Technologies ( KT) at the Jožef Stefan Institute have developed models to  predict dynamics  of the COVID -19 pandemic in Slovenia. Using computational scientific discovery methods  and machi ne learning, the model simulates and predicts the dynamics of the infected population in the future.  Other research projects focus on the influence of weather, humidity and other factor on the speed of the  coronavirus progress, and on the effectiveness of various approaches for curbing the coronavirus infection.  The latter two projects use machine learning, data mining, and advanced statistical methods.  Researchers  from the Department of Intelligent Systems  at the Jožef Stefan Institute  have also participat ed to  the  Pandemic Response Challenge  focusing  on the development of data -driven AI systems to predict COVID -19  infection . The team develop ed accurate predictors of COVID -19 infections using  a combination of a SEIR  epidemiological model and machine learning and modelled  the necessary trade -offs when weighing public  health interventions and economic impact.   Finally, the COVID -19 tracker  is a project relying on crowdsourcing funding to collect, analyse and publish data  on the spread of the COVID -19 virus in Slovenia. Employing this tracker data, researchers of the Jožef Stefan  Institute are predicting  the workload of the epidemiological service with AI -related methods.   5.26.7  Monitoring and future update   The Slovenian G overnment highlight s that the implementation of the  NpUI is dynamic, therefore there will be  periodic updates and reviews ab out the achievement of objectives. Policy actions will likely evolve over the  coming years and new policies could supplement existing ones, in particular to support the EU priority  measures.   
  125 5.27 Spain   The Spanish G overnment released its National AI strategy  in December 2020 (Spain, 2020a) with the  objective to develop a policy framework defining the various actions that the governmental admini strations  will undertake to facilitate the development and deployment of AI in the economy and society. This strategy  adopts a multidisciplinary approach to address economic, social, environmental, public management and  governance challenges, and it includ es perspectives for a wide range of sectors and disciplines. It seeks to  boost the growth of AI in the Spanish economy in the coming years with concrete AI -directed policies at the  national level, while ensuring a smooth alignment with EU policy.   In defin ing the concrete action plans in accordance to the nat ional AI strategy, the Spanish G overnment takes  stock of the priorities and policy recommendations of the RDI strategy in artificial i ntelligence  (Spain, 2019),  the Spanish d igital agenda 2025  (Spain, 2020b) and the Recovery, transformation and resilience p lan (Spain,  2020c). The RDI strategy, published in March 2019, mainly focuses on the creation of a framework for a  compet itive Research, Development and Innovation (R&D&I) ecosystem in AI, and it provides a solid  foundation for the RDI part of the national AI strategy. The Spanish Digital Agenda 2025, presented in July  2020, outlines the strategic approach for digital transf ormations in Spain, focusing on 1) the deployment of  networks and services for digi tal connectivity; 2) the digitis ation of the economy; 3) the improvement of e governance, and 4) training in digital skills. Lastly, the Recovery, Transformation and Resilience Plan, released  in October 2020, emphasises the importance of AI and presents policy initiatives to boost innovations in this  field.  In particular, the national AI strategy highlights the following objectives:    Promoting the development of human c apital in AI through the development of a large base of  skilled employment, the provision of training and education opportunities, the stimulation of Spanish  talent and the attraction of global talent towards Spain;    Developing solid scientific excellence i n the field of AI to promote Spain as a leading country in AI;   Placing Spain as a leader in the development of tools, technologies and applications for the  projection and use of the Spanish language in AI;    Boosting the deployment and use of AI technologies  in both the public and private sector, including  also cross -cutting sector activities and grand challenges;    Guaranteeing an ethical framework that outlines individual and collective rights and builds an  environment of trust in AI;    Ensuring inclusiveness in the AI -driven economy, by reducing gender gaps and digital divides while  supporting ecological transition and territorial cohesion.   In terms of financing, the Spanish G overnment foresees a public investment of EUR 600 million for the  development and the  implementation of the national AI strategy over the period 2021 -2023.   5.27.1  Human capital   As the Spanish strategy emphasises, human capital is an essential cornerstone and driver for the successful  deployment and development of AI in Spain. To this purpose, one  of the main priorities is to provide the  necessary technical skills to both the current and upcoming workforces. Within both the private sector and the  public administration, current workforces benefit from modern work -related trainings and life -long lear ning  initiatives. To guarantee the skills of up coming workforces, the Spanish G overnment foresees a wide range of  education and training policies to stimulate and prepare next generations towards mastering digital skills and  capabilities to understand and develop AI technologies and applications. Overall, the national strategy  presents policy actions about education and digital skills for the entire population throughout their lives. The  foundations of the various policies is the National digital competence p lan, released in January 2021.   In terms of policies targeting the primary and secondary education , the national AI strategy foresees the  following actions:    Introducing the foundations to understand computational thinking, critical and creative thinking;    Strengthening the orientation towards ICT technologies and AI of early education cycles and training  of teachers;    Promoting and adaptin g education in science, technology, engineering, maths and humanities (STEM),  also within the tertiary education.   
  126 In line with these objectives, the Spanish Informatics Scientific Society ( SCIE) and the Spanish Royal Soc iety of  Mathematics ( RSME ) have drawn up a joint report entitled Towards a new education in mathematics a nd  informatics in secondary education . In the same vein, the Ministry of Education has published a study on  Robotics and computation al thinking  in the education system in Spain. As an outcome of this study, the School  on Computation Thinking and Artificial Intelligence  is ongoing  in cooperation with the Au tonomous  Communities.   At higher education levels, such as tertiary education , the following initiatives aim to strengthen the  technological content towards AI:    Expanding postgraduate studies, Master’s and doctoral programmes that offer AI trainings;    Promot ing an inter -multidisciplinary approach in which all educational disciplines.   The Spanish AI strategy also announces an action plan to combat gender discrimination, and to promote  gender equality in both scientific education fields and AI -related jobs. Bes ides the gender gap, social cohesion  is a general target to address also the inequalities due to disability and social exclusion.   These policies include also specific trainings for professionals, particularly lifelong learning, vocational  training and resk illing opportunities . The promotion of continuous training refers to all job occupations  throughout the entire professional life. It aims to keep competenc ies in line with future labour market  demands. In particular, the national AI strategy foresees:    Actions to upgrade professional skills and competenc ies are presented in the Strategic plan for  vocational training of the education s ystem 2019 -2022 . This plan provides actions to modernise t he  offer of vocational training  to match actual and upcoming skill demands, notably in AI;    Novel AI training opportunities for the current workforce in both the private sector and public  administration.   5.27.2  From the l ab to the market   The development of AI goes along with both a solid scientific research in AI and the subsequent efforts to  transform science into marketable products and services. To coordinate the governance of scientific research  activities in Spain, th e Spanish G overnment has developed the Spanish System of Science, Technology and  Innovation ( SECTI ). This system integrates and coordinates general State policies with the policies of  Autonomous Regions on research, development and innovation (R&D&I). In collaboration with various  ministries, it focuses on the creation, the implementation, the monitori ng and the evaluation of R&D&I  policies, including those promoting AI developments.   The following policy initiatives aim to foster scientific research in AI :   Policy recommendations presented in the RDI strategy in artificial i ntelligence : with respect to  scientific research this report highlights the following priorities:   o Fostering the development of AI technologies in key sectors of the Spanish economy ;  o Facilitating AI research across all sectors, with special attention to cross -cutting activities;   o Encouraging the adoption of AI applications in all sectors, while allowing for different speed  rates of proliferation;    Creation of a Spanish network of excellence in AI  to maintain research and training programmes  in cutting -edge knowledge areas on AI;    Strengthening pre -doctoral and post -doctoral research contracts and creating attractive programmes  for senior researchers in AI;    Supporting a flexible scie ntific trajectory of AI research staff to ensure scientific diversity and  permeability across the public and private sectors while favouring knowledge transfers;    Promoting the creation of new national technology development centres in mult idisciplinary fie lds;   Creati ng a program me of AI R&D projects that will focus in National Missions, addressing great social  challenges in Spain.    The creation of a prosperous innovation environment further encourages the development of AI  technologies. To this aim, the Spanish national AI strategy foresees the following policy instruments to  support the digital transformation of businesses and public administration:  
  127  Support programmes  for companies providing AI solutions. These programmes aim to encourage  the uptake of n ew technologies in companies’ production processes, and to foster data intensive use  for the development of emerging technologies;    Programmes to boost innovation on AI  as part of the Recovery, transformation and resilience  plan, in line with the frameworks of the Spanish Entrepreneurship Strategy and the Industrial Policy  Strategy 2030;    Map of  AI capabilities  in Spain: this initiative  highlights the ongoing technological and scientific  activities in AI in technological centres, academic institutions and public research organisations;    Test areas and innovation sandboxes  to facilitate experimentation  in real -life conditions, in  particular the Sandbox Financial Act  targeting technological innovations in the financial sector.   With respect to the  private sector, the national AI strategy calls for the integration of AI in the business  value chain , in particular for SMEs. AI -related technologies and robotics integrate more and more in sectors,  like the fashion industry, tourism and construction, in which Spai n has a comparative advantage. The  Spanish  Government also recommends the adoption of AI in essential industries such as telecommunications, energy,  mobility, health care and financial services. A wide range of programmes and initiatives with financial  support  are in place to foster the adoption and development of AI in the private sector. These initiatives span  from grants, cr edits, venture capital to other risk-taking financial aids that encourage technological  innovation. In particular, the following policy initiatives are ongoing or planned:    Launching a public -private venture capital fund to boost digital entrepreneurship and the creation of  highly innovative technology -based businesses, in the field of AI and digital enabling technologies;    Strengthening existing financial support programmes such as:   o The NEOTEC  programme provides venture capital, seed capital or direct grant support to  technology businesses;   o The fina ncing lines highlighted in the ENISA  programme, directed to (young) entrepreneurs,  and growth support;   o The state -owned bank ICO that promotes the creation of private management risk capital  funds.   Witnessing the potential benefits of AI in the public sector  and citizens as a whole, the national AI strategy  also foresees a wide range of policies to foster the adoptio n and use of AI in the public administration. AI can  help to improve decision -making with reliable and high -quality data, and it can increase the efficiency of  service processes. The following actions will help to achieve these goals:    Embedding AI in publi c administration to improve efficiency towards citizens, industry, and society at  large;    Increasing AI skills in public administration in order to encourage the use of AI applications;    Launching an innovation laboratory to study the uptake and use of AI in  public administration  (GovTech Lab).   The new plan for the digitalisation of the public sector in 2021 -2025  further stimulates the use of AI in the  public administration by presenting policy initiatives to foster digitalisation and automation in the public  sector to finally improve the quality of public policies and service to citizens.   5.27.3  Networking   An efficient knowledge sharing across stakeholders is crucial for the development of AI. Given the advantages  of networks and collaborations in the development and uptake of AI , the Spanish G overnment  highlights the following policy initiatives:    Developing platforms th at foster collaborative research on AI and knowledge transfers, while  promoting and exploiting synergies between universities and businesses by means of cooperation  programmes like the Co-incident Programme ;   Strengthening the Digital Innovation Hubs (DIHs) network;    Supporting the Spanish participation in European RDI programmes.   In addition, Spain takes part in the Global Partnership on AI ( GPAI), an international initiative to spur a  responsible development and use of AI in full respect of human rights, inclusion, diversity, innovation and  economic growth. The GPAI collaborates with international partners and or ganisations to bring together 
  128 experts from industry, civil society, governments and the academic world. This initiative is stirred by a  secretariat, hosted by the OECD in Paris, and it accounts for two Centres of Expertise in Montreal and in Paris.   The Sp anish G overnment is committed to increase the international attractiveness  of the country in the  field of AI. To this aim, the national AI strategy proposes the following initiatives to attract international  talents in AI (i.e. individuals and businesses):    Creating the Spanish Talent Hub , a programme in collaboration with ICEX Spain Trade and  Investment  to attract both academic and professional talents with a specific focus on attracting  foreign investment, social impact investments, and promoting women entrepreneurship;    Launching a programme for the international accreditation/equalisation of educationa l certificates to  facilitate the attraction of international talents.   5.27.4  Regulation   The proliferation of AI across the economy and society needs a well -developed ethical and regulatory  framework that protects individual and collective rights, and that safegua rds inclusion and social welfare.   With regards to the legislative framework , the national AI strategy stipulates that the development of AI  has to comply with the constitutional values and principles of accountability, equality, individual freedom, and  privacy . To achieve this, the Spanish G overnment will work on:    A new legislative framework  for AI applications and technologies to include, among others, laws  that guarantee data integrity and security.    A charter of Digital Rights (released for publication consultation ) to guarantee individual and  collective rights of citizens.   These initiatives take stock of prior wo rk like the 2018 book on Digital Society and Rights  by the Ministry of  Industry, Trade and Tourism and financed by Red.es . This book already presents the challenges of regulating  AI, and it reflects on its advantages and risks concerning rights.   Besides a solid legislative framework, it is also crucial to support AI development  that is also ethically sound  and that conceives AI -systems that are human -centred, trustworthy, fair, transparent and sustainable. In  order to create an ethical framework, the Spanish G overnment envisages the following action lines:    Launch of a monitorin g model for ethics in AI developed by the AI Advisory Board, in collaboration  with the Digital Transformation Advisory Board ;   Developing a trust worthy AI certification (i.e. quality label) for AI practitioners that develop ethically  sound AI;    Creating forums for national and international dialogue to discuss the impact of AI on human rights  and public freedoms;    Strengthening the National Observat ory on Telecommunications and Information Society ( ONTSI )  from the public corporate entity Red.es  to promote digital development in Spain. With regards to  ethics, the Observatory published a policy report on The network society: digital transform ation in  Spain, annual report 2018 . Among others it highlights the importance of the development of AI in the  improvement of the welfare of citizens and the economy, alerting about its risks and ethical  dilemmas.   5.27.5  Infrastructure   Since the collection of data  is an essential driver of digital transformation and of AI -related applications, the  Spanish national strategy incorporates dedicated policies to develop data platforms. While the digital  economy increasingly relies on large volumes of data, it also requi res investments in high -performance  telecom and IT infrastructure. Spanish policies related to data platforms and technological infrastructure are  targeting three key areas: 1) the use and sharing of data across economic players and public administrations,   2) AI innovation through increased cybersecurity and cutting -edge infrastructure, and 3) AI technologies in the  field of natural language processing.   The following policies will ensure the availability of high -quality data  to foster the development of AI based technologies:  
  129  Creating a central data governance body  (Data Office) at the national level and appointing a  Chief Data Officer  who will actively participate in initiatives to create secure data repositories in  the EU and in coordinating AI application s in public administrations;    Creating a decentralised and accessible data repositories  to provide added -value services based on  data infrastructures and innovative AI applications;    The creation of an interdisciplinary Working Group on Open Data  in the publ ic sector. Furthermore,  also the launch of the Data for the Common Good  programme encourages the use and  governance of open data;    Promoting the access to public data , through initiatives as Red.es  that stimulates openness and re use of public administration data, and the open data portal APORTA ;   The creation of new value -added services based on data in line with the European data s trategy  that  promotes data sharing  among businesses, public administrations, governmental institutions and  citizens;    Fostering the  infrastructure for AI in natural language processing , in particular for Spanish. To  this purpose, the Royal Spanish Academy ( RAE) recently joined other main operators of digital  platforms in the project on the Spanish L anguage and AI ( LEIA) to promote and enable the use of the  Spanish language in the digital world and in AI systems. These polic y efforts advance the action lines  of the National plan for advancement in n atural language p rocessing .  To support infrastructure , the national AI strategy foresees policies i n a wide range of areas, such as high performance computing  and cybersecurity:    Supporting the pan -European EuroHPC  initiative with high -performance computing facilities;    Further expanding the National Centre of supercomputing in  Barcelona ( BSC);   Launching an experimental computing laboratory in quantum computing to enhance new  computational modes and explore their potential applications;    Enhancing cybersecurity through a better coordination bet ween involved economic partners and the  Spanish National Cybersecurity Institute ( INCIBE ) in charge of promoting companies’ cybersecurity.   Concerning (cyber -)security, the Ministry of Defence also published a Security and defence d ocument nº 79  about applied AI to defence  to present challenges and opportunities of AI for defence, evaluating suitable  uses of robotics, computer vision and natural language processing.   Additionally, other pla ns, such as the 5G action plan and  the Connectivity Plan, will foster high -speed  connectivity deployment and uptake, which will underpin de development of the AI market.   5.27.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   In line with the efforts outlined in the European Green Deal , the national AI strategy proposes to encourage  the development of a national programme for “efficient and sustainable algorithms (green algorithms)” to  maximise the energy efficiency of AI systems  and foster the use of AI as a part for solving problems related  to the environment.   COVID -19 pandemic   With respect to the COVID -19 outbreak, the national AI strategy highlights the importance of drawing lessons  from the crisis, to take corrective actions in the future and to better prepare healthcare systems for these  types of events. AI is for instance be ing applied to support the diagnosis and treatment of coronavirus  outbreaks, to screen severity of diseases of patients, to disinfect healthcare facilities and to help minimising  social contacts. For the latter, multiple applications for smartphones have b een developed, while predictive  modelling and simulation systems are often used for disease detection and prevention. Concrete action plans  and initiatives develop ed or supported by the Spanish G overnment include:    The launch of a COVID -19 fund : in June 2020 the Spanish Government approved COVID -19 Fund of  EUR 16 billion for regional governments to finance costs stemming from the pandemic, particu larly  for the health system, together with an increase in items for education. A part of the budget will be  allocated to support platforms for teachers, pupils and education authorities through the application  of AI; 
  130  The assessment of lockdown measures: in  April 2020, a new project by the National Scientific  Research Council ( CSIC) employed computer science and data science techniques to assess  the  effectiveness of lockdown measures in halting the spread of COVID -19. The project uses AI tools and  data science, and integrates big data in real time on human mobility, geo -localised surveys and  computational models;    The development of a conversational assistant Hispabot -COVID19  function via WhatsApp. This is an  automatic channel, set up by the government, for  enquiries that uses AI and natural language to  respond to concerns from the public about COVID -19 with official, precise and updated information;    In April 2020, the project DataCOVID  was developed in collaboration with the National Statistics  Institute ( INE). DataCOVID employs bi g data to analyse anonymous data compiled on movements of  the population during the state of alarm to enhance an efficient data -based decision -making in  different regions during the pandemic;    The AsistenciaCOVID -19 - an official self -diagnosis application - was created by the State Secretary   for Digitalisation and Artificial Intelligence  (SEDIA ) to free up the healthcare hotlines in the different  regions and offer official information and convey trust to people;    The development of a personnel assistant application  using AI technology to respond to frequently  asked questions about COVID -19. This natural language processing tool is developed by SEDIA   through the National plan for advancement in n atural language processing .  Spanish hospi tals are also participating in a collaborative project on Imaging COVID -19 AI . The objective of  this project is to enhance computed tomography (CT) in the diagnosis of COVID -19 by using AI. The project  group will create a deep learning model for automated detection and classification of COVID -19 on CT scans,  and for assessing disease severity in patients by quantification of lung involvement.   In March 2020, Carlos III Health Institute launched a funding initiative  to finance projects that improve  knowledge about the COVID -19 virus and how to handle the disease in the short term. Among the envisaged  fields of re search there is the use of AI and integrated big data analysis tools aimed at the epidemiological  control of COVID -19.  In addition, Spanish businesses have participated in the pan -European #EUvsViru s hackathon, which aimed to  collect and promote innovative ideas to fight against the coronavirus. PoCOVIDscreen  is one of the winning  projects headquar tered in Spain, proposing a tool for detecting COVID -19 from ultrasound recordings with AI.  Finally, Spain takes part in the EU -funded project EXSCALATE4COV  that exploits the most powerful computing  resources c urrently based in Europe to foster  smart in -silico drug design while increasing the accuracy and  predictability of Computer -Aided Drug Design. Specifically, the project involves three among the most  powerful supercomputing centres in the EU: CINECA  in Italy, the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre ( BSC) in  Spain and the Julich Supercomputing Centre ( JSC) in German y. The collaboration also includes pharmaceutical  companies and major institutes of biology and bio -molecular dynamics from across Europe.   5.27.7  Monitoring and future update   The development and the implementation of the Spanish AI strategy involves a wide range of governmental  bodies, and SEDIA  is in charge of coordinating and monitoring the AI strategy. This newly -established body  harmonises the actions of ministerial departments, public and private stake holders. Furthermore, the Advisory  Council on Artificial Intelligence, a new consultative body, supports the development and implementation of  the AI strategy by providing advice and recommendations on the policy measures to develop AI in Spain.   Since policy needs in the field of AI may change quickly over time, the national AI strategy is a living and  flexible document . For this reason, the Spanish G overnment will revise and update the national AI strategy  within two years.       
  131 5.28 Sweden   In May 2018, the Swedish Government released its national AI strategy National approach for artificial  intelligence  (Sweden, 2018). This strategy points out the general direction for AI in Sweden in order to create  a basis for future policy actions and priorities. In this sense, this strategy serves as a reference for the  government to outline forthcoming policy initia tives with the aim to strengthen Sweden’s welfare and  competitiveness by means of AI. To this purpose, the Swedish strategy focuses on the following priority areas:    Education and training;    Research;    Innovation and use;    Framework and infrastructure.   Prior t o the release of the strategy, Vinnova  – Sweden’s innovation agency – published an extensive policy  report  outlini ng the opportunities and challenges of AI in Sweden, and Sweden’s capabilities to embrace the  full potential of AI (with concrete examples of ongoing AI projects).   This section presents the policy recommendations of Sweden’s AI strategy. Where possible, i t aims to  incorporate new policy initiatives that have been rolled out since the launch of the strategy in May 2018.   In terms of funding, Vinnova funded AI  projects for SEK 675 million (approx . EUR 67. 5 million) in 2020. The  total sum for AI projects that Vinnova help ed fund was SEK 1,350 billion (approx . EUR 135 million), 50% of  this could be private founding or funding from other national programs. In the national budget for innovation  and research until 2024 at least SEK 550 million (approx . EUR 55 milli on) has been assigned to research and  innovation in digital technologies and AI and its use and impact on society.   5.28.1  Human capital   The Swedish G overnment addresses the need of formal education and training as well as lifelong  learning  in AI  by means of the following policy recommendations:    Education institutions need to provide a sufficient number of people with AI education and training,  including continuing education for professionals. Swedish universities have started proposing  bachelor’s  and master’s programmes in AI fields, e.g.:   o Master programmes on Data engineering , Machine learning and statistics , Image analysis  and machine learning  at Uppsala University;   o Master programmes on Design for Creative and Immersive Technology  at Stockholm  University;   o Master programmes on Machine learning , and Systems, Control and Robotics  at KTH Royal  Institute of Technology;   o Master programmes on Language technology  and Logic  at the University of Gothenburg;   o Three newly launched AI-related  master programmes on Data science and AI , HighPerformance computer systems  and Physics  at Chalmers University;    Non-technical programmes should include a strong AI component to foster a broad and responsible  understanding of the use of AI;    The links between research, higher education and innovation should reinforce in the field of AI;    Continued and further education for professionals should be ensured (e.g. by offering MOOCs such as  the Elements of AI  course ).  The following initiatives will serve to evaluate changes in skill ne eds on the labour market due to AI  developments, and to get ready for them:    The Agency for Economic and regional Growth together with the Swedish Higher Education Authority  analyse the evolution of the supply of competenc ies in advanced digital technologies in both short  and long term, and they make recommendation about it. The work aims to improve the supply of  such competenc ies as well as improve statistics and forecasts of future needs in the Swedish labour   market;    A pilot project  to identify the need for AI skills in companies and organisations from the southern  region to better use new smart technologies based on AI. The aim is to develop AI courses depending  on the needs that emerge.   
  132 Lastly, the platform AI Competence for Sweden  lists university courses for working professionals in AI -related  fields. The goal of this initiative is to improve the competence in AI of bot h academia and industry.   5.28.2  From the lab to the market   To transform innovative ideas into market products and services, the Swedish strategy emphasizes the need  for:   A strong basic and applied research environment in AI;    A strong relation with leading international AI research environments;    Pilot projects, testbeds and environments for development of AI applications;    Efforts to prevent and manage risk associated with AI.   Some policy initiatives to address these needs are:    AI Sweden : an ambitious holistic programme to foster the development of AI applications in Sweden.  With funding from Vinnova , among others, it is organised as a national centre for applied AI research  and innovation with almost 70 partners from the industrial and public sectors, research institutions,  and the academic world. AI Sweden initiated and runs a number of projects supporting AI research  and innovations. It also provides a platform for collaborat ions, and technology/data infrastructure;    AI-related innovation projects  financed through Vinnova . On 1 April 2021 , a total of 256  ongoing  projects matched the keywords “artificial intelligence” and “AI” in Vinnova’s project database;    Startup AI activities : Vinnova also funds SMEs and public organisations when they start the first  innovation project in AI. In a recent call for projects’ proposals participants could apply for a  maximum of SEK 50 0,000 (approx. EUR 48,800);    Vinnova is the national coordinator to strengthen testbeds and demonstration  activities in Sweden.  To this purpose it disseminates information on hundreds ongoing testbeds in Sweden, among others  in the field of AI.   5.28.3  Networking   In terms of networking, the  Swedish G overnment is setting up policies to:    Foster strong collaborations an d partnerships among business, the public sector and research in AI;    Develop collaboration and partnerships on the use of AI applications with other countries.   The AI Sweden  programme for instance envisages nodes and co -location areas  across Sweden to boost and  to enable collaborations and partnerships for AI innovation.   Another example is the Analytic Imaging Diagnostic Arena ( AIDA), which is a Swedish arena for research and  innovation on analytic image -based diagnostics. AIDA is a cross -disciplinary and cross -sectoral  collaboration  aiming to largescale usefulness of AI in healthcare.   Lastly, the AI agenda  is a collaborative, stakeholder -driven, approach  to suggest and formulate a  national roadmap to accelerate the AI uptake in Sweden. This work is stakeholder -driven, bringing together  academia, research  institutes, public and private sector representatives as well as other organisations. There  are six working groups looking into different aspects of AI such as: infrastructure, industry, public sector,  education and more. The work is coordinated by the RISE.  In terms of international attractiveness  the Swedish strategy (p. 5) claims that “ if Sweden can strengthen  policy conditions across all policy areas, it will be well placed to offer an internationally attractive wor king  environment for business, researchers and others interested in AI research, development and use ”.  5.28.4  Regulation   To foster AI regulation, the Government has identified the need to:    Develop rules, standards, norms and ethical principles for an ethical and sustainable AI and its use;    Push for Swedish and international standards and regulations that promote a risk -free use of AI.   With regard to ethical and sustainable AI , it is important to develop ethical guidelines to ensure a  transparent, explainable, and non-discriminatory development of AI. This is particularly important in systems  that closely interact with the physical world, such as self -driving vehicles or AI applications in health care. To  
  133 this purpose, the Swedish G overnment established the Committe e for Technological Innovation and Ethics  (KOMET ) in August 2018. The Committee aims to release annual interim reports.   The launch of the following initiatives means to foster the creation of eth ical and sustainable AI:    The establishment of the AI sustainability centre: a hub co-founded by companies, universities and  public authorities with a specific focus on social and ethical aspects of AI;    Academic seminars  on the ethical challenges of AI in business, administration and across various  sectoral areas.   The Swedish strategy recommends to establish a legislation  that fosters the use of AI and prevents ri sks for  both society and individuals. In this sense, the new legislation should safeguard privacy, ethics, trust and  social values. At the time of writing this report, the new legislation was starting hence the Swedish legislation  on data protection and ow nership, for instance, was still largely based on the EU law.   The Government has established the Committee for Technological Innovation and Ethics to identify policy  challenges, contribute to reducing uncertainty on existing regulations and accelerate the policy development  on new technologies. Automation and AI are both natural areas of interest for this committee.   The Swedish strategy also suggests to frame appropriate (international) standards . In terms of  standardisation, Sweden has the following organi sations and bodies:    The Swedish Institute for Standards ( SIS): an international organisation specialised in national and  international standards;    The Swedish Standards Council: the principal body for all Swedish stand ardisation. Its task is to  promote interest in standardisation and to encourage the use of standards.   5.28.5  Infrastructure   The Swedish strategy emphasizes the need for a digital infrastructure to harness the opportunities that AI can  provide, including both a high-quality data infrastructure and a well -developed digital and  telecommunication infrastructure  in terms of computer power, connectivity and network capacity. The AI  Sweden programme cover both the development of the data infrastructure – by improving d ata quality, data  availability and data sharing opportunities, and the setting up of the IT infrastructure.   The AI Sweden programme  makes  datasets accessible via the Data Factory . It aims to provide horizon tal  resources to all research partners, ensuring that data sets are available across industries and application  areas in order to accelerate AI innovation and applications.   With regard to AI in the public sector, the Swedish Agency for Digital Government (DIGG ) supports AI uptake  and deployment in public administrations. In a policy report  from the 14th of January 2020, the agency points  out that the economic gains resulting from AI could be potentially large for the Swedish public sector. The  report includes a mapping exercise on how the Swedish public sector currently uses A I, and it presents  suggestions to increasingly use AI in the future. The DIGG is also supporting open data policies to foster data driven innovations and technology developments.   5.28.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   In October 2019, th e Swedish G overnment and academia met representatives from U.S. academia, Google,  Ericsson, USAID and UN agencies UNDP and UN Global Pulse to explore the extent of AI in accelerating  innovations that help reaching the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs ). The event marked the  beginning of the AI, People & Planet  collaborative research initiative. This initiative is hosted by the Beijer  Institute of Ecological Economics (at the Royal Swedish Academ y of Sciences), Princeton University (Princeton  Institute for International and Regional Studies), and the Stockholm Resilience Centre. It aims to deepen how  AI can help expand the planetary support systems – climate stability, biodiversity, and living oce ans.  In April 2020, Vinnova  launched the call on AI in the service of climate , in collaboration with the government  agency Formas. This call aims to support projects using AI to help Sweden having no net emissions of  greenhouse gases by 2045 or to adapt society to the climate changes.      
  134 COVID -19 pandemic   The Swedish Innovation Agency Vinnova  is supporting businesses and public enterprises in their innovative  efforts. Among other support initiatives, it is also promoting innovation projects in AI. In April 2020, the  agency announced its funding support for a project  on how AI can provide more effective strategies for future  pandemics.   Open science initia tives boosting access and sharing of data are essential to leverage the benefits of AI. Data  and algorithms constitute key elements of AI systems. To this purpose, t he Swedish COVID -19 Data Portal   provides information, guidelines, tools and services also from AI to support researchers to use Swedish and  European infrastructures for data shar ing. To further expand this initiative, SciLifeLab, the national centre for  molecular biosciences in health and environmental research, is  recruiting  data engineers with expertise in AI   to operate the Swedish national COVID -19 research data portal and rein force open science, and data driven  life science.   Finally, the Upplands -Bro municipality on the outskirts of Stockholm is an interesting use -case of the  employment of AI recruitment robots  to reduce the risk of contamination at the interview stage during the  COVID -19 pandemic.   5.28.7  Monitoring and future update   The Swedish national strategy on AI will be reviewed on a regular basis to assess the policy progress  and to  foster the development and use of AI.   Sweden is working on a strategy for secure access to open data and the use of data as a strategic resource,  with respect for rules on data protection and privacy and based on the premise  that data is a basic  prerequisite for being able to use the potential in AI and other digital innovation. The strategy will be  published in 2021 and is an important complement to the previously published national AI strategy.
  135 5.29 Switzerland   Although Switzer land does not intend to release a national AI strategy, there is ongoing effort to promote  framework conditions for research and deployment of  AI in the Swiss economy and society . In December  2019, the Swiss Federal Council acknowledged the Report  of the Interdepartmental Working Group on  Artificial Intelligence (Switzerland, 2019a). This Working Group was established in fall 2018 by the Federal  Department of Ec onomic Affairs, Education and Research ( EAER ) on behalf of the Federal Council. The report  provides evidence that Switzerland benefits  of good conditions to encourage the deployment of AI and to  tackle the numerous challenges brought about by this technology. This report analyses the existing policy  initiatives in Switzerland to propose - where needed - concrete lines of actions to enabl e the Federal  Government to fully leverage the benefits of AI. Specifically, this report provides recommendations in various  policy areas and presents policy actions along 17 thematic fields.66 Mainly, it includes:    Improving AI -related skills and competenc ies at all education levels and creating lifelong learning and  reskilling opportunities for the labour force;    Fostering AI research and innovation to enhance the competitiveness of the entrepreneurial  ecosystem;    Enhancing public services through a wider ado ption and use of AI applications;    Supporting (international) networks and partnerships and ensuring the exchange of information and  knowledge between all economic and institutional players;    Establishing a regulatory and ethical framework to ensure a susta inable and trustworthy AI;    Developing a data infrastructure to fuel AI developments;    Reinforcing the telecommunication infrastructure, in particular with respect to cybersecurity.   In tackling these challenges for concrete policy actions, the Working Group on AI recommends close  coordination and integration of policies outlined in the Digital Switzerland Strategy . Some aspects in the  application of AI are addressed in the new Digital Switzerland s trategy  of September 2020 , in particular on  data use (Switzerland, 2020) .  In addition, the Swiss G overnment adopted specific guidelines for AI in November 2020, which are intended to  provide the federal administration and the agencies entrusted with administrative tasks with a general  orientation framework and ensure a coherent AI policy. Regular evaluation of the application and further  development  of these guidelines is planned .  5.29.1  Human capital   The State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation ( SERI) has released a report on Artificial  intelligence in e ducation  (Switzerland, 2019b) to enhance human capacity in AI. This report presents the  policies for the adoption of AI in education, and it highlights opp ortunities and challenges that AI brings into  the education system. Among others, it emphasise s the need to develop courses to acquire the necessary  skills for the deployment of AI in the primary, secondary and tertiary education  systems. It includes  the following policies:    Ensuring the transfer of skills necessary for the use of AI at all levels of the education system . The  State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation ( SERI) will ensure this in close coordination  with the cantons;    Guaranteeing a transparent and responsible use of AI in education.   In addition to the need of students’ education, it is essential to guarantee that AI skills support the workforce  across all sectors . Lifelong learning programmes for continuous education and training, and re skilling and up -skilling opportunities can make this possible. These types of training have a tremendous  potential and their importance will continue growing in the future.                                              66  1) International bodies and AI, 2) Swiss intelligence of interests in the European AI (Digital Europe Programme) activities, 3) Changes in  the world of work, 4) AI in industry and services, 5) AI in education, 6) A pplication of AI in science and research, 7) AI in cybersecurity  and security policy, 8) AI, Media & Public, 9) Automated mobility and AI, 10) AI in healthcare, 11) AI in the financial secto r, 12) AI in  agriculture, 13) Energy, climate, environment and AI,  14) AI in administration, 15) Further development of the general legal framework  on AI, 16) AI in justice, 17) AI, data and intellectual property law.   
  136 The Wo rking Group also recognises that the AI will change the labour market in a different way from previous  technological developments. In this sense, skills and competenc ies of the workforce need to adapt quickly to  the changing needs of the labour market . Existing measures are already in place to actively screen and  monitor the skills demanded in the labour market. The State Secretariat for Economic Affairs ( SECO ) monitors  the challenges and addresses  emerging issues within the existing competenc ies in AI. Furthermore, in  November 2017, the Federal Council decided to monitor the impact of the digital transformation on the  labour market. A report will publish the results of the monitoring by the end of 2022.   5.29.2  From the lab to the market   The Working Group on AI highlights that Switzerland has good quality research and innovation in AI, although  challenges are high.   In terms of scientific research in AI , existing activities and challenges on AI are presented in the SATW  report on Artificial intelligence in  science and r esearch , prepared for the S ERI. Switzerland can rely on the  dynamic research environment of well -known and long -established research centres, such as the Swiss AI Lab  IDSIA , the IDIAP Research Institute , the ETH Zürich Competence centres , and the Centre for Intelligent Systems   at EPFL . In addition, private research initiatives and universities complement this research context. At present,  the experts of the Working Group on AI suggested that the existing policy initiatives are providing the  appropriate support and the Federal Government can avoid taking further policy measures. In this sense, the  research capacity around AI receives support by existing policies as  the Federal education, research and  innovation policy 2021 -2024 , the Digitalisation a ction plan for education, research and innovation , open and  competitive federal instruments, and the strategic planning of universities for 2021 -2024 that identified  digitalisation and AI as key priorities.   To enhance innovation in AI , the SATW report on Artificial intelligence in the industry and public  administration , prepared for the S ERI, presented a detailed overview of overarching challeng es on AI in  industry and public administration. The performance of Switzerland as for the amount and quality of AI  patents, and the number of Swiss AI start -ups – reported by the Working Group on AI – reveal a strong and  competitive position. As such, the Working Group concludes that the industry itself is addressing quite well the  challenges of AI. However, besides self -regulation by the industry, the Working Group highlights numerous  policy initiatives in priority areas  such as media, mobility, healthcare , finance, agriculture and energy and  climate.   Media and public   The Working Group highlights the need to govern the role of intermediaries due to the increasing use of AI in  the media and to the challenges that it may bring along (e.g. fake news),. A gover nance report outlining  concrete policy actions will be submitted to the Federal Council by the end of 2021. Other actions will tackle  the monitoring of media developments and the use of AI in the media.   Autonomous mobility   The report on Autonomous m obility and artificial intelligence , prepared in 2019 for the S ERI, presents  governance efforts on autonomous mobility. In this respect , both the Federal Roads Office ( FEDRO ) and the  Federal Office of Transport ( FOT) are following -up the development on automated vehicles  to promote data  exchange (e.g. report on Provision and exchange of data for automated road driving ), ensure data protection  and revise the legislative framework (revision of the Road Traffic Act ( SVG) and the Railways Act ( EBG)).  Health care   AI is bringing many opportunities to the health system by means of data -driven medicine that can improve  prevention, predictio n and monitoring. The development of data -driven analytical techniques and the  introduction of AI in the health care sector increase the need for data and privacy protection. Due to this, the  Federal Office of Public Health ( FOPH ) monitors the impact of AI on medicine and healthcare also to include  potential revisions to the existing legislation on the Human Research Act  for data protection and privacy, and  on the Federal Act on Medicinal Products and Medical Devices  for the use of A I in the clinic process.   Finance    The use of AI is automating and accelerating labour -intensive processes in the financial industry too.  Therefore, the need of a proper governance emerges as the use of AI in this sector expands.  The Federal  Department of Finance ( FDF) monitors AI developments in the financial sector to fix emerging issues through 
  137 proper regulatory reviews. Among others, it regulates the operational  risks and it outlines the behavioural  obligations to use AI methods in the financial sector.   Agriculture   In the context of agriculture, AI facilitates precision farming through image recognition and harvesting robots,  among other cognitive computer techno logies. The Federal Office for Agriculture ( FOAG ) monitors  developments in agriculture on an ongoing basis. To this end, it has set up a Business Intelligence  Competence Centre, which is active in t he field digital data and predictive analyses. In addition, the Federal  Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research ( EAER ), and the FOAG  launched a Charter on the  digitisation of Swiss agriculture and the food industry  in 2018 . This Charter aims to nurture a shared  awareness and promotes cooperation among relevant stakeholders.   Energy   The deployment of AI can enable significant efficiency gains in energy supply. It can support the development  of renewable energies, provide energy savi ngs and thus contribute to climate protection. Overall, it can  simplify the existing complexity of energy supply operations. In this respect, the Swiss Federal Office of  Energy ( SFOE ) monitors and t ackles the AI challenges in the energy industry (see Section 4.29.6 ).  To foster innovations in the private sector, the creation of testbeds is recommended for cyber security and the  energy sector. To increase the use of AI in cybersecurity, The National Cy bersecurity Centre ( NCSC ), and the  Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport ( DDPS ), in cooperation with the Federal Depar tment  of Foreign Affairs ( FDFA ) and the EAER , are launching a study to evalu ate the potential of a Swiss AI test  centre in this field. In the energy sector, the Federal Office for Energy offers a Pilot and Demonstrati on  Programme  to promote the development and testing of new technologies, including AI -related projects.   In addition to the demonstrated tremendous potential of AI in the private sector, the use of AI is also an  effective means to increase the quality and e fficiency of services in the public administration . To  this aim, the Federal Customs Administration ( FCA), the Swiss Federal Statistical Office ( FSO) and the State  Secretariat for Migration ( SEM), support various projects, e.g.:    The development of a chatbot solution to reduce the costs of border crossing and the establishment  of a data analytics projects to conduct risk analysis and controls in smuggling of goods. Both projects  are part of the DaziT P rogramme , which aims to modernise and digitalise th e Federal Customs  Administration;    The Arealstatistik Deep Learning – ADELE  project is a deep learning application for land use and land  cover classific ation manag ed by the FSO ;   The project on Automation of NOGA coding  (NOGauto) proposes machine -learning methods to encode  data already available at the FSO ;   The FSO project on Machine Learning – Sosi conducts data analyses on the social security system  with machine -learning approaches;    The projec t on Data validation with Machine Learning  aims to extend and spe ed up data validation in  the FSO  by means of machine learning algorithms and at the s ame time to improve data quality;    The SEM project Job algorithm for asylum seekers  is a pilot test of a machine learning system to  distribut e asylum seekers among the cantons while optimising the labour market.   To foster similar types of projects, the Working Group on AI recommends that the federal administration  encourages data exchanges and exploits the large data collections available in pu blic administrations by  means of AI -related technologies. To this purpose, a cross -administrative recording of processes and shared  access to data between public departments should be envisaged. In addition, the creation of an AI  competence network with a specific focus on technical aspects of the application of AI in the federal  administration could facilitate the sharing of good practices.   5.29.3  Networking   The following policy initiatives are ongoing or recommended to promote better networking and cooperation  between AI -relevant actors:    Developing platforms to ensure dialogue and exchange of information and knowledge. The Working  Group suggests that the Swiss " Plateforme Tripartite ” established by the Federal Office of 
  138 Communications ( OFCOM ) could become an interdisciplinary national competence network on AI  issues;    Strengthening collaborations between AI players by further developing hubs for digital policy  debates, such as the Geneva Internet Platform ( GIP). This platf orm has been launched by the OFC OM  and the  Federal Department of Foreign Affairs ( FDFA) and it could act as a centre for digital  governance, including AI. Strengthening the importance of Geneva and the Geneva Internet Platform  as hu bs for global digital and technology policy is also a main objective in the new Foreign policy  strategy 2020 -2023;   Supporting the participation in the pan -European initiatives such as Horizon Europe  and Digital  Europe Programme , aiming to improve Europe’s competitiveness in the global digital economy  through support schemes on supercomputing, Digi tal Innovation Hubs, and advanced digital skills  among others;    Strengthening the international cooperation for cybersecurity: the FDFA has set up the Office of the  Special Envoy for Cyber Foreign and Security Policy . This targeted multilateral cooperation regularly  discusses the influ ence of AI . At technical level, the international cooperation helps to exchange  information on incident management, and at the same time the Federal Intelligence Servi ce  maintains intensive contacts with the Swiss cantons whose infrastructures are also affected by  cyber -attacks.    5.29.4  Regulation   The regulation concerns legislations and recommendations to foster AI innovations, create standard of AI  adoption and application, while caring of principle of ethics and inclusion.   With respect to the development of ethical guidelines  for a trustworthy, reliable, responsible and fair  deployment of AI, the Swiss  Government is actively involved in international discussions and committe d to  ensure the respect of established values and standards in the use of AI. To this purpose, it is important to  guarantee principles of traceability, transparency, and inclusion (i.e. avoiding social biases and discrimination).   Towards a regulation for AI, the Working Group on AI recommends to keep the general regulatory  framework to enable the development of AI in Switzerland. This framework will accommodate some  clarifications and adaptations in specific thematic fields and policy areas like media, mob ility, healthcare,  finance, agri culture and energy and climate . The identification of these thematic areas goes along with the  need to adapt sectoral regulation. However, effective regulations should target as many technologies as  possible. Therefore, the Federal Government is keen to continue with a technology -neutral policy , which  avoids the promotion of specific technologies and of technology -specific regulations as far as possible. While  the establishment of the legal basis is ensured by a wide range of  institutions, the FDFA will specifically focus  on the following policies to further develop the general legal framework on AI:   Examining the emergence of AI -specific international law and its impac t on Switzerland;    Following -up developments with regard to the visibility of AI systems in interaction with consumers;    Monitoring developments in AI -based decision -making in the justice system (predictive justice).   In line with legislative reforms, the Wor king Group on AI recognises that a general improvement of  standardisation and a higher interoperability  would encourage AI -related research and innovation  between relevant stakeholders.   5.29.5  Infrastructure   The interdepartmental Working Group on AI includes the implementation of a suitable infrastructure among  its challenges. The possibility to finance the infrastructure to increase the capacity in the field of AI is a  challenge of technical nature. It relates to both a strong data infrastructure (i.e. data colle ction, data sharing  practices) and a solid telecommunication infrastructure (i.e. high -speed connectivity and appropriate cyber  security).   In terms of data infrastructure , following policies are mentioned:    Supporting data exchange infrastructures in the ar eas of Open Access to Publication and Open  Research Data. These initiatives could link up with the European electronic computer infrastructure  for open science ( BEAT platform ) and the European Open Science Cloud ( EOSC ); 
  139  Ensuring  the security and protection of data through  on the recently revised Federal Act on Copyright  and Related Rights ;   Supporting sector -specific measures towards data collection, data sharing and data protection, e.g.:   o Releasing the  Energy s trategy 2050 , which includes targets to building the data  infrastructure to deploy AI within the energy sector (see also Section 4.29.6 ). By the end of  2027, smart metering systems (so-called smart meters) will be introduced in the electricity  sector. They allow digital and fine -granular data collection of electricity  production/consumption;    Establishing  a digital platform (Datahub) could be envisaged to make data exchange more effic ient  and to make data more easily available. Standardised machine -readable interfaces (APIs) play an  important role in this process as platforms and machine -readable interfaces could be at the core of  the data infrastructure.   In terms of telecommunication infrastructure  and associated cyber security measures, the Working Group  on AI refers to a detailed report on Artificial intelligence in cybersec urity and security p olicy. It highlights the  following initiatives:    The National Cyber Risk Protection Strategy (NCS) presents ongoing and planned activities  (2018 -2022) to strengthen the protection against cyber -risks related to AI. In particular, the National  Cybersecurity Centre ( NCSC ), formerly known as MELANI, and Governmental Computer Emergency  Response Team ( GovCERT ) have capabilities to analyse new cyber risks related to AI;    The National strategy for C ritical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) contains 17 actions to  improve the protection of critical infrastructure and thereby to ensure the availability of essential  goods and services (e.g. information and communication service s). This strategy also aims to grasp  new AI opportunities to deliver critical services (e.g. cyber supply chain risks) and an overall better  protection (e.g. AI -based monitoring and decision -making processes);    The Cyber Defence Action Plan (CDAP ) aims to systematically strengthen cyber capabilities. In  addition to self -prote ction, the main objective is to implement the cyber aspects of the Intelligence  Act and the Military Act to be able to support operators of critical infrastructure under cyber -attacks.  Since 2019, the Cyber Defence Campus of Armasuisse  is a platform to anticipate, detect and monitor  new technologies including AI developments. The campus operates in close cooperation with both  universities and eco nomic actors;    The Swiss Drone and Robotics Centre  (SDRC) explores the opportunities and risks of combining  robotics and AI for the security of Switzerland in n ational and bilateral projects.   5.29.6  AI to address societal challenges   Climate and environment   The objectives to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the next 30 years constitute a strong incentive for  Switzerland to employ the full potential of AI to achieve envir onmental objectives. Issues around  environmentally sound production, recycling and disposal of the necessary infrastructure and equipment for  the circular economy will increasingly gain momentum.   The Working Group on AI  explicitly recognises AI as key technology to meet the ecological requirements   of nutrition, housing and mobility systems. To this purpose, there is an attempt to make necessary data (e.g.  availability of raw materials, state of ecosystems at production sites or information in production  processes)  easily available and integrated into the information flows of value  chains and markets. In this respect, the  Federal Council released a report on Swiss Hub for Energy Data , as part of a national energy data  infrastructure, which paves the way for energy strategy 2050, climate action and digital innovation.  This  policy report highlights that a national data infrastructure in the energy sector is essential for digitisation an d  innovation that enables the development and integration of renewable energy, improves energy efficiency,  counters climate change and, last but not least, supports new business models.   The Federa l Office for Environment  ensures that environmental information is openly available within digital  datasets that can possibly be used for AI applications. This institution also accompanies the environmental  challenges related to AI vis -à-vis the circular e conomy challenges.   AI technologies can help to predict demand for energy, food or consumer goods. Furthermore, AI has the  potential to reduce inefficiencies in production planning, by managing information about raw materials as  much as integrating informa tion about the production ecosystems including environmental and social aspects. 
  140 Finally, AI can distribute this information to consumers in order to identify and purchase not only the cheapest  but also the most environmentally friendly product for given i ndividual consumption needs.   In sum, AI will play a key role in the energy sector, especially in the transformation from a centrally organised  system to a decentralised and renewables -based one, as it optimises network planning results with forecasts  of co nsumption and production. AI technologies can be promoted either through the targeted development of  environmental applications or indirectly through the provision of large amounts of environmental data (push  approach).   COVID -19 pandemic   Concerning the cur rent pandemic of COVID -19, the Federal Office of Public Health launched the  SwissCOVID  app and contact tracing , this institutional page provides information about many dimensions (e.g.,  relevance to citizens, how to install) of the app as much as about its technical aspects (e.g., using Bluetooth  and the API of Amazon and Google, usin g Amazon Cloud Front, using Replay attacks and AEM -tempering).  Another digital initiative of the Federal Office of Public Health is the Coronavirus online check .   Furthermore, the Swiss Tropical a nd Public Health Institute  (Swiss TPH)  has a whole web page related to  COVID -19 Activities at Swiss TPH  and encompassing the use of AI and machine learning. The Swiss TPH is an  associated institu te of the University of Basel, and as a public organisation, is partially supported by the Swiss  Federal Council and the Canton of Basel -Stadt. The greater part of its funding comes from competitively  acquired project funds. Specifically, the following ini tiatives are presented:    Mitigation strategies for communities with COVID -19 transmission in Lesotho using AI on chest x rays and novel rapid diagnostic tests ( MistraL );   COVID -19 Outbreak Res ponse combining E -health, Serolomics, Modelling, Artificial Intelligence and  Implementation Research ( CORESMA );   Using model -based evidence to optimise medical intervention profiles and disease management  strategies for COVID -19 control ( MODCOVID ). This approach combines mathematical models and  machine learning with product development decision processes;    Providing real -time clinical data to improve risk assessment and response, deploying an established  mHealth Surveillance Outbreak Response Management and Analysis System ( SORMAS ).  5.29.7  Monitoring and future update   The progress of the development and deployment of AI in Switzerland will be monitored and evaluated on a  regular basis.
