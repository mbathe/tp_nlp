Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence
















The Commission has proposed the first ever legal framework on AI, which addresses the risks of AI and positions Europe to play a leading role globally.


The Proposal for a Regulation on artificial intelligence was announced by the Commission in April 2021. It aims to address risks of specific uses of AI, categorising them into 4 different levels: unacceptable risk, high risk, limited risk, and minimal risk.
In doing so, the AI Regulation will make sure that Europeans can trust the AI they are using. The Regulation is also key to building an ecosytem of excellence in AI and strengthening the EU's ability to compete globally. It goes hand in hand with the Coordinated Plan on AI.
