                  DDP-YD/ETD (2020) 170   Strasbourg, 1 December 2020                                                                                     Seminar   Artificial Intelligence :   How can youth take part?     online   23 - 27 November  2020      Declaration  on Youth Participation in AI  Governance              
2   This declaration  is the outcome of the work done by the young people, participants of  the seminar Artificial Intelligence: How Can Youth Take part?  organised  by the Youth  Department of the Council of Europe, between 23  and 27 November 2020.  It is  positioned within the wider framework of  the Council of Europe’s youth policy and  initiatives that link Artificial Intelligence ( AI) and democratic citizenship . The declaration   explor es issues, challenges and roles that stakeholders can play to secure  and enable   the participation of young people in AI governance processes at all levels.     Considering the impact of AI systems on everyday life , in addition to  the accelerated  trends and risks due to COVID19 , the present Declaration highlights :    a) The exclusionary consequences of the  fast-paced development  of AI  technologies driven by the private sector  that leave  many stake holders,  especially youth actors and human rights activists , but also policy makers,   behind,  and result in normatively questionable and ineffective self -regulation in  the private sector   b) The need to develop and ensure l egal safeguards  both  by international  organisations  through existing or new legal instruments  and by  national  governments  responsible  for securing and implementing them at national level   c) The a bsence of youth in the emerging AI governance processes  as a denial  of the  right to participation in democratic pro cesses which  impedes  a whole  sector from co -shaping the  discourse about development, assessment,  implementation and regulation of  AI technologies   d) The imperative to respect ethical principles  which must  be at the core of all  AI developments and deployment (transparency, justice and fairness,  responsibility, safety and security, privacy)   e) The need to assess the value of AI technologies  on the impact of their  consequences and benefits on individuals  and soc iety. Not all social and  economic problems need to be anchored in technological solutions .    Based on these elements and the full set of conclusions  that result ed from the seminar,  the declaration invites the existing youth structures to engage actively in AI governance  and calls on the Council of Europe , its member states , national, regional and local  authorities to take  action upon  the following priorities :    1. Youth Participation  - Safeguard and promote quality and meaningful youth  participation in all AI Governance processes, recognise and position young people  as rightful stakeholder s that stand  on the same level as AI experts and private  representatives, and other  groups , by 
3   - ensuring access to AI governance processes at all levels, local, regional, national  and European   - including young people in existing structures such as digital transformation  councils, smart city strategies and councils , multidisciplinary advisory boards  dealing with the development and deployment of AI -technologies , etc.  - supporting the establishment of new forms of youth participation – such as Youth  Labs, Open Creative Spaces – in cooperation with various stakeholders, within  schools, academia, and techno logy companies .    2. AI Literacy and Education  - Support the democratisation of AI as a complementary  approach to all AI governance processes . First, t his includes demystifying the  complexity of issues and  making algorithms understandable and interpretable ,  breaking the culture of AI “impenetrability ”. Second, it means ensuring equal access  of young people to AI -related value -based knowledge, skills and competences  needed to participate in and co -shape the AI discourse , by  - increasing awareness on the use of AI while focusing on understanding the impact  of AI systems on human  rights, including social rights, and on the well -being and  dignity of young people   - supporting the skills development of young people , thereby  facilitating the  transition to an increasing ly automated society   - supporting educators and teachers in advancing  their digital skills needed to   empower young people in dealing with AI technology   - enabling a “maker culture ” and empowering you ng people to engage in  identifying and developing solutions based on AI  technologies that can further  improve their quality of life   - educating engineers and technical experts on human rights -based  approaches to  technology development and on democratic gover nance   - anchoring AI literacy in formal  education , in order  to reach young people from an  early age. For this, an international or European AI curriculum for teacher training  and school education should be developed   - ensuring AI literacy initiatives are affordable and accessible to all young people,  from all socio -economic backgrounds, to avoid further ing existing  digital gap s.    3. AI Governance  - there is a need to put the respect for human rights and democracy   at the cent re of AI policies  and to safeguard principles of social inclusion and  diversity , by:  - ensuring that the  language used in these processes is accessible and clear for all  citizens, including those with no technical background  
4   - proposing evidence -based policies  that consider  young people as a specific  category  and mandating intersectional audits on the possible impacts of specific  policies on different groups , before a policy is adopted.   - including specifically the youth sector in  public consultation s on AI  use and  regulation     4. Creating  Synergies  - Foster  cross -sectoral and multi stakeholder cooperation  between AI, educational and youth stakeholders among  others , by  - ensuring th at cooperatio n between youth and stakeholders in AI Governance is  the rule rather than the exception   - harmonising  AI and youth policies, by creating links between AI and youth  priorities, in all processes .
