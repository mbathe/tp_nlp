      6     Foreword     Over the past 50 years , the world has witnessed landmark innovations and revolutionary changes  that  have  transform ed economies, jobs, and even society itself , fundamentally altering the way  we live,  work and relate to one another. Artificial intelligence (AI)  and related technologies are among the most  important drivers of change, and have an impact on every area of intellectual property  rights  (IPR).  This study has been drawn up as a tool for practitioners, shedding light on how these technologies  are used bo th to safeguard copyright and design s and infringe them.     Understanding the implications of these transformations  is vital at a time when the Fourth Industrial  Revolution (4IR) is transforming virtually every area of the economy and society. We are seeing  inventions and breakthroughs in the fields of autonomous transport, biotechnology, the Internet of  Things (IoT), smart devices, AI, 3D printing, robotics, and quantum computing. These inventions affect   healthcare, transport, agriculture and law enforcement , among other  fields,  and the pace of global  innovation has accelerated greatly during the last decade. According to some estimates, by 2023  there will be some 29  billion connected devices on the planet that use AI technologies , and the  underlying algorith ms are becoming ever more central.     Infringements of IP R through the malicious use of various new  technologies, including AI, are on the  rise, as reported by Europol ’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3), the EU Agency for Cybersecurity  (ENISA) and the United  Nations. In May 2021,  the EU’s Council of Ministers named  IP crime as one  of the top 10 priorities in the fight against organised crime for 2022 -2025 . This issue  will be tackled   through the European multi -disciplinary platform against criminal threats (EM PACT). The European  Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) , via the European Observatory on Infringements of  Intellectual Property Rights, will be actively involved in  supporting  the implementation of this priority  under  the EMPACT.      
      7   In this new era, it is critical that we adopt ‘smart’ intellectual property strategies , and the EUIPO,  working with its network of partners and IP stakeholders, has been developing tools and promoting  best practice s. This study represents another step on the journey to cre ating an IP excellence hub in  which new technologies and AI work to protect  legitimate businesses and citizens.

            10 Definitions     The following terminology and definitions will be used  in this study.    3D printing : the field of printing 3D objects. T he cycle begins with a digital file in which  the item to be  printed is digitally arranged using either 3D print ing software or a 3D scanne r. This digital file is then  exported to a 3D printer , which  uses  dedicated software t o assemble the digital model into a physical  object by building  liquid material up in layers  that then harden  until the finished object emerges.     Artificial intelligence : a subfield of computer science focuse d on develop ing computer systems that  can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence. These systems are designed by  humans , and when given a complex goal  can act in the physical or digital dimension.  In the context of  this study, AI is understood  as c omputer  code ( implemented in software and hardware) that  dynamically adapt s according to algorithmic rules  as large datasets are processed , with the aim of  predicting phenomena and assisting decision -makin g.    Artificial neural networks (ANN) : comput er systems intended to  mimic the way the  human  nervous   system analyses and processes information. They are based on the functioning  of the human brain,  with interconnected neuron s that process information by tran smitting it towards (inputs) and away  from  (outputs) the brain.  ANN s are a subset of machine learning ( ML) systems  and are at the centre  of  deep learning algorithms.     Algorithm : a series of instructions and rules that a computer must follow to complete an assignment,  which can be used to handle and process data and perform calculations or various other actions.    Cloud computing : the p rocess of storing and accessing data and other programs on the internet  rather than on  a computer  hard drive .    Computer speec h: the c apability of a machine to apply speech recognition and synthesis to creat e  human -like speech.  AI can be used in speech recognition, natural language processing  (NLP) , and  translation. Several speech recognition applications are generated by automat ic speech recognition,  conversion of audio to text, and processing the text to determine its meaning.   
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      11      Convolutional neural network (CNN) : a type of neural network that has one or more convolutional  layers ( in which  a filter is applied to an input that res ults in an activation). CNN s are mainly used for  image processing, classification,  and segmentation, as well as for other auto -correlated data. They  are d eep learning neural network s designed for processing structured arrays of data such as images.     Copyri ght: is a legal term used to describe the rights that creators have over their literary and artistic  works. Works covered by copyright range from books, plays, music, paintings, photographs, sculpture,  films and choreography, to computer programs, database s, advertisements, maps, technical drawings  and architecture. For the purposes of this study, references to copyright include the ‘related rights’ set  forth in copyright -related treaties administered by WIPO and relevant EU directives.     Cryptography : the s tudy of mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security such  as confidentiality, data integrity, entity authentication, and data origin authentication.     Deep learning (DL) : a subset of machine learning that uses a special type of algorit hm known as a   neural network and that is able to process a wider range of data resources . In some cases , it may  require less human data pre -processing to achieve  more accurate results than other machine learning  approaches. DL must have more than three lay ers of neurons  (including input and output) .    Design : the appearance of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features of, in particular,  the lines, contours, colours, shape, texture and/or materials of the product itself and/or its   ornamenta tion (Article  3 of Regulation (EC)  6/2002 on Community designs).  At international level,  design rights are  understood some what  differently ; that is, non -EU countries may not recogni se a  design as a stand -alone right. Instead, these countries may protect de signs through a combination of  other intellectual property laws, such as patent, trade  mark and copyright laws .    Expert system (ES) : a subfield of AI concerning  the use of a computer program designed to solve  complex issues and imitate a human expert’s  decision-making ability through extracting  knowledge  from its knowledge base and using reasoning and inference rules in accordance with user queries.     Explainable AI (XAI) : a set of processes and methods that enables users to understand and trust the  results generated by machine learning algorithms. XAI can be defined as AI that produces details or  reason ing to make its functioning clear or easy to understand.  
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      12      Generative adversarial networks (GANs) : generative models used in machine learning frameworks  that can create new data instances that resemble the training data. GANs are algorithmic architectures  that use two neural networks, pitting one against the other to generat e new, synthetic items of data  that can pass for real data.     Generative  design : a design exploration process  in which  designers or engineers select specific  goals to add to the generative design software, along with selected parameters including performance  or spatial requirements, materials, manufacturing methods, and cost constraints.     Infringement : a term that c overs direct ly IP-infringing acts as well as contributory and preparatory  acts and other closely related illegal acts or criminal offences (e.g. cybercrim e offences, money  laundering , etc.)    Intellectual property (IP) : creations of th e mind, such as : inventions; literary and artistic works;  designs; and symbols, names and images used in commerce. IP is protected in law by patents, design,  copyright, trade  mark  and trade secret law, which enable people to earn recognition or financial b enefit  from the ir invent ions or creat ions.(1)    Intellectual property infringement : the unauthorised use, translation, adaptation, reproduction, or  sale of materials or products that are legally regarded as protected intellectual property (IP), as defined  in the relevant legislation.     Internet of Things (IoT) : a network of physical objects  – ‘things’ – that are embedded with sensors,  software, and other technologies to connect  and exchang e data with other devices and systems over  the internet. These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools.     Machine learning (ML) : a subfield of AI focuse d on creating  applications that learn from data and can  progressively  improve their accuracy. This process allows the system to develop beyond the data and  algorithms with which it was  originally  provided,  with a view to achiev ing independent development  and learning based on previous experience gained in the same manner.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      13    Malicious software ( malware ): software designed to carry out an una uthori sed process that will have  an adverse impact on the privacy, integrity, or accessibility of an information system . This term   commonly includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and other code -based process es that infect a host,  as well as spyware, and s ome forms of adware.     Natural language processing (NLP) : a subfield of AI focuse d on providing machines  with the ability  to read, understand and derive meaning from human languages. NLP adopts a cognitive approach  by  enabling the extraction of data to crea te relations, making it possib le to identify figures of speech and  perform sentiment analysis.     Quantum computing : an area of computing focused on developing computer technology based on  the principles of quantum mechanics, a mathematical machine used to p redict the behaviours of  microscopic particles or to measure instruments created to explore those behaviours.     Recurrent neural network (RNN) : a type of artificial neural network that uses sequential or time  series data. While traditional deep neural netwo rks assume that inputs and outputs are independent  of each other, the output of recurrent neural networks depend s on the prior elements within the  sequence.     Reinforced learning : a behavioural model similar to supervised learning , but one in which the  algorithm is not trained using sample data; rather, the model learns through trial and error. The system  must iteratively test solutions independently to discard or further develop them . This process is driven  by ‘rewards’ for appropriate solutions and ‘punish ments’ for unsuccessful approaches.     Robotics : a branch of engineering encompassing  the conception, design, manufacture, and operation  of robots. This field frequently overlaps with other related fields such as electronics, computer science,  artificial intelligence , mechatronics, nanotechnology and bioengineering.     Supervised learning : a category of machine learning  in which  the AI system starts by knowing the  right answers by receiving a n input -output  pair; it must then adjust the algorithms so that the an swers  are as accurate as possible from the existing dataset , meaning that supervised learning  can calculate  an out put when given a certain input.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      14    Trade secrets : a form of intellectual property that protects confidential information that may be sold  or lic ensed. To be considered a trade secret, the information must be commercially valuable because  it is secret, be known only to a limited group of persons, and be subject to reasonable steps taken by  the rightful holder of the information to keep it secret, i ncluding the use of confidentiality agreements  for business partners and employees. In the EU, civil protection of trade secrets is regulated by  Directive (EU)  2016/943 on the protection of undisclosed know -how and business information (trade  secrets) agai nst their unlawful acquisition, use and disclosure.  Law enforcement varies depending on  the criminal laws of each Member State.     Unsupervised learning : a category of machine learning that processes a large amount of unlabelled  data without an input -output configuration and uses algorithms to extract meaningful features needed  to label, sort, and classify data in real  time, without human intervention.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      15    Executive  Summary     Background     In early 2019, the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) established an Impact of  Technology Expert Group (EG) . The group is  composed of experts with knowledge of and practical  experience in monitoring the impact of new and emerging technologies on the infringement and  enforcement of intellectual property  rights . The EG follows a specific approach based on an adaptation  of Lawrence Lessig ’s ‘Code and Other Laws  of Cyberspace’  theory  (the Code Theory) , which  describ es how human online activity is regulated by law,  social norms, and the market , taking in to  considerat ion the internet’s technical infrastructure ( referred to as  ‘code’). The Code Theory has been   adapted  by the EG in the sense that it believes all technologic al impact on intellectual property should  be considered from four angles: the market; the law; the social context;  and the technology itself .    Expert Group ’s adaptation of Lessig ’s Code Theory         The approach  followed in analys ing the impact of new technologies on  IP can be described using  the  ‘double -edged  sword’ metaphor shown in the figure below. Th e starting point is the consideration  that  the use of a particular technology  either  to infringe IP  or to protect and enforce them  presents , to some  extent , the same features in each case . This metaphor also suggests that there may be weaknesses  in the app lication of technologies on each side that can be exploited  by the other.        
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      16    The ‘double -edged sword ’ metaphor           The EG developed a unique methodology called the ‘Intellectual Property Tech Chain’, which is  described in detail in its first report, publis hed in September 2020, entitled ‘ Intelle ctual Property  Infringement and Enforcement Tech Watch Discussion Paper 2020 ’. According to this  methodology ,  the development of any application follow s four steps:     • exploration , i.e. assessing  the technology to ascertain whether it could be used to infri nge or   protect/enforce IP;     • conversion  of the technology to enable the achievement of the identified goal;     • weaponi sation , i.e. finalising  the application’s  development;     • utilisation , i.e. actual monetisation or use of  the application to infringe or protec t/enforce IP.       
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      17    The ‘Intellectual Property Tech Chain ’          In 2021, the EUIPO commissioned the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research  Institute (UNICRI) to carry out the first deep -dive research project applying this methodology in  cooper ation with the Impact of Technology Expert Group.     The current crime landscape was considered when  drafting th is study. The yearly strategic Internet  Organised Crime Threat Assessment (IOCTA)  report,  produced by Europol ’s European Cybercrime  Centre (EC3), provide s an overview of the emerging threats and developments in the cybercrime  landscape. In 2020, the highest -priority threats included social engineering, ransomware, and other  forms of malware. It is essential to consider the impact of the ‘cyber -’ element of cybercrime when  analysi ng criminal activity , since it frequently has a bearing on nearly every a spect  of this activity . In  the recent IOCTA 2021 report, Europol listed the ransomware affiliate programs using supply -chain  attacks to compromise the n etworks of large corporations and public institutions and deploy new multi layered extortion methods, overlayered mobile malware attacks, and distributed denial of service   (DDoS ) for ransom. Chapter  5 of this study will explain  how these threats are also r elevant in the  context of copyright and design s.    The development and evolution of cybercrime must  also be considered in conjunction with the misuse  of AI, including in AI -facilitated IP crime. The emerging malicious use of AI can enhance the impact of  cybercrime since it is able to perfect social engineering attacks at scale  and, among others,  it can be  used :    • for document -scraping malware to make attacks more efficient ;  • to evade image recognition and voice biometrics ;   
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      18    • to creat e ransomware attacks through  intelligent targeting , evasion,  and data pollution by  identifying blind spots in detection rules ;   • to improve blockchain capabilities in online crime.     The relevance of addressing IP crime has  also been raised as a priorit y in the current context. In May  2021, the EU’s Council of Ministers included IP crime among the top 10 priorities in the fight against  organised crime to be addressed in 2022 -2025.  On 26 May 2021 , the Council adopted  the conclusions  setting the 2022 -2025 EU priorities for the fight again st serious and organised crime  through the  European multi -disciplinary platform against criminal threats (EMPACT).     In this context, th is study aims to provid e an assessment of the impact of AI technologies on both the  infringement and enforcement of copyr ight and design s.      Methodology     The purpose of this study is to analyse the impact of AI technologies on both the infringement  and  enforcement  of copyright and design s. These have much in common with the i nfringement and  enforcement of other IPs (e.g. tra de secrets, trade  marks, and patents) through  the application of AI,  but this study will not take these other types of IP specifically into consideration.     This study is meant as a practical, practitioner -oriented tool to help understand the impact of AI a nd  put th is impact into a broader perspective. To this end, 20 scenarios have been developed to  demonstrate existing or potential misuse  of AI technolog ies to infringe copyright (and related rights)  and designs , as well as the  use of AI to enforce  these sa me rights . The focus of enforcement of the  selected IP is the application of AI in the field of law enforcement. However , there are, and will be in  the future, many relevant applications of AI that overlap or have many commonalities with voluntary  enforcem ent measures, civil enforcement, and certain aspects of administrative enforcement.     The data collection encompassed a variety of elements: a desk review study; interviews and focus  group discussions; and case analysis. At the start of the project, the EUI PO facilitated contact  with a  broad  group of experts (including the Impact of Technology Expert Group) , who were invited to  contribute to and support the research. The  researchers then contact ed other experts to supplement  the information thus obtained . 
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      19      Generally, experts were  identified based on their knowledge of and experience with AI technolog ies  themselves , the copyright and design infringement and enforcement landscape , and (in particular)   issues surrounding the application of AI in  the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s.  Many of the experts reviewed and commented on the methodology of the study, and all of them  actively supported the research, including through  participati on in group discussions  and online  interviews and, whenever possible, providing case studies .      Key findings     AI technologies have passed through different phases since the ir initial development, dating back to  the late 1940s  and early 1950s, but there is still no widely agreed -upon and precise definition of what  AI is. It is commonly understood as a subfield of computer science focus ing on developing  computer  systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence .    AI has various  capa bilities,  from sensing, reasoning, and acting to assessing and even predicting.             
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      20    AI has various subfields, each of which ha s its own  specific  aspects in addition to certain shared  elements.  These subfields pursue a number of  operational objectives, including machine learning,  natural language processing, computer vision, computer speech  and expert systems.  Quantum  computing, although it is  not necessarily linked to AI, could be used to enhance the capacity of AI  applications, while explainable AI, encompassing a set of processes and methods, enables users to  understand and trust the results generated by ML algorithms.     Against this background, t he study found that there are  multiple opportunities , drivers , limitations   and concerns  regarding the use of AI in infringement and enforcement of copyright and designs.           There are several opportunities  for AI to improve efficiency in detecting copyright and design  infringements and in enforcing copyright and design rights , since it can be used to perform a number  of different function s ranging from sensing, reasoning  and acting to assessing and even predicting.   Currently, the main areas of AI development are machine learning, natural language processing,  computer vision, expert systems, and explainable AI. Explainable AI is currently receiving increased  attention by e xperts and policy makers. Other technologies enhanced by AI , such as quantum  computing, blockchain, 3D printing, generative design, cloud services, and robotics also have great  potential. AI can identify and prioriti se risk s, instantly spot malware on a ne twork, guide incident  
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      21    response, and detect intrusions  before they occur. For example, machine learning stands out as a key  AI subfield that can be used to develop law enforcement tools such as the analysis of large amounts  of information to detect threats  and identify  social engineering bots, scanning of images to detect false  pages or illicit content, improving  automatic content recognition  (ACR ) tools, and providing insights to  find infringement patterns.     Natural language processing can be used to analys e and block cyberattacks  like phishing, identify the  behaviour of fraudsters, and create a correlation analysis aimed at promptly identifying infringements.  Computer speech and computer vision are also successfully employed in this field. Some of the ir uses  include pattern recognition to predict future infringements, detection of marketing of infringing goods,  and the detection and analysis of fraudulent logos or other images. Quantum computing could be  adopted to improve AI tools, enabling them to process larger amounts of data. For example, AI and  quantum computing  can be used by customs and law enforcement authorities to recognise patterns  within large dataset s and identify similarities. Expert systems, on the other hand , can be used by law  enforcement to  decide which strategy is more adequate to protect a system from specific  vulnerabilities, including those linked to copyright and design infringements.     As for  the drivers , the various capabilities of AI make it attractive for malicious actors. AI can emu late  many acts performed by humans and in some instances  can exceed human performance in terms of  efficiency and scalability. Moreover , certain crimes – with the support of AI technologies – can be  performed on a much larger scale, targeting thousands of v ictims simultaneously. As depicted by the  double -edged sword metaphor, the same technologies can be used both by malicious actors and for  enforcement purposes , including in the field  of copyright and design s. Fraudsters and criminal groups  employ or may employ the same AI techniques use d by enforcement agencies to overcome  cybersecurity measures and evade  detection. This is known as the ‘AI/cybersecurity conundrum ’: as  AI matures and is increasingly used in the field of cybersecurity, the potential downside s of this  technological advance increase as well. In this regard , adversarial machine learning could help to spot  and to overcome cybersecurity measures, including breaking through defences and develop ing  dynamic malware to evade detection . AI technologies  can be used to make such attacks more  efficient, as in the case of AI -supported password guessing and CAPTCHA breaking. Furthermore,  natural language processing tools can be employe d to produc e deepfake music videos , and  generative design -based tools  can be used  in the manufactur e of infringing copies.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      22    Finally, it is worth keeping in mind that  there is always  a human being behind any AI algorithm and its  practical application vectors. Explainable AI, though it does not solv e all possible issues,  could be  used by law enforcement authorities  as part of  an increased use of innovative tools – including AI – in  analysis and prediction, while at the same time better  achieving the prerequisites of fairness,  accountability and transparency. The use of AI in law en forcement and the judiciary should in any  case always be subject to strong safeguards and human oversight through built -in human control.     The current limitations  of AI include , in particular: its dependenc e on a large amount of high -quality  training data;  its inability to deal with long -tail problems (i.e. the difficulty and cost required  for AI to  achieve strong performance at the ‘long tail’ of data distribution);  its limited versatility; its dependenc e  on specifi c application scenarios; and the inherent  biases of the AI ’s developer. More powerful  machine learning algorithms can learn complex non -linear relationships between input and output  data, but to do so they require a large amount of quality data. Machines still need to understand the  world through  perceptual and cognitive learning in a more accurate manner, enabling them to simulate  real-world scenarios through reinforcement learning to perceive information and then transform th at  perceived information into abstract knowledge through attention, mem ory, and understanding. This  might be achieved through the intersection, integration, and optimi sation of algorithms and the  continuous improvement of academic study.  In addition, notwithstanding the expanded use of  innovation technologies in law enforceme nt, according to the interviews undertaken in the context of  this study the actual use of these technologies by public authorities to enforc e copyright and design s  is still generally limited.  Furthermore , law enforcement and customs authorities will need t o  continuously monitor the new technology landscape to ensure they are  properly  prepared  and trained .    Finally, the development and application of AI has raised some concerns  related to ethic s, privacy  and fundamental rights. As AI and related technologies  are used to make determinations and  predictions in areas of great importance such as combating criminality, including copyright and design related crime, AI has the potential to impact fundamental human rights in profound ways. AI algorithms  are powered b y data collected and processed by technologies that increasingly surround us at every  minute of our lives .    Many experts argue that AI algorithms must be built to align with overarching  human  goals. The EU  Parliament , in its recent Resolution of 6  October 2021 on artificial intelligence in criminal law and its  use by the police and judicial authorities in criminal matters (2020/2016(INI)),  has clearly stated that  ‘AI should not be seen as an end in itself, but as a tool, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well -
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      23    being, human capabilities and safety ’. As a result, the fundamental human right to privacy must be  duly considered when data is collected by law enforcement authorities.  Algorithms and AI should be  ‘ethical by design’, with no built -in bias, in a way that guarantees maximum protection of fundamental  rights. The EU Parliament in the same resolution invites ‘European stakeholders, including the  Member States and the Commission, to ensure, through international cooperation, the engagement  of partner s outside the EU in order to raise standards at international level and to find a common and  complementary legal and ethical framework for the use of AI ’. Policy makers are invited  to be actively  involved and to draw the legal boundaries within which these  technologies are allowed to operate.  Retroactive deconstruction of an algorithm may be required to assess the factors that influence a  model’s predictions.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      24    1 Structure , background,  and context  of the  study      As an introduction to  this study on the  impa ct of artificial intelligence technologies on the infringement  and enforcement of copyright and design s, this chapter present s the study’s structure, as well as  the  background and overall context within which it was developed .     1.1 Structure and content o f the study    The study comprises five chapters, two annexes and the bibliography. The present chapter describes  the study’s  background and context, starting from the current criminal landscape , which involves  cybercrime and organised crim inal involvement i n IP crime.  Chapter  1 also presents the ‘Intellectual  Property Tech Chain’ methodology developed by the EUIPO’s Impact of Technology Expert Group ,  which is applied in the study, and the main elements of the EUIPO ’s Strategic Plan 2025 (SP2025)  related to A I and  its work in support of the European multi -disciplinary platform against criminal threats  (EMPACT).     Chapter  2 outlines the  study’s  goals and target audience and presents its data acquisition and analysis  methodology, including 20 fictional scenarios linked to two storylines concerning copyright and  design s of physical products and digital content ; these scenarios illustrate  the infringement and  enforcement possibilities of AI.     Chapter  3 introduces the  background information relevant to understand ing the main technolog ical  concepts used in the study. In addition, this chapter describes the main ‘streams’ and techniques of  the technology that will be referred to in the fictional scenarios presented in Chapter  5 as possible  infringement and enforcement  tools. Finally, this chapter addresses the societal impact of AI  technologies to help the reader  understand the context in which these technologies operate or could  operate in the future.     Chapter  4 offers a bird’s -eye view of AI  as applied in the infringem ent and enforcement of copyright  and design s, focusing on various  relevant AI technologies. The description of each technology aims  to clarify  its meaning and scope of application, in order to facilitate comprehension of the scenarios in

Alongsi de the ‘streams’ and techniques presented in Chapter  3, these  applications of  AI  illustrate  its various elements and uses in combination with other tools.     Chapter  5 presents 20 fictional scenarios related to the  possible use of AI technologies and tools i n  the infringement and enforcement  of copyright and design s. These scenarios are based on two  storylines, one centr ing on physical products and another on digital content. Technolog ical tools were  analysed for each scenario to provi de examples of the adopt ion of AI  in both infringement and   enforcement.     The conclusion present s the k ey findings in terms of opportunities , drivers , limitations and concerns  related to the use of AI in copyright and design s. Annex  1 contain s the list of experts who agreed to  be interviewed and mentioned in the study, while Annex  2 provid es more in -depth information on  the  different aspects of AI technolog ies covered in the core text.       1.2 Current internet crime and artificial intelligence -supported crime threat landscape     The cu rrent cybercrime landscape , and the role of artificial intelligence and new technologies in illegal  activities on the internet , must  be consider ed in assess ing these technologies ’ impact on the  infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s.    AI and  other n ew technologies represent  opportunities for malicious actors , who can use them to  facilitate and enhance their attacks, exploit new victims, and creat e more innovative criminal business  models while reducing the chances of being caught  (2). The following c hapters of this study will  describe in detail AI ’s relevance to the field of IP and design infringement.     Every year, Europol's European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) produces the Internet Organised Crime  Threat Assessment (IOCTA), focusing on emerging t hreats and developments in the cybercrime  landscape.  It is essential to consider  the impact of the 'cyber -' element of cybercrime in analys ing  criminal activity , since it frequently has a bearing on nearly every a spect  of this activity .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      26    In 2020, the highe st-priority threats included social engineering, ransomware, and other forms of  malware ; Chapter  5 of this Study will show  how these threats are also relevant to copyright  and  design s. According to the IOCTA,  cybercriminals have refine d their methods , maki ng their work  available to others,  for instance, through so -called Cybercrime -as-a-Service (CaaS)  (3). Criminal  activi ty has in fact evolved  significantly  due to the  supply of  readily available data  (including personal  and other sensitive information)  and the existence of a CaaS community helping criminals to carry out  highly targeted attacks. In this context, data compromise is a central aspect of several threats. This is  also true of copyright and design infringement.     The development and evolution of cyb ercrime can also be  considered in conjunction with the misuse  of artificial intelligence, including in the AI -facilitated IP crime. In particular, the emerging malicious  use of AI can enhance the impact of cybercrime. AI can undertake social engineering at tacks at  a  larger scale ; it can be used to make  attacks by document -scraping malware more efficient; and it can  be used to  evade image recognition and voice biometrics. AI -based ransomware attacks can perform  intelligent targeting and evasion or data pollu tion by identifying blind spots in detection rules. Finally,  AI can also improve blockchain capabilities in online crime.     Law enforcement authorities, including those involved in the enforcement of IP and design s, face  several challenges. T he ability of A I to upscale criminality without physical proximity, blurring  jurisdiction and providing stronger tools for obfuscation and anonymi sation in the new criminal  structures and methods, and  the evolution of CaaS to offer  more elaborate AI -supported services , in  combination with decentrali sed blockchain solutions , are threats that need to be effectively addressed.     In the recent  IOCTA 2021  report , Europol emphasi sed that the current global pandemic has  accelerated ongoing changes cybercrime , including innovation  among cybercriminals , who have  sought  to capitalise on new opportunities. Among its key findings, Europol listed ransomware affiliate  programs  that use supply -chain attacks to compromise the networks of large corporations and public  institutions and emplo y new multi -layered extortion methods, overlayered mobile malware attacks,  and DDoS  (Distributed Denial of Service) for ransom . Criminals also use the names of well -known  Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups to scare their targets into complying with ra nsom demands.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      27    Furthermore, IOCTA 2021 recogni sed that the pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the  European online fraud landscape, where phishing and social engineering are still the principal vectors  for payment fraud  and investment fraud . However,  business email compromise (BEC) and CEO fraud  also remain key threats. In addition, dark web users are increasingly adopting anonymous  cryptocurrencies. All these elements will be further analysed in the context of copyright  and design s.    The Eur opean Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA) , in its 2021  ENISA Threat Landscape (ETL)  annual report, confirm ed EUROPOL’s findings. The ELT identified the following primary threats :  1) ransomware ; 2) malware ; 3) cryptojacking  (4); 4) email -related threats ; 5) threats against data ;  6) threats against availability and integrity ; 7) disinformation /misinformation ; 8) non-malicious threats ;  and 9) supply chain attacks  (5). Cybercriminals are increasingly motivated by monetisation, including  the monetisation of s tolen information through data auctions on the dark web and the increase d use  of ransomware. Cryptocurrency continues to be the most common payout method for threat actors.     Threats against data , frequently referred to as data breaches or data leaks , involve the release of  sensitive, confidential,  or protected data into an untrusted environment. One of the consequences of  relevant  threats against data that can be observed i s the fact that approximately 58  % of supply chain  attacks were aimed at gaining acce ss to data (predominantly customer data, including personal data  and intellectual property).  Compromise through phishing emails, and brute -forcing o f remote desktop  services (RDP) remain , according to ENISA,  the two most common ransomware infection vectors  (6).    In 2021, traditional DDoS campaigns have become more targeted, more persistent, and increasingly  multi -vector , and have been amplified by the COVID -19 pandemic . The IoT is also used as a threat  vector for DDoS. Attackers can build massive botnets to  launch DDoS attacks or distribute malware  (7).    While the threat of the criminal use and abuse of AI can be seen as overwhelming and far -reaching,  it important to stress that th is technology also provides law enforcement authorities with potentially  power ful tools , since it can enhance the current ly available  tools by providing better data management  for, inter alia,  risk analysis, open -source intelligence (OSINT) techniques, and image and text                                                   (4) Cryptojacking is a type of cybercrime where a criminal secretly uses a victim’s computing  power to generate  cryptocurrency.

The current study will th erefore  also present possi ble use s of AI technologies for the  enforcement of copyright and design s.      1.3 IP crime among the  top 10 priorities in the fight a gainst organised crime    In Europe, t he fight against IP crime is also of great importance  due to  the involvement of criminal  networks.  In May 2021, the EU’s Council of Ministers included IP crime among its top 10 priorities in  the fight against organised crime  (8) for 2022 -2025  (9), which will be addressed through the European  multi -disciplinary platform against criminal threats  (EMPACT).     The 10 priorities that have been identified for 2022 -2025 are the following:     1) high-risk criminal networks;   2) cyberattacks;   3) trafficking in human beings;   4) child sexual exploitation;   5) migrant smuggling;   6) drug trafficking;   7) fraud, economic and financial crimes ;  8) organised property crime ;  9) environmental crime ;  10) firearms trafficking .    EMPACT Priority  7 target s fraud, economic and financial crimes. It propos es, inter alia , ‘to combat  and disrupt criminal networks and criminal individual entrepreneurs involved i n IP crime and in the  production, sale or distribution (physical and online) of counterfeit goods or currencies, with a specific                                                   (8) The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime  (2000) provides an internationally agreed upon  definition of an organised criminal group as ‘a group of three or more persons existing over a period of time acting in conce rt  with the aim of committing crimes for financial or material benefit.’ This defin ition was also adopted in the EU’s Council  Framework Decision  2008/841/JHA of 24  October 2008 on the fight against organised crime.

Through EMPACT , the EU has adopt ed an integrated approach to its internal security, involving  measures that range from external border controls, police, customs and judicial cooperation to  information management, innovation, training, prevention,  and the external dimension of in ternal  security.  It began in 2010, setting the  EU’s  law enforcement priorities , with a  focus on serious and  organi sed crime. It is an intelligence -led and EU Member State -driven cooperation instrument  that  allow s Member States, agencies,  and other actors t o work closely to address key criminal threats,  using tools such as law enforcement training and joint operation s to dismantle criminal networks  and  their structures and business models.     EMPACT works with General Multi -Annual Strategic Plans (MASPs) acros s Common Horizontal  Strategic Goals for all the Operational Action Plans (OAPs) that will be implemented within each plan.  This approach aims to strengthen consistency and coherence among  OAPs as well as the multi disciplinary and multi -agency approach .    EMPACT continuously considers the role and impact of emerging technologies in its priority  assessment. In this context, the EUIPO  will be actively involved in  supporting  the implementation of  this priority within the EMPACT framework  (11).      1.4 The EUIPO’s Impact of Technology Expert Group     In 2019, the EUIPO established an Impact of Technology Expert Group  to discuss and  monitor the  influence  of emerging technologies on the protection, infringement,  and enforcement of intellectual  property  rights .    The Expe rt Group  (EG)  follows a specific approach based on an adaptation of Lawrence Lessig’s  ‘Code and Other Laws  of Cyberspace’  theory  (12), which describes how human online activity is                                                   (10) EUROPOL (2021).

Lessig’s Code Theory is applied by the EG in the sense that  it believes   all technologic al impact on IP should be considered from four angles: the market ; the law ; the social  context ; and the technology itself (see Figure  1).    Figure 1 – The EG’s adaptation of Lessig ’s Code Theory           The EG’s approach in analysing the impact of new technologies on IP can be described using the  ‘double -edged sword’ metaphor shown in the figure below. The starting point is the consideration that  the use of a particular technology either to infringe IP  or to protect and enforce them presents to some  extent the same features in each case. This metaphor also suggests that there may be weaknesses  in the application of technologies on each side that can be exploited by the other  (13).

According to th is methodology , the development of any application  of a technology  follow s  four steps  (see Figure  3 below):     • exploration , or assessment of the tech nology to ascertain whether it could be used to infringe  or protect/enforce IP;     • conversion  of the technology to enable the achievement of the identified goal;     • weaponisation , or finalisation of the application’s development;     • utilisation , or actual moneti sation or use of the application to infringe or protect/enforce IP.

The proactive approach refers to  applications  developed  to achiev e a specific goal   without respon ding to a specific threat. The reactive approach , on the other hand , refers to  applications  developed  in response to a specific threat.     In 2021,  the EUIPO commissioned the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research  Institute (UNICRI)  (15) to carry out the first deep -dive research project applying th is methodology in  cooperation with the  Impact of Technology Expert Group.

T he  EUIPO’s Strate gic Plan 2025 (SP2025)  (16) aims  to provide customer -centric services and contribut e  to a stronger IP system, efficient enforcement , and better understanding of IP rights in a global and  increasingly digital environment by building and promoting sustainable  networks, thereby supporting  competitiveness, innovation,  and creativity in the EU.     The SP2025 foresees  three  ‘strategic drivers’. The first  focuses on  an ‘interconnected, efficient and  reliable IP system for the internal market’ and  the second  is dedica ted to  ‘advanced customer -centric  services’ . The third,  entitled  ‘dynamic organisational skill sets and an innovative workplace of choice’,   includes a specific objective (Goal  3.2 – Evolving with the  Digital  Era) dedicated to innovation and  artificial intelligence , represent ing a great opportunity for businesses .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      34    Goal 3.2 seek s further opportunities for the EUIPO to harness its current AI -based solutions in  a wide  variety of business cases , including  formalities, classification, image search, goods and services  comparison , and chatbots.  To this end , machine learning, natural  language  processing  and deep  learning techniques  will be employed.  All these solutions will be  described further in Chapter  3. Quality  control  will be performed to avoid the most common pitfalls of machine learning implementation ,  namely  discrimination, vulnerability  to misuse , violation of privacy, failure to perform and lack of   explainability  (17).      1.6 AI in criminal law and its use by the police and judicial authorities in criminal matters     To conclu de this introductory chapter, it is important to emphasis e that the use of AI by police and  judicial authorities is currently the subject of much debate in Europe. In October 2021, the European  Parliament issued a resolution on AI in criminal law and its use by the police and judicial authorities in  criminal matters  (18). The resolution recogni ses AI’s strategic position and potential to generate  subst antial benefits in  terms of  efficiency, accuracy, and convenience , and to  increas e human well being, capabilities, and safety. However, it also emphasi ses the significant possible risks  that it poses   to fundamental rights and democracies based on the rule of law.     One of the resolution ’s central  consider ations  is the guarantee of fundamental rights and freedoms  throughout the life cycle of AI and related technologies, especially during their design, development,  deployment, and use . This  should apply to the  enforcement of the law under  all circumstances. This  perspective put s people at the centre , demanding an AI worthy of public trust that always works in the  service of humans . The EU Parliament resolution also  emphasises that AI systems should be  designed so that they can always be shut down by a human operator. This needs to  be accompanied  by a clear model for assigning criminal  responsibility for the potential harmful effects of AI systems,  since  regulatory provisions in this field must  always maintain hu man accountability.     The resolution emphasi ses that the use of AI in law enforcement  may entail several significant risks  to the  fundamental rights of individuals, including : opaque decision -making ; various types of                                                   (17) EUIPO (2020) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN      35    discrimination and errors inherent in th e underlying algorithm , which can be reinforced by feedback  loops ; and risks to privacy and personal data, freedom of expression and information, the presumption  of innocence, the right to an effective remedy and a fair trial, a nd individual  freedom and se curity. In  addition, AI systems used by law enforcement and the judiciary can be vulnerable to AI -powered  attacks against information systems or data poisoning. For these reasons, the European Parliament  highlights the importance of having AI systems that are safe, robust, secure,  and fit for purpose, and  that respect the principles of fairness, data minimisation, accountability, transparency, non discrimination and explainability.     The issue of how to properly collect and present evidence of the use of AI is outside the scope of this  study, as criminal law and procedure var y (sometimes significantly) among the different EU Member  States in prescrib ing how investigators and prosecutors must collect and present electronic evidence.     It is nonetheless importan t for investigators and prosecutors to keep in mind the issue of proper  electronic evidence collection and presentation when AI is involved in a criminal copyright or design  infringement case. Like other forms of electronic evidence, investigators must con sider how best to  identify and preserve digital evidence establishing how a criminal has used AI to infringe copyright  and design rights, and prosecutors must  think  strategically about how best to present this evidence  properly and effectively in court to prove that a defendant has committed criminal copyright or design  infringement. This process of identifying, preserving, and presenting electronic evidence can  certainly   be more challenging than it is with more traditional non -electronic evidence. Neverthe less, the  challenges remain  largely  the same whether the electronic evidence relates to the use of AI or any  other form of electronic evidence.  For example, investigators and prosecutors will often have to work  with digital -forensic experts regardless of t he type of electronic evidence  in question .    At the same time, investigators and prosecutors may have to identify and work with experts  in the type  of electronic evidence in question  (such as AI-related evidence) as they build and prove their criminal  copy right and design infringement cases. Therefore , investigators and prosecutors should keep  abreast  of the ways in which  the emergence of new types of technology, such as  AI, may impact how  they collect electronic evidence of the use of this technology in a criminal investigation and present  it  in court during  a criminal prosecution.      
            36 2. Scope  and methodology       The purpose of this study is to assess  the impact of artificial intelligence technologies and applications  on both the infringement and enforcement  of copyright and design s. The study target s law  enforcement officers, prosecutors , and judges, as well as policymakers,  rights holders , and civil  society,  and is meant as a practical, user -friendly , and problem -oriented tool. It aims to be easily  accessib le to an audience familiar with IP issues but without prior in -depth knowledge of AI  technologies. For this reason, 20 different scenarios have been developed to illustrate  possible  copyright and design  infringements  using  AI technologies , as well as the use of AI in the enforcement  of copyright and designs. The scenarios have been devised to be well-suited for workshop  discussion s, seminars and other means of capacity -building and networking.     AI is an emerging and disruptive technology . It has  a growing n umber of practical implications that will  profound ly affect  the protection, management, infringement , and enforcement of all types of IP.  For  the purposes of this study, the term ‘infringement’ cover s direct ly IP-infringing acts targeting  copyright  and des ign rights as well as  similarly directed  contributory and preparatory acts and other closely  related illegal acts or criminal offences (e.g. cybercriminal offences  and money laundering).     The following types  of IP are the main focus of the study:     • copyrigh t – digital content;   • copyright – applied art;   • copyright – other copyright -protected physical products;   • rights related to copyright – digital content;   • sui generis  protection of databases – digital content;   • registered Community design s – products;   • registered  Community design s – digital items;   • unregistered Community design s – products;   • unregistered Community design s – digital items;   • registered design rights in the European Union Member States (EUMS) – products;   • registered design rights in the EUMS – digital it ems.
            37   The study deliberately uses examples of works that are undisputedly protected by either copyright or  design rights  to ensure that it focuses on the use of AI to facilitate infringement or enforcement of  copyright and design rights .    The following iss ues are outside the scope of the study:     • substantive issues related to the protection of copyright and designs;   • questions about the examination of design applications;   • questions about documentation systems for unregistered rights;   • management of the rights  in question (e.g. individual and collective management of copyright  and related rights).     Nor does the study cover the topics dealt with in the study on copyright and new technologies  by the  Directorate -General for Communications Networks, Content and Tec hnology (DG CNNCT ) (19), such  as ownership of works created with AI, or AI data used in AI mining .    Significant effort ha s been made to ensur e that the study does not overlap with other research projects  and initiatives . This ensure s that its results provid e an original perspective and will provide  many  readers with  an eye -open ing survey of  a technology that is growing quickly  in importance for  business es, consumers,  and society as a whole.     The study cover s the following technologies:     • existing AI technolog ies and related applications;   • AI technologies and applications that are likely to be developed in the foreseeable future;   • quantum computing -related AI;   • combinations of AI and other emerging technologies (e.g. blockchain  and robotics )                                                  (19) EC (2020).

            38       2.1 Data acquisitio n methodology     The study relies on data and information collected  both through desk research and experts’ interviews.  The UNICRI team carried out a preliminary thorough examination of existing reports and literature  related to AI and IP  infringement - and e nforcement -related issues, as a basis for the study.     Two storylines and 20  scenarios  in which  AI is used for the infringement and enforcement of  copyright and design     For the assessment of  the possible use of AI technologies and tools in copyright and des ign  infringement  and enforcement,  the research team  has developed twenty  practical fictional scenarios   related to two main storylines, one related to physical products and the other to digital content, which  are thoroughly  presented in Chapter  5. The two s torylines  developed by UNICRI  are imaginary but   have been developed based on  actual cases  or on situations that may become possible in the near  future in  light of  current technological developments.      • Storyline  α concerns  copyright and design s of physical products  developed by a  famous  fashion company  and their infringement and enforcement  by a criminal group us ing AI to make  their criminal activities more effective;     • Storyline  b concerns  copyright and design s of digital content  developed by a famous  digital  media conglomerate , and their infringement and enforcement  by a criminal group working online   using  AI technolog ies.    The two storylines and the twenty fictional scenarios were  used as basis for the interviews  with  experts .    The infringements described in the current study are of such  a scale and nature that in one or more  EU Member States they would constitute serious offences and  would  most often be carried out by 
            39 organi sed crim inal groups  (20). In addition , in the context of the storylines and scenarios, enforcement  specifically refer s to law enforcement authorities ’ efforts against serious and organi sed crim e.      Discussions and interviews with experts     The EUIPO Observatory’s Impact of Technology Expert Grou p and other experts have been actively  involved in defining the scenarios  and in the different phases of the research. Representatives from  other departments of the EUIPO also supported the research.     UNICRI and the EUIPO organised interviews and group dis cussions with the selected experts via  video conference calls. Experts involved in the research who agreed to be acknowledged in the study  are listed in Annex  1.    The activities  shown in Figure  5 below  were  undertaken across four phases  between  March and  November 2021.

              40 3. Introduction to artificial  intelligence       This chapter presents the main  concepts  and capacities of AI and an overview of its subfields. More  in-depth information on the evolution of the technology, AI streams and layers, a nd capacities can be  found in Annex  2 Additional  information on AI’. This section  explor es the technology, descri bing  several concepts rel evant  to AI which will be used in the followin g chapters when describing its  applications in  protect ing, infringing, or enforc ing IP.      3.1 What is artificial intelligence?     3.1.1 The concept of AI     Over the course of its  evolution  (21), artificial intelligence  has been defined in different ways  (22), but  there is still no widely agreed -upon  and precise single definition of the concept .    AI is commonly understood as a subfield of computer science that focuses on the development of  computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence  (23). These  systems are designed by humans and , when given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital  dimension by :    1. perceiving  their environment through data acquisition ,  2. interpreting  the collected structured or unstructured data ,  3. reasoning  on the knowl edge, or processing  the information, derived from this data and   4. deciding  the best action(s) to take to achieve the given goal  (24).                                                   (21) See Annex  2, section  1, ‘1 Phases in  the history  of artificial intelligen ce’.  (22) See Annex  Definitions’.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              41   AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can also adapt their  behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions  (25). In the context  of this study, AI is understood  as follows  (26):    Definition of AI  used in the study     Computer code (software and hardware) that , according to algorithmic rules , dynamically adapt s as  large datasets are processed with the aim of predicting phenomena and assisting decision -making .        3.1.2. AI capacities     AI can be seen as an attempt  to simulat e certain human intelligence processes in computer systems,  particularly  learning, reasoning, planning, self -correction, problem -solving, knowledge representation,  perception, motion, manipulation, and creativity  (27). In this regard, AI systems are primarily advanced  learning systems. With the application of AI, a machine can learn to perform a tas k previously  performed by a human with li ttle or no human intervention. Some of the techniques encompassed by  AI include : advanced statistics -based machine learning algorithms and multi -task learning algorithms ;  deep learning executed  in a multiple layer n eural network (a computer framework imitating the human  brain) ; and prediction models to support decision -making and other kinds of probabilistic reasoning  that combine deductive logic with probability theory  (28).

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              42 AI can therefore  employ several  different  capacities , ranging from sensing, reasoning , and acting to  assessing and even predicting, as shown in Figure  6.    Figure 6 – AI capacities             3.1.3 AI streams     AI has been used in different areas , and can be divided into several streams depending on the   respective system ’s functioning . The various elements of AI can be combined to add numerous  features to an application , or they can be used solely to perform specific tasks. Robotics and quantum  computing are related technologies that are considered relev ant in the context of this study when used  in combination with AI streams. At the foot of the pages in this section  is a legend introducing a colour  code for the different AI streams in question .

They  can be defined as a series of instructions and rules  that a computer must follow to complete an assignment . They can be used to handle and process  data and perform ca lculations or act in various ways  (29). Algorithms are used  in AI technologies  to  calculate  and process data and to automate reasoning ; in the latter  case  they do not only follow  explicitly programmed instructions but are designed to allow computers to lear n on their own  from                                                   (29) ThinkAutomation.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              44 data examples that reflect human knowledge  (30). Algorithms used in AI can be broadly divided into  classification algorithms  and those suited to other applications  such as  regression, ranking,  and  labelling , which separate subject variab les into various classes and then predict the class for a given  input  (31).    Algorithms enabl e the development of different  AI tools that can be used to protect designs and other  IP, as well as for enforcement  purposes . Algorithms can enhance the capabiliti es of existing tools and  expand their use to other areas.       3.2 AI subfields     Artificial intelligence is divided in to various subfields, each of which has its own specific aspects in  addition to certain shared elements and pursue s different operational obj ectives. The ma jor relevant   subfields are summarised below to facilitat e understanding of the scenarios presented in Chapter  5.                                                     (30) DeAngelis, S. F.

This process allows the system to  increasingly develop beyond the data and algorithms originally  supplied  to achieve independent  development and learning based on  previous experience gained in the same manner  (33). The initial  algorithms used in  the process of programming  ML are the starting point for the development of new  algorithms, and if  the new algorithms prove more meaningful and efficient during the learning  process,                                                   (32) IBM Cloud Educat ion.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              46 the system will continue to work with them independently  (34). ML has become one of the main  elements used in AI to develop possible  copyright and design protection  tools for law enforcement, as  explained  in more detail in the scenarios presented in Chapter  5. Some of the uses of ML for  enforcement include analysis of large amounts of information to detect threats, identification of social  engineering bots, scanning of images to detect f raudulent  pages or illicit content, improving automatic  conten t recognition tools, and providing insights to find infringement patterns. On the other hand , as  will be  mentioned in the same scenarios, ML can also be used for infringement. The technology can  be used to learn from social media and create fraudulent profiles or imitate real ones, scan websites  to identify price changes and popular products, develop smart phishing attacks, automatically  eliminate watermarks , and  identify patterns to exploit personal information . It can also be combined  with computer vision to create f raudulent  registration pages and invoices .    The operation of ML follows four main steps :    1. Firstly, the training data  is prepared. This  is a dataset  representative of the data  the ML model  will process to solve the issue it is designed to addres s (35).  2. Secondly, an advanced training algorithm  is chosen to create the model.   3. Third ly, the model  is trained  to learn a specific task . Training the model  means  running data  inputs  through the algorithm to compare the output with the results it should have produced,  adjusting it so it yield s a more accurate result, and repeating the process until the algorithm  regularly returns the correct result  (36).  4. Finally, the model is used with new data to test  its accuracy and effectiveness over time  (37).    Several d ifferent types of ML and ML models can be distinguished .  • Artificial neural networks (ANNs)                                                    (34) Kreutzer, R. (2020). Op. cit.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              47 Artificial neural networks are ML models that mimic the way the human nervous system analyses  and processes information  (38). ANNs are the foundation of AI; they address  issues that would  prove almost unsolvable by human or statistical methods, and have self -learning capabilities  that allow them to generate better results as more data becomes available  (39). ANNs are based  on the functioning of the human brain , with interc onnected ‘neuron’ nodes responsible for  processing information by transmitting it towards (inputs) and away (outputs) from the brain  (40).  Processing units act as the base that is fed with inputs and outputs, while inputs are the source  from which the ANN l earns to produce the desired output  (41). Moreover, ANNs adopt a set of  learning rules called ‘backpropagation’, or backward propagation of error, to improve their  output  (42).    • Generative adversarial networks (GANs)   GANs are generative models used in ML fra meworks that can create new data instances that  resemble the training data  (43). They are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks,  pitting one against the other to generate new, synthetic items of data that can pass for real  data  (44). GANs ar e widely used to generate images, videos, and voices  (45). They can create  images that resemble real photographs of human faces even though they do not portray any  real individual  (46). GANs are also known for their role in the generation of fake media conte nt,  including the creation of ‘ deepfakes ’ (47). A deepfake is a specific type of synthetic media in  which an individual in an image or video is replaced with another’s likeness  (48) (49).

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              48   • Supervised learning   In the supervised learning process, the AI system starts by knowing the right answers, and must  then adjust the algorithms so that the answers are as accurate as possible given the existing  dataset  (50). In this case, the algorithm’s objective algorithm is already known,  and humans must  identify each eleme nt of the input data and the output variables  (51). Therefore, the algorithm is  trained on the entered data to identity the connection between the input and output data  points  (52). This type of learning requires a small  amount of training data  and facilitat es training  because  the results of the model can be compared to real labelled results. Text and image  classification  are common applications of this process  (53).    • Unsupervised learning   Unsupervised machine learning processes a large amount of unlabelled da ta and uses  algorithms to extract meaningful features needed to label, sort, and classify the data in real  time  without human intervention  (54). Unsupervised learning focuses less on the automation of  decisions and predictions  (although  in some cases it sti ll makes  predictions , e.g. to predict the  next word in a sentence)  and more on recogni sing patterns and relationships  in data that  humans would be unlikely to  identify  (55). In unsupervised learning, the system does not have  predefined target values . Theref ore, it must independently recogni se similarities and patterns in  the data  (56). To achieve this, the algorithm receives unlabelled data in which it  independently  recogni ses a structure, enabling the identification of data groups that exhibit similar behavi our  or similar characteristics  (57).    • Reinforced learning                                                    (50) Kreutzer, R.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              49 Reinforced learning is similar to supervised learning, except that the algorithm is not trained  using sample data; rather, it learns through trial and error  (58). The system must iteratively test  solutions independently to discard and/or further develop them ; at the same time, this process  is driven by ‘rewards’ for appropriate solutions and ‘punishments ’ for unsuccessful  approaches  (59). This  approach  is often adopted when only a small amount of traini ng data is  available , when the ideal outcome cannot be clearly defined , or when something can only  be learned from interaction with the environment  (60). During the reinforced learning process,  the algorithm automatically optimi ses its actions by constantly  correcting itself  (61).    • Deep learning  (DL)  Deep learning  uses special ly design ed neural networks able to process a wider range of data  resources . These networks requir e less human pre -processing  of the data  but frequently provide  more accurate results tha n other ML approaches  (62). ‘Deep’ refers to the large number of layers  in the neural network  (63). The algorithms used in DL are ANN s (see below)  requiring  large  amounts of data that go through multiple layers of calculations ; they  apply different weights a nd  biases at each successive layer to repeatedly adjust and improve the results  (64). DL models are  usually unsupervised or semi -supervised, and reinforcement learning models can also be DL  models  (65).

Rather  than interpret ing a text or speech based on its keywords, which was the previously used mechanical  method , NLP adopts a cognitive approach  by analysing  the meaning behind those words  (67). It is  therefore  the branch of AI that allows computers to under stand, interpret, and manipulate human                                                   (66) Lopez Yse, D. (2019).

NLP is a tool for content extraction , classification , machine translation , question  answering , and text generation . Subsets of NLP include natural language understanding (NLU),  concerning machine reading  comprehension , and natural language generation (NLG) , used to  transform data into words understood by humans  (69). In addition, NLP m ay use ML and DL methods  to effectively absorb and process unstructured speech and text dataset s (70).    As will be explained  in Chapter  5, NLP is also relevant for law enforcement , since it can analyse and  block cyberattacks like phishing , identify the behaviour of fraudsters , and create a correlation analysis.  NLP is also mentioned in Chapter  5 as a tool for infringement in ce rtain situations, such as the creation  of text in fraudulent emails and communications and the replication of text to create  fraudulent  registration pages for goods or other official documents.     There are several different application s of NLP.    • Text-to-speech (TTS)   Text-to-speech  is a type of speech synthesis application that generate s a spoken  audio  version  of the text in a computer document with the goal of rendering natural -sounding speech signals  for downstream  applications , including assistant devices such as  Google’s Assistant, Amazon’s  Echo, and Apple’s Siri  (71).    • Speech -to-speech (STS)   Speech -to-speech  process es a speech input to generate another speech output, for example in  translation  applications  or in digital personal assistants ’ question and an swer sequences  (72).    • Text-to-text (TTT)                                                    (68) Overby, S.

Figure 10 – Natural language processing (NLP)           3.2.3 Computer speech     Computer speech  ֎ refers to a machine’s application of  speech recognition and synthesis to creat e  human -like speech  (74). In speech recognition, the computer takes sound vibrations as inputs and uses  an analogue -to-digital converter to translate  the sound waves into a digi tal format  (75). Advanced  speech recognition in AI also includes voice recognition, in which the computer can distinguish a                                                   (73) Kreutzer, R. (2020). Op. cit.

AI is used in different areas related to the imitation of human speech ,  for example, speech recogniti on and translation; furthermore, several speech recognition applications  are powered by automatic speech recognition  and NLP  (77). Automatic speech recognition is the  conversion of audio to text , while  NLP refers to the processing of text to determine its m eaning  (78). In  Chapter  5, the use of computer speech  for infringement can be observed in the imitation of existing  voices and designs. However, it  can also be used  for enforcement , for instance  in identif ying online  marketing of infringing products.       3.2.4 Computer vision    Computer vision  ֎ refers to  the processing of signals that represent images,  training computers  to interpret and understand the visual world  (79). It follows three main steps :    1. the system acquires an image  for analysis  in real  time through video, photos or 3D technology ;  2. it process es the image through a previously trained model  (80);  3. it understands the image through an interpretative process  (i.e. it implements the model to  perform a specific task)  in which  an object is identified or classified  (81).    Computer vision  can be u sed in the segmentation  of images  for separate examination , advanced  object detection , facial recognition , detection of the outside edge of an object or landscape for  better identi fication  of the content , pattern detection , image classification , and featur e matching  (82).  Computer vision can provide various support tools  for enforcement, as will be shown  in the scenarios  in Chapter  5. Some of its uses include pattern recognition to predict future infringement, detection of                                                   (76) Horowitz, J. H. (2020). Op. cit.   (77) Horowitz, J.

The use  of computer vision for infringement is also described  in the scenarios,  as it can enable the copy ing of  popular  product  designs, colo urs and shapes, and detect and replicate patterns in visu al anti counterfeiting technology. In addition, it can be combined with other technologies  to create  fraudulent  registration s or invoices.     Computer vision not only enable s systems to derive meaningful information from visual inputs, but  also allows them t o take action or make recommendations based on that information  (83).  Convolutional neural network s (CNN s) and DL are used  for this purpose  (84). DL uses algorithmic  models to allow the computer to teach itself about the context of visual data, while CNN s help the DL  model to ‘see’ by dividing the images into labelled pixels  (85). The neural network iteratively assesses  the accuracy of the predictions until the predictions start to come true, allowing  the computer to  recogni se images in a way similar to humans  (86).

Quantum comput ing is not  necessarily linked to AI, but could be used to enhance the capacity of AI applications. Every computer  application is composed of ‘bits’ in some combination of ones and zeroes  (87). An ordinary computer  uses  micro chips  on which transistors act as  switches  that can either be in the ‘off’ position  (represented by a zero) or the ‘on’ position (represented by a one)  (88). Quantum computers use                                                    (87) Katwala, A. (2020).

Dataset s are becoming larger and more complex, placing considerable strain on current computer  systems . A number of issues related to problem -solving and capability restrictions are expected to be  solved in seconds through  the use of quantum computing . Certain technologies, such as AI , and in  particular ML, can benefit from progress in quantum computing  (90).    At present, nearly all the industrial applications of AI are based on supervised learning, and are used  for image re cognition or consumption forecasting. In the area of finance, AI and quantum computing  can help improve fraud detection.  Moreover, quantum computing -trained models could be used to  detect patterns  that would be almost undetectable with conventional equipme nt. Finally , the  acceleration of algorithms could allow machines to handle  high volume s of data  (91).    In the scenarios in Chapter  5, quantum computing is mentioned as a technology that could improve  AI tools, enabling them to process larger amounts of data . For example, AI and quantum computing  can be used by customs and law enforcement authorities to recognise patterns in large dataset s and  identify similarities. On the other hand, the same capabilities can be used to improve  tools used for   infringement.                                                                  (89) Katwala, A. (2020). Op. cit.

An ES uses specific kno wledge about  its domain of application and adopts an inferential procedure to solve issues that would  normally   require  human expertise  (93).

ESs are based on ‘knowledge engineering ’, in which knowledge about  the specific domain is acquired from human experts and other sources  (95). The main feature of an ES  is the accumulation of knowledge in its databases, from which conclusions are gene rated by the  inference engine  (96). Areas of application include classification, diagnosis, monitoring, process  control, design, scheduling and planning, and option generation  (97). Expert systems also provide  valuable tools to minimi se the risks presented i n the scenarios in Chapter  5, as they can help law  enforcement authorities  to decide which strategy is mo st adequate to protect a system from specific  vulnerabilities.

XAI can  be defined as AI that produces details or reason ing to make its functioning clear or easy to  understand  (99). It describe s an AI model, in addition to its expected impact and potential biases  (100).  Furthermore, XAI helps to determin e a model’s precision, fairness, transparency,  and results in AI based decision making  (101).    One of the challenges in the development and implementation of AI is that humans need to  comprehend and retrace how the algorithm arrives at  an output , a calculation known as a ‘black box ’,  which  is almost impossible to interpret  (102). Black box models a re derived directly from the data, and  not even the  algorithm’s  creators can fully comprehend or explain what exactly the algorithm does  or  how it obtain s a specific result  (103).    Full understand ing of  how an AI -enabled system has arrived at  a specific outp ut is extremely useful,   since it can help developers  to ensur e that the system operates as expected, which may  be required  if the system is  to meet regulatory standards . Explainability  may also  be essential in allowing those  affected by a decision to chall enge or change th e outcome  (104).    XAI can be used in the scenarios in Chapter 5 to better understand the ML process es used in different  tools  and consequently to  improve th ose tools. However, XAI can also be used by  infringers to  understand  and improve  their own  tools.                                                    (98) IBM. (n.d.).

The impact of AI on our society has had, and will in the near future have, far-reaching  economic, legal, political and regulatory implications  (107). These new technolog ies will transform  societies in areas such as  safe transport, mobility, security, health, media content recognition, service   quality , and employment  (108). The s ocial impact s of AI will clearly affect  the economy and the labour   force . The present study will focus on  AI technologies ’ impact  on crime, law enforcement and criminal  justice, taking into account the  relevant ethical  and fundamental rights -related issues  (including data  protection and privacy concerns). Further observations  on these issues are provi ded in Annex  .    In the E uropean Union, the discussion around AI and its various implications is very lively and has  resulted in a number of EU Parliament resolutions. At the global level, the United Nations has put in  place a number of important initiatives related to AI’s role in sustainable development. While AI  technologies may support breakthroughs in achieving the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs), they may also have unanticipated consequences that will exacerbate inequalities and  negatively affect  individuals, societies, economies and the environment  (109).      3.4 The EC’s proposal for AI regulation     Finally , this chapter will conclude with an overview of  current legal initiatives around AI in the EU. The  European Commission is in the process of taking  important regulatory steps in this field . The E U  overall approach to AI aims to ensure that any AI improvements are based on rules that safeguard  the functioning of markets and the public sector, and people’s safety and fundamental rights , as                                                   (106) DBI (n.d).

In 2020, the EC’s white paper on ‘AI  – A European approach to excellence and trust ’ set out policy options on promoti ng AI while  addressing the risks associa ted with certain uses  (111). In 2021, the EC published a proposal for a  regulation laying down harmonised rules on  AI. The proposal aims to develop an ecosystem of trust  by proposing a legal framework for reliable AI, based on the EU’s values and fundamental  rights , to  give people the confidence to embrace AI  and encourag e its development by businesses  (112).    The proposed legal framework , which is still under discussion,  addresses the risks posed by  the  various uses of AI systems while at the same time promoti ng innovation, recognising  the need to  preserve individual safety and fundamental rights without overly inhibiting AI innovation. To this end,  a risk -based approach is suggested  (113). The gradation of risks is represented as a four -level pyramid :  unacceptab le risk s, high risk s, limited risks, and minimal risk s; further information is available in  Annex  .    In 2021, the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence 2021 Review  puts forward a concrete set of   joint actions for the European Commission and Member States on how to create EU global  leadership  on trustworthy AI (114).

The EU Security Union Strategy 2020 outline s the main priorities for improving internal security.  These include strengthening the provision of data services in the areas of border surveillance  and maritime security.     All these po licy and regulatory measures will affect  the development and use of AI and related  technologies by private -sector actors as well as law enforcement and customs agencies, including in  the area s of copyright and design enforcement .

A bird’s-eye view of AI applied in infringement and  enforcement of copyright and design       This chapter will provid e a bird s-eye view of the various AI technologies that have been found relevant  to this study. They are presented  briefly,  without technical explanation s of precisely how they are built  or how they  function ; rather , the purpose is to clarify their meaning and scope of application and allow  a proper understanding of the fictional scenarios in Chapter  5.     The weaponisation and monetisation of AI also feature in the following sections , since the  development of AI tools and their use both to protect and infringe IP can be observed in the  subseque nt examples and scenarios. It is must be emphasised  that AI and related technologies are  tools . They are  neither  good nor bad  in themselves . Rather, i t is the use of these  technologies that  determines whether they are beneficial or harmful . ‘Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it  neutral’ (116). The legend at the foot of the page  links the different technologies presented in this  chapter with the AI streams introduced in Chapter  3.    The listing of t echnologies below is not meant to suggest  any rank ing in terms of frequency or  seriousness .      ֎֎  4.1 AI-supported malware     Malicious software , or ‘malware’ is software designed  to carry out  an unauthori sed  process that will adverse ly affect  the privacy , integrity, or accessibility  of an information                                                   (116) Kranzberg M.

The use of AI to improve the effectiveness of malware is still in an experimental  phase , but its  monetisation and weaponization are  expected to increase in the near future:  AI-supported and AIenhanced cyberattack s that have been studied are proof that criminals are already taking steps to  broaden the ir use of AI  (119). Artificial Intelligence  can be used maliciously to control malware in order   to creat e more convincing spam, evade detection , and better adapt itself to each target  (120).  Cybercriminals might be able to determine how AI-powered security software identif ies malware,  enabling them to  adapt t heir own software and  easily evade detection . In some cases , the samples  can be modified to trick the AI into flagging legitimate files as malware, triggering false positives  (121).    AI-supported malware could be integrated in to a variety of  techniques  to enhance their negative  impact : chang ing the malware’s behaviour and characteristics based on context, eliminating itself  when it suspects it is being analysed, and performing malicious activities only on specified  systems  (122). Furthermore, malware prog rammers could train security solutions that use ML to  preserve certain malicious files or to produce false positives . Specifically , AI malware might be used  to (123):    1. solve the CAPTCHA  authentication method  (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell  Computers and Humans Apart) using ML (124);                                                   (117) For more information see CERN.

This last approach is kno wn as ‘deep targeting’, which usually  refers to techniques used in marketing  to learn the behaviours, habits, and values of a person or group in order to create successful  advertising campaigns  (126). As illustrated in the previous examples, cybercriminals c an use this end user behavioural analysis (UBA) to learn user conduct and blend into their targets’ environment  (127).  UBA technology searches for patterns of usage indicating unusual or anomalous behavio urs (128).  However,  anti-malware security measures can a lso be improved  by adopting AI tools such as ML.  Beyond adding malware samples to security software, AI can also detect future versions and similar  variants of the same malware , as it enables the evaluation, organisation,  and condensation of threat  variant s (129). In this case, AI must  be continuously supervised and adjusted by humans , since if the  ‘weave’ of the neural net is too wide, malware may evade detection , and if it is too fine, the security  solution may trigger false positives  (130).    AI-supported mal ware is one of the infringement -related issues mentioned in the scenarios in  Chapter  5, due to its role in the use of fake identities in phishing attacks and the creation of false  documents. The complexity of the attacks performed with AI -supported malware  can itself be targeted  by specialised law enforcement units using AI tools such as ML, as described in the scenarios.

Cloud  computing services have increasingly become the target  of attacks,  as they store  large amount s of company and user data, and some companies also  use them to  operate consumer  services such as email and photo libraries  (132).    Existing types of cloud application services include Infrastructure -as-a-Service (IaaS), which allows  the us er to pay for services based on usage , and frequently covers  the rental of storage, networks,  operating systems, servers,  and virtual machines (VMs)  (133) (134). Another type is Platform -as-aService (PaaS), which was created to facilitate web creation and mob ile app design by providing an  inbuilt infrastructure of servers, networks, databases , and storage that is automatically updated and  managed  (135). Finally, Software -as-a-Service (SaaS) is a type of cloud application service in which   the cloud provider perfo rms management and maintenance tasks  (136).    The role of cloud services  in AI  can be seen in t certain machine learning tasks such as batch  processing, serverless computing,  predictive analytics,  and orchestration of containers  (137). Other AI  services in this  category include text analytics, speech, vision, and translation . Furthermore , the use                                                   (131) Griffith, E. (2020).

This way , issues such a s the need to find the appropriate  algorithm or the correct training model are eliminated  (140).    The use of c loud services in AI can provide an additional mechanism to improve  and facilitate use of   the tools described in the scenarios in Chapter  5, due to their role in the automation of various tasks.  Conversely, however , the adoption of cloud services can also improve  infringement tools that might  be developed.       ֎  4.3 AI in generative design     Generative design is a design exploration process in which designer s or engineers  select specific goals to add to the generative design software, along with selected  parameters including performance or spatial requirements, materials, manufacturing  methods, and cost constraints  (141). After receiving the se inputs, the softw are analyses  all the possible permutations of a solution to develop and suggest design alternatives . During this  process, the software also tries and learns from each iteration to identify wh ich strategies and  combinations work, and which ones do not  (142).    In this way, AI in generative design can quickly produce a large number  of concepts that are adapted  to the  project’s  requirements. In traditional design , the process usually starts with a model based on  an engineer’s or designer’s knowledge . However, in generative design, design parameters are                                                   (138)For more information see: Botelho, B. (2018).

Generative design allows the  creation of precisely optimi sed and customi sed design solutions and can solve  various  engineering  challenges, such as how to make product components lighter, stronger, or more cost -effective  (144).  Generative design has great potential in the development of tools that improve and facilitate the design  process; however, as described  in Chapter  5, it can also be used for infrin gement when adopted by  criminals.       ֎֎֎  4.4 AI in robotics     An industrial robot is an automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose  manipulator, prog rammable in three or more axes, which can be either fixed in place or  mobile for use in industrial automation  (145). In general, a robot is any machine that can be u sed to  perform complex actions and tasks automatic ally; specifically, robotics relates to the automation of  physical tasks  (146).    Robotics can integrate some sub-fields of AI: for example, ‘smart robots ’ adopt ML to improve the ir  performance  progressively  (147). Robots that incorporate AI are usually able to automate far more tasks  than purely robotics -based technologies  (148). The autonomy of a robot in its surroundings can be  classified into different subdivisions such as perceiving, planning,  and executi ng (i.e. manipulating,  navigating,  and collaborating)  (149). One of the main objectives of using AI in robotics is to optimise the                                                   (143) Formlabs. (n.d.).

In the scenarios in Chapter  5, AI in robotics is mentioned  as a means  of optimi sing the mass production of infrin ging products and the processes in their supply  chain . The benefits of adopting AI in robotics could  also be used by infringers to develop tools to  automate certain tasks. However, it is also a valuable tool for future improvements in the general  security of the manufacturing process, including the creation of unique visual identities for products to  identif y original goods.       ֎֎  4.5 Smart devices and AI   A ‘smart device ’ is a context -aware electronic device capable of performing  autonomous computing and connecting to other devices through a wire or wirelessly  to exchange data  (151). Therefore, smart  device  technology  may be applied to  various objects  such as  simple sensor nodes, home appliances and smartphones  (152). Smart devices are essential for the  development of other technological advances such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities.     The key characteristics of AI as used  in smart devices are context -awareness, device connectivity  and autonomy  (153). ‘Context -awareness ’ is the ability of a system or one of its component s to obtain  data about its environment at any moment and adapt its behaviour accordingly . ‘Autonomous  compu ting’ refers to  a device or devices that carry out tasks autonomous ly without the direct control  of the user, while ‘device connectivity ’ refers to a  device that can  connect to a data network  (154). In  other cases, such as the integration of AI in the  IoT, a pplications include components like smart                                                   (150) Andreu Perez, J., Deligianni, F., Ravi, D., & Yang, G.

The combination of AI and the  IoT also allows systems to be predictive, prescriptive, and autonomous . The continuous evolution of  emerging app lications will enable IoT sensors to collect a vast amount of data, while AI can aid in  deriving intelligence to devis e smarter applications for a smarter world  (156). Smart devices may in the  future be part of the infrastructure used in the technology prese nted in the scenarios  in Chapter  5,  since it equips regular devices with additional capabilities, increasing the  technology’s  potential.  However, smart devices could also be employed  by infringers.            ֎֎֎֎  4.6 AI-enhanced supply chain     Artificial intelligence  is also increasingly  being  used to improve supply chain  operation s and make them more  cost-effective through  its integrat ion into supply  chain management solutions and related management information s ystems  to  enhance automation and provide better visibility into static, real -time data  (157). In addition to  implementing fully automated decision -making, AI systems can adapt diverse types of cognitive  computing to improve cooperation between artificial and  human intelligence  (158). Furthermore, AI based tools can help  to automate other stages in the supply chain , such as demand forecasting,  production planning, and predictive maintenance  (159).    AI-driven tools can be adapted to diverse aspects of the supply ch ain, including inventory  management , to analyse and interpret datasets ; warehouse administration ; worker and material                                                   (151)Liaqat, S., Ullah, S., Dashtipour, K., Zahid, A., Ars had, K., Assaleh, K., & Ramzan, N.

On top of this , AI will drastically transform  supply chain  decisions  by using ad vanced analytics and modelling techniques to help decision -makers  evaluate alternatives against complex and dynamic threats and constraints  (161).    Among its other uses , AI can be used in adaptive robotics , processing  Internet of Things (IoT) device  informat ion and a large amount of structured and unstructured data to  help robots  learn and make  autonomous decisions  (162). Other AI appli cations,  such as natural language processing tools , have  been develop ed to process human speech and react accordingly . Predicti ve analytics are being used  in the fields of  responsiveness, inventory and network optimi sation, preventative maintenance,  and  digital manufacturing  (163). Complex coordination performance can be achieved using search and  pattern recognition algorithms, whic h are designed to analyse real -time data, enabling supply chains  to respond to machine -generated, augmented intelligence while increasing visibility and  transparency  (164). Visibility refers not only to the internal aspects of the supply chain, but also to  visibility among partners, which allows collaborative decision -making  (165).    ML might also be used in  making  baseline forecasts for new products, identifying changing demand  behaviours, optimi sing inventory levels, and managing product life  cycle s (166). It might apply  algorithms to large operational data feeds to identify insights that enable the tracking and prediction  of supply chain disruptions, recommending  alternative actions in unexpected circumstances such as   transport disruptions  (167). In other areas su ch as manufacturing, AI -based collaborative robots can  perceive the ir environment and move safely around human s work ing alongside them in  production  (168).

In the  scenar ios in Chapter  5, expert systems are used to optimi se and, in some cases, automate the  decision -making process in the supply chain. These scenarios also show  how A I can be used in the  supply chain for infringement. For example, AI in robotics can be used t o optimi se the mass production  of infringing products and the processes in their supply chain.       ֎֎  4.7 AI in 3D printing   The 3D printing or additive manufacturing (AM)  process  begins with a digital file , in  which the item to be printed is using either 3D printing software or a 3D scanner. This digital file is  then exported to a 3D printer, which uses ded icated software to assemble the digital model into a  physical object by building liquid material up in layers that then harden until the finished object  emerges.  (169).3D printing makes it technically possible to replicate nearly any object, with or without  the authori sation of those who hold the rights to it  (170).    There are various  possible benefits of 3D printing for innovation -intensive companies . It allow s them  to reduce  their overheads when creating, designing , and testing new items or improving existin g ones.  In addition, the technology can be used to avoid paying for expensive prototypes , since it can quickly  and cheaply produce multiple iterations of complex components using in-house 3D printers  (171). 3D  printing is a complex process, and AI could impr ove it considerably and make it even more efficient.  The combination of AI and 3D printing could lead to new applications of the additive manufacturing  technology , and more  (172).

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              74 AI can be used in 3D printing as part of  machine  vision and machine  learning systems. A multi -material  inkjet 3D printer can use a vision system that extensively scans each layer of the object while it is  being printed to correct errors in real  time; at the same time , an ML system can use that information  to predict the warping beh aviour of materials and create more accurate final products  (173). Machine  learning can be used in additive manufacturing  in several ways , including creating design s for 3D  printing, tuning material s, optimising process es, carrying out in situ  monitoring, and providing c loud  service s and cybersecurity  (174). Moreover, ML data -driven models based on the understanding of the  physical processes involved in 3D printing is essential , since these processes can then be optimis ed  using  incomplete or partial information  (175). These  data-driven models can also outperform  timeconsuming physics -based modelling and detect anomalies during in -process monitoring for quality  control. In addition, ML affects  other elements of 3D printing, such as the design  and fabrication  proce sses, qualification, and logistics  (176).    Customs  agencies’  scanning processes could be improved by implementing 3D and penetration  scanners adapted to large objects , or by applying nanotech. Customs inspections could also focus on  inspecting, detecting and  controlling the distribution of the most  popular 3D printing  materials,  such  as plastic pellets. Shipping of these materials is nevertheless expected to drop as the world adopts a  ‘circular economy ’ paradigm where materials are recycled and sourced  locall y. Nanocodes could be  integrated into CAD files and used to track 3D -printed objects , allowing authorities to determine a  product’s  authentic ity easily  (177). AI in 3D printing is a technology with potential in different areas,  including in sensitive situati ons such as th ose described in the scenarios in the following chapter.  However , it can also be used by criminals to facilitate the creation of infringing goods.                                                      (173) Winn, Z. (2019).

The main features of blockchain  include  (179):    • immutability : there is a p ermanent record of transactions , and o nce a block is added, the  transaction record cannot be altered ;  • decentrali sation : the blockchain is s tored in a file that can be acces sed and copied by any  node on the network ;  • consensus : each block on the blockchain is  independently  verified independently by  validating consensus models ;  • transparency : the full transaction history is available, since  any party can access the  blockchain an d audit transactions.     The combination of AI and blockchain technology can be mutually beneficial . Both AI and blockchain  use data in diverse ways  and are particularly  useful in  processing and analysing  a large amount of   data using different tools  (180). Both AI and blockchain act upon data in various  ways ; therefore , their  combined use takes the manipulation of data to new levels. At the same time , the integration of  ML  and AI into blockchain , and vice versa , can strengthen blockchain’s  underlaying architect ure and  enhance the capacity of AI. Blockchain can be used to make AI more understandable and coherent,                                                   (178) Assemblée Nationale. (2018).

In this case, the ledger in  blockchain can record all data and variables invol ved in ML decision -making  (181).    Specific applications of AI and blockchain  (182) can be observed in the following areas (for more  information , see Annex  ):    • increasing smart computing power ;  • creating diverse dataset s;  • data protection ;  • data moneti sation ;  • ensuring trustworthy AI decision -making .    The use of blockchain and AI can be seen in some of the scenarios in Chapter  5, in which the  technology is used to protect unique identifiers and other relevant product informat ion, and to protect  registered designs in databases, which can then be shared with law enforcement. However, this  combination of technologies can also be used for infringement, for example in AI-based cyberlockers,  online -based data hosting services that p rovide remote file -storing and file -sharing services for various  types of files and data within a secure storage architecture (183), and AI -supported blockchains that  can evade detection.

Copyright and design  infringement and  enforcement scenarios       This chapter will show how AI technologies and tools may be weaponi sed to facilitate copyright and  design infringement, as well as how law enforcement may use these  technologies to detect or defend  against such infringement.  These competing uses of AI are a nalysed  below through fictional scenarios  elaborated by the research team. These scenarios reflect the ‘Intellectual Property Tech Chain ’ cycle,  in which the exploration of AI as a technology is used as a base  from which  to analyse the use of that  technolo gy in develop ing an application ( ‘weaponisation ’) to achieve a goal ( ‘monetisation ’), whether  this is infringement or  enforcement.     Each scenario is based on a thorough analysis of international references on the topic and was  discussed with several intern ational experts and with the members of the ad -hoc supporting Expert  Group (see Annex  1 List of experts and stakeholders involved in  the studyAnnex  ). However, t he 20 scenari os only cover examples of potential uses of  AI for infringement  and enforcement  and are not exhaustive .    To illustrate more clearly  how AI tools can be used in practice for infringement or enforcement of  relevant  IP, two main storylines were created : one concerning  physical products and the other  involving digital content. This structure divides the 20 scenarios into two groups of 10, one group for  each storyline.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              78 The two storylines are fictional, 184 but have been developed based on existing situations or s ituations  that may be on the horizon given the pace of current technological developments. In particular:     • Storyline α  concerns the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of physical  products (see paragraph 5.1 Storyline  α: infringement and enforcement of physical  product copyright and design s);    • Storyline  b concerns the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of digital  content (see paragraph 5.2 Storyline  b – infringement and enforcement of copyright and  design s of digita l content )      5.1 Storyline  α: infringement and enforcement of physical product copyright and design s    This section analyses the use or potential use of AI technologies in 10 scenarios involving  the  infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of physical products. Storyline  α, described  below , provides the context for the se scenarios.     toryline α: a European clothing, accessories and cosmetics company and the  organi sed crime group that seeks to infringe the company’s copyrights and design  rights.     A well -known European clothi ng, accessories and cosmetics company,  Marcoriana Vittaria  (MarcVit), has developed a new clothing line called ‘Artsters ’ that takes original artistic  expressions and places the m on never -before -seen designs for shirts and dresses. This                                                   184 Since the storylines and relevant scenarios  are fictional, their content may not be  applic able or realistic in all jurisdictions,  and will depend o n the specific mandate and role assigned to law enforcement and other authorities involved in IP  enforcement.

A sophisticated organi sed crim inal group called ‘OMD’ has learned that M arcVit plans to laun ch its  new clothing line, and OMD intends to make and to sell its own infringing version of Artsters  products.     This storyline will be examined through  the following 10 scenarios:     1. theft of copyrightable work or design under development   2. design registration  fraud   3. mass production of copyright and design -infringing goods   4. importation of copyright and design -infringing goods   5. physical market ing of copyright and design -infringing products – infringer -controlled shop   6. physical market ing of copyright and design -infringing products – third-party -controlled shop   7. trade dress infringement   8. online marketing of copyright and design -infringing products – infringer controlled e -shop   9. online marketing of copyright and design -infringing products – sales on third -party marketplace s  (surface web)   10. online marketing of copyright and design -infringing products – sales on third -party marketplaces  (dark web).      5.1.1  Theft of copyrightable work or design under development     OMD has learned from a Marcoriana Vittaria (M arcVit) insider that MarcVit plans to launch its new Artsters   clothing line in 6 months. OMD intends to use AI technologies to steal M arcVit’s copyrightable artwork and  innovative shirt and dress designs while they are still under development and, importantly, before M arcVit  has the chance to make the Artsters  clothing line available to consumers.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              80 To accomplish this goal, OMD uses AI to conduct reconnaissance to identify who it perceives as the  weakest and best -placed employee most likely to be duped by a phishing email, such as the executive  assistant to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO)  of MarcVit. OMD then uses AI to optimi se a spear phishing  attempt to obtain the CEO’s email login and password. Once OMD has the ability to send and receive  emails from the M arcVit CEO’s email  account, it sends an email to the head of M arcVit’s design team to  obtain the designs for the new Artsters  clothing line.     OMD also uses another tactic. It has obtained AI-based software from a Crime-as-a-Service group that  allows the user to generate any  statement using an almost perfect ( ‘deepfake’) copy of someone’s voice.  Using this software, OMD generates a deepfake version of the CEO’s voice and leaves a voicemail with  MarcVit’s design team  lead asking her to email the new Artsters  designs to an emai l account under OMD’s  control. OMD then stores the stolen designs on an encrypted hard drive.     For its part , MarcVit is concerned about criminals who may seek to steal its original artwork and new shirt  and dress designs before the Artsters  clothing line i s released for sale. For this reason, M arcVit is looking  for ways to work with law enforcement to use AI as an enforcement tool to prevent the pre -release theft of  its new clothing line.     OMD’s efforts are successful , but law enforcement investigates the c ase and executes a search warrant  to obtain OMD’s encrypted hard drive. Law enforcement then uses AI -based technology to break the  encryption on OMD’s hard drive and retrieve the files containing the stolen M arcVit Artsters  designs.     AI tools used for infr ingement:  ֎֎֎    • Reconnaissance is an AI -supported machine learning technique  (see   •   • 3.2.1 Machine  learning (ML) ) that learn s from social media profiles , in this case  by analy sing  the communication style of the execut ive assistant to the CEO of M arcVit. By collecting this data 
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              81 using such an AI tool, OMD c an weaponi se ML to create an alias of an individual  trusted by  MarcVit .    • AI technologies can be weaponised to make phishing, hacking and brute force attacks more  efficient. For example, natural language processing (see 3.2.2 Natural language  processing  (NLP) ) can be adapted to create text, including coherent paragraphs. This NLP generated text can then be used to create false ema ils and written communications based on  existing information, which OMD could obtain either from open -source data or by scanning the  email communications of the CEO ’s assistant  and the CEO.     • Even if the phishing attempt fails, AI -supported hacking, AI -supp orted password guessing, and  AI-supported CAPTCHA breaking can easily  be used to predict the correct password and enable  OMD to enter the CEO’s email account. This AI technology  can also be weaponised  to predict  updates to passwords.     • Deepfakes of someone’ s voice (like the CEO’s voice in this scenario) can be generate d by AI  generative adversarial networks (see   •   • 3.2.1 Machine  learning (ML) ).    • Machine learning algorithms and computer speech  (see 3.2.3 Computer speech ) can  also be used by OMD to imitate the CEO’s voice, thereby mi sleading the M arcVit designer. Deep  neural networks , in particular , can be used to recogni se patterns in speech.     AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎    • Machine learning, and in particular supervised learning, can be converted into a functional  application by law enforcement to break the encryption used by OMD. In addition, deep learning  algorithms, specifically convolution neural networks (CNN), might  be used to classify encryption 
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              82 schemes and solve some of the limitations of ML such as the ability to perform an accurate  cryptanalysis  (185).    • In addition, M arcVit could fortify its cybersecurity efforts with AI by using ML to quickly analyse  millions of e vents and identify many different types of threats: for instance, NLP -enabled filters  can classify and analyse emails to block phishing attacks. This information can then be provided  to law enforcement in support of their investigation.     • AI bots could also  be employed by M arcVit to crawl  the web to help identify and detect social  engineering bots that are targeting M arcVit. These AI bots are self -learning software applications  that are programmed with natural language processing and machine learning tools. In the  framework of a targeted investigation, a specialised law enforcement department could employ  a similar tool and approach.       5.1.2  Design registration fraud     Two types of design registration fraud scenarios are presented below .    5.1.2.1  Design regis tration fraud where the registration itself is fraudulent     MarcVit intends to register the original shirt and dress designs that will eventually be included in its Artsters   clothing line. However, after stealing MarcVit’s original shirt and dress designs, OMD hopes to fraudulently  register the designs as its own with a national  intellectual property office (IP Office).     OMD intends to use AI technologies to ‘trick’ the IP Office into believing that MarcVit’s original designs  were actually created by OMD.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              83 However, the IP Office plans to use AI technologies of its own to identify and stop fraudulent design  registrations.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎֎    • Generative adversarial networks and computer vision tools  (see 3.2.4 Computer vision)  can be weaponi sed by OMD to produce a fake appplication for registration, replicating very  similar applications filed by M arcVit and others  in order  to trick the IP Office. In particular, a  natural language processing tool could  replicat e the text of the original applications. Generative  modelling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that automatically acquir es  information about regularities or patterns in input data to generate new examples that were  based on the o riginal information  (186).    AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎    • Machine learning can be used by the IP Office to create a system that detects if someone is  attempting to re -register a previously registered design. GANs could also be trained to determine  if a part or parts of several original designs are being combined to create a spurious ‘new’ design.     • AI-supported blockchain (see AI and Blockchain  can be used by the IP Office to protect the  information in a registrati on system from vulnerabilities. In fact, blockchain’s cryptography and  immutability provide an additional security layer.     • In general, intellectual property offices responsible for national design registrations can u se deep  learning and convolutional neural networks to analyse and recognise visual imagery in order to                                                   (186) Brownlee, J.

The model could be optimi sed to identify infringement  even if the image is taken from a different angle.       5.1.2.2  Design registration fraud where the  registration invoices are fraudulent     MarcVit registers its original shirt and dress designs with a national IP Office (“IP Office”). When the time  comes for MarcVit to renew its design registrations, MarcVit must pay a renewal fee to the IP Office.   Know ing this, OMD sends MarcVit an invoice that looks like it came from the EUIPO, but includes a  payment address that OMD controls, so that OMD, rather than the IP Office, receives MarcVit’s re registration fee.     The IP Office has learned about this type of d esign registration fraud scheme and uses AI technologies to  anticipate when certain design registrants, like MarcVit, are being targeted by groups like OMD. It warns  MarcVit and other registrants of OMD’s fraud scheme and reiterates the proper address to w hich OMD  should send the re -registration fees.  MarcVit makes the information available to law enforcement.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎֎    • Machine learning with pattern recognition and computer vision tools can be used by OMD to  produce a fake re -registration invoice virtually identical to the original issued by the IP Office.     • Natural language processing can be weaponised  by OMD to create text that resembles an  authentic invoice or other ‘official’ document.     AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎    • NLP-enabled filters can classify and analyse emails received by MarcVit to block phishing  attacks. This information can be shared by MarcVit with the IP Office, which can then increase

M arcVit is concerned that infringer s may produce copyright and design -infringing versions of their  new line before the y are released to the public .    OMD wants to use AI technolog ies, including AI -supported robotics, to optimi se its own illegal manufacture  of infringing versions of the copyr ight-protected artistic works and unique clothing designs that make up  MarcVit’s Artsters  clothing line.     MarcVit has alerted law enforcement to its concerns, and law enforcement intends to use AI technologies   to stop criminal groups like OMD from mass -producing infringing copies of the Artsters  clothing line.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎֎    • Generative design -based tools (see Error! Reference source not found. can be weaponi sed  by OMD to more efficiently mass -produce infringing copies of the Artsters  clothing line.     • AI in robotics (see AI in robotics can be u sed to optimi se the mass production of the Artsters   products and the processes in their supply chain.     • OMD could also use neural -style transfer techniques to create additional  designs that replicate  MarcVit’s original designs.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              86 AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎    • A platform can be developed using deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to  analyse and recognise visual imagery in order to scan shapes and patterns for similarities. This  model could identify infringement even if OMD present s an image  taken  at a different angle to  avoid discovery by less advanced AI tools.     • AI-supported blockchain can also be u sed by M arcVit to protect the registered designs in a  common database, maintained by rights holders, providing a reliable tool to store informati on  that can be shared with law enforcement in support of the investigation against OMD.     • Machine learning tools can be then adopted to quickly process and classify the data, which can  then be shared with law enforcement authorities investigating the case.       5.1.4  Importation of copyright and design -infringing goods     OMD intends to sell its infringing versions of MarcVit’s Artsters  clothing line all over the world. To  accomplish this goal, OMD will have to find a way to avoid customs authorities in the count ries to which it  will export its infringing goods. OMD will use AI to evade customs inspections and avoid seizure of their  infringing goods. Specifically, OMD hopes AI will help it:     • identif y and create shell corporations in different countries , so customs  authorities  will not know  that  OMD is behind the imports of infringing goods ;  • engage in ‘port shopping’ whereby OMD choose s ports where customs authorities are  least likely to  seize OMD’s infringing goods ;  • optimi se its conceal ment  of the  infringing goods in shipping containers ;  • find the best trade route between its illicit factories and ports of entry.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              87 The c ustoms  authorities, meanwhile,  use AI to identify the real importer of infringing goods behind the shell  corporations and expose importers engaged in ‘port shopping ’. The c ustoms  authorities  also use AI  software to scan shipping containers for hidden infringing goods.     AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎    • OMD can weaponise  machine learning to create a system that identifies the quickest trade route  betwe en its illicit factories and ports of entry, choose s ports, and helps to conceal infringing  goods in containers, limiting the risk of being detected by customs authorities. The system is  constantly updated.     • OMD can also weaponise expert systems (see 3.2.6 Expert systems  (ESs)) to optimi se the  decision -making process it uses for its supply chain.     • Adversarial machine learning can be u sed by OMD to evade detection. Specifically, OMD can  implement this AI -based  techniq ue to change trade routes and optimise its concealment of  infringing copies of M arcVit products. Adversarial ML is a technique that can be weaponi sed to  deceiving ML models designed to detect the illegal activities of an organi sed crim inal group such  as OMD. For instance, OMD could u se adversarial ML techniques to provide deceptive input  data, or ‘false flags ’, to cause a malfunction in the ML model being used by customs authorit ies,  making it generate inaccurate information.     • To use adversarial ML effectiv ely, OMD would have to have extensive knowledge of customs  authorities ’ use of AI  to detect infringements.  If an ML model is used by law enforcement or  customs authorities, OMD could use an ML model extraction attack to obtain information on its  functionin g. This ‘reverse engineering ’ strategy could be u sed to identify and potentially even  reproduce the neural network  (187).

The processing  power of quantum computing  could enable t he analysis of a large amount of data, at a regional  or even  global level.     • Expert systems [ see 3.2.6 Expert systems  (ESs)] can be used to decide wh ich strategy and  vulnerabilities are mo st appropriate to the situat ion.    5.1.5  Physical market sale of copyright and design -infringing products – infringer -controlled shop     MarcVit uses AI to generate unique visual anti -counterfeiting technology on the labels of its Artsters   clothing line , so customers can use M arcVit’s app to scan and confirm that what they are buying in markets  and elsewhere is authentic. M arcVit periodically changes this visual anti -counterfeiting technology to make  duplication more difficult.     OMD hopes to use AI technolog ies to replicate and track cha nges to M arcVit’s visual anti -counterfeiting  technology so that OMD  can successfully sell its infringing goods in stores that OMD controls.                                                       
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              89 MarcVit is sharing data about its AI -generated visual anti -counterfeiting technology with law enforcement ,  so natio nal authorities can use their own AI to detect OMD’s fakes when they investigate infringer controlled stores.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎    • Pattern recognition, computer vision and/or machine learning can be used by OMD to detect  and replicate the patterns in the visual anti -counterfeiting technology .    AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎    • AI-supported blockchain (see AI and Blockchain could be adopted by M arcVit to create and  secure a label , code , or image that would enable its clients to verify  the authenticity of a product,  and which the company can shar e with law enforcement authorities investigating  the case. Once  it is independently verified by national investigators, this would also provide important evidence  for the prosecutor to present in court.     • Machine learning can be adopted in the creation of the visual identity that will be protected. Law  enforcement will be able to identify OMD’s infringing copies  using computer vision tools .      5.1.6  Physical market sale of copyright and design -infringing products – third-party -controlled shop     MarcVit strictly  manages the wholesale prices that it charges t hird-party controlled stores for its Artsters   clothing line. M arcVit will charge different wholesale prices in different countries.     To select prices for its infringing versions of Artsters  clothes that are just below M arcVit’s wholesale prices,  OMD uses A I to track when  MarcVit’s prices  change and how they vary from country  to country.  
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              90   To combat these efforts, MarcVit shares its sensitive pricing data with law enforcement so national  authorities can use their own AI to develop a price comparison tool that  will detect infringing Artsters  goods  based on price .    AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎    • OMD can weaponis e machine learning  and natural language processing to analyse the different  prices of Artsters  clothes in different countries and track the changes in these prices ,  consequently adjust ing its marketing policy.     AI tools used for enforce ment:  ֎֎    • Law enforcement can u se machine learning to create its own platform that works as a price  comparison tool.     • Law enforcement can implement deep learning tools to obtain  insights into infringement patterns  in order to detect and prevent the crime.     • Expert systems  (see 3.2.6 Expert systems (ES s)) can be developed to create an interface  that use s the generated data to analyse patterns and determine  which decisions could prevent  future criminal activities .

As with the Artsters  clothing line, OMD will use AI to try and infringe  the unique shapes and colours of  MarcVit’s Artsters  cosmetics containers and then sell them in stores and online.      MarcVit is providing data to law enforcement on the components of  the unique colours o f the Artsters   cosmetics containers, so law enforcement can use its own AI to distinguish the authentic colours from  attempts by groups like OMD to infringe  them .    AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎    • OMD can weaponis e computer vision to identify and replicate the unique colours and shapes of  the new Artsters  cosmetic s line.    • AI can be integrated into robotics [see AI in robotics to improve the manufacturing p rocess,  enabling OMD to create the infringing copies in an easier and faster way.

Web crawling is a procedure in which data on we b pages is indexed  using a program or automated script by copying pages for processing , which are then indexed   by a search engine  (188). One of the main objectives of a crawler is to understand the content of  a website. Law enforcement can apply machine learning ( ML) technology to identify the unique  underlying patterns of websites, including change s in their structures  over time.     • Finally, law enforcement can use natural language processing  to analyse users’ behaviour and  the content they share  to identify t he fraudsters.       5.1.8  Online marketing of copyright and design infringing products – infringer -controlled e -shop     MarcVit markets  and sells its Artsters  clothing line online through its own retail website and through e commerce platforms.

Deep learning algorithms, specifically  convolution neural networks (CNN), might be used to classify encryption schemes and solve  some of the limitations of ML , such as the ability to perform an accurate cryptanalysis.     • Machine translation in natural language processing can also aid in the transl ation of websites  and identify infringing content in other language s.      5.1.9  Online marketing of copyright and design -infringing products – sales on third -party  marketplaces (surface web)     MarcVit markets and sells its Artsters  clothing line online throug h popular third -party e -commerce  platforms.     OMD uses AI to scan M arcVit’s online listings of Artsters  shirts and dresses and identify M arcVit’s most  popular clothes . OMD then uses this information to sell infringing versions on popular third -party e comme rce platforms.      National product safety authorities and other law enforcement authorities  purchase and use third -party AI enabled products to: (1)  identify third -party sellers such as  OMD group members who attempt to sell  infringing products and (2)  take down listings for infringing products. In this way, authorities identify OMD  members who are infringing M arcVit’s copyright and design rights.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎֎    • Machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing can all be weaponi sed by  OMD to scan websites and identify the most popular designs, which it will later infringe and sell  online.

On the dark web, OMD only  accepts cryptocu rrency as payment.     Law enforcement hires computer forensics experts or creates its own ‘cyber patrol ’ unit that speciali ses in  cryptocurrency to analyse OMD’s cryptocurrency transactions and identify members of the group.     Law enforcement also uses AI too ls to find similarities between OMD -affiliated users selling infringing  Artsters  clothes on different platforms  on the dark web and, if possible, track such sellers across dark web  and surface web platforms .     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎    • Machine learning (ML) and computer vision tools can be used by OMD to scan websites and  identify the most popular Artsters  designs, which will be later copied and sold  to the public  on  the dark web .    AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎    • A cyber patrol unit could be in volved in the investigation, making full use of advanced  technologies including AI tools. In many EU countries , as well as in countries outside Europe,  specialised law enforcement units  or ‘cyber patrols ’ are trained to conduct investigations against  serio us crimes conducted using the internet and the dark web. These units also investigat e  counterfeiting and piracy cases.

In particular,  supervised ML can identify the cryptocurrency cluster and assign it a category to help identify   controlling entities. Deep learning and neural networks can be used for latent representations  on a graph or network structure.     • AI can also use graph analysis to ‘follow the money ’ by detecting correlations between  addresses on the blockchain.       5.2 Storyline  b – infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of digita l content     This section will analyse 10 different scenarios concerning the infringement and enforcement of  copyright and design s of digital content, based o n storyline  b below . 
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              98   toryline  b: a multinational media conglomerate producing a variety of digita l media and  the organi sed crim inal group that seeks to infringe the conglomerate’s copyrights and  design rights.     A multinational media conglomerate, Mottanna , produces a variety of digital media, including  music, movies, television broadcasts, software, a nd video games. Mottanna  markets its  popular digital content all over the world.     A sophisticated online organi sed crim inal group called the InterGalactics, or ‘the IGs’, is one of the  most successful online infringers and distributors of copyright -protect ed digital works.     This storyline will unfold through the following 10 scenarios:     1. hacking media accounts   2. computer icon  / virtual commodit y infringement   3. social media offences   4. sales of hacked media accounts on the dark web  5. media sharing platform offences   6. virtual/gaming world offences   7. P2P and BitTorrent   8. live streaming – sports broadcast link aggregator (advertising -based )  9. IPTV crime – unauthori sed access to subscription -based IPTV service   10. training an AI application.       5.2.1  Hacking media accounts     Two types o f media account  hacking  scenarios are suggested in this section.    S 
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              99 5.2.1.1  Hacking movie streaming media accounts     Members of the InterGalactics purchase a database of existing movie streaming service customers and  use th is information to execute an AI -base d brute force attack to hack the accounts of these customers  and stream movies without authori sation.     Law enforcement uses AI -based machine learning  to track changes to IP addresses, MAC addresses,  content selection and other non -human behavio ur on the movie streaming service accounts to identify  accounts that are under the IGs ’ control.     Law enforcement also uses AI bots to crawl the web to identify online attempts at social engineering.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎    • AI technologies can be employed by the IGs to hack databases  through  brute force attacks  and  AI-supported password guessing. The same technologies, along with AI -supported CAPTCHA  breaking , could be used to hack the user accounts found in the hacked databases.     • Although malware does not necessarily require the use of AI, AI -enabled technologies could be  weaponi sed by the IGs to create more sophisticated malware that can imitate trusted system  components and deceive movie streaming account users into providing their login information.     • Machine learning can be used to carry out ‘smart’ phishing attacks, where a baseline of data  exclusive to  the user being targeted is used to make the phishing attack look more legitimate  and authentic. Machine learning can be further misused by organi sed crim inal groups like  the  IGs to learn patterns and exploit other personal information.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              100 AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎֎    • Law enforcement can use deep learning tools to identify online attempts at social engineering.     • Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image and pattern recognition can be used for the  same purpose by law enforcement.     • A machine learning -based system  could be developed to scan images and identify  fake login  pages, phishing behaviours, or other suspicious activit ies. Computer vision, natural language  processing , and machine learning could recognise these activities  and block them . These  AI  tools would be able to carry out real -time scanning of inbound links, using visual indications to  determine the authenticity of a login page.       5.2.1.2  Hacking music streaming media accounts     The InterGalactics upload infringing copies of Mottanna’s sound recordings t o music streaming services  using song titles that are confusingly similar to Mottanna’s actual song titles. The IGs claim that they are  the owners of the sound recording copyright and therefore  entitled to the royalties for streams of their  pirated version  of Mottanna’s sound recordings. The I Gs’ goal is to increase the number of streams of  these pirated sound recordings and thereby maximi se the royalties they can receive for these streams.     The I Gs then use AI to:     • hack into and take over actual accounts o n music streaming services to play/stream  their pirated  versions of Mottanna’s sound recordings that the y had previously uploaded on these services   • create free trial accounts with music streaming services for the sole purpose of streaming/playing  their pir ated version s of Mottanna’s sound recordings   • artificially inflate the number of streams of their pirated version s of Mottanna’s sound recordings on  music streaming services by waiting more than 30 seconds before replaying the stream s of the songs  
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              101    Law enf orcement uses AI -based pattern recognition technology to monitor the misuse of music streaming  media accounts to identify and to track the accounts that have been hacked and the IG members who  control the hacked music streaming accounts.     AI tools used for  infringement : ֎֎֎    • AI-enabled malware can be u sed by hackers to identify potential vulnerabilities in the music  streaming service, infect the service with malicious code, and then gain access to a music  streaming service account in order to use existing accounts on the service at a later time. The  attack is not immediate, but rather is triggered by specific actions at a certain time. This approach  can maximi se the impact of the attack , since it would not necessarily raise suspicion  at first .    • AI can be used to create mal ware that imitate s trusted system components, which could improve  stealth attacks. In this case, hackers could use AI malware programs to automatically learn the  services’ computation environment, patch update lifecycle, and preferred communication  protoco ls, as well as  the moments whe n the systems are least protected.     • The IGs can also use AI -enabled bots to automate the creation of free accounts on the music  streaming services and automat ically  replay the songs th ey previously uploaded for more than  30 se conds , so that each replay generates royalties.     AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎    • Machine learning could be used to model and monitor users’  behaviour, raising an alert if there  are any anomalies. The same technology could detect infringement patterns to identify larger  networks of IP infringers .   
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              102 • AI can detect duplicate copies of so und recordings on the service containing suspect ownership  data, and copyright owners can help law enforcement identify which uploads are authentic and  which are infringing.       5.2.2  Computer icon / virtual commodity infringement     One of Mottanna’s top art ists is giving a virtual 3D concert on a popular Mottanna  gaming platform.  Mottanna  sells tens of thousands of tickets to fans who will attend the virtual concert using their avatars.  The IGs create an avatar of their own and use it to sell virtual hats an d T-shirts bearing the Mottanna  logo  and an image of the Mottanna  musician for EUR  1 per virtual item of clothing without Mottanna’s  authori sation.     Law enforcement purchases AI that identifies the IGs’ avatar as well as the unauthori sed use of logos that  are identical or very similar to Mottanna’s logo.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎֎֎    • The IGs can weaponis e machine learning and computer vision tools using Mottanna’s logos to  produce new and infringing images: neural networks can produce images similar to a specific  image, such as the one developed by Mottanna . This includes colour alteration and pixeli sation  of images. Pattern recognition, as well as  text, video,  and audio recognition tools , can be used  to create a new item.     • The IGs can also create AI -based bots to test the commercial viability of their infringing virtual  commodit ies and then (if viable) to promote them. AI bots are self -learning bots programmed  with natural language processing and machine learning. The initial stage of  training and build ing

This  technique could be used by the IGs to change how they present their infringing cop ies online  and evade  detec tion. To accomplish this, IP infringer s would first illegally obtain extensive  knowledge about authorities ’ use of AI to detect infringement. Using this stolen  information,  fraudsters would then implement adversarial  machine learning to identify  and circum vent the  authorities’ detection patterns.     • If law enforcement uses an ML model, a n ML model extraction attack could obtain information  on its functioning . This “reverse engineering” strategy could be used to identify and potentially  reproduce the neural ne twork  (190).    AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎֎    • Computer vision or pattern recognition applications can be used to detect the specific logo used  by the IGs on  their avatars or digital items.     • Neural networks can be used by the authorities to find images similar to a specific image through   pattern r ecognition. Convolutional neural networks can be used for image and pattern  recognition.     • NLP can search for specific information on a website, and exploratory analysis (mathematical  analysis) can be adopted by law enforcement to find correlations in datas ets.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              104   5.2.3  Social media offences     Members of the InterGalactics have successfully developed AI that seems to perfectly impersonate the  voices of popular singers and musicians who have signed to Mottanna’s music label . These voices  then  appear to sing ‘samples’ of copyright -protected songs composed by other artists. The IGs seek to  incorporate these impersonations into ‘deepfake’ music videos.     The IGs have also successfully used social engineering to hack into the social media accounts of  Mottanna’s singe rs and musicians. The IGs hope to legitimi se their deepfake videos by broadcasting them  on the musicians ’ hacked social media accounts and later moneti sing or selling copies of the deepfake  videos elsewhere online.     Law enforcement works with third -party companies to develop AI that can distinguish between a musician’s  true voice and an impersonation.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎֎֎    • Generative adversarial networks and deep learning can be weaponi sed by the IGs to create the  imitation ‘samples’ of mus ic videos of singers signed to Mottanna .    • Social engineering is a type of hacking carried out through human interactions, whereby an  attacker uses psychological manipulation that lead s innocent people to make mistakes and  unwittingly reveal information  that they should not  (191). AI can be used for social engineering  through  voice cloning, deepfakes, and natural language processing phishing bots that could   improve the hacking techniques used on Mo ttanna’s singers and musicians.

Now the y intend to u se AI to identify the best  dark web forums to advertise the sale of the stolen credentials used to hack the accounts.     The IGs also will try to use AI to build up the ir reputation on dark web for ums to maximi se the sale of the  stolen credentials. The IGs t arget their marketing of the stolen credentials to operators of dedicated music  piracy websites and pre -release networks who intend to use their access to these accounts (and the private  direct messages they contain ) to look for and to obtain copies of sou nd recordings before they are  commercially released.     Law enforcement uses AI to find and track the IGs’ attempts to sell the stolen credentials across different  forums on the dark web so authorities can conduct a coordinated takedown of all the IGs’ attem pted sales.

They implement web crawling tools to identify where to post  their advertisements.     AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎֎    • Deep learning -based optical character recognition tools can be used by law enforcement to track  the IGs’ attempts to sell the credentials that the IGs stole. This AI tool could also be combined  with natural language processing.     • Convolutional neural networks for image and pattern recognition can also be used to track the  IGs’ attempts to sell the credentials they stole.     • Finally, NLP that looks for specific information on a website, or exploratory analysis  (mathematical analysis) , can be adopted to find correlations in dataset s.      5.2.5  Media sharing platf orm offences     Two types of media sharing platform offences are described in the following two scenarios.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              107 5.2.5.1 Uploading deepfake music videos     The InterGalactics make copies of deepfake music videos they have created using AI technolog ies and  upload th em to online video services, hoping to make money from the online advertising that the se  deepfake videos generate.      Law enforcement uses AI -enabled text -based and content -based pattern recognition and image  recognition technology to identify the deepfake videos and automate the takedown of the IGs ’ infringing  uploads.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎    • Generative adversarial networks can be weaponi sed by organi sed crim inal groups operating  online , such as  the InterGalactics , to create deepfake music video s.    AI tools used for enforcement: ֎֎֎    • AI-improved algorithms can detect if music is copyright protected: computer vision programs  can recognise if the image has been uploaded before. AI software can also analyse photos and  videos , providing a signal ( a ‘confidence score ’) about whether the material is likely to have been  artificially created.     • Computer vision can a nalys e the sequence of images in the video .    • Web crawlers can find patterns ( e.g. domain names, content of websites with fakes, similar  names, Javascript) that show that the IGs are behind the deepfake videos.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              108 • Machine learning , and in particular deep learning -based fingerprinting of media content , could  also be used by Mottanna  as a precautionary measure. The fingerprint data could be shared  with law enforcement to identify infringing music videos and support takedown orders. The  fingerprinting technique can be  adopted by content -sharing platforms to identify the  unauthori sed use or monetisation of copyright -protected content, as well as to apply  specific  policies defined by content rights holders, including blocking  (192).    • Convolutional neural networks  can also be used  for image and pattern recognition.     • NLP that looks for specific information on a website, or exploratory analysis (mathematical  analysis) , can be used by enforcement authorities investigating the case to find correlations in  dataset s to show that that IGs are behind the uploaded deepfake videos.       5.2.5.2  Unauthori sed streaming of movies and sports broadcasts     The InterGalactics use AI to automate the unauthori sed streaming and online distribution of copyright protected Mottanna  movies and sports broadcasts over popular media sharing platforms.      Law enforcement uses AI -based image recognition to identify the type of stream ed or distr ibuted content  and quickly determine  which content belongs to Mottanna  and other copyright owners. Once identified, law  enforcement can also use AI to automate the takedown of the IGs ’ infringing streams and seize the servers  used to distribute infringing copies of Mottanna’s copyrighted content online.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              110 5.2.6  Virtual/gaming world offences     The InterGalactics have developed ‘cheats’ for Mottanna’s massive online gam ing platform that the IGs   then sell to Mottanna’s most competitive customers , who can then use those cheats to ‘steal’ (i.e. copy  without authori sation) virtual items (copyright -protected code) that they would otherwise have to earn or  pay for in the game , in order to gain a competitive edge against their opponents.     The IGs use AI to identify vulnerabilities in the game to maximi se the effectiveness of these illegal cheats  and, in turn, how much the y can charge Mottanna’s customers for the cheats.     Law enf orcement use AI -based machine learning to distinguish and identify those Mottanna  customers  who are using cheats, which will then facilitate identifying the IGs member who sold th ose cheats.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎֎    • Machine learning and compute r vision can be weaponi sed by the IGs to infringe a videogame   copyrights  by modifying  the game’s  colours, icons, video, or audio.     • Natural language processing and machine learning bots can be used to sell articles online.     • AI-supported hacking could allow the IGs to obtain the access keys to Mottanna’s online gaming  platform . They could h ack servers or obtain second -hand keys from online resale markets for  this purpose. ML can be weaponi sed to target and circumvent authentication and identity  validation, in cluding voice and visuali sation -based  hacking attempts.     • Mottanna’s skins in the game can be imitated  with the help of computer vision tools.     • IGs could even develop AI -empowered bots to use as mules during an illegal transaction in the  game to cover the ir tracks.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              111 AI tools used for enforcement: ֎֎֎    • Computer vision and text recognition can identify similar images, names, and content across  the internet, especially on marketplaces and gaming platforms , as in this scenario.     • Convolutional neural networks could alternatively be employed by law enfor cement for image  and pattern recognition.     • AI algorithms can efficiently deal with large amounts of data through pattern recognition  (193). AIsupported  big data analysis can identify suspicious behaviours globally, for example, if new  accounts have been cre ated by an app. ML can then compare existing user accounts to other s  to distinguish those that have been detected as suspicious, or that have suspicious or unusual  patterns.     • Law enforcement could implement an AI -enabled tool to analyse player s’ behavio ur – such as  their moves, trades, and playing times, and  the time between  their logins and logouts – to  distinguish between real players and bots.       5.2.7  P2P and BitTorrent -like applications     The InterGalactics members often use tool s to share infringing cop ies of Mottanna’s movies efficiently and  anonymously among themselves. In particular, they use AI to develop and run a decentrali sed file -sharing  network , called IGFlix , that is similar to existing P2P networks, but more fragmented in its distribution of  packets than typical BitTorrent or P2P technology. This file -sharing network is connected to a  cryptocurrency blockchain, enabling the IGs to sell premium IGFlix accounts (i.e. user accounts with  privileges) and anonymously pay rewards to members who occasi onally upload infringing content to IGFlix.

Law enforcement uses AI -based patt ern recognition technology to find common patterns between  members of the IGs, users of the IGFlix peer -to-peer technology, and cryptocurrency transactions occurring  on the associated blockchain. Finding these patterns will help them  establish which member s of the IGs  are distributing infringing copies of Mottanna’s movies.     AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎    • AI-supported blockchain [see AI and Blockchain ] can be weaponi sed by the IGs to evade  detection  by Mottanna .    • AI and machine learning could also eliminate digital  dots and digital watermarks that Mottanna  adds t o its copyright -protected movies  to track the distribution of unauthorized copies of its  movies online .    • Generative adversarial networks could also be used to incorporat e certain effects into  livestreams to prevent automatic content recognition by adding n ew logos, removing original  logos , watermarks , and  fingerprinting,  or enhancing content.     AI tools used for enforcement: ֎֎֎    • Mottanna  can use an image watermarking system based on deep neural networks. Data could  be shared with the law enforcement to help investigations.     • Machine learning - or deep learning -based  fingerprinting of media content can also be employed  for the s ame purpose.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              113 • AI-supported big data analysis can analyse suspicious behaviours and find patterns to promptly  detect the distribution of infringing movie copies on the P2P network and dubious transactions  on the cryptocurrency blockchain.     • Convolutional neural networks  can be  used for image and pattern recognition.       5.2.8  Livestreaming – sports broadcast link aggregator (advertising -based )    The InterGalactics members are big fans of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA), so they use AI to create a link  aggregator that f inds and posts all the links that other groups have created so other MMA fans can watch  Mottanna’s MMA programming for free. The IGs generate revenue from advertising on the website where  it posts the aggregated links.      To combat these  efforts, Mottanna  has developed an AI of its own that automates the generation of  requests for notice -and-takedown orders. For its part, law enforcement has developed AI to quickly  generate requests for dynamic and live blocking orders.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎    • Machine learning can be weaponi sed by the IGs to identify and scan the most popular and most  relevant websites and social media and then suggest  infringing links to Mottanna’s MMA  programming. ML can then also find and automatically extract the links to  infringing streams,  before reposting them on the  IGs’ own website.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              114 AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎֎֎    • Machine learning can be employed by law enforcement officials to increase the efficiency of an  automatic content recognition tool. This refers not onl y to the recognition of images and videos,  but also to the content’s audio  footprint.     • Expert systems could be employed by law enforcement authorities to generate requests for  dynamic and live blocking orders.     • A platform could be develo ped using deep learning and convolutional neural networks to analyse  the content of the website  and detect patterns . The data thus gathered could  enabl e law  enforcement to predict future infringements and detect links between infringing websites so they  can take down mirrors  of blocked websites more easily and create a blacklist of infringing sites.     • The marketing of the infringing streams can also be tracked by using computer vision to identify  the content and its similar ity to the original content .      5.2.9  IPTV crime – unauthorised access to subscription -based  IPTV service     Members of the InterGalactics want to offer access to Mottanna’s copyright -protected television  programming without having  to pay the subscription  fee for this service. Therefore , they develop and sell  an AI-enabled IPTV application ( or ‘app’) that custom ers can buy and then download onto their smart  televisions.     The IGs’ IPTV app circumvents Mottanna’s technological protection measures , enabling purchasers to  avoid paying for Mottanna’s television subscr iption and watch all of its television programming for free.    
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              115 Mottanna  works with law enforcement to develop AI software that analyses the behavioural patterns of  Mottanna’s television viewers to identify those who have failed to pay a subscription. They a lso develop AI  that identifies whe ther Mottanna’s copyright -protected programming is being streamed using the IGs’ IPTV  app.    AI tools used for infringement:  ֎    • The IGs could weaponis e an AI -enabled machine learning tool to identify the protection  measures  Mottanna has applied to its IPTV service to break into the system and gain access to  its IPTV content . Circumvention methods are then shared with the IGs’ app customers in an  adaptive way, so that they can access Mottanna’s service without paying.     • The IG s could also u se AI tools to identify broken links or streams with lag spikes and then  reroute the source of the stream or forward a working link to the IPTV service customers.     AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎    • Convolutional neural networks can allow Mottanna  to (1)  track the tools the IGs have created to  offer illicit access to copyright -protected content and (2)  collect data for behavioural analysis, all  of which can then be shared with law enforcement for their investigati on.    • ML can also analyse the behavioural patterns in users’ account activity to recognise unknown  users or unusual consumption patterns, such as account details being used in several locations  within a short  period. This would also enable the detection – either retroactive or predictive – of  any correlation or pattern in the IGs’ infringement method s.    • The IGs’ marketing of the infringing services can also be tracked using computer vision to  identify the content and its similar ity to the or iginal content . 
STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              116   5.2.10  Training an AI application     The InterGalactics want to create an AI application that successfully impersonates one of Mottanna’s most  successful musical artists. To train this AI application, the IGs make infringing copies of dozens  of the  artist’s most popular sound recordings and feed th is data into the AI application. Based on the data (i.e.  the infringing copies of the artist’s sound recordings), the AI’s artificial neural network can create near perfect copies of the artist’s vo ice. The IGs can in turn use these copies to create and sell deepfake music  videos of other artists’ songs without authori sation, violating those artists’ copyright as the composers  of  these songs.     Mottanna  works with law enforcement to develop AI that no t only determine s when a music video is using  a fake copy of an artist’s voice, but also identif ies the AI application that was ‘trained’ to generate the fake  copy.     AI tools used for infringement:  ֎    • Generative adversarial  networks can be weaponi sed by the IGs to recognise successful artists  and impersonat e a specific artist’s voice.     AI tools used for enforcement:  ֎֎    • Law enforcement can use convolutional neural networks to identify the AI applicat ion that the  IGs trained to generate the fake artist’s voice and create their deepfake s.     
              117 Conclusions       The findings of th is study allow some general conclusions based on existing  AI technologies and their  current application s in the infringement and en forcement of copyright and design s of both physical  products and digital content. It examined  those technologies that – based on the current pace of  technological advancements – will plausibly  be used for the same purposes in the near future. The  use and t ransformation of AI was analysed using  the ‘Intellectual Property Tech Chain ’, from the  exploration of the existing and developing subfields and tools, through the conversion of the  technology to adapt to certain goals  and the  develop ment of  specific appli cations at the weaponisation  stage, to the  monetisation stage , in which  AI is used to protect, enforce or infringe IP.     In conclusion, the results  regarding the use of AI in the infringement and enforcement of copyright and  designs  can be summarised under the headings  ‘Opportunities ’, ‘Drivers’, ‘Risks’, and ‘Concerns ’.

Currently, the main areas of development are machine learning ,  natural language processing , computer vision, and expert systems . Explainable AI is a nother  field that  is currently receiving increased attention from experts and pol icy makers. Other technologies that can  be enhanced by AI , such as quantum computing , blockchain, 3D printing, generative design, cloud  services,  and robotics , also  have great potential. AI can identify and prioriti se risk s, instantly spot  malware on a net work, guide incident response s, and detect intrusions  before they occur  (194).

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              119 As described in the scenarios presented in Chapter  5, machine learning has become one of the key  AI subfields in the  develop ment of  possible tools for law enforcement in the field of copyright and  design protection. Some of the most common uses of machine learning for the enforcement of  copyright and design include analysi ng large amounts of information to detect threats, identif ying  social engineering bots, scanning images to det ect false pages or illicit content, improving ACR tools,  and providing insights to find infringement patterns.     Natural language processing  can analyse and block cyberattacks like phishing, identify the behaviour  of fraudsters, and create a correlation ana lysis to promptly identify copyright and design infringements.  Computer speech and computer vision can also be successfully employed in this field. Some of the ir  uses include pattern recognition to predict future infringements, detectin g the marketing of i nfringing  goods, and detecti ng and analysi ng fraudulent logos or other images. Quantum computing could  improve AI tools, enabling them to process larger amounts of data. For example, AI and quantum  computing can be used by customs and law enforcement autho rities to recognise patterns in large  dataset s and identify similarities. Expert systems, alternatively, can be used by law enforcement to  decide which strategy is more adequate to protect a system from specific vulnerabilities, including  those linked to c opyright and design infringement.  Customs and l aw enforcement authorities should  continuously monitor the new technology landscape to ensure  their preparedness to use new tools  that may support identifying, limiting and investigating IP violations .    Finall y, it is worth keeping in mind that there is always a human being behind any AI algorithm and its  practical application vectors  (195). Explainable AI , although it does not solv e all possible issues,  could  be used by law enforcement authorities  to increase  the use of innovative tools – including AI – for  analysis and prediction, while at the same time helping to  achiev e the prerequisites of fairness,  accountability and transparency. The use of AI in law enforcement and the judiciary should in any  case always b e subject to strong safeguards and human oversight  (196), through built -in human  control  (197).

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              120   Driver s    On the infringement side, fraudsters and criminal groups involved in copyright and design infringement  employ , or could possibly employ , the same AI techn iques use d by enforcement agencies  in order  to  overcome cybersecurity measures and evade detection . This is known  as the ‘AI/cybersecurity  conundrum ’ (198): as AI matures and is increasingly used in the field of cybersecurity, the potential  downsides of this  technological advancement increa se as well.     Adversarial machine learning can help to spot and overcome cybersecurity measures in place. AI can  be trained to break through defences and develop dynamic malware to evade detection . Phishing,  hacking and brut e force attacks do not have to involve AI, but AI technologies can  evidently  be  employed to make such attacks more efficient, as in the case of AI -supported password guessing and  CAPTCHA breaking.  AI-enabled malware can be used to conceal malicious codes i n benign  applications – an attack triggered by specific actions or at a certain time , which can maximi se the  impact of the attack without raising suspicion.      Natural language processing tools can be used to produce  deepfake music videos , and generative  design-based tools can aid in the manufacturing of infringing copies. In addition, pattern recognition,  computer vision and/or machine learning can detect , eliminate , or replicate the patterns of anti counterfeiting technologies (like digital dots and digita l watermarks) .      Limitations     AI as a tool still faces certain limitations, including , in particular: its dependenc e on a large amount of  high-quality training data;  its inability to deal with ‘long tail’ problems; its limited versatility; its  dependenc e on specifi c application scenarios; and the inherent biases of its developer.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              121 More powerful machine learning algorithms can learn complex nonlinear relationships between input  and output data, but to do so they require a large amount of quality data. Machin es still need to  understand the world  perceptual and cognitive learning in a more accurate manner, enabling them to  simulate real -world scenarios through reinforcement learning to perceive information ; they can then   transform the perceived information int o abstract knowledge through attention, memory, and  understanding. This might be achieved through the intersection, integration, and optimi sation of  algorithms and the continuous improvement of academic stud ies. Further developments could  improve AI’s creative abilities, its general -purpose use, and its understanding of objects in the world.  The a ccessibility of comput ing power is another  current limitation : quantum computing , for instance ,  is still not widely available.     Finally,  although the use of innova tive technologies in law enforcement is increasing, according to the  interviews for this study, their actual use in the enforcement of copyright and designs is still generally  limited . It is clear, though, that AI can help companies, IT experts and law enf orcement to identify and  mitigate risks and threats, predict attack vectors, block and take down infringing sites, and try  ‘to shrink  the attack surface instead of constantly chasing after malicious activity ’ (199). Experts involved in the  study underlined the need for increased awareness o f technological developments and continuous  training of law enforcement and customs authorities on the ways  AI tools can be used for infringement  and for enforcement.       Concerns     As AI and related technologies are used to m ake determinations and predictions in areas of great  importance , such as combatting copyright and design infringement, AI has the potential to impact  fundamental human rights in profound ways.     AI algorithms are powered by data collected and processed by t echnologies that are increasingly  surrounding us, in every single minute of every person’s life. As a result, the fundamental human right s                                                   (199) Gant V. (2018).

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              122 of privacy and data protection must be duly considered when data is collected by law enforcement  authorities. AI incr eases the possibility that mass surveillance will become more widespread. The  international debate concerning its impact on fundamental human rights , and more generally on the  ethical aspects of AI , is very lively .    Nevertheless,  the experts highlight ed that use of AI in the justice system also presents many  opportunities to figure out how to effectively use it without violating individual privacy and affecting  fundamental rights. Explainable AI could also ensure that authorities can clarify to the court ho w the  algorithms work, and which dataset s they work  on.    Concerns regards the potential dual use of AI technologies, as depicted in the ‘double -edged sword ’  metaphor mentioned in Chapter  1, suggest that there can be weaknesses in each side ’s application  of technologies that can be exploited by the other.     Many experts argue that AI algorithms must be built to align with overarching  human  goals. The EU  Parliament , in its recent Resolution of 6  October 2021 on artificial intelligence in criminal law and its  use by the police and judicial authorities in criminal matters (2020/2016(INI)), has clearly stated that  ‘AI should not be seen as an end in itself, but as a tool, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well being, human capabilities and safety ’ (200). As a result, the fundamental human right to privacy must  be duly considered  when data is collected by law enforcement authorities. Algorithms and AI should  be ‘ethical by design’, with no built -in bias, in a way that guarantees maximum protection of  fundament al rights. The EU Parliament, in the same Resolution, th erefore  invites ‘European  stakeholders, including the Member States and the Commission, to ensure, through international  cooperation, the engagement of partners outside the EU in order to raise standa rds at international  level and to find a common and complementary legal and ethical framework for the use of AI ’ (201).  Policy makers are invited to be actively involved and  to draw  the legal boundaries within which these  technologies are allowed to operate.  Retroactive deconstruction of the algorithm could be required in  order to assess the factors that influence a model’s predictions.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              123   The proposed new EU regulatory framework on AI , currently  under discussion, is intended to  ensur e  that AI systems used in t he EU market are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and  values.  Further consideration s may arise  if or when the text is approved by the Parliament.     In conclusion, great investment is flowing into AI research and development along with machine  learning technologies , and this trend is predicted to continue over the next years . Therefore , the  availability and use of these  tools and technologies, for both legal a nd illegal purposes, can be  expected  to increase . A wide range of AI -related tools  and technologies are currently or potentially in  use in copyright and design infringement and enforcement. There is clearly a need for better  understanding, increased awareness and enhanced capacities on the part of all stakeholders,  including  policymaker s, IP protection entities, companies and law enforcement authorities.

Even in periods of reduced  activity in this field  (the so -called ‘AI winters ’), the  technology  never regressed , but previous achieveme nts were in fact consolidated , preparing for the  next ‘boom’ phase.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              145 The Birth of AI - the Golden Age (1940 -1974)     The initial stage of development took place from the 1940s to 1974 and is known as the ‘Golden Age  of AI ’. Artificial intelligence was born  as a field of scientific study in 1956, when the term was coined  at a conference organised at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, US. The Dartmouth Summer  Research Project on Artificial Intelligence  (202) was initially cre ated to discuss  the simulation of  learning  or any other feature of intelligence by a machine. This included automatic computers, i.e. those   programmed to use language, neuron nets, self -improvement, abstractions, randomness , and  creativity , or to grasp the  theory of the size of a calculation  (203).    Before the term was formally coined, several technologies and theories related to the future  development of AI originated in the post -World War II period. One of the most relevant examples is  the creation of the Turing test  (or ‘imitation game ’) by Alan Turing in 1950, wh o proposed a model to  validate whether  a computer  or other machine can be programmed to behave intelligently to the extent  that it can  convinc e a human that it too is a human  (204).      Other mileston es in the evolution of AI were:  Marvin Minsky  (205) and Dean Edmonds’ first artificial  neural network  in 1951  (206); the first transistor computer , introduced by IBM in 1955 ; the creation  of the first AI language  (IPL-II) by Allen Newell, J. C. Shaw and Herber t Simon in 1955  (207); the  invention of the  first scientific programming language  (Formula Translator or FORTRAN) by John  Backus in 1956  (208); and the development of MANIAC I (Mathematical Analyzer, Numerical Integrator,                                                   (202) For more information see: Dartmouth (n.d).

The study of AI took  a multidisciplinary approach even before the development of concrete  AI tools ,  being  influenced by disciplines such as psych ology, mathematics and statistics, philosophy,  and  linguistic and communication theories  (210). Technology advanced in different areas, especially in  relation to the storage, capability and affordability  of computers and the improvement of algorithms,  which could be seen  in the presentation of the General Problem Solver  computer by Newell and  Simon  (211) and the natural language processing  computer program ELIZA by  Weizenbaum  (212) (213).      The successful development of these technologies , and advocacy by research ers, contributed to the  flourishing of AI and the funding of AI research by government agencies such as the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency  (DARPA ) (214). Research in t he Golden Age was mainly based  on logic -based problem -solving approaches. Howeve r, between 1966 and the early 1970’s, the  limitations of AI had already become clear when machine translation did not provide the expected  results , and the connectionist approach was abandoned  (215).      The First AI Winter (1974 -1980)     This initial stage of g rowth was followed by a period known as an ‘AI winter’, which occurred from  1974 to 1980. The early successes encountered several obstacles, which eventually led to a period                                                   (209) Anderson H. (1986).

The First AI Winter was caused by several factors, including the ca pacity of computers  at the time and a number of disappointments in regard to machine translation.     The publication of the Lighthill report  (216) in 1973 concluded that AI researchers’  promises  concerning the  technology’s development were exaggerated, which p rovoked cuts in government  funding , first  in the United Kingdom and later in the rest of Europe and the United States  (217). As in  the case of other technologies, the AI Winter was a result of initial excitement caused by overinflated  promises by developers,  unrealistic ally high expectations on the part of  end-users, and extensive  promotion in the media  (218).      Renewed hope for AI (1980s)     The field of AI was revived in the 1980s, when an increase in funding and the expansion of the  algorithmic toolkit reignit ed interest in the technology  (219). During this period, s everal  relevant  advances were achieved, such as the populari sation of deep learning techniques that enabled  computers to learn from previous experience.     In 1982, Hopfield revived the concept of the recurrent artificial neural network  with the Hopfield  neural network (HNN)  (220), which also provides a model for understanding human memory. In 1986,  Hinton, Rumelhart and Williams published the backpropagation training algorithm , which train ed a  neural netw ork through a method called  a chain rule; this means that after each forward pass through  a network, backpropagation performs a backward pass while adjusting the model’s parameters  (221).  Furthermore, Edward Feigenbaum introduced expert systems , which mimick ed the decision -making  process of a human expert; in this case, the program would ask an expert in a field how to respond in                                                   (216) For more information see: Lighthill, J.

These technological advances were accompanied by other circumstances that increased the  flourishing of AI in this period. In 1982, the  Japanese  Ministry of International Trade and Industry  (MITI) launched the Fifth Gene ration Computer Systems  (FGCS) initiative with the objective of  revolutioni sing computer processing, implementing logic programming, and improving artificial  intelligence . The high  level of  investment in the technology’s development  by the Japanese  governm ent (USD  400 million between 1982 and 1990) led to an increase in investment by other  actors, such as the British government  (223). Despite  these efforts, the project did not have the  expected results.     Other important factors included the found ing of the American Association for the Advancement  of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI)  (224) in 1979, and the organi sation of conferences on related topics ,  which  enhanced the visibility of AI. Moreover , the commerciali sation of AI, especially of expert  systems , contribut ed to increased  interest in the technology.     Expert systems were created by surveying experts using ‘if-then ’ rule sets and were implemented in  fields like financial planning, medical diagnosis, geological exploration, and microelectronic circuit  design  (225). However, as with the initial period of hype regarding AI’s potential, the fact that the  technology did not achieve the expected results in a short period led to another era of stagnation.       Second AI Winter (1987 -1993)     The Second AI Winter occurred  from 1987 to 1993, when another decrease in funding adversely  affec ted AI research: interest on the topic declined when it could not meet unrealistic expectations                                                   (222) Anyoha, R.

The expert systems that had been one of the main sources of interest in previous years started to  show their limitations ; in particular,  many AI -related tasks were too complicated to de sign rules around  them manually , and systems for vision and speech  recognition contained too many edge cases  (226).  During these years, many AI companies closed , and attendance at the AAAI conference significantly  diminished in 1991. Similarly, a decrease in  the publication of  AI-related articles was observed, starting  in 1987 and reaching a nadir  in 1995  (227).      AI Booms ( late 1990s -ongoing)     In the 1990s , advances in computation power and storage generated new funding and interest in  AI (228). In this decade, several developments facilitated AI’s next period of flouri shing. In 1995, the  Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity  (A.L.I.C.E) was created by Richard Wallace. Based  on Joseph Weizenbaum's 1964  ELIZA  program , it was able to hold basic conversatio ns with humans .  During this period there were other major advances in all areas of AI, with significant demonstrations  in machine learning , intelligent tutoring, case -based reasoning, multi -agent planning, scheduling,  uncertain reasoning, data mining, natu ral language understanding and translation, vision, virtual  reality, games, and other fields  (229).    The 1990s saw other relevant events that demonstrat ed the development of AI. The COG Project  at  MIT  (230) made significant progress in building a humanoid robo t, while IBM created the chess -playing  computer Deep Blue , which defeated world champion Garry Kasparov  (231). In 1997, the speech  recognition software Dragon Naturally Speaking  was launched by Dragon Systems to be                                                   (226) Schuchmann, S. (2019). Op. cit.

In the same year, Dr. Cynthia Breazeal developed the   robot head Kismet  at MIT  (232), which was able to recogni se and display emotions  (233).     In 1995, Cortes and Vapnik published the current standard for the support vector machine , a  system for mapping and re cogni sing similar data through classification and regression analysis, while  in 1997 Hochreiter and Schmidhuber developed the long short -term memory  (LSTM) for recurrent  neural networks  (234). Both contributions were essential for the evolution of deep learn ing. The se  advances w ere possible due to improvement s in processing and storage  capacity , which had   previously  been the main limitation in achieving the expected results  (235).    The increased  development of AI -related technologies after the 1990s was due to  the interaction of  many  factors and drivers, particularly  the exponential development in the performance of IT systems  and technologies based on them, the advance of digitali sation and demateriali sation into more and  more areas of value creation, and incre asing connectivity between objects, processes , and human  beings . In time this has led not only to the development of the Internet of Things (IoT)  (236) but to an  Internet of Everything (IoE)  (237). Gordon Moore explained this phenomenon in what became known  as Moore’s Law  (238), which describes the exponential growth of integrated circuits by estimating that  the speed and memory of computers doubles every year. These doublings are currently occurring at                                                   (232) Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) (2001). MIT team building social robot.

AI became more complex at the beginning of the 21st century , with an  approach centred on developing  tools that c an interact and cooperate with people. The humanoid robot ASIMO (Advanced Step in  Innovative  Mobility)  (240), which could perform basic interactions , was presented by Honda in 2000. AI  was also commerciali sed in items  for daily use , such as the robotic vacuum cleaner Roomba in 2002.     In 2001, Doug Laney proposed the ‘Three Vs of big data ’: volume, velocity and variety. In 2005,  O’Reilly published ‘What is Web 2.0 ’, thereby populari sing this term, which was devised to  differentiate the post -dotcom bubble World Wide Web , with its emphasis on social networking,  usergenerated  content, and cloud computi ng, from that which came before  (241). Machine reading was also  refined with the improvement of the autonomous understanding of text.     After that , AI technolog ies started to become more accessible for everyday use. In 2010, Apple  introduced the  intelligent p ersonal assistant Siri in its iPhone 4 S, followed by Amazon’s  intelligent  personal home assistant Alexa  in 2014. Machine -learning chatbots  also became a common tool for  customer service. In 2014, the chatbot Eugene Goostman passed the Turing test for the f irst time,  convincing 33  % of the judges that it was human  (242).    Advancements were observed in other areas  of AI research . In 2016, the Google DeepMind  Challenge Match  showcased  the computer Go program AlphaGo’s defeat of the world’s best Go  player , Lee Se dol. AlphaGo was later programmed to play against itself using a trial -and-error pattern,  which led to the creation of an improved version of AlphaGo Zero that trained itself faster and was  able to beat the original AlphaGo by 100 games to 0  (243).                                                   (239) Quantum computing is essentially harnessing and exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics to process information.  A traditional computer uses long strings of “bits,” which encode either a zero or a one. A quantum computer, on the other  hand, uses quantum bits, or qubits.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              152   In the l ast few years, the increasing availability of big data  and cloud computing and the associated  computational and storage capacity , as well as  advances in machine learning , have rapidly boosted  the power, attainability, growth, and impact of AI technolog ies (244). The improvement in sensors  and  the reduction in their cost has also contributed to the growth of AI, and resulted in enhance d research  in core AI areas such as natural language processing, autonomous vehicles and robotics, computer  vision, and languag e learning.     2 Definitions  of AI throughout  its history     But what is AI? To date , there is no widely agreed -upon and precise definition of the concept . As  mentioned in the main part of the s tudy, AI is c omputer code ( comprising both software and hardware)  that dynamically adapts according to algorithmic rules while processing large datasets to predict  phenomena and assist decision -making.     Over  the course of  AI’s history, numerous definitions have been given of what ‘AI’ actually means.   While the term ‘artificial intelligence ’ has entered common parlance and is widely used, there is no  single definition of AI that is universally accepted. Some define AI loosely as a computeri sed system  that exhibits behaviour commonly thought of as requiring intelligence. Othe rs define AI as a system  capable of rationally solving complex problems or taking appropriate actions to achieve its goals in  whatever real -world circumstances it encounters  (245).    The term 'artificial intelligence ’ was coined by Professor John McCarthy in 1955 , who defined it as  ‘Machines behaving in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving ’ (246).

(M. Minsky, 1969)  (247)  ‘The ability of a system to act appropriately in an uncertain environment, where appropriate  action is that which inc reases the probability of success, and success is the achievement of  behavioural subgoals that support the system’s ultimate goal .’ (J.S. Albus, 1991)  (248)  ‘The main idea unifying theme is the idea of an intelligent agent. We define AI as the study  of agen ts that receive precepts from the environment and perform actions. Each such agent  implements a function that maps percept sequences to action. ’ (S. Russell et P. Norvig,  1995)  (249)  ‘[…] activity devoted to making machines intelligent, and intelligence is that quality that  enables an entity to function appropriately and with foresight in its environment .’ (Nils  Nilsson, The Quest for Artificial Intelligence, Cambridge, 2010)   ‘Any artificial system that performs tasks under varying and unpredictable circums tances,  without significant human oversight, or that can learn from their experience and improve  their performance…In general, the more human -like the system within the context of its  tasks, the more it can be said to use artificial intelligence .’ (Fundame ntally Understanding  the Usability and Realistic Evolution of AI (Future of AI) Act of 2017)  (250)  ‘[…] a set of technologies that enable computers to perceive, learn, reason and assist in  decision -making to solve problems in ways that are similar to what p eople do.’ (Microsoft,  (2018)   ‘Artificial intelligence refers to systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their  environment and taking actions – with some degree of autonomy – to achieve specific goals.

An AI system is a machine -based system that can, for a given set of human -defined  objectives, make predictions, recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual  environments. ’ (OECD, 2019)  (252)  ‘Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and possibly also hardware) systems  designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital dimension by  perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the coll ected structured  or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the information, derived  from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given goal. AI systems  can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, a nd they can also adapt their  behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions. As a  scientific discipline, AI includes several approaches and techniques, such as machine  learning (of which deep learning and reinforcement lea rning are specific examples),  machine reasoning (which includes planning, scheduling, knowledge representation and  reasoning, search, and optimization), and robotics (which includes control, perception,  sensors and actuators, as well as the integration of all other techniques into cyber -physical  systems)’ (Independent High -Level Expert Group on AI set up by  the European  Commission,  2019)  (253)  ‘Artificial intelligence (AI) is a discipline of computer science that is aimed at developing  machines and systems that can carry out tasks considered to require human intelligence,  with limited or no human intervention .’ (WIPO Conversation on IP and AI, 2020)  (254)      3 Additional technical insights into AI                                                     (251) European Commission.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              155 Algorithms are , as me ntioned  earlier , the bas is of AI, enablin g the development of different tools that  can be used for the protection of copyright, designs , and other IP, as well as for enforcement purposes.  Algorithms can enhance the capabilities of existing tools and expand their use to other areas.     Different alg orithms are used  for different purposes . The Naive Bayes algorithm  (255) has a group of  prior probabilities (calculated with previously gathered data) for each class . Once data is provided, it  updates these probabilities to constitute a posterior probability  (256). Another category is the decision  tree algorithm , which belongs to the family of supervised machine learning algorithms  (257) and  resembles a flowchart where nodes represent the test on an input attribute and branches represent  the outcome of the test . Similarly, the random forest algorithm  (258), is a ML algorithm that belongs  to the supervised learning technique and can be used for classification as well as for regression  problems in ML. It  acts as group of trees, where input dataset  is subclassified and  fed into various  decision trees to finally average all outputs  (259). In the same category, support vector machines   (SVM s) (260) are mostly used in classification problems . SVM s classify data using a hyperplane,  ensuring that the space between the hyperplane and support vectors is maxim al, whereas a K  Nearest Neighbours  (KNN)  (261) – one of the simplest machine learning algorithms based on the  supervised learning technique – uses multiple data points divided into classes to predict the class of  a new sample data  point  (262).    Regression algorithms  (263) are another type of supervised machine learning algorithm , used  in AI  to predict the output values based on the input information points in a database  (264). Some of the main  applications of these algorithms include pre dicting stock market price s and  forecasting weather,                                                   (255) Ray S.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              156 among others  (265). Algorithms in this category include l inear regression algorithms that measure  genuine qualities by taking into account consistent variables, which is achieved by identif ying the best  linear-fit relationship in a dataset  among  independent and dependent variables  (266). Other examples  are the Lasso regression algorithm  (267), which – like other regression algorithms  – obtains the  subset of predictors that minimi ses prediction error for a respo nse variable ; the logistic regression  algorithm  (268) for binary classification ; the multivariate regression algorithm  (269) used when there  is more than one predictor variable, and the multiple regression algorithm , which appl ies a  combination of linear regre ssion and non -linear regression algorithms using multiple explanatory  variables as inputs  (270).    Finally, t o complement the information  in Chapter 3, it may be add ed that international studies and  literature on the topic  divide  AI systems into three main ca tegories, two of which are currently only  hypothetical .    1. Artificial narrow intelligence (ANI)  is the current state of the technology , also known as  applied AI . It is designed to accomplish a specific problem -solving or reasoning task. It cannot  replicate t he versatility of a human mind, but is able to generalise pattern recognition such as  by transferring knowledge learned in the field of image recognition to speech recognition   tasks  (271).    2. Artificial general intelligence (AGI) , also called  ‘strong AI’ or ‘deep AI’, refers to  a machine  with general intelligence that is able to mimic human  intelligence  while greatly improving upon  it, intelligence to solve problems that go beyond the resolution of specific tasks.  AGI can think,  understand, and act in a way tha t is indistinguishable from that of a human in any given situation.                                                   (265) DeAngelis, S. F. (2015).

Artificial superinte lligence (ASI)  is the last hypothetical stage  of the technology , in which the  machine will have self -awareness and will be able to surpass the capacity of human  intelligence  (273). For this stage , quantum computing  will most probably  be needed.       Figure 17 – Categories of AI                                                            (272) OECD (2019), Op. cit.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              158 The core of AI is the manifestation of multiple intelligence approaches based on human intelligence,  which Gardner  (274) describe s as encompassing linguistic, musical, logical -mathematical, spatial,  physical -kinaesthetic, intrapersonal , interpersonal, and naturalistic -existential intelligence  (275).    Figure 18 – Gardner's Theory of Multiple Intelligences           In this sense , the field of  AI covers two main areas : the analysis of how ‘intelligent ’ behavio ur can  solve problems, and subsequen tly, based on the knowledge obtained during this process, the  ‘intelligent ’ solutions suggested by the systems  (276).

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              159 4 Overview of AI technologies’ impact on the economy and labour market     As mentioned in  the study, AI has profound implications for indivi duals, societies, economies, and the  environment. The EU Parliament, in its resolution of 6  October 2021  (277), has underlined that, whil e  innovati ve technologies in general, and AI in particular, hold extraordinary promise , with the potential  to generate su bstantial benefits in efficiency, accuracy, and convenience  for the European economy  and society, they also pose  a number of challenges and threats to fundamental rights and  democracies based on the rule of law.   At the global level, the United Nations has put in place several  important initiatives related to the role  of AI in sustainable development. While it is widely acknowledged that AI technologies may support  breakthroughs in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), they may also have  unanti cipated consequences that will exacerbate inequalities and negatively impact individuals,  societies, economies and the environment  (278). The UN Secretary -General has underlined the need  to ensure that AI becomes a force for good. The UN systems’ work on  the ethics of AI builds on a long  history of engagement with ethical concerns related to the development and use of information and  communication technologies (ICTs).     In discussing  AI, it is importan t to briefly mention the impact that these technologies are having today  and may have in the future on the  econom y and the labour market .      4.1 Impact on the economy     A lot has been written concerning AI’s impact on the economy, and the debate is ongoing . A report  published by the McKinsey Global Institute  (279) attempts to simulate AI’s impact on the world  economy. According to th is simulation, AI has the potential to deliver additional global economic                                                   (277) European Parliament (2021).

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              160 activity of around US D 13 trillion by 2030, or about 16  % higher cumulative GDP than today,  equivalent to 1.2  % add itional GDP growth per year.     A number of factors, including labour automation, innovation, and new competition , have an  impact on  AI-driven productivity growth. Micro factors, such as the pace of adoption of AI, and macro  factors, such as a country’s  global connectedness or labo ur-market structure, both contribute to the  size of th is impact. With regard to the impact on the supply chain, the McKinsey study reports that  61 % of executives have observed  decreased costs and 53  % increased revenues as a direct  result  of introducing artificial intelligence  into their supply chains.     The World Economic Forum highlights the impressive advance in AI technologies in recent years,  boosted by exponential increases in computing power and by the availability of massive amounts of  data, from software used to discover new drugs to algorithms used to predict our cultural interests  (280).  Technological innovation will also increase the efficiency and productivity of the global supply   chain , as transportation, logistic and comm unication costs all drop. On the other hand, a s artificial  intelligence systems are introduced into our core infrastructures, the risks posed by errors and blind  spots increase.       4.2 Impact on labour     The profound business transformation caused by the qui ck, efficient and accurate processing of large  amounts of data will greatly affect employment and labour. With regard to the labour market, experts  worldwide concur that AI will certainly  cause our workforce to evolve. Automation and early -stage AI  systems  are already changing the nature of employment and working conditions in multiple sectors.   AI tools, for instance, can limit errors caused by  human fatigue and improve the efficiency and  accuracy of work. Some have emphasised the loss of jobs to machines, although other sources  underline that other jobs will be created. In this case, the concept  of ‘collective intelligence ’ would  combine the accumulated knowledge of a group of people with the use of AI.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              161 The McKinsey study suggests that around 30  % of globa l working hours could be automated by  2030  (281), AI can help by taking over repetitive or dangerous tasks  from employees, who in turn  can focus on the types of work that require a more strategic or analytical approach . However, this  also requires the retrai ning of the existing workforce at a certain level  (282). Moreover , many AI  predictive statistics applications call for  data input that requir es extensive manual labour to  prepar e (283); this is  in contrast to the idea that AI can make sense of disorganised dat a.    At the same time, technological advances could yield greater inequality, particularly in labo ur markets.  As automation substitutes for labo ur across different economic sectors, the displacement of workers  by machines m ay exacerbate the gap between retu rns to capital and returns to labo ur. On the other  hand, it is also possible that the displacement of workers by technology will, in aggregate, result in a  net increase in safe and rewarding jobs. This may give rise to a job market increasingly segregated  into ‘low-skill/low -pay’ and ‘high -skill/high -pay’ segments, which in turn could lead to increased  social tensions  (284). In parallel , there is likely to be increased demand for experts in designing and  delivering training on AI solutions.       5 Overview of the main AI-affected a reas relevant for the study    For the purpose of this study, three areas in which AI technologies have a significant impact are  particularly relevant: crime, law enforcement and criminal justice. Across these last two areas, ethical,  fundamental rights and privacy concerns are clearly at stake.

The various capabilities of AI described in Chapter  3 make  it attractive for malicious actors. AI can emulate many act ions performed by humans, and in some  instances can exceed human performance in terms of efficiency and scalability. With AI , certain crimes  can be performed on a much larger scale, targeting thousands of victims simultaneously  (285). It is  clear that, as AI technolog ies expand in capability and deployment, so too do the risks of criminal  exploitation  (286), as described in the scenarios presented in Chapter  5.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              163 Some of the international reports reviewed for this  study suggest that the interlinkages between  criminality and AI can be threefold, as shown below.     1. AI as a tool for crime : criminals use the capabil ities described in the study (see 3.2 AI  subfields ) to facilitate their criminal actions in the real world, such as the production and sale of  copyright and design -infringing goods or digital content ; AI prediction technologies are used to  forecast the behaviour of people or institutions to discover and exploit vulnerabilities; AI generated fake content or videos is used to dece ive and extort , etc. Chapter  4 provides a wide  range of scenarios regard ing copyright and design infringements of both physical products and  digital content.     2. AI systems targeted by criminals : circumventing protective systems to commit a crime (e.g.  CAPTCHA breaking, detecting and removing digital watermarks, etc.); evading detection or  prosecu tion for crimes already committed;  or making trusted or critical systems fail or behave  erratically in order to cause damage or undermine public trust.     3. AI as context for a crime : a number of fraudulent activities are based on the victim’s belief that  a particular AI functionality is possible, even though it is not , or that it is possible, but not actually  used in the fraud  (287).    A single crime may fall into two or  three  of the above  categories simultaneously: an attack on an AI  system is often carried out using  another AI system, while the fraudulent simulation of non -existent AI  capabilities might be executed using other existing AI technologies. Moreover , it is worth emphasis ing  that while a various  limits and barriers are being introduced with regard to the legitimate use of AI  technologies, these are of course not relevant for criminals, who are going to exploit the capabilities  of these  innovative tools without any legal, ethical or other limit s, and ultimately tak e advantage of the  respect for these  limits that society legitim ately require s on the part of  law enforcement and other  authorities .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              164 5.2 Impact on law enforcement and criminal justice     The wide range of existing legitimate AI applications include s systems for crime prevention and  detection. A I tools analy se sounds, objects, faces, and DNA and uncover digital traces of crimes. AI  is also being developed to predict and prevent crime, and not merely detect what has occurred. There  are several tools available or under development in numerous juris dictions to inform initial sentencing,  parole, and decisions regarding post -release monitoring and rehabilitation  (288).    As AI and related technologies are used to make determinations and predictions in high -stakes  domains such as criminal justice and law e nforcement, they have the potential to impact basic  fundamental rights and liberties in profound ways. AI will enhance the uncovering and investigation of   criminal activities. Facial recognition  and fingerprint  technology are increasingly be ing used. Mass  surveillance is also more and more possible.     The UNICRI -INTERPOL report ‘Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Law Enforcement ’ analyses the  contribution AI and robotics can make in policing  (289) and examines use cases at var ious stages of  development b y national law enforcement authorities , demonstrating that the use of AI in this context  is a present reality  (290). Some interesting examples of AI use cases for law enforcement include the  following:     1. autonomously research ing, analy sing and respond ing to requests for international mutual legal  assistance;     2. advanced virtual autopsy tools to help determine cause s of death;     3. forecasting where and what type of crimes are likely to occur (predictive policing and crime  hotspot analytics) to optimi se law enforceme nt resources;                                                      (288) Korean Institute of Criminology, International Center of Comparative Criminology (2018).

The recent Frontex report ‘Artificial Intelligence -Based Capabilities for the European Border and Coast  Guard’ provides insights into the current landscape of AI -based  capabilities in border security through  a number of case studies, as well cross -cutting barriers and enablers for future AI adoption  (292).    Law enforcement and border guards should continuously monitor the new technology landscape to  ensure preparedness  to appropriately  respond . Moreover , as is widely discussed at international level,  law enforcement authorities  and the criminal justice system should ensure fairness, accountability,  transparency and that the use of AI is effectively communicated to the publ ic. Experts highlight that   the use of AI in the justice system also presents many opportunities to figure out how to effectively  use it without violating an individual’s privacy  (293).    With regards to criminal justice, numerous examples can be found of judi cial systems making use of  AI tools in criminal proceedings. According to international studies on the topic, AI is currently  employed in the US , for instance,  to assess the risk of future unwanted behavio ur by an accused  person ( e.g. commit ting a new crim e or the same crime, or failure to appear in court)  (294). Some  countries also use automated risk assessment tools in the criminal justice system, though  their use  may be  questioned. In fact, some technological solutions, such as those  for estimating  a crimi nal                                                   (291) UNICRI, INTERPOL (2018).

In fact, d ata  reflect the social, historical and political conditions i n which they were created and collected. AI  systems ‘learn’ based on the data they are using. This, along with many other factors, can lead to  biased, inaccurate, and unfair outcomes. The quality and quantity of data is th erefore  essential in  limiting poss ible bias  (295). In addition, human control over the final decision must  always  be ensured .    In this context , in December 2018 , the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) of  the Council of Europe adopted the ‘Ethical Charter on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Judicial  Systems and their environment ’ (296), which encompasses the following five principles:     1. principle of respect for fundamental rights : ensure that the design and implementation of  artificial intelligence tools and services a re compatible with fundamental rights ;    2. principle of non -discrimination : specifically prevent the development or intensification of any  discrimination among  individuals or groups of individuals ;    3. principle of quality and security : with regard to the proces sing of judicial decisions and data,  use certified sources and intangible data with models elaborated in a multi -disciplinary manner,  in a secure technological environment ;    4. principle of transparency, impartiality and fairness : make data processing methods   accessible and understandable, and authorise external audits ;    5. principle of ‘user control ’: eschew  a prescriptive approach and ensure that users are informed  actors and in control of the choices made  (297).

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              167     5.3 Ethical, fundamental rights and privacy concerns    All of the above  points  raise an increasing number of ethical, fundamental rights and privacy concerns.  The ongoing debate is very lively globally as well as within the EU. As mentioned  above , AI algorithms  are powered by data that are collected and processed by technologies that increasingly surround us  at every minute of our lives . This process raises  privacy and ethical concerns. Explainable AI could  allow  authorities to clarify to the court how the algorithms work, and which dataset s they are work ing  from.    Many experts argue that AI algorithms must be built to align with overarching  human  goals.  The EU  Parliament , in its Resolution of 6  October 2021 on artificial intelligence in criminal law and its use by  the police and judicial authorities in cr iminal matters,  clearly stated that ‘AI should not be seen as an  end in itself, but as a tool, with the ultimate aim of increasing human well -being, human capabilities  and safety ’ (298). It also  stresse d that algorithms and AI should be ‘ ethical by design ’, with no built in bias , in a way that guarantees maximum protection of fundamental rights  (299). Therefore, regulatory  agencies shall be actively involved and fix the legal boundaries within which these technologies are  allowed to operate. Retroactive deconst ruction of the algorithm could be required to assess the factors  that influence a model’s predictions.     At first, it was thought that regulation could control the way  AI is used : open letters were sent to  government s with long lists of signatories attached , asking for regulation to be enacted. This  approach   has failed to bear fruit. More recently, the focus has been on developing ethical principles to guide the  development of AI -enabled solutions. These principles are useful indications of what we expect fr om  AI (and what we wish to avoid), but they are not enough, as they fall short of describing how particular  solutions should adhere to them.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND  ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN              168 The most recent expectation is that design (and design methodologies) will enable us to apply these  principles, bu t whether this will suffice is not yet clear  (300). AI algorithms must be built to align with  overarching  human  goals. The debate is still open and will necessarily evolve with the evolution of  technology.     With regard  to citizens’ fundamental rights and  the avoid ance of  potential liability, the use of AI in law  enforcement should ensure  that it  respect s the following key guiding principles .    • Responsibility : ensure  the availab ility of  measures to redress adverse individual or social  effects of an algorithmic decision system, and designate a person responsible for the timely  remedy of such issues.   • Fairness : the use of technology  should not breach rights such as the right to due process, the  presumption of innocence, freedom of expression, and freedom from discr imination.   • Accountability : a culture of accountability must be established at an institutional and  organi sational level.   • Transparency : the path taken by the system to arrive at a certain conclusion or decision must  not be a ‘black box’.   • Explainability : the  decisions and actions of a system must be comprehensible to human  users  (301).      6 AI Regulation  in the European Union     In 2020,  the EC’s white paper on ’AI - A European approach to excellence and trust‘  (302) set out policy  options for promoti ng AI while add ressing the risks associated with certain uses. In this context, the  proposed regulatory framework on AI has the objective s of ensuring that AI systems used in the EU                                                   (300) Evans -Gree nwood P., Hanson R., Goodman S., and D.

In April 2021, the European Commission publishe d the first proposal for a legal framework on AI,  namely  the draft Artificial Intelligence Act  (304). This proposed AI Act addresses the risks  stemming  from the various uses of AI systems while at the same time promoting AI innovation, to find a proper  balance between the need to preserve individual safety and fundamental rights without overly  inhibiting  AI innovation. To this end, the draft AI Act envisages a risk -based approach that prohibits  specific unacceptable uses of AI , heavily regulates some other uses entailing significant risks, and  encourages the adoption of codes of conduct regard ing uses of  AI that present limited or no risk  (305).    The gradation of risks is represented using a four -level pyramid : unacceptable risk s, high risk s, limited  risks and minimal risk s.
