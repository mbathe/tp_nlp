6 Foreword   The Future  Computed   By Brad Smith and Harry Shum  
2Twenty years ago, we both worked at Microsoft, but on  opposite sides of the globe. In 1998, one of us was living and  working in China as a founding member of the Microsoft  Research Asia lab in Beijing. Five thousand miles away, the  other was based at the company’s headquarters, just outside  of Seattle, leading the international legal and corporate  affairs team. While we lived on separate continents and in  quite different cultures, we shared a common workplace  experience within Microsoft, albeit with differing routines  before we arrived at the office.  At that time in the United States, waking to the scent of  brewing coffee was a small victory in technology automation.  It meant that you had remembered to set the timer on the  programmable coffee maker the night before. As you drank  that first cup of coffee, you typically watched the morning  news on a standard television or turned the pages of the  local newspaper to learn what had happened while you slept.  For many people a daily diary was your lifeline, reminding  you of the coming day’s activities: a morning meeting at the  office, dial-in numbers and passcodes for conference calls,  the address for your afternoon doctor’s appointment, and  a list of to-dos including programming the VCR to record  your favorite show. Before you left for the day, you might  have placed a few phone calls (and often left messages on  answering machines), including to remind sitters when to  pick up children or confirm dinner plans. The Future  Computed
3Twenty years ago, for most people in China, an LED alarm  clock was probably the sole digital device in your bedroom.  A bound personal calendar helped you track the day’s  appointments, addresses, and phone numbers. After sending  your kids off to school, you likely caught up on the world’s  happenings from a radio broadcast while you ate a quick  breakfast of soya milk with Youtiao at your neighborhood  restaurant. In 1998, commuters in Beijing buried their noses  in newspapers and books – not smartphones and laptops –  on the crowded trains and buses traveling to and from the  city’s centers.   But today, while many of our fundamental morning routines  remain the same, a lot has also changed as technology has  altered how we go about them. Today a morning in Beijing is  still different from a morning in Seattle, but not as different  as it used to be. Consider for a moment that in both places  the smartphone charging on your bedside table is the device  that not only wakes you, but serves up headlines and updates  you on your friends’ social lives. You read all the email that  arrived overnight, text your sister to confirm dinner plans,  update the calendar invite to your sitter with details for  soccer practice, and then check traffic conditions. Today, in  2018, you can order and pay for a double skinny latte or tea  from Starbucks and request a ride-share to drive you to work  from that same smartphone.  Compared with the world just 20 years ago, we take a lot of  things for granted that used to be the stuff of science fiction.  Clearly much can change in just two decades. The Future  Computed
4Twenty years from now, what will your morning look like?  At Microsoft, we imagine a world where your personal digital  assistant Cortana talks with your calendar while you sleep.  She works with your other smart devices at home to rouse  you at the end of a sleep cycle when it’s easiest to wake  and ensures that you have plenty of time to shower, dress,  commute and prepare for your first meeting. As you get  ready, Cortana reads the latest news, research reports and  social media activity based on your current work, interests  and tasks, all of which she gleaned from your calendar,  meetings, communications, projects and writings. She  updates you on the weather, upcoming meetings, the people  you will see, and when you should leave home based on  traffic projections.  Acting on the request you made a year before, Cortana  also knows that it’s your sister’s birthday and she’s ordered  flowers (lilies, your sister’s favorite) to be delivered later  that day. (Cortana also reminds you about this so that you’ll  know to say, “you’re welcome” when your sister thanks you.)  Cortana has also booked a reservation for a restaurant that  you both like at a time that’s convenient for both of your  schedules.  In 2038, digital devices will help us do more with one of our  most precious commodities: time. The Future  Computed
5In 20 years, you might take your first meeting from home by  slipping on a HoloLens or other device where you’ll meet  and interact with your colleagues and clients around a virtual  boardroom powered by mixed reality. Your presentation  and remarks will be translated automatically into each  participant’s native language, which they will hear through  an earpiece or phone. A digital assistant like Cortana will  then automatically prepare a summary of the meeting with  tasks assigned to the participants and reminders placed on  their schedules based on the conversation that took place  and the decisions the participants made.  In 2038, a driverless vehicle will take you to your first  meeting while you finalize a presentation on the car’s digital  hub. Cortana will summarize research and data pulled from  newly published articles and reports, creating infographics  with the new information for you to review and accept.  Based on your instructions, she’ll automatically reply to  routine emails and reroute those that can be handled by  others, which she will request with a due date based on the  project timeline. In fact, some of this is already happening  today, but two decades from now everyone will take these  kinds of capabilities for granted. Increasingly, we imagine that a smart device will monitor  your health vitals. When something is amiss, Cortana  will schedule an appointment, and she will also track and  schedule routine checkups, vaccines and tests. Your digital  assistant will book appointments and reserve time on your The Future  Computed
6calendar on days that are most convenient. After work a  self-driving car will take you home, where you’ll join your  doctor for a virtual checkup. Your mobile device will take  your blood pressure, analyze your blood and oxygen level,  and send the results to your doctor, who will analyze the  data during your call. Artificial intelligence will help your  doctor analyze your results using more than a terabyte of  health data, helping her accurately diagnose and prescribe  a customized treatment based on your unique physiological  traits. Within a few hours, your medication will arrive at  your door by drone, which Cortana will remind you to take.  Cortana will also monitor your progress and, if you don’t  improve, she’ll ask your permission to book a follow-up  appointment with the doctor.  When it’s time to take a break from the automated world of  the future, you won’t call a travel agent or even book online  your own flight or hotel as you do today. You’ll simply say,  “Hey, Cortana, please plan a two-week holiday.” She’ll  propose a custom itinerary based on the season, your budget,  availability and interests. You’ll then decide where you want  to go and stay. Looking back, it’s fascinating to see how technology has  transformed the way we live and work over the span of  twenty years. Digital technology powered by the cloud  has made us smarter and helped us optimize our time, be  more productive and communicate with one another more  effectively. And this is just the beginning. The Future  Computed
7Before long, many mundane and repetitive tasks will be  handled automatically by AI, freeing us to devote our time  and energy to more productive and creative endeavors. More  broadly, AI will enable humans to harness vast amounts  of data and make breakthrough advances in areas like  healthcare, agriculture, education and transportation. We’re  already seeing how AI-bolstered computing can help doctors  reduce medical mistakes, farmers improve yields, teachers  customize instruction and researchers unlock solutions to  protect our planet.  But as we’ve seen over the past 20 years, as digital advances  bring us daily benefits they also raise a host of complex  questions and broad concerns about how technology will  affect society. We have seen this as the internet has come  of age and become an essential part of our work and private  lives. The impact ranges from debates around the dinner  table about how distracting our smartphones have become  to public deliberations about cybersecurity, privacy, and  even the role social media plays in terrorism. This has given  birth not just to new public policies and regulations, but  to new fields of law and to new ethical considerations in  the field of computer science. And this seems certain to  continue as AI evolves and the world focuses on the role it  will play in society. As we look to the future, it’s important  that we maintain an open and questioning mind while we  seek to take advantage of the opportunities and address the  challenges that this new technology creates.The Future  Computed
8The development of privacy rules over the past two decades  provides a good preview of what we might expect to see  more broadly in the coming years for issues relating to AI.  In 1998, one would have been hard-pressed to find a fulltime “privacy lawyer.” This legal discipline was just emerging  with the advent of the initial digital privacy laws, perhaps  most notably the European Community’s Data Protection  Directive, adopted in 1995. But the founding of the  International Association of Privacy Professionals, or IAPP,  the leading professional organization in the field, was still  two years away.  Today, the IAPP has over 20,000 members in 83 countries.  Its meetings take place in large convention centers filled  with thousands of people. There’s no shortage of topics  for IAPP members to discuss, including questions of  corporate responsibility and even ethics when it comes to  the collection, use, and protection of consumer information.  There’s also no lack of work for privacy lawyers now that  data protection agencies — the privacy regulators of our age  — are operating in over 100 countries. Privacy regulation,  a branch of law that barely existed two decades ago, has  become one of the defining legal fields of our time.  What will the future bring when it comes to the issues,  policies and regulations for artificial intelligence? In  computer science, will concerns about the impact of AI  mean that the study of ethics will become a requirement for  computer programmers and researchers? We believe that’s The Future  Computed
9a safe bet. Could we see a Hippocratic Oath for coders like  we have for doctors? That could make sense. We’ll all need  to learn together and with a strong commitment to broad  societal responsibility. Ultimately the question is not only  what computers can do. It’s what computers should do. Similarly, will the future give birth to a new legal field called  “AI law”? Today AI law feels a lot like privacy law did in  1998. Some existing laws already apply to AI, especially  tort and privacy law, and we’re starting to see a few specific  new regulations emerge, such as for driverless cars. But  AI law doesn’t exist as a distinct field. And we’re not yet  walking into conferences and meeting people who introduce  themselves as “AI lawyers.” By 2038, it’s safe to assume that  the situation will be different. Not only will there be AI  lawyers practicing AI law, but these lawyers, and virtually all  others, will rely on AI itself to assist them with their practice.   The real question is not whether AI law will emerge, but how  it can best come together — and over what timeframe. We  don’t have all the answers, but we’re fortunate to work every  day with people who are asking the right questions. As they  point out, AI technology needs to continue to develop and  mature before rules can be crafted to govern it. A consensus  then needs to be reached about societal principles and values  to govern AI development and use, followed by best practices  to live up to them. Then we’re likely to be in a better position  for governments to create legal and regulatory rules for  everyone to follow.The Future  Computed
10This will take time — more than a couple of years in all  likelihood, but almost certainly less than two decades.  Already it’s possible to start defining six ethical principles  that should guide the development and use of artificial  intelligence. These principles should ensure that AI systems  are fair, reliable and safe, private and secure, inclusive,  transparent, and accountable. The more we build a detailed  understanding of these or similar principles — and the more  technology developers and users can share best practices to  implement them — the better served the world will be as we  begin to contemplate societal rules to govern AI. Today, there are some people who might say that ethical  principles and best practices are all that is needed as we  move forward. They suggest that technology innovation  doesn’t really need the help of regulators, legislators and  lawyers.  While they make some important points, we believe this  view is unrealistic and even misguided. AI will be like every  technology that has preceded it. It will confer enormous  benefits on society. But inevitably, some people will use  it to cause harm. Just as the advent of the postal service  led criminals to invent mail fraud and the telegraph was  followed by wire fraud, the years since 1998 have seen both  the adoption of the internet as a tool for progress and the  rise of the internet as a new arena for fraud, practiced in  increasingly creative and disturbing ways on a global basis. The Future  Computed
11We must assume that by 2038, we’ll grapple with the  issues that arise when criminal enterprises and others use  AI in ways that are objectionable and even harmful. And  undoubtedly other important questions will need to be  addressed regarding societally acceptable uses for AI. It will  be impossible to address these issues effectively without a  new generation of laws. So, while we can’t afford to stifle  AI technology by adopting laws before we understand the  issues that lie ahead of us, neither can we make the mistake  of doing nothing now and waiting for two decades before  getting started. We need to strike a balance.  As we consider principles, policies and laws to govern AI, we  must also pay attention to AI’s impact on workers around the  globe. What jobs will AI eliminate? What jobs will it create?  If there has been one constant over 250 years of technological  change, it has been the ongoing impact of technology on jobs  — the creation of new jobs, the elimination of existing jobs,  and the evolution of job tasks and content. This too is certain  to continue with the adoption of AI. Will AI create more jobs than it will eliminate? Or will it be  the other way around? Economic historians have pointed out  that each prior industrial revolution created jobs on a net  basis. There are many reasons to think this will also be the  case with AI, but the truth is that no one has a crystal ball.  It’s difficult to predict detailed employment trends with  certainty because the impact of new technology on jobs is  often indirect and subject to a wide range of interconnected  innovations and events. Consider the automobile. One didn’t  need to be a soothsayer to predict that the adoption of cars The Future  Computed
12would mean fewer jobs producing horse-drawn carriages and  new jobs manufacturing automobile tires. But that was just  part of the story.1  The transition to cars initially contributed to an agricultural  depression that affected the entire American economy in  the 1920s and 1930s. Why? Because as the horse population  declined rapidly, so did the fortunes of American farmers. In  the preceding decade roughly a quarter of agricultural output  had been used to feed horses. But fewer horses meant less  demand for hay, so farmers shifted to other crops, flooding  the market and depressing agricultural prices more broadly.  This agricultural depression impacted local banks in rural  areas, and then this rippled across the entire financial system. Other indirect effects had a positive economic impact as  the sale of automobiles led to the expansion of industry  sectors that, at first glance, appear disconnected from cars.  One example was a new industry to provide consumer  credit. Henry Ford’s invention of the assembly line made  cars affordable to a great many families, but cars were still  expensive and people needed to borrow money to pay for  them. As one historian noted, “installment credit and the  automobile were both cause and consequence of each other’s  success.”2 In short, a new financial services market took flight. Something similar happened with advertising. As passengers  traveled in cars driving 30 miles per hour or more, “a sign  had to be grasped instantly or it wouldn’t be grasped at all.”3   Among other things, this led to the creation of corporate   The Future  Computed
13logos that could be recognized immediately wherever they  appeared.  Consider the indirect impact of the automobile on the  island of Manhattan alone. The cars driving down Broadway  contributed to the creation of new financial jobs on Wall  Street and new advertising positions on Madison Avenue. Yet  there’s little indication that anyone predicted either of these  new job categories when cars first appeared on city streets. One of the lessons for AI and the future is that we’ll all need  to be alert and agile to the impact of this new technology  on jobs. While we can predict generally that new jobs will  be created and some existing jobs will disappear, none of us  should develop such a strong sense of certainty that we lose  the ability to adapt to the surprises that probably await us. But as we brace ourselves for uncertainty, one thing remains  clear. New jobs will require new skills. Indeed, many existing  jobs will also require new skills. That is what always happens  in the face of technological change. Consider what we’ve seen over the past three decades. Today  every organization of more than modest size has one or more  employees who support its IT, or information technology.  Very few of these jobs existed 30 years ago. But it’s not  just IT staff that needed to acquire IT skills. In the early  1980s, people in offices wrote with a pen on paper, and then  secretaries used typewriters to turn that prose into something  that was actually legible. By the end of the decade, secretaries  learned to use word processing terminals. And then in the  1990s, everyone learned to do their own writing on a PC and The Future  Computed
14the number of secretaries declined. IT training wasn’t just  reserved for IT professionals.  In a similar way, we’re already seeing increasing demand for  new digital and other technical skills, with critical shortages  appearing in some disciplines. This is expanding beyond  coding and computer science to data science and other  fields that are growing in importance as we enter the world’s  Fourth Industrial Revolution. More and more, this isn’t just  a question of encouraging people to learn new skills, but of  finding new ways to help them acquire the skills they will  need. Surveys of parents show that they overwhelmingly  want their children to have the opportunity to learn to code.  And at Microsoft, when we offer our employees new courses  on the latest AI advances, demand is always extremely high. The biggest challenges involve the creation of ways to help  people learn new skills, and then rethinking how the labor  market operates to enable employers and employees to move  in more agile ways to fill new positions. The good news is  that many communities and countries have developed new  innovations to address this issue, and there are opportunities  to learn from these emerging practices. Some are new  approaches to longstanding programs, like Switzerland’s  successful youth apprenticeships. Others are more recent  innovations spurred by entities such as LinkedIn and its  online tools and services and nonprofit ventures like the  Markle Foundation’s Skillful initiative in Colorado.  The impact of AI, the cloud and other new technologies  won’t stop there. A few decades ago, workers in many  countries mostly enjoyed traditional employer-employee The Future  Computed
15relationships and worked in offices or manufacturing  facilities. Technology has helped upend this model as more  workers engage in alternative work arrangements through  remote and part-time work, as contractors or through  project-based engagements. And most studies suggest that  these trends will continue. For AI and other technologies to benefit people as broadly  as possible, we’ll need to adapt employment laws and labor  policies to address these new realities. Many of our current  labor laws were adopted in response to the innovations  of the early 20th century. Now, a century later, they’re no  longer suited to the needs of either workers or employers. For  example, employment laws in most countries assume that  everyone is either a full-time employee or an independent  contractor, making no room for people who work in the new  economy for Uber, Lyft or other similar services that are  emerging in every field from tech support to caregiving.  Similarly, health insurance and other benefits were designed  for full-time employees who remain with a single employer  for many years. But they aren’t as effective for individuals  who work for multiple companies simultaneously or change  jobs more frequently. Our social safety net — including the  United States’ Social Security system — is a product of the  first half of the last century. There is an increasingly pressing  need to adapt these vital public policies to the world that is  changing today.The Future  Computed
16As we all think about the future, the pace of change can feel  more than a little daunting. By looking back to technology  in 1998, we can readily appreciate how much change we’ve  lived through already. Looking ahead to 2038, we can begin  to anticipate the rapid changes that lie ahead — changes that  will create opportunities and challenges for communities and  countries around the world. For us, some key conclusions emerge.  First, the companies and countries that will fare best in the  AI era will be those that embrace these changes rapidly  and effectively. The reason is straightforward: AI will be  useful wherever intelligence is useful, helping us to be  more productive in nearly every field of human endeavor  and leading to economic growth. Put simply, new jobs and  economic growth will accrue to those that embrace the  technology, not those that resist it.  Second, while we believe that AI will help improve daily  life in many ways and help solve big societal problems, we  can’t afford to look to this future with uncritical eyes. There  will be challenges as well as opportunities. This is why we  need to think beyond the technology itself to address the  need for strong ethical principles, the evolution of laws, the  importance of training for new skills, and even labor market  reforms. This must all come together if we’re going to make  the most of this new technology.The Future  Computed
17Third, we need to address these issues together with a sense  of shared responsibility. In part this is because AI technology  won’t be created by the tech sector alone. At Microsoft we’re  working to “democratize AI” in a manner that’s similar to  the way we “democratized the PC.” Just as our work that  started in the 1970s enabled organizations across society to  create their own custom applications for the PC, the same  thing will happen with AI. Our approach to AI is making the  fundamental AI building blocks like computer vision, speech,  and knowledge recognition available to every individual  and organization to build their own AI-based solutions. We  believe this is far preferable to having only a few companies  control the future of AI. But just as this will spread broadly  the opportunity for others to create AI-based systems, it will  spread broadly the shared responsibility needed to address  AI issues and their implications. As technology evolves so quickly, those of us who create  AI, cloud and other innovations will know more than  anyone else how these technologies work. But that doesn’t  necessarily mean that we will know how best to address the  role they should play in society. This requires that people  in government, academia, business, civil society, and other  interested stakeholders come together to help shape this  future. And increasingly we need to do this not just in a  single community or country, but on a global basis. Each of  us has a responsibility to participate — and an important role  to play.The Future  Computed
18All of this leads us to what may be one of the most important  conclusions of all. We’re reminded of something that Steve  Jobs famously talked about repeatedly: he always sought to  work at the intersection of engineering and the liberal arts.  One of us grew up learning computer science and the other  started in the liberal arts. Having worked together for many  years at Microsoft, it’s clear to both of us that it will be even  more important to connect these fields in the future. At one level, AI will require that even more people specialize  in digital skills and data science. But skilling-up for an  AI-powered world involves more than science, technology,  engineering and math. As computers behave more like  humans, the social sciences and humanities will become even  more important. Languages, art, history, economics, ethics,  philosophy, psychology and human development courses  can teach critical, philosophical and ethics-based skills that  will be instrumental in the development and management of  AI solutions. If AI is to reach its potential in serving humans,  then every engineer will need to learn more about the liberal  arts and every liberal arts major will need to learn more  about engineering.  The Future  Computed
19We’re all going to need to spend more time talking with,  listening to, and learning from each other. As two people  from different disciplines who’ve benefited from doing just  that, we appreciate firsthand the valuable and even enjoyable  opportunities this can create.  We hope that the pages that follow can help as we all get  started.

26 I propose to consider  the question.   Can machines think?   Alan Turing, 1950“ ”
27In the summer of 1956, a team of researchers at Dartmouth  College met to explore the development of computer systems  capable of learning from experience, much as people do.  But, even this seminal moment in the development of AI  was preceded by more than a decade of exploration of  the notion of machine intelligence, exemplified by Alan  Turing’s quintessential test: a machine could be considered  “intelligent” if a person interacting with it (by text in those  days) could not tell whether it was a human or a computer.  Researchers have been advancing the state of the art in AI in  the decades since the Dartmouth conference. Developments  in subdisciplines such as machine vision, natural language  understanding, reasoning, planning and robotics have  produced an ongoing stream of innovations, many of which  have already become part of our daily lives. Route-planning  features in navigation systems, search engines that retrieve  and rank content from the vast amounts of information  on the internet, and machine vision capabilities that  enable postal services to automatically recognize and route  handwritten addresses are all enabled by AI.  At Microsoft, we think of AI as a set of technologies that  enable computers to perceive, learn, reason and assist in  decision-making to solve problems in ways that are similar  to what people do. With these capabilities, how computers  understand and interact with the world is beginning to  feel far more natural and responsive than in the past, when  computers could only follow pre-programmed routines.The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
28Not so long ago we interacted with computers via a  command line interface. And while the graphical user  interface was an important step forward, we will soon be  routinely interacting with computers just by talking to  them, just as we would to a person. To enable these new  capabilities, we are, in effect, teaching computers to see, hear,  understand and reason.1 Key technologies include: Vision: the ability of computers to “see” by recognizing what  is in a picture or video. Speech:  the ability of computers to “listen” by understanding  the words that people say and to transcribe them into text. Language: the ability of computers to “comprehend” the  meaning of the words, taking into account the many nuances  and complexities of language (such as slang and idiomatic  expressions). Knowledge: the ability of a computer to “reason” by  understanding the relationship between people, things,  places, events and the like. For instance, when a search result  for a movie provides information about the cast and other  movies those actors were in, or at work when you participate  in a meeting and the last several documents that you shared  with the person you’re meeting with are automatically  delivered to you. These are examples of a computer  reasoning by drawing conclusions about which information is  related to other information. The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
29 Computers are learning the way people do; namely, through  experience. For computers, experience is captured in the  form of data. In predicting how bad traffic will be, for  example, computers draw upon data regarding historical  traffic flows based on the time of day, seasonal variations,  the weather, and major events in the area such as concerts or  sporting events. More broadly, rich “graphs” of information  are foundational to enabling computers to develop an  understanding of relevant relationships and interactions  between people, entities and events. In developing AI  systems, Microsoft is drawing upon graphs of information  that include knowledge about the world, about work and  about people. People Chart 1.

30Thanks in part to the availability of much more data,  researchers have made important strides in these  technologies in the past few years. In 2015, researchers at  Microsoft announced that they had taught computers to  identify objects in a photograph or video as accurately as  people do in a test using the standard ImageNet 1K database  of images.2 In 2017, Microsoft’s researchers announced they  had developed a speech recognition system that understood  spoken words as accurately as a team of professional  transcribers, with an error rate of just 5.1 percent using the  standard Switchboard dataset.3 In essence, AI-enhanced  computers can, in most cases, see and hear as accurately as  humans. Much work remains to be done to make these innovations  applicable to everyday use. Computers still may have a hard  time understanding speech in a noisy environment where  people speak over one another or when presented with  unfamiliar accents or languages. It is especially challenging  to teach computers to truly understand not just what words  were spoken, but what the words mean and to reason by  drawing conclusions and making decisions based on them.  To enable computers to comprehend meaning and answer  more complex questions, we need to take a big-picture view,  understand and evaluate context, and bring in background  knowledge. The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
31Why Now? Researchers have been working on AI for decades. Progress  has accelerated over the past few years thanks in large  part to three developments: the increased availability of  data; growing cloud computing power; and more powerful  algorithms developed by AI researchers.  As our lives have become increasingly digitized and sensors  have become cheap and ubiquitous, more data than ever  before is available for computers to learn from.                  Only with data can computers discern the patterns, often  subtle, that enable them to “see,” “hear” and “understand.” Analyzing all this data requires massive computing power,  which is available thanks to the efficiencies of cloud  computing.

32Researchers at Microsoft, other technology firms, universities  and governments have drawn upon this combination of the  availability of this data, and with it ready access to powerful  computing and breakthroughs in AI techniques — such  as “deep learning” using so-called “deep neural nets”— to  enable computers to mimic how people learn.  In many ways, AI is still maturing as a technology. Most  of the progress to date has been in teaching computers to  perform narrow tasks — play a game, recognize an image,  predict traffic. We have a long way to go to imbue computers  with “general” intelligence. Today’s AI cannot yet begin to  compete with a child’s ability to understand and interact  with the world using senses such as touch, sight and smell.  And AI systems have only the most rudimentary ability  to understand human expression, tone, emotion and the  subtleties of human interaction. In other words, AI today is  strong on “IQ” but weak on “EQ.” At Microsoft, we’re working toward endowing computers  with more nuanced capabilities. We believe an integrated  approach that combines various AI disciplines will lead to  the development of more sophisticated tools that can help  people perform more complex, multifaceted tasks. Then, as  we learn how to combine multiple IQ functions with abilities  that come naturally to people — like applying knowledge of  one task to another, having a commonsense understanding of  the world, interacting naturally, or knowing when someone The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
33is trying to be funny or sarcastic, and the difference between  those — AI will become even more helpful. While this is  clearly a formidable challenge, when machines can integrate  the smarts of IQ and the empathy of EQ in their interactions,  we will have achieved what we call “conversational AI.”  This will be an important step forward in the evolution of  computer-human interaction. Microsoft’s Approach to AI When Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft over 40  years ago, their aim was to bring the benefits of computing  — then largely locked up in mainframes — to everyone.  They set out to build a “personal” computer that would  help people be more productive at home, at school and at  work. Today, Microsoft is aiming to do much the same with  AI. We’re building AI systems that are designed to amplify  natural human ingenuity. We’re deploying AI systems with  the goal of making them available to everyone and aspiring  to build AI systems that reflect timeless societal values so  that AI earns the trust of all.4The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
34Amplifying Human Ingenuity We believe that AI offers incredible opportunities to drive  widespread economic and social progress. The key to  attaining these benefits is to develop AI in such a way that  it is human-centered. Put simply, we aim to develop AI in  order to augment human abilities, especially humankind’s  innate ingenuity. We want to combine the capabilities of  computers with human capabilities to enable people to  achieve more. Computers are very good at remembering things. Absent a  system failure, computers never forget. Computers are very  good at probabilistic reasoning, something many people  are not so good at. Computers are very good at discerning  patterns in data that are too subtle for people to notice.  With these capabilities, computers can help us make better  decisions. And this is a real benefit, because, as researchers  in cognitive psychology have established, human decisionmaking is often imperfect. Broadly speaking, the kind of  “computational intelligence” that computers can provide  will have a significant impact in almost any field where  intelligence itself has a role to play.The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
35AI improving medical image analysis   for clinicians     AI systems are already helping people tackle big problems.  A good example of this is “InnerEye,” a project in which  U.K.-based researchers at Microsoft have teamed up with  oncologists to develop an AI system to help treat cancer more  effectively.5  InnerEye uses AI technology originally developed for video  gameplay to analyze computed tomography (CT) and  magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and helps oncologists  target cancer treatment more quickly. CT and MRI scans  allow doctors to look inside a patient’s body in three  dimensions and study anomalies, such as tumors. For cancer  patients who are undergoing radiation therapy, oncologists  use such scans to delineate tumors from the surrounding  Scan for more on  InnerEye The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
36healthy tissue, bone and organs. In turn, this helps focus  the cell-damaging radiation treatment on the tumor while  avoiding healthy anatomy as much as possible. Today,  this 3-D delineation task is manual, slow and error-prone.  It requires a radiation oncologist to draw contours on  hundreds of cross-sectional images by hand, one at a time  — a process that can take hours. InnerEye is being designed  to accomplish the same task in a fraction of that time, while  giving oncologists full control over the accuracy of the final  delineation.  To create InnerEye’s automatic segmentation, researchers  used hundreds of raw CT and MRI scans (with all identifying  patient information removed). The scans were fed into an  AI system that learned to recognize tumors and healthy  anatomical structures with a clinical level of accuracy. As part  of the process, once the InnerEye automatic segmentation is  complete, the oncologist goes in to fine-tune the contours.  The doctor is in control at all times. With further advances,  InnerEye may be helpful for measuring and tracking tumor  changes over time, and even assessing whether a treatment   is working. The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
37AI helping researchers prevent disease  outbreaks     Another interesting example is “Project Premonition.” We’ve  all seen the heartbreaking stories of lives lost in recent years  to dangerous diseases like Zika, Ebola and dengue that are  transmitted from animals and insects to people. Today,  epidemiologists often don’t learn about the emergence of  these pathogens until an outbreak is underway. But this  project — developed by scientists and engineers at Microsoft  Research, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of  California Riverside and Vanderbilt University — is exploring  ways to detect pathogens in the environment so public  health officials can protect people from transmission before  an outbreak begins.6  What epidemiologists need are sensors that can detect when  pathogens are present. The researchers on this project hit  Scan for more on  Project   Premonition 
38upon an ingenious idea: why not use mosquitoes as sensors?  There are plenty of them and they feed on a wide range of  animals, extracting a small amount of blood that contains  genetic information about the animal bitten and pathogens  circulating in the environment.  The researchers use advanced autonomous drones capable of  navigating through complex environments to identify areas  where mosquitoes breed. They then deploy robotic traps that  can distinguish between the types of mosquitoes researchers  want to collect and other insects, based on wing movement  patterns. Once specimens are collected, cloud-scale genomics  and advanced AI systems identify the animals that the  mosquitoes have fed on and the pathogens that the animals  carry. In the past, this kind of genetic analysis could take a  month; now the AI capabilities of Project Premonition have  shortened that to about 12 hours. During a Zika outbreak in 2016, Project Premonition  drones and traps were tested in Houston. More than 20,000  mosquitoes were collected from nine different species,  including those known to carry Zika, dengue, West Nile  virus and malaria. Because the traps also gather data on  environmental conditions when an insect is collected, the  test provided useful data not only about pathogens in the  environment but also about mosquito behavior. This helped  Project Premonition researchers improve their ability to  target hotspots where mosquitoes breed. Researchers are  also working to improve how to identify known diseases and  detect the presence of previously unknown pathogens. The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
39While the project is still in its early stages, it may well point  the way toward an effective early warning system that will  detect some of the world’s most dangerous diseases in the  environment and help prevent deadly outbreaks. Making Human-Centered AI Available to All We cannot deliver on the promise of AI unless we make it  broadly available to all. People around the world can benefit  from AI — but only if AI technologies are available for  them. For Microsoft, this begins with basic R&D. Microsoft  Research, with its 26-year history, has established itself  as one of the premier research organizations in the world  contributing both to the advancement of computer science  and to Microsoft products and services. Our researchers  have published more than 22,000 papers in all areas of study  — from the environment to health, and from privacy to  security. Recently, we announced the creation of Microsoft  Artificial Intelligence and Research, a new group that brings  together approximately 7,500 computer scientists, researchers  and engineers. This group is chartered with pursuing a  deeper understanding of the computational foundations  of intelligence, and is focused on integrating research from  all fields of AI research in order to solve some of AI’s most  difficult challenges. We continue to encourage researchers to publish their  results broadly so that AI researchers around the world — at  universities, at other companies and in government settings  — can build on these advances.  The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
40                For our customers, we’re building AI capabilities into  our most popular products, such as Windows and Office.  Windows is more secure thanks to AI systems that detect  malware and automatically protect computers against it. In  Office, Researcher for Word helps you write more compelling  documents. Without leaving a document, you can find and  incorporate relevant information from across the web using  Bing “Knowledge Graph.” If you are creating a PowerPoint  presentation, PowerPoint Designer assesses the images and  text you’ve used, and provides design tips to create more  professional-looking slides, along with suggestions for text  captions for images to improve accessibility. And PowerPoint  Presentation Translator lets you engage diverse audiences  more effectively by breaking down language barriers through  auto-captioning in over 60 languages. This feature will also  aid people with hearing loss. AI is the enabling technology behind Cortana, Microsoft’s  personal digital assistant. Cortana is young, but she’s learning  fast. Already Cortana can help you schedule a meeting, make  a restaurant reservation and find answers to questions on Chart 3.   Source: The Economist The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
41a broad range of topics. Over time, Cortana will be able to  interact with other personal digital assistants to automatically  handle tasks that take up time and follow familiar patterns.  One of the key technologies that Cortana builds upon is  Bing, our search service. But instead of just providing links to  relevant information, Cortana uses Bing to discover answers  to your questions and provide them in a variety of more  context-rich ways.7   Microsoft is not only using AI technologies to create and  enhance our own products, we are also making them  available to developers so that they can build their own  AI-powered products. The Microsoft AI Platform offers  services, tools and infrastructure making AI development  easier for developers and organizations of any size. Our  service offerings include Microsoft Cognitive Services, a set  of pre-built AI capabilities including vision, speech, language  and search. All of these are hosted in the cloud and can be  easily integrated into applications. Some of these are also  customizable so that they can be better optimized to help  transform and improve business processes specific to an  organization’s industry and business needs. You can see the  breadth of these offerings below.      The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
42Chart 4.   Source: Microsoft CorporationThe Future  of Artificial  Intelligence                   We also have technologies available to simplify the creation  of “bots” that can engage with people more naturally and  conversationally. We offer a growing collection of coding  and management tools to make the AI development process  easier. And our infrastructure offerings help others develop  and deploy algorithms, and store their data and derive  insights from it. Finally, with Microsoft’s AI Business Solutions, we are  building systems of intelligence so organizations can better  understand and act on the information they collect in order  to be more productive.  One example of an AI Business Solution is Customer Care  Intelligence, currently being used by the Department of  Human Services (DHS) in Australia to transform how it  delivers services to citizens. At the heart of the program is 
43an expert system that uses a virtual assistant named “Roxy”  who helps claims processing officers answer questions and  solve problems. Roxy was trained using the DHS operational  blueprint that includes all of the agency’s policies and  procedures, and fed all of the questions that passed between  claims officers and DHS managers over a three-month  period. In early use, the system was able to answer nearly  80 percent of the questions it was asked. This is expected  to translate to about a 20 percent reduction in workload for  claims officers. The internal project with Roxy was so successful that DHS  is now developing virtual assistants that will interact directly  with citizens. One of these projects will target high school  seniors to help them decide whether to apply for a university  or enroll in a vocational program through Australia’s  Technical and Further Education program by helping them  navigate the qualification process. The Potential of Modern AI – Addressing  Societal Challenges At Microsoft, we aim to develop AI systems that will enable  people worldwide to more effectively address local and  global challenges, and to help drive progress and economic  opportunity.The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
44Today’s AI enables faster and more profound progress in  nearly every field of human endeavor, and it is essential  to enabling the digital transformation that is at the heart  of worldwide economic development. Every aspect of a  business or organization — from engaging with customers  to transforming products, optimizing operations and  empowering employees — can benefit from this digital  transformation.  But even more importantly, AI has the potential to help  society overcome some of its most daunting challenges.  Think of the most complex and pressing issues that humanity  faces: from reducing poverty and improving education, to  delivering healthcare and eradicating diseases, addressing  sustainability challenges such as growing enough food to feed  our fast-growing global population through to advancing  inclusion in our society. Then imagine what it would mean  in lives saved, suffering alleviated and human potential  unleashed if we could harness AI to help us find solutions to  these challenges. Providing effective healthcare at a reasonable cost to the  approximately 7.5 billion people on the planet is one of  society’s most pressing challenges. Whether it’s analyzing  massive amounts of patient data to uncover hidden patterns  that can point the way toward better treatments, identifying  compounds that show promise as new drugs or vaccines,  or unlocking the potential of personal medicine based on The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
45in-depth genetic analysis, AI offers vast opportunities to  transform how we understand disease and improve health.  Machine reading can help doctors quickly find important  information amid thousands of documents that they  otherwise wouldn’t have time to read. By doing so, it can  help medical professionals spend more of their time on  higher value and potentially lifesaving work. Providing safe and efficient transportation is another critical  challenge where AI can play an important role. AI-controlled  driverless vehicles could reduce traffic accidents and expand  the capacity of existing road infrastructure, saving hundreds  of thousands of lives every year while improving traffic flow  and reducing carbon emissions. These vehicles will also  facilitate greater inclusiveness in society by enhancing the  independence of those who otherwise are not able to drive  themselves. In education, the ability to analyze how people acquire  knowledge and then use that information to develop  predictive models for engagement and comprehension points  the way toward new approaches to education that combine  online and teacher-led instruction and may revolutionize  how people learn.  As demonstrated by Australia’s Department of Human  Services’ use of the natural language capabilities of Customer  Care Intelligence to answer questions, AI also has the  potential to improve how governments interact with their  citizens and deliver services. The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
46AI enabling people with low vision to hear  information about the world around them     Another area where AI has the potential to have a significant  positive impact is in serving the more than 1 billion people in  the world with disabilties. One example of how AI can make  a difference is a recent Microsoft offering called “Seeing AI,”  available in the iOS app store, that can assist people with  blindness and low vision as they navigate daily life.  Seeing AI was developed by a team that included a Microsoft  engineer who lost his sight at 7 years of age. This powerful  app, while still in its early stages, demonstrates the potential  for AI to empower people with disabilities by capturing  images from the user’s surroundings and instantly describing  what is happening. For example, it can read signs and menus,  recognize products through barcodes, interpret handwriting,  count currency, describe scenes and objects in the vicinity,  or, during a meeting, tell the user that there is a man and a  woman sitting across the table who are smiling and paying  close attention.8 Scan for more on  Seeing AI 
47              AI empowering farmers to be more  productive and increase their yield     And with the world’s population expected to grow by  nearly 2.5 billion people over the next quarter century, AI  offers significant opportunities to increase food production  by improving agricultural yield and reducing waste. For  example, our “FarmBeats” project uses advanced technology,  existing connectivity infrastructure, and the power of the  cloud and machine learning to enable data-driven farming  at low cost. This initiative provides farmers with easily  interpretable insights to help them improve agricultural  yield, lower overall costs and reduce the environmental  impact of farming.9 Given the significant benefits that stem from using AI  — empowering us all to accomplish more by being more  productive and efficient, driving better business outcomes,  delivering more effective government services and helping  Scan for more on  FarmBeats The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
48to solve difficult societal issues — it’s vital that everyone has  the opportunity to use it. Making AI available to all people  and organizations is foundational to enabling everyone to  capitalize on the opportunities AI presents and share in the  benefits it delivers. The Challenges AI Presents As with the great advances of the past on which it builds —  including electricity, the telephone and transistors — AI will  bring about vast changes, some of which are hard to imagine  today. And, as was the case with these previous significant  technological advances, we’ll need to be thoughtful about  how we address the societal issues that these changes bring  about. Most importantly, we all need to work together to  ensure that AI is developed in a responsible manner so that  people will trust it and deploy it broadly, both to increase  business and personal productivity and to help solve societal  problems.  This will require a shared understanding of the ethical and  societal implication of these new technologies. This, in turn,  will help pave the way toward a common framework of  principles to guide researchers and developers as they deliver  a new generation of AI-enabled systems and capabilities, and  governments as they consider a new generation of rules and  regulations to protect the safety and privacy of citizens and  ensure that the benefits of AI are broadly accessible.The Future  of Artificial  Intelligence
49In Chapter 2, we offer our initial thinking on how to move  forward in a way that respects universal values and addresses  the full range of societal issues that AI will raise, while  ensuring that we achieve the full potential of AI to create  opportunities and improve lives.

55As AI begins to augment human understanding and  decision-making in fields like education, healthcare,  transportation, agriculture, energy and manufacturing, it  will raise new societal questions. How can we ensure that  AI treats everyone fairly? How can we best ensure that AI  is safe and reliable? How can we attain the benefits of AI  while protecting privacy? How do we not lose control of  our machines as they become increasingly intelligent and  powerful? The people who are building AI systems are, of course,  required to comply with the broad range of laws around the  world that already govern fairness, privacy, injuries resulting  from unreasonable behaviors and the like. There are no  exceptions to these laws for AI systems. But we still need  to develop and adopt clear principles to guide the people  building, using and applying AI systems. Industry groups and  others should build off these principles to create detailed best  practices for key aspects of the development of AI systems,  such as the nature of the data used to train AI systems, the  analytical techniques deployed, and how the results of AI  systems are explained to people using those systems. It’s imperative that we get this right if we’re going to   prevent mistakes. Otherwise people may not fully trust AI  systems. And if people don’t trust AI systems, they will be  less likely to contribute to the development of such systems  and to use them.  Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
56Ethical and Societal Implications Business leaders, policymakers, researchers, academics and  representatives of nongovernmental groups must work  together to ensure that AI-based technologies are designed  and deployed in a manner that will earn the trust of the  people who use them and the individuals whose data is being  collected. The Partnership on AI (PAI), an organization  co-founded by Microsoft, is one vehicle for advancing these  discussions. Important work is also underway at many  universities and governmental and non-governmental  organizations.10 Designing AI to be trustworthy requires creating solutions  that reflect ethical principles that are deeply rooted in  important and timeless values. As we’ve thought about it,  we’ve focused on six principles that we believe should guide  the development of AI. Specifically, AI systems should  be fair, reliable and safe, private and secure, inclusive,  transparent, and accountable. These principles are critical to  addressing the societal impacts of AI and building trust as the  technology becomes more and more a part of the products  and services that people use at work and at home every day.     Chart 5.   Source: Microsoft CorporationPrinciples,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
57Fairness – AI systems should treat all people fairly. AI systems should treat everyone in a fair and balanced  manner and not affect similarly situated groups of people  in different ways. For example, when AI systems provide  guidance on medical treatment, loan applications or  employment, they should make the same recommendations  for everyone with similar symptoms, financial circumstances  or professional qualifications. If designed properly, AI can  help make decisions that are fairer because computers are  purely logical and, in theory, are not subject to the conscious  and unconscious biases that inevitably influence human  decision-making. Yet, because AI systems are designed by  human beings and the systems are trained using data that  reflects the imperfect world in which we live, AI can operate  unfairly without careful planning. To ensure that fairness  is the foundation for solutions using this new technology,  it’s imperative that developers understand how bias can be  introduced into AI systems and how it can affect AI-based  recommendations.  The design of any AI systems starts with the choice of  training data, which is the first place where unfairness can  arise. Training data should sufficiently represent the world  in which we live, or at least the part of the world where the  AI system will operate. Consider an AI system that enables  facial recognition or emotion detection. If it is trained solely  on images of adult faces, it may not accurately identify the  features or expressions of children due to differences in facial  structure.Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
58But ensuring the “representativeness” of data is not enough.  Racism and sexism can also creep into societal data. Training  an AI system on such data may inadvertently lead to results  that perpetuate these harmful biases. One example might  be an AI system designed to help employers screen job  applicants. When trained on data from public employment  records, this system might “learn” that most software  developers are male. As a result, it may favor men over  women when selecting candidates for software developer  positions, even though the company deploying the system is  seeking to promote diversity through its hiring practices.11 An AI system could also be unfair if people do not  understand the limitations of the system, especially if they  assume technical systems are more accurate and precise than  people, and therefore more authoritative. In many cases, the  output of an AI system is actually a prediction. One example  might be “there is a 70 percent likelihood that the applicant  will default on the loan.” The AI system may be highly  accurate, meaning that if the bank extends credit every time  to people with the 70 percent “risk of default,” 70 percent  of those people will, in fact, default. Such a system may be  unfair in application, however, if loan officers incorrectly  interpret “70 percent risk of default” to simply mean “bad  credit risk” and decline to extend credit to everyone with  that score — even though nearly a third of those applicants  are predicted to be a good credit risk. It will be essential to  train people to understand the meaning and implications of  AI results to supplement their decision-making with sound  human judgment. Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
59How can we ensure that AI systems treat everyone fairly?  There’s almost certainly a lot of learning ahead for all of us  in this area, and it will be vital to sustain research and foster  robust discussions to share new best practices that emerge.  But already some important themes are emerging. First, we believe that the people designing AI systems should  reflect the diversity of the world in which we live. We also  believe that people with relevant subject matter expertise  (such as those with consumer credit expertise for a credit  scoring AI system) should be included in the design process  and in deployment decisions.  Second, if the recommendations or predictions of AI systems  are used to help inform consequential decisions about  people, we believe it will be critical that people are primarily  accountable for these decisions. It will also be important  to invest in research to better understand the impact of AI  systems on human decision-making generally. Finally — and this is vital — industry and academia should  continue the promising work underway to develop analytical  techniques to detect and address potential unfairness, like  methods that systematically assess the data used to train AI  systems for appropriate representativeness and document  information about its origins and characteristics.  Ultimately, determining the full range of work needed to  address possible bias in AI systems will require ongoing  discussions that include a wide range of interested Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
60stakeholders. Academic research efforts such as those  highlighted at the annual conference for researchers on  Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine  Learning have raised awareness of the issue. We encourage  increased efforts across the public, private and civil sectors to  expand these discussions to help find solutions.     Reliability – AI systems should perform reliably and safely. The complexity of AI technologies has fueled fears that  AI systems may cause harm in the face of unforeseen  circumstances, or that they can be manipulated to act  in harmful ways. As is true for any technology, trust will  ultimately depend on whether AI-based systems can be  operated reliably, safely and consistently — not only under  normal circumstances but also in unexpected conditions or  when they are under attack.  This begins by demonstrating that systems are designed  to operate within a clear set of parameters under expected  performance conditions, and that there is a way to verify  that they are behaving as intended under actual operating  conditions. Because AI systems are data-driven, how they  behave and the variety of conditions they can handle  reliably and safely largely reflects the range of situations  and circumstance that developers anticipate during design  and testing. For example, an AI system designed to detect  misplaced objects may have difficulty recognizing items in  low lighting conditions, meaning designers should conduct Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
61 
62tests in typical and poorly lit environments. Rigorous testing  is essential during system development and deployment  to ensure that systems can respond safely to unanticipated  situations; do not have unexpected performance failures;  and do not evolve in ways that are inconsistent with original  expectations.  Design and testing should also anticipate and protect against  the potential for unintended system interactions or bad  actors to influence operations, such as through cyberattacks.  Securing AI systems will require developers to identify  abnormal behaviors and prevent manipulation, such as the  introduction of malicious data that may be intended to  negatively impact AI behavior.  In addition, because AI should augment and amplify human  capabilities, people should play a critical role in making  decisions about how and when an AI system is deployed, and  whether it’s appropriate to continue to use it over time. Since  AI systems often do not see or understand the bigger societal  picture, human judgment will be key to identifying potential  blind spots and biases in AI systems. Developers should  be cognizant of these challenges as they build and deploy  systems, and share information with their customers to help  them monitor and understand system behavior so that they  can quickly identify and correct any unintended behaviors  that may surface.Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
63In one example in the field of AI research, a system designed  to help make decisions about whether to hospitalize patients  with pneumonia “learned” that people with asthma have  a lower rate of mortality from pneumonia than the general  population. This was a surprising result because people  with asthma are generally considered to be at greater risk of  dying from pneumonia than others. While the correlation  was accurate, the system failed to detect that the primary  reason for this lower mortality rate was that asthma patients  receive faster and more comprehensive care than other  patients because they are at greater risk. If researchers  hadn’t noticed that the AI system had drawn a misleading  inference, the system might have recommended against  hospitalizing people with asthma, an outcome that would  have run counter to what the data revealed.12 This highlights  the critical role that people, particularly those with subject  matter expertise, must play in observing and evaluating AI  systems as they are developed and deployed. Principles of robust and fail-safe design that were pioneered  in other engineering disciplines can be valuable in designing  and developing reliable and safe AI systems. Research and  collaboration involving industry participants, governments,  academics and other experts to further improve the safety  and reliability of AI systems will be increasingly important  as AI systems become more widely used in fields such as  transportation, healthcare and financial services. Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
64We believe the following steps will promote the safety and  reliability of AI systems:  • Systematic evaluation of the quality and suitability  of the data and models used to train and operate AIbased products and services, and systematic sharing of  information about potential inadequacies in training data. • Processes for documenting and auditing operations of AI  systems to aid in understanding ongoing performance  monitoring. • When AI systems are used to make consequential  decisions about people, a requirement to provide  adequate explanations of overall system operation,  including information about the training data and  algorithms, training failures that have occurred, and  the inferences and significant predictions generated,  especially.  • Involvement of domain experts in the design process  and operation of AI systems used to make consequential  decisions about people. • Evaluation of when and how an AI system should seek  human input during critical situations, and how a system  controlled by AI should transfer control to a human in a  manner that is meaningful and intelligible. • A robust feedback mechanism so that users can easily  report performance issues they encounter.Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
65Creating AI systems that are safe and reliable is a shared  responsibility. It is, therefore, critically important for  industry participants to share best practices for design and  development, such as effective testing, the structure of trials  and reporting. Topics such as human-robot interaction and  how AI-driven systems that fail should hand control over to  people are important areas not only for ongoing research, but  also for enhanced collaboration and communication within  the industry.  Privacy & Security – AI systems should be secure and   respect privacy. As more and more of our lives are captured in digital form,  the question of how to preserve our privacy and secure  our personal data is becoming more important and more  complicated. While protecting privacy and security is  important to all technology development, recent advances  require that we pay even closer attention to these issues to  create the levels of trust needed to realize the full benefits of  AI. Simply put, people will not share data about themselves  — data that is essential for AI to help inform decisions about  people — unless they are confident that their privacy is  protected and their data secured.  Privacy needs to be both a business imperative and a key  pillar of trust in all cloud computing initiatives. This is  why Microsoft made firm commitments to protect the  security and privacy of our customers’ data, and why we Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
66 
67are upgrading our engineering systems to ensure that we  satisfy data protection laws around the world, including  the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR). Microsoft is investing in the infrastructure and  systems to enable GDPR compliance in our largest-ever  engineering effort devoted to complying with a regulatory  environment. Like other cloud technologies, AI systems must comply with  privacy laws that require transparency about the collection,  use and storage of data, and mandate that consumers have  appropriate controls so that they can choose how their data  is used. AI systems should also be designed so that private  information is used in accordance with privacy standards and  protected from bad actors who might seek to steal private  information or inflict harm. Industry processes should be  developed and implemented for the following: tracking  relevant information about customer data (such as when  it was collected and the terms governing its collection);  accessing and using that data; and auditing access and use.  Microsoft is continuing to invest in robust compliance  technologies and processes to ensure that data collected and  used by our AI systems is handled responsibly. What is needed is an approach that promotes the  development of technologies and policies that protect privacy  while facilitating access to the data that AI systems require  to operate effectively. Microsoft has been a leader in creating  and advancing innovative state-of-the-art techniques for Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
68protecting privacy, such as differential privacy, homomorphic  encryption, and techniques to separate data from identifying  information about individuals and for protecting against  misuse, hacking or tampering. We believe these techniques  will reduce the risk of privacy intrusions by AI systems so  they can use personal data without accessing or knowing  the identities of individuals. Microsoft will continue to  invest in research and work with governments and others in  industry to develop effective and efficient privacy protection  technologies that can be deployed based on the sensitivity  and proposed uses of the data. Inclusiveness – AI systems should empower everyone and  engage people.  If we are to ensure that AI technologies benefit and empower  everyone, they must incorporate and address a broad range  of human needs and experiences. Inclusive design practices  will help system developers understand and address  potential barriers in a product or environment that could  unintentionally exclude people. This means that AI systems  should be designed to understand the context, needs and  expectations of the people who use them.  The importance that information and communications  technology plays in the lives of the 1 billion people around  the world with disabilities is broadly recognized. More than  160 countries have ratified the United Nations Convention  on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which covers  access to digital technology in education and employment. Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
69In the United States, the Americans with Disabilities Act  and the Communications and Video Accessibility Act  require technology solutions to be accessible, and federal  and state regulations mandate the procurement of accessible  technology, as does European Union law. AI can be a  powerful tool for increasing access to information, education,  employment, government services, and social and economic  opportunities. Real-time speech-to-text transcription, visual  recognition services, and predictive text functionality that  suggests words as people type are just a few examples of  AI-enabled services that are already empowering those with  hearing, visual and other impairments. We also believe that AI experiences can have the greatest  positive impact when they offer both emotional intelligence  and cognitive intelligence, a balance that can improve  predictability and comprehension. AI-based personal agents,  for example, can exhibit user awareness by confirming and,  as necessary, correcting understanding of the user’s intent,  and by recognizing and adjusting to the people, places and  events that are most important to users. Personal agents  should provide information and make recommendations in  ways that are contextual and expected. They should provide  information that helps people understand what inferences  the system is making about them. Over time, such successful  interactions will increase usage of AI system and trust in their  performance.Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI

71Transparency – AI systems should be understandable. Underlying these four preceding values are two foundational  principles that are essential for ensuring the effectiveness of  the rest: transparency and accountability.  When AI systems are used to help make decisions that  impact people’s lives, it is particularly important that people  understand how those decisions were made. An approach  that is most likely to engender trust with users and those  affected by these systems is to provide explanations that  include contextual information about how an AI system  works and interacts with data. Such information will make it  easier to identify and raise awareness of potential bias, errors  and unintended outcomes. Simply publishing the algorithms underlying AI systems  will rarely provide meaningful transparency. With the latest  (and often most promising) AI techniques, such as deep  neural networks, there typically isn’t any algorithmic output  that would help people understand the subtle patterns that  systems find. This is why we need a more holistic approach in  which AI system designers describe the key elements of the  system as completely and clearly as possible. Microsoft is working with the Partnership on AI and  other organizations to develop best practices for enabling  meaningful transparency of AI systems. This includes the  practices described above and a variety of other methods, Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
72such as an approach to determine if it’s possible to use an  algorithm or model that is easier to understand in place  of one that is more complex and difficult to explain. This  is an area that will require further research to understand  how machine learning models work and to develop new  techniques that provide more meaningful transparency. Accountability Finally, as with other technologies and products, the people  who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for  how their systems operate. To establish accountability norms  for AI, we should draw upon experience and practices in  other areas, including healthcare and privacy. Those who  develop and use AI systems should consider such practices  and periodically check whether they are being adhered to  and if they are working effectively. Internal review boards  can provide oversight and guidance on which practices  should be adopted to help address the concerns discussed  above, and on particularly important questions regarding  development and deployment of AI systems.  Internal Oversight and Guidance – Microsoft’s AI and Ethics  in Engineering and Research (AETHER) Committee Ultimately these six principles need to be integrated into  ongoing operations if they’re to be effective. At Microsoft,  we’re addressing this in part through the AI and Ethics in  Engineering and Research (AETHER) Committee. This  committee is a new internal organization that includes Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
73senior leaders from across Microsoft’s engineering, research,  consulting and legal organizations who focus on proactive  formulation of internal policies and on how to respond  to specific issues as they arise. The AETHER Committee  considers and defines best practices, provides guiding  principles to be used in the development and deployment  of Microsoft’s AI products and solutions, and helps resolve  questions related to ethical and societal implications  stemming from Microsoft’s AI research, product and  customer engagement efforts.    Developing Policy and Law for Artificial  Intelligence AI can serve as a catalyst for progress in almost every area of  human endeavor. But, as with any innovation that pushes us  beyond current knowledge and experience, the advent of AI  raises important questions about the relationship between  people and technology, and the impact of new technologydriven capabilities on individuals and communities.  We are the first generation to live in a world where AI  will play an expansive role in our daily lives. It’s safe to  say that most current standards, laws and regulations  were not written specifically to account for AI. But, while  existing rules may not have been crafted with AI in mind,  this doesn’t mean that AI-based products and services are  unregulated. Current laws that, for example, protect the Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
74privacy and security of personal information, that govern  the flow of data and how it is used, that promote fairness in  the use of consumer information, or that govern decisions  on credit or employment apply broadly to digital products  and services or their use in decision-making, whether they  explicitly mention AI capabilities or not. AI-based services  are not exempt from the requirements that will take effect  with GDPR, for example, or from HIPAA regulations that  protect the privacy of healthcare data in the United States, or  existing regulations on automobile safety. As the role of AI continues to grow, it will be natural for  policymakers not only to monitor its impact, but to address  new questions and update laws. One goal should be to  ensure that governments work with businesses and other  stakeholders to strike the balance that is needed to maximize  the potential of AI to improve people’s lives and address new  challenges as they arise. As this happens, it seems inevitable that “AI law” will emerge  as an important new legal topic. But, over what period of  time? And in what ways should such a field develop and  evolve?  We believe the most effective regulation can be achieved  by providing all stakeholders with sufficient time to identify  and articulate key principles guiding the development of  responsible and trustworthy AI, and to implement these  principles by adopting and refining best practices. Before  devising new regulations or laws, there needs to be some  clarity about the fundamental issues and principles that must  be addressed. Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
75The evolution of information privacy laws in the United  States and Europe offers a useful model. In 1973, the United  States Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW)  issued a comprehensive report analyzing a host of societal  concerns arising from the increasing computerization of  information and the growing repositories of personal data  held by federal agencies.13 The report espoused a series of  important principles — the Fair Information Practices — that  sought to delineate fundamental privacy ideals regardless  of the specific context or technology involved. Over the  ensuing decades, these principles — thanks in large part to  their fundamental and universal nature — helped frame a  series of federal and state laws governing the collection and  use of personal information within education, healthcare,  financial services and other areas. Guided by these principles,  the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began  fashioning a body of privacy case law to prevent unfair or  deceptive practices affecting commerce.  Internationally, the Fair Information Practices influenced  the development of local and national laws in European  jurisdictions, including Germany and France, which in  many respects emerged as the leaders in the development of  privacy law. Beginning in the late 1970s, the Organization  for Economic Coordination and Development (OECD) built  upon the Fair Information Practices to promulgate its seminal  Privacy Guidelines. As with the HEW’s Fair Information  Practices, the universal and extensible nature of the OECD’s Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
76Privacy Guidelines ultimately allowed them to serve as the  building blocks for the European Union’s comprehensive  Data Protection Directive in 1995 and its successor, the  General Data Protection Regulation.  Laws in the United States and Europe ultimately diverged,  with the United States pursuing a more sectoral approach  and the European Union adopting more comprehensive  regulation. But, in both cases, they built on universal,  foundational concepts and in some cases existing laws and  legal tenets. These rules addressed a very broad range of  new technologies, uses and business models, as well as an  increasingly diverse set of societal needs and expectations. Today, we believe policy discussions should focus on  continued innovation and advancement of fundamental AI  technologies, support the development and deployment of  AI capabilities across different sectors, encourage outcomes  that are aligned with a shared vision of human-centered AI,  and foster the development and sharing of best practices  to promote trustworthy and responsible AI. The following  considerations will help policymakers craft a framework to  realize these objectives.  The Importance of Data It seems likely that many near-term AI policy and regulatory  issues will focus on the collection and use of data. The  development of more effective AI services requires the use of  data — often as much relevant data as possible. Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
77And yet access to and use of data also involves policy issues  that range from ensuring the protection of individual privacy  and the safeguarding of sensitive and proprietary information  to answering a range of new competition law questions. A  careful and productive balancing of these objectives will  require discussion and cooperation between governments,  industry participants, academic researchers and civil society.  On the one hand, we believe governments should help  accelerate AI advances by promoting common approaches  to making data broadly available for machine learning. A  large amount of useful data resides in public datasets —  data that belongs to the public itself. Governments can also  invest in and promote methods and processes for linking  and combining related datasets from public and private  organizations while preserving confidentiality, privacy and  security as circumstances require. At the same time, it will be important for governments  to develop and promote effective approaches to privacy  protection that take into account the type of data and the  context in which it is used. To help reduce the risk of privacy  intrusions, governments should support and promote the  development of techniques that enable systems to use  personal data without accessing or knowing the identities  of individuals. Additional research to enhance “deidentification” techniques and ongoing discussions about  how to balance the risks of re-identification against the social  benefits will be important.Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
78As policymakers look to update data protection laws, they  should carefully weigh the benefits that can be derived  from data against important privacy interests. While some  sensitive personal information, such as Social Security  numbers, should typically be subject to high levels of  protection, rigid approaches should be avoided because the  sensitivity of personal information often depends on the  context in which it is provided and used. For example, an  individual’s name in a company directory is not typically  considered sensitive and should probably require less  privacy protection than if it appeared in an adoption record.  In general, updated laws should recognize that processing  sensitive information may be increasingly critical to serving  clear public interests such as preventing the spread of  communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Another important policy area involves competition law. As  vast amounts of data are generated through the use of smart  devices, applications and cloud-based services, there are  growing concerns about the concentration of information by  a relatively small number of companies. But, in addition to  the data that companies generate from their customers, there  is publicly available data. Governments can help add to the  supply of available data by ensuring that public data is usable  by AI developers on a non-exclusive basis. These steps will  help enable developers of all types to take greater advantage  of AI technologies. Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
79At the same time, governments should monitor whether  access to unique datasets (in other words, data for which  there is no substitute) is becoming a barrier to competition  and needs to be addressed. Other concerns relate to whether  too much data is available to too few firms and whether  sophisticated algorithms will enable rivals to effectively  “fix” prices. All these questions warrant attention; but, they  probably can be addressed within the framework of existing  competition law. The question of the availability of data  will arise most directly when one firm seeks to buy another  and competition authorities need to consider whether the  combined firms would possess datasets that are so valuable  and unique that no other firms can compete effectively.  Such situations are unlikely to arise very often given the vast  amount of data being generated by digital technologies, the  fact that multiple firms often have the same data, and the  reality that people often use multiple services that generate  data for a variety of firms.    Algorithms can help increase price transparency, which will  help businesses and consumers buy products at the lowest  cost. But, algorithms could one day become so sophisticated  that firms employing them to set prices might establish the  same prices, even if the firms did not agree among themselves  to do so. Competition authorities will need to carefully study  the benefits of price transparency as well as the risk that  transparency could over time reduce price competition. Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
80Promoting Responsible and Effective Uses of AI In addition to addressing issues relating to data, governments  have an important role to play in promoting responsible and  effective uses of AI itself. This should start with the adoption  of responsible AI technologies in the public sector. While  enabling more effective delivery of services for citizens, this  will also provide governments with firsthand experience in  developing best practices to address the ethical principles  identified above. Governments also have an important role to play in funding  core research to further advance AI development and  support multidisciplinary research that focuses on studying  and fostering solutions to the socioeconomic issues that may  arise as AI technologies are deployed. This multidisciplinary  research will also be valuable for the design of future AI laws  and regulations. Governments should also stimulate adoption of AI  technologies across a wide range of industries and for  businesses of all sizes, with an emphasis on providing  incentives for small and medium-sized organizations.  Promoting economic growth and opportunity by giving  smaller businesses access to the capabilities that AI methods  offer can play an important role in addressing income  stagnation and mitigating political and social tensions that  can arise as income inequality increases. As governments take  these steps, they can adopt safeguards to ensure that AI is not  used to discriminate either intentionally or unintentionally in  a manner prohibited under applicable laws. Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
81Liability Governments must also balance support for innovation with  the need to ensure consumer safety by holding the makers  of AI systems responsible for harm caused by unreasonable  practices. Well-tested principles of negligence law are  most appropriate for addressing injuries arising from the  deployment and use of AI systems. This is because they  encourage reasonable conduct and hold parties accountable  if they fall short of that standard. This works particularly  well in the context of AI for a number of reasons. First, the  potential roles AI systems can play and the benefit they can  bring are substantial. Second, society is already familiar with  a broad range of automated systems and many other existing  and prospective AI technologies and services. And third,  considerable work is ongoing to help mitigate the risk of  harm from these systems.    Relying on a negligence standard that is already applicable to  software generally to assign responsibility for harm caused by  AI is the best way for policymakers and regulators to balance  innovation and consumer safety, and promote certainty for  developers and users of the technology. This will help keep  firms accountable for their actions, align incentives and  compensate people for harm.Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
82Fostering Dialogue and the Sharing of Best  Practices To maximize AI’s potential to deliver broad-based  benefits, while mitigating risks and minimizing unintended  consequences, it will be essential that we continue to  convene open discussions among governments, businesses,  representatives from non-governmental organizations and  civil society, academic researchers, and all other interested  individuals and organizations. Working together, we  can identify issues that have clear societal or economic  consequences and prioritize the development of solutions  that protect people without unnecessarily restricting future  innovation.  One helpful step we can take to address current and future  issues is to develop and share innovative best practices to  guide the creation and deployment of people-centered  AI. Industry-led organizations such as Partnership on AI  that bring together industry, nonprofit organizations and  NGOs can serve as forums for the process of devising and  promulgating best practices. By encouraging open and honest  discussion and assisting in the sharing of best practices,  governments can also help create a culture of cooperation,  trust and openness among AI developers, users and the  public at large. This work can serve as the foundation for  future laws and regulations. In addition it will be critical that we acknowledge the broad  concerns that have been raised about the impact of these  technologies on jobs and the nature of work, and take steps Principles,  Policies and  Laws for the  Responsible  Use of AI
83to ensure that people are prepared for the impact that AI  will have on the workplace and the workforce. Already, AI  is transforming the relationship between businesses and  employees, and changing how, when and where people work.  As the pace of change accelerates, new skills will be essential  and new ways of connecting people to training and to jobs  will be required.  In Chapter 3, we look at the impact of AI on jobs and work,  and offer some suggestions for steps we can take together  to provide education and training for people of every age  and at every stage of school and their working lives to help  them take advantage of the opportunities of the AI era. We  also explore the need to rethink protections for workers and  social safety net programs in a time when the relationship  between workers and employers is undergoing rapid change.

88 Teachers will not be replaced  by technology, but teachers  who do not use technology will  be replaced by those who do.   Hari Krishna Arya“ ”
89For more than 250 years, technology innovation has been  changing the nature of jobs and work. In the 1740s, the  First Industrial Revolution began moving jobs away from  homes and farms to rapidly growing cities. The Second  Industrial Revolution, which began in the 1870s, continued  this trend, and led to the assembly line, the modern  corporation, and workplaces that started to resemble offices  that we would recognize today. The shift from reliance on  horses to automobiles eliminated numerous occupations  while creating new categories of jobs that no one initially  imagined.14  Sweeping economic changes also created  difficult and sometimes dangerous working conditions that  led governments to adopt labor protections and practices  that are still in place today.  The Third Industrial Revolution of the past few decades  created changes that many of us have experienced. For  Microsoft, this was evident in how the original vision of  our company — to put a computer on every desk and in  every home — became reality. That transformation brought  information technology into the workplace, changing how  people communicate and collaborate at work, while adding  new IT positions and largely eliminating jobs for secretaries  who turned handwritten prose into typed copy.  Now technology is changing again the nature of jobs and  work is changing with it. While available economic data  is far from perfect, there are clear indications that how  enterprises organize work, how people find work, and the AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
90skills that people need to prepare for work are shifting  significantly. These changes are likely to accelerate in the  decade ahead.  AI and cloud computing are the driving force behind much  of this change. This is evident in the burgeoning on-demand  — or “gig” — economy where digital platforms not only  match the skills of workers with consumer or enterprise  needs, they provide for people to work increasingly from  anywhere in the world. AI and automation are already  influencing which jobs, or aspects of jobs, will continue to  exist. Some estimate that as many as 5.1 million jobs will  be lost within the next decade; but, new areas of economic  opportunity will also be created, as well as entirely new  occupations and categories of work.15  These fundamental changes in the nature of work will  require new ways of thinking about skills and training to  ensure that workers are prepared for the future and that  there is sufficient talent available for critical jobs. The  education ecosystem will need to evolve as well; to help  workers become lifelong learners, to enable individuals  to cultivate skills that are uniquely human, and to weave  ongoing education into full-time and on-demand work.  For businesses, they will need to rethink how they find and  evaluate talent, broaden the pool of candidates they draw  from and use work portfolios to assess competence and skill.  Employers will also need to focus more on offering on-thejob training, opportunities to acquire new skills, and access  to outside education for their existing workforces.AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
91In addition to rethinking how workers are trained and  remain prepared for work, it is important to consider what  happens to workers as traditional models of employment  that typically include benefits and protections change  significantly. The rapid evolution of work could undermine  worker protections and benefits including unemployment  insurance, workers’ compensation and, in the United  States, the Social Security system. To prevent this, the  legal frameworks governing employment will need to be  modernized to recognize new ways of working, provide  adequate worker protections, and maintain the social safety  net. The Impact of Technology on Jobs and Work  Throughout history, the emergence of new technologies  has been accompanied by dire warnings about human  redundancy. For example, a 1928 headline in the New York  Times warned that “The March of the Machine Makes  Idle Hands.”16 More often, however, the reality is that new  technologies have created more jobs than they destroyed.  The invention of the steam engine, for example, led to  the development of the steam locomotive, which was an  important catalyst in the shift from a largely rural and  agricultural society to one where more and more people  lived in urban centers and worked in manufacturing and  transportation — a transformation that changed how, when  and where people worked. More recently, automated teller  machines (ATMs) took over many traditional tasks for bank AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
92tellers. As a result, the average number of bank tellers per  branch in the United States fell from 20 in 1988 to 13 in  2004.17 Despite this reduction, the need for fewer tellers  made it cheaper to run each branch and allowed banks to  open more branches, thereby increasing the total number  of employees. Instead of destroying jobs, ATMs eliminated  routine tasks, which allowed bank tellers to focus on sales  and customer service.18   This pattern is common across almost every industry. As  one economist found in a recent analysis of the workforce,  between 1982 and 2002, employment grew significantly  faster in occupations that used computers because  automation enabled workers to focus on other parts of their  jobs; this increased demand for human workers to handle  higher-value tasks that had not been automated.19  More recently, public debate has centered on the impact  of automation and AI on employment. Although the terms  “automation” and “AI” are often used interchangeably,  the technologies are different. With automation, systems  are programmed to perform specific repetitive tasks. For  example, word processing automates tasks previously done  by people on typewriters. Barcode scanners and point-ofsale systems automate tasks that had been done by retail  employees. AI, on the other hand, is designed to seek  patterns, learn from experiences, and make appropriate  decisions — it does not require an explicit programmed  path to determine how it will respond to the situations it  encounters. Together, automation and AI are accelerating AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
93 
94changes to the nature of jobs. As one commentator put it,  “automated machines collate data — AI systems ‘understand’  it. We’re looking at two very different systems that perfectly  complement each other.”20    As AI complements and accelerates automation,  policymakers in countries around the world recognize that  it will be an important driver of economic growth in the  decades ahead. For example, China recently announced its  intention to become the global leader in AI to strengthen its  economy and create competitive advantages.21 Any business or organization that depends upon data and  information — which today is almost every business and  organization — can benefit from AI. These systems will  improve efficiency and productivity while enabling the  creation of higher-value services that can drive economic  growth. But as far back as the First Industrial Revolution,  the introduction of any new technology has caused concern  about the impact on jobs and employment — AI and  automation are no different. Indeed, it would appear that  AI and automation are raising serious questions about the  potential loss of jobs in developed countries. A recent survey  commissioned by Microsoft found that in all 16 countries  surveyed, the impact of AI on employment was identified  as a key risk.22 As machines become capable of performing  tasks that require complex analysis and discretionary  judgment, the concern is it will accelerate the rate of job loss  beyond what already occurs due to automation.AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
95While it’s not yet clear whether AI will be more disruptive  than earlier technological advances, there’s no question  that it is having an impact on jobs and employment. As  was the case in earlier periods of significant technology  transformation, it is difficult to predict how many jobs will  be affected. A widely quoted University of Oxford study  estimated that 47 percent of total employment in the United  States is at risk due to computerization.23 A World Bank  study predicted that 57 percent of jobs in OECD countries  could be automated.24 And according to a recent paper on  robots and jobs, researchers found that each robot deployed  per thousand workers decreased employment by 6.2 workers  and caused a decline in wages of 0.7 percent.25  Jobs across many industries are susceptible to the dual  impact of AI and automation. Here are a few examples: a  company based in San Francisco has developed “Tally”  which automates the auditing of grocery store shelves  to ensure goods are properly stocked and priced;26 at  Amazon, they currently use more than 100,000 robots in  its fulfillment centers and is creating convenience stores  with no cashiers; in Australia a company has developed a  robot that can lay 1,000 bricks per hour (a task that would  take human laborers a day or longer to complete); in call  centers, they are using chatbots to answer customer support  questions; and even in journalism, tasks such as writing  summaries of sporting events are being automated.27 AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
96 
97Even where jobs are not entirely replaced, AI will have an  impact. In warehouses, employees have shifted from stacking  bins to monitoring robots. In legal environments, paralegals  and law clerks now use “e-discovery” software to find  documents. In hospitals, machine learning can help doctors  diagnose illnesses more quickly and enable teachers to assess  student learning more effectively. But, while AI is changing  these jobs, they have not disappeared; there are aspects  of the work that simply cannot be automated. Many jobs  will continue to require uniquely human skills that AI and  machines cannot replicate, such as creativity, collaboration,  abstract and systems thinking, complex communication, and  the ability to work in diverse environments.  And while it is true that AI will eliminate and change some  jobs, it will also create new ones. A recent report from  the research firm Forrester projects that by 2027, AI will  displace 24.7 million jobs and create 14.9 million new jobs.28   New jobs will emerge as AI changes how work is done and  what people need from the world around them. Many of  these jobs will be in technology. For example, banks will  need network engineers instead of tellers. Retailers will  need people with web programming skills to create online  shopping experiences instead of greeters or salespeople on  the floor. Farms will need agricultural data analysts instead  of fruit pickers. Demand for data scientists, robotics experts  and AI engineers will increase significantly. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
98What’s more, AI will create jobs we cannot yet even  imagine. While it is relatively easy to see where automation  may reduce the need for workers, it is impossible to foresee  all of the changes that will come. As one economic historian  put it, “we can’t predict what jobs will be created in the  future, but it’s always been like that.”29    One result of the rapid transformation of work caused by  AI and automation is a shortage of critical talent across  many industries. As jobs increasingly require technology  skills, companies compete for the employees who have  specialized skills supporting digital capabilities such as  robotics, augmented reality computations, cybersecurity  and data science. It is estimated that by 2020, 30 percent of  technology jobs will go unfilled due to talent shortages,30   and this gap is likely to widen given the time it takes to  introduce training programs for new technology skills.  According to the World Economic Forum, many academic  fields experience unprecedented rates of change in core  curriculum. They suggest that nearly 50 percent of subject  knowledge acquired during the first year of a four-year  technical degree will become outdated before students  graduate. And by 2020, more than a third of the skills  needed for most occupations will be ones that are not  considered crucial today.31 More broadly, technology  will significantly impact the skills requirements in all job  families. To manage these trends successfully, we’ll need to  ensure that people in the workforce can continually learn  and gain new skills.    Economists who are studying the emerging talent shortage  and the replacement of so-called “middle skills” jobs by  automation worry that technological advances such as AI are AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
99 
100widening the income gap between those with technological  skills and training and those without.32 As expertise in  areas such as data analytics becomes more central to many  jobs and automation enables machines to handle more  repetitive tasks, demand for highly skilled workers will  grow, and the need for those with fewer skills will fall — an  effect known as the “skill-biased technical change.” For  example, while the number of jobs for Americans with a  four-year college degree doubled between 1989 and 2016,  the job opportunities for those with a high school diploma  or less fell by 13 percent. Over the same period, the number  of Americans with a college degree grew by just under 50  percent and the unemployment rate for those without a  college degree rose 300 percent compared to those with a  college degree.33 Addressing this widening gap will require a  shift in how we think about education and training so that  we can prepare more of the workforce to take advantage of  the opportunities that are emerging.

101The Changing Nature of Work, the Workplace  and Jobs Until recently, most people worked in traditional employeremployee relationships at specific worksites: offices,  factories, schools, hospitals or other business facilities.  This traditional model is being upended as more people  are engaged through remote and part-time work, such as  contractors, or through project-based employment.  Some studies have noted that between 2005 and 2015, the  number of people in alternative work relationships — which  include contractors and on-demand workers — increased  from 10 percent to 16 percent accounting for nearly all  net job growth during that period.34 A recent study by the  McKinsey Global Institute concluded that “the independent  workforce is larger than previously recognized” with up to  162 million people in Europe and the United States — 20  or 30 percent of the working-age population — engaged in  some form of independent work. For more than half of these  individuals, independent work supplements their primary  source of income.  These alternative work arrangements are fueled by advances  in technology. Perhaps the most notable trend in this regard  is the rise of the on-demand economy. At its core, the ondemand economy refers to working arrangements in which  people find work through online talent platforms or staffing  agencies, performing tasks for a wide variety of customers. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
102According to the McKinsey Global Institute, 15 percent  of independent workers use digital talent platforms to  connect to work. Researchers at Oxford University’s Martin  Programme on Technology and Employment estimate that  nearly 30 percent of jobs in the United States could be  organized into task-based work within 20 years.35  The on-demand economy presents enormous opportunities  for workers and businesses. McKinsey estimates digital  platforms that match workers with opportunities could raise  global GDP by as much as 2 percent by 2025, increasing  employment worldwide by 72 million full-time equivalent  jobs. Here is just a partial list of the potential benefits of the  on-demand economy: • Engagement in on-demand work through digital  platforms allows jobs to come to workers, rather than  forcing people to migrate to available work. This helps  workers who live in areas where job opportunities are  limited and enables companies to access a wider talent  pool.  • According to the Hamilton Project, more than 70  percent of labor force non-participants report that  caregiving, disability or early retirement keeps them  out of the workforce. The flexibility of on-demand work  reduces the barriers that traditional employment models  present.36 According to a survey by the Pew Research  Center, nearly 50 percent of on-demand workers report  a “need to control their own schedule.” Another quarter  said there was a “lack of other jobs where they live.”37    AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
103• The on-demand economy offers more opportunities  for part-time labor. Today, many workers prefer the  flexibility of part-time work to full-time employment.38   For millennials, flexibility, work/life balance, and the  social impact of their work can be more important than  a high salary or a full-time career. And many baby  boomers are choosing to work later in life, often through  part-time work. • The on-demand economy allows businesses to engage  workers on a short-term basis, facilitating business  agility and reducing long-term staffing costs. The ondemand economy can be particularly helpful to small  businesses that cannot afford a large full-time workforce  but can get work done through targeted on-demand  engagements. Costs can be reduced further by recruiting  freelancers through online platforms that feature  competitive bids for projects. • The on-demand economy can provide companies  with access to skills they do not have in-house. Hiring  freelancers enables employers to find individuals with  specific skills and engage them on an as-needed basis.  • The on-demand economy provides access to  supplemental income. For instance, the online platform  Teachers Pay Teachers includes an online marketplace  where teachers buy and sell lesson plans and other  educational resources.39   AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
104While the on-demand economy has the potential to promote  greater labor force participation, many concerns have been  raised about its impact on working conditions and worker  protections. Some of these concerns include:   • Because the on-demand economy is so new, it is  stretching the bounds of existing regulations relating  to worker protections, including child labor laws and  minimum wage requirements. While some on-demand  digital platforms offer worker protections, others have  taken the position that even baseline worker protections  do not apply to the on-demand labor model.  • The on-demand borderless workplace heightens  issues relating to wages and the distribution of the  global workforce. Because of the differences in the  cost of living across the globe and the opportunity for  employers to hire workers where wages are low, jobs may  move from the higher-wage to the lower-wage countries. • Some studies have shown that the economic benefits  of the on-demand economy largely accrue to platform  owners and consumers, but not to workers.40 Because  these platforms commoditize work into tasks, they may  devalue other contributions that workers can make to  the platform or the overall digital economy.  • The commoditization of the workforce also has the  potential to reduce access to social insurance, career  development and social interaction, which might  otherwise strengthen innovation and economic value.  Moreover, workers in the on-demand economy do not  benefit from the investments enterprises make in work  culture. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
105• In the long term, as platforms “learn” from workers and  automate more tasks, the development of the platform  economy may contribute to the elimination of jobs.  Those who are unable to acquire new skills may be  marginalized, further concentrating wealth in the hands  of platform owners and top earners.  As the on-demand economy continues to grow, enterprises  have an opportunity to shape policy within their own  companies, at the industry level and from a public policy  perspective. Increasingly, the technology industry needs to  engage to change the perception that it reaps the benefits  of technology progress at the expense of workers who are  displaced or left without protections, benefits or long-term  career paths.     Companies must acknowledge the impact of the ondemand model on workers rather than claim that they are  “just the technology platform.” Companies that do not  acknowledge the importance of worker protections and  benefits risk damage to their brands and face the possibility  that lawmakers and the courts will step in to impose  regulations that could limit the business opportunities  that the on-demand economy presents. Microsoft believes  that companies can benefit from the on-demand economy  while taking steps to provide protections, benefits and  opportunities that offer long-term economic stability for  workers. The technologies underpinning the on-demand economy are  also changing how enterprises organize work within their  traditional workforce. Today, a wide range of factors are AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
106driving enterprises to focus on creating a globally distributed  workforce, including the need to look beyond local talent  pools to find people with the skills that they need. But, as  countries face nationalist pressures and businesses face more  restrictive immigration laws, companies may also need to  consider expanding their domestic workforce.  New technologies and tools are enabling businesses to  accommodate distributed workforces. Online platforms can  aggregate data on workers and job openings across entire  countries and regions, making it easier to address geographic  mismatches between skills and jobs. And because new  collaboration tools support remote work, employees are no  longer tied to working in a fixed location. In addition, people  are seeking more flexibility in how and where they work.  In a recent poll, 37 percent of technology professionals said  they would take a 10 percent pay cut to work from home.41  While the new technologies are allowing businesses to  distribute work across the globe, they require shifts in  the way enterprises train workers, cultivate culture, and  build institutional knowledge and intellectual property.  Today, many enterprises are finding that more dispersed  workforces make effective collaboration more difficult  and agility more challenging. As the unit of work shifts to  task-based projects that use new agile team structures, the  combination of alternative employment arrangements and  distributed workers means enterprises need to reconsider  how they engage employees, build teams, and support career AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
107development and training. Enterprises will need to take  advantage of collaboration tools like Microsoft Teams or  Slack to address these shifts. They will need to use learning  platforms like LinkedIn Learning or Coursera to address  employees’ needs for career development and mentorship.  In addition, they will need to discover news ways to build  community and engagement within a dispersed workforce.  Preparing Everyone for the Future of Work Because the skills required for jobs in the AI economy are  changing so rapidly, we need to ensure that our systems for  preparing, educating, training, and retraining the current  and future workforce also evolve. Not only will the new AI  economy require new technical skills, but there is a growing  recognition that most workers will need to learn new skills  throughout their working lives.     According to a recent study by the Pew Research Center,  87 percent of U.S. adults in the labor force say that to  keep up with changes in the workplace, it will be essential  or important to get training and develop new skills  throughout their working lives.42 The ability to learn new  things, collaborate, communicate and adapt to changing  environments may become the most important skills for  long-term employability. Innovation and new solutions  throughout our education, training and workforce systems  will be required to help people stay competitive in this  rapidly changing workforce.    AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
108As automation and AI take on tasks that require thinking  and judgement, it will become increasingly important to  train people — perhaps through a renewed focus on the  humanities — to develop their critical thinking, creativity,  empathy, and reasoning.     Employers have a responsibility to help the education  and workforce systems better understand, interpret and  anticipate what professional skills they’ll need. While we  can’t predict with certainty which jobs will exist in the  future, we believe strongly that education and training will  be more important than ever. Technology can be better  utilized throughout the system to help students and job  seekers discover promising career paths, assess their current  skills, develop new skills and connect to jobs, and to scale  the solutions to meet the needs of broader swaths of the  population.     For people to succeed in the age of automation and AI,  improving education and training systems for everyone will  be critical. Most experts agree that some post-secondary  education and training will be essential. The following  charts show the clear relationship between educational  attainment and employment levels. Chart 7 reflects this  strong positive relationship in OECD countries. Chart 8  shows the United States unemployment rate impacts those  with less education disproportionately and more acutely  than those who accrude more education. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work

110The stark differences in the increases in unemployment rate,  particularly for those with less education, demonstrate a  higher volatility to that group. This is yet another example  of how technology companies can play a vital role in shaping  education and labor policy.   To help people get the training they need to thrive in today’s  economy and prepare for the future, Microsoft is focusing  on three areas: 1) preparing today’s students for tomorrow’s  jobs; 2) helping today’s workers prepare for the changing  economy; and 3) creating systems to better match workers to  job opportunities. Preparing today’s students for tomorrow’s jobs The single most important skill that people will need for  tomorrow’s jobs is the ability to continually learn. Future  jobs will require what Stanford professor Carol Dweck  has called a “growth mindset” to engage in more complex  problem-solving. Success will require strong communication,  teamwork and presentation skills. People will need to be  more globally aware as jobs will increasingly involve serving  not just a community, but the world. Rapidly evolving  technology impacting every sector means jobs of the future  will require more digital skills, from basic computer literacy  to advanced computer science. And emerging technologies  and the jobs of the future will require more digital and  computer skills.AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
111Given these changing expectations, the skills young people  need to learn before entering the workforce have also  changed. Every young person needs to understand how  computers work, how to navigate the internet, how to use  productivity tools, and how to keep their computers secure.  But they also need the opportunity to study computer  science. Computer science teaches computational thinking,  a different way to problem solve and a skill in high demand  by employers. Together these skills enable access to higher  paying jobs in faster-growing fields. Therefore, equitable  access to rigorous and engaging computer science courses  must be a top priority. If equitable access is left unaddressed,  we will exclude entire populations from fully participating in  this new world of work. The goal of equitable access should  be computer science classrooms that are diverse across race,  gender, disability and socioeconomic status. Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, embed  instruction in computational thinking into classes at every  grade level, while others struggle to close the digital skills  and computer science education gap. For example, while  the United States has made progress to ensure that all  students can take at least one computer science class before  graduating from high school, thousands of students still do  not have access.43 According to the College Board, last year  only 4,810 of the 37,000 high schools in the United States  offered the Advanced Placement computer science exam.  with girls, minorities, and the economically disadvantaged  least likely to have access.44AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work

113To help address the global need for digital skills development,  Microsoft Philanthropies partners with governments,  educators, nonprofits, and businesses and is involved in a  range of programs and partnerships aimed at addressing the  skills gap at scale. Together with our partners, we’re working  to help prepare young people for the future, especially those  who might not otherwise have access to opportunities to  acquire critical skills. For example, through our YouthSpark  program, Microsoft works with 150 nonprofit organizations in  60 countries to offer computer science learning both in and out  of school to more than 3 million young people, 83 percent of  whom are from underserved communities and more than half  are female.   To solve this problem, increasing the number of teachers  who are trained to teach computer science is also critical.  Technology Education and Literacy in Schools (TEALS)  is a program that operates in 349 high schools in 29 states  throughout the United States and is supported by Microsoft  Philanthropies. The program engages 1,000 tech volunteers  from over 500 different companies to team-teach computer  science, usually with the math or science teacher. Within two  years of working with their volunteer, 97 percent of classroom  teachers are able to teach computer science on their own,  creating the basis for sustainable computer science programs.AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
114Supporting today’s workers for the changing economy Because technology is changing so rapidly, it’s not enough  to just focus on educating tomorrow’s workforce; we must  also help today’s workers gain skills that are relevant in the  changing workplace. Economic growth depends on a skilled  workforce that can enable enterprises to take advantage of a  new generation of emerging digital technology innovations.  To achieve this, workers will need to be lifelong learners.  As noted earlier, the global economy is going through rapid  changes as automation and AI create demand for a more  skilled workforce. This is reflected in recent labor statistics  in the United States where, for the first time, job postings  have surpassed hiring in the monthly U.S. Bureau of Labor  Statistics Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS)  reporting.45    Chart 9. Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, October 2017.AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work 
115This is just one illustration of the global mismatch between  employer needs and the skills that today’s workers  possess. According to a 2017 survey by global staffing  firm ManpowerGroup, significant skills shortages exist  in Japan, India, Brazil, Turkey, Mexico, Greece, Australia  and Germany.46 In the United States, the National Skills  Coalition reports that 53 percent of jobs today are “middle  skill” or “new-collar” jobs that require more than a high  school diploma and less than a college degree. But only 43  percent of the workforce is a match for this requirement. At  the same time, while 20 percent of the workforce has a high  school graduation credential or less and is considered “lowskilled,” just 15 percent of jobs are open to people with this  level of educational attainment.47 Further, in a study of job  postings by Burning Glass Technologies, 8 out of 10 middleskills jobs require basic digital literacy skills, something that  more than half of workers today lack. Unless we change how  we prepare people for these new jobs, this gap will continue  to widen.48 The National Skills Coalition predicts that 80  percent of jobs that will be created by 2024 will require  post-secondary credentials.49  As demands for a more educated and skilled workforce  continue to grow, we must identify new ways to increase  the skills of today’s workers. Workforce systems will need  to evolve to keep pace with the changing technologies.  Emerging practices focused on distance and online learning  as well as investment in more on-the-job training programs  are key ways to prepare today’s workers for the changing  workplace. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
116To understand how to train the current workforce, it is  important to identify the skills that enterprises need.  Microsoft and its LinkedIn subsidiary are already  experimenting with new ways to understand which skills  are currently in demand and how to help people gain  them.50 For example, LinkedIn is working with the National  Cybersecurity Center (NCC) and the University of Colorado  at Colorado Springs to identify the most in-demand  cybersecurity occupations in the United States and map the  skills needed to be hired for those jobs.     LinkedIn is also working with local training programs to  update curriculum and to teach graduating students how to  use LinkedIn in their job search. Microsoft offers curriculum  and certification programs to help people develop digital  skills through programs like Imagine Academy, YouthSpark  and LinkedIn Learning.51 This is important because digital  skills are critical in all job clusters. In fact, research firm IDC  reports that knowing how to use Microsoft Office was the  third most cited skill requirement across all occupations.52  It will also be critical to identify new entry points into the  workforce. As enterprises face talent shortages, they must  explore new ways to bring in talent from available labor  pools. Microsoft and LinkedIn are testing several programs  that do this, such as Microsoft Software and Systems  Academy (MSSA). An 18-week training program, MSSA is  created specifically to prepare service members and veterans  for careers in cloud development, cloud administration, AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
117 Scan for more on  MSSA 
118cybersecurity administration, and database and business  intelligence administration. At the end of the program,  graduates interview for full-time jobs at Microsoft or one  of our hiring partners. So far, 240 companies have hired  graduates of MSSA. Microsoft is also working with the state  of Washington’s Apprenticeship and Training Council,  which offers the first registered apprenticeship program for  the IT industry.   LinkedIn supports the apprenticeship model as well, and  is working to identify ways to build an apprenticeship  marketplace. LinkedIn launched REACH, a six-month  apprenticeship program where people join a LinkedIn  engineering team to learn what it is like to work as a  software engineer and gain experience to help them pursue a  career in software development. LinkedIn is also partnering  with CareerWise Colorado to create a marketplace that lists  apprenticeship openings for high school students. And it is  working with the state of Colorado’s apprenticeship office to  help people understand the value of apprenticeships.     All of these programs are good first steps. But the next  — and maybe harder — challenge will be to figure out  how to scale these programs through public and private  partnerships to have sustainable impact on the workforce.   This will require both educational institutions to think  differently — at scale — about how they train, and  employers to think differently about how they identify and  onboard talent.AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
119Supporting the development of systems to create a skills-based  marketplace  To help foster economic prosperity across the globe,  the public and private sectors must also invest in new  educational delivery models. People need to be able to gain  the demand-driven skills required for advancement and  a system needs to be developed in which credentials are  portable, stackable and valued by employers. The rapidity of  change in the workplace requires employers and workforce  providers to work together in new ways. The public and  private sectors should seek to meet the needs of people at all  stages of the workforce continuum — from students entering  the workforce to unemployed and underemployed workers,  to people currently in the workforce who need help gaining  new skills to ensure their long-term employability.  To help enterprises find qualified employees and workers  find jobs, we’ll need to shift from a system based on  traditional degrees to a system based on skills. This system  should account for the rapidly evolving skills employers  need across occupations. And it should recognize the skills  individuals possess to more efficiently connect workers to  employers.  A first step will be to create a common taxonomy of skills.  Emerging technologies and changes to the workplace  require education providers to offer training in the skills  that employers need. It will be critical to codify the most  in-demand skills and train workers on them and on how  to articulate their skills to potential employers. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
120Employers and workforce agencies should use real-time  labor market information to identify in-demand skills, a  task for which LinkedIn and the broader IT industry are  well-placed to assist governments and workforce agencies.  Governments can use this information to develop and  deliver high-quality workforce training programs and offer  incentives and financial resources to private and nonprofit  organizations to provide training. Goals for educational  attainment should include outcomes related to employment,  skills and advancement.     Technology and data must be used to build a dynamic  skills-based labor marketplace that guides the education  and workforce systems. To be successful, we’ll need a  worker-centered framework for assessing learning outcomes  that harmonizes data across sectors in a way that is easier for  individuals to navigate. This framework should emphasize  the knowledge that employers require and include the  technical and foundational skills workers need in the  digital workplace. Foundational skills include problemsolving, work ethic, teamwork, curiosity and interpersonal  communication. This framework should guide training  organizations as they help people acquire skills and earn  credentials.  We also need to identify existing open jobs and the skills  required to fill them. Digital platforms such as LinkedIn,  TaskRabbit and Upwork offer insights about in-demand  skills based on job or task openings. Over time, this data  can be used to construct analyses such as the LinkedIn  Economic Graph to understand supply and demand for AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
121specific skills and how they vary over time for a given region,  particularly when combined with government data on local  demographics and businesses.  Microsoft and LinkedIn are taking additional steps to  understand which skills are in high demand, to invest in  skills development to address the changing nature of work  and of jobs, and to help people find jobs to match their  skills. In pursuit of these goals, Microsoft and LinkedIn  have partnered with Skillful, an initiative of the Markle  Foundation, that is creating a skills-based labor market that  works for everyone, with a focus on those without a college  degree. Microsoft has made a substantial investment to help  the Markle Foundation build this marketplace.53  To achieve its mission, Skillful helps employers expand  their talent pool by providing data, tools and resources to  simplify the adoption of skills-based practices. Coaches  and digital services enable job seekers to find out which  skills are in demand and access professional training at any  stage of their careers. Skillful also works with educators and  employers to ensure that students are learning the skills they  need to succeed in today’s digital economy. The partnership  aims to create a model that can be replicated across the  United States, aiming to help millions of Americans find  rewarding careers. Skillful is also working with LinkedIn  to test strategies to improve the lives of skilled workers  through initiatives such as Mentor Connect, LinkedIn’s pilot  mentorship program that uses Skillful’s coaching efforts and  platform.   AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
122To improve how the public and private sectors work together  to match job seekers with job openings, LinkedIn has  opened its listings to governments in the United States,  free of charge. In 2017, more than 1 million government job  listings appeared on LinkedIn. In addition, the National  Labor Exchange, which is managed by the National  Association of State Workforce Agencies and includes  jobs from all 50 state job banks, began sending its jobs  to LinkedIn in January 2017. LinkedIn has shared labor  market insights with more than 70 U.S. cities through the  White House TechHire program. LinkedIn has also shared  data with government agencies in New York, Los Angeles,  Chicago, Louisville, New Orleans, Seattle, San Francisco  and Cleveland to help them improve issues such as student  retention and youth unemployment, identify job biases, and  understand supply and demand for job skills.     While many of these programs are relatively new, it is  clear that we need to use data to build a more dynamic  skills-based labor marketplace that guides education and  workforce systems and prepares workers for available jobs.   Changing Norms for Changing Worker Needs To meet the challenges of the evolving economy, we must  also understand how the on-demand economy, part-time  work, independent contracting, and temporary jobs affect  individuals and society.54 These changes raise questions that  are not always adequately addressed by existing legal and  policy frameworks. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
123To enable innovation and to protect workers, the public  and private sectors must tackle a number of key policy  questions. Legal certainty must be created so that workers  and businesses understand their rights and obligations.  Industry must also define its own standards for worker  protection to ensure that society does not become further  divided between the “haves and have-nots.” To promote  the efficient flow of skills, encourage entrepreneurship, and  allow workers to exercise their market power to the best of  their ability, industry and governments must work together  to find ways to enable workers to take their benefits with  them as they change jobs. And the social safety net must  be modernized to support workers and families, as well  as stabilizing the economy during periods of economic  instability and labor market shifts.  Providing Legal Certainty and Structure for Employers   and Workers Given the velocity of change in the modern workforce, it  is not surprising that existing legal and policy frameworks  do not adequately address all of today’s changing work  arrangements. Questions and uncertainty about how to  categorize workers have been an issue for a sometime, with  consequences for businesses, workers and government. Now,  changes in labor marketplaces and the rise of on-demand  work platforms are increasing the urgency to find answers to  these questions.55   AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
124Broadly speaking, current laws tend to recognize only  two designations for workers: 1) employees who work on a  regular basis in a formal relationship with an employer; or  2) independent contractors who provide goods or services  under a specified contract.     Employees have traditionally enjoyed less flexibility and  control over their hours and working conditions, but retain  more stability and legal protection. Independent contractors  typically retain more control over when and how they work,  but receive fewer legal protections. Whether or not someone  is an employee determines whether they are protected by  traditional labor, wage and hour, and equal opportunity  laws, and whether they can access employer-provided  benefits such as private pensions, access to training,  retirement benefits and, in many countries, healthcare. A  worker’s designation also determines whether employers  contribute to and workers benefit from social safety net  benefits such as unemployment insurance and, in the United  States, Social Security and state-paid leave benefits.  Today, most on-demand workers are treated as independent  contractors by digital platforms and the businesses that  engage them. Under this classification, on-demand workers  are not protected by minimum wage and overtime pay  requirements, child labor regulations, or anti-discrimination  and anti-harassment laws. In addition, there is a lack of  clarity about the rights and protections that workers who  connect through an intermediary can expect under the  law. As dissatisfaction about the lack of protections grows,  on-demand workers are increasingly challenging such  designations through litigation or government intervention.56  AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
125The results have been inconsistent. For on-demand workers,  this creates uncertainty about what rights and benefits they  can expect. For platform companies and the businesses  that engage on-demand workers, it raises questions about  whether on-demand workers will be considered to be  employees, subject to the associated costs and protections.     Until labor and employment laws and systems for providing  benefits are modernized to respond to current workforce  trends, there’s a danger that growth in productivity and  opportunity will be constrained. There is a risk that if we fail  to impose baseline protections —  including wage protection  — work will become increasingly stratified between high  paying, stable employment and low-value, low-paid, taskoriented gigs. This may undermine the potential of the ondemand economy. Unfortunately, current discussions about  the classification of workers are often extremely polarized —  with business pushing for narrower classifications and labor  advocates pushing for more expansive interpretations. What  is needed is broader dialogue about the needs of businesses  and workers to determine what changes are required to  serve the interests of both in a way that is productive and  fair.  So far, policy recommendations have focused on either  redefining the categories of employees and independent  contractor or finding ways to mitigate the consequences of  this difference — often by extending protections, benefits  and social safety net participation to contingent workers.  Both of these approaches focus on addressing the issue by  making the distinction between the two categories less AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
126extreme and providing basic protections to workers who  are currently left out. Current policy proposals include  the implementation of a new worker classification for  “independent worker” that would fall between employee  and independent contractor; the creation of a safe harbor  for income and employment tax purposes for certain  workers; the expansion of collective bargaining and other  protections to certain classifications of on-demand workers;  and the adoption of voluntary minimum industry standards  for worker protections. All of these proposals should be  explored as more people find work through on-demand  platforms.  Developing Industry Standards to Protect All Workers  Today, business leaders have the opportunity to play a  significant role in reshaping employment policy for the  emerging economy by setting their own standards for  on-demand engagements. Microsoft believes we can (and  should) positively impact the treatment of on-demand  workers through its internal policy. Microsoft’s policy  includes minimum pay requirements for all on-demand  work. It requires that on-demand workers be paid within  one week of completing work and that all workers be treated  with dignity and respect. It also prohibits the use of child  labor and requires the on-demand platforms that it uses to  be accessible. Microsoft is implementing contractual terms  with the on-demand platforms it engages with that reflect  this policy.AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
127While corporate policies can provide some degree of  protection to on-demand workers, the impact is limited.  But enterprise users of on-demand labor also have an  opportunity to contribute to broader solutions to these  issues. For instance, groups such as freelancers’ unions  and caregiver coalitions have improved standards for task  workers — sometimes through legislation. Approaches like  the National Domestic Workers Alliance’s “Good Work  Code” for domestic workers in the United States offer a  framework for engaging workers that includes safety, shared  prosperity, a living wage, inclusion and input.57 Industry  leaders should encourage discussions among businesses  and workers to develop standards like these for task-based  work that might include wage, benefits and fair treatment  commitments. This could lead to a set of standards  endorsed by businesses that might serve as a framework for  nongovernmental policy. Such standards could either be  industry-specific or generalized to broader platforms, and  might also serve as the framework for legislation that sets  minimum protections. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
128Ensuring Benefits Move with Workers These labor market trends have tremendous implications for  both worker protections and employer-provided benefits.  The employer-based benefits model that emerged in most of  Europe and North America in the middle of the last century  is based on two principles: first, that businesses benefit  from the well-being of a stable workforce; and second, that  certain benefits are best provided by employers rather than  the government as an investment in workforce stability.  This approach has shaped our perspective of the social  contract between employers and employees. While the  nature of work has evolved with technology innovation,  the system of employer-provided benefits and social safety  nets has not. The challenge we face now is how to transform  benefits and social insurance programs to provide adequate  coverage for workers and a sustainable contribution  structure for businesses.  In today’s digital economy, the mobility of labor and the  ability to quickly focus skills on new growth areas are vitally  important to business success. Many businesses may find the  relative burden of maintaining employer-provided benefits  not worth the cost. Individual workers also want benefits  that are portable and flexible. Portability of benefits will be  critical to a viable solution. Three models have emerged as  possible solutions. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
129• Employer-provided benefits.  The issue of providing  benefits to people working in industries that are  structured around short-term projects is not new.  Industries such as construction and entertainment have  addressed this through labor-management partnerships  that enable workers to retain healthcare and pension  coverage across multiple employers, even for short-term  work. A collective bargaining structure provided a way  for employers to contribute to benefits pools without  bearing the burden of administration; workers did not  have to be responsible for moving benefits and seeking  out new providers. New models could use this approach,  which would reduce inefficiency and confusion, and  ensure that workers have access to basic protections  and adequate benefits. This would support greater labor  mobility because workers would be less likely to stay in  jobs simply to retain benefits. • Use of new platforms to provide benefits.  The rise of  on-demand labor platforms may create opportunities  to develop new ways for workers to access benefits. For  example, Care.com, a platform for caregivers, enables  families to contribute to their caregiver’s benefits  in a way that is similar to how traditional corporate  employers fund employee benefits.58 When families  pay a caregiver through Care.com, a percentage funds  benefits that stay with caregivers even when they go  to work for other families on Care.com. There are still  challenges to this approach — including what happens  when workers find work through different platforms. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
130• Government mandates and funds. In some  countries, national or even multinational government  organizations may seek to address this gap. In those  countries where a broad new nationwide system may not  be feasible, smaller governmental units may be able to  establish the infrastructure and risk pooling needed to  make benefits affordable. Some countries require basic  benefits, with an accompanying structure to provide  those benefits. In the United States, where broad new  federal programs have not received political support,  some states have sought to create their own healthcare  or retirement programs. In the short term, policymakers  should consider creating pilot programs to establish  portable benefits, such as, legislation introduced at the  state level in the United States.59  Modernizing the Social Safety Net A more mobile and dynamic workforce will increase  pressure on social safety net programs. As people find work  through a more diverse array of non-exclusive arrangements  that may not include employer-provided benefits or  allow workers to earn enough to build their own savings,  they will rely more than ever on safety net programs like  unemployment insurance, workers’ compensation and Social  Security.  Programs that are triggered during a worker’s productive  working years are particularly important for workers’  economic stability, which in turn helps maintain a diverse  and skilled workforce. Periods of joblessness produce income  volatility, which can have serious long-term consequences AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
131for workers and their families. This also reduces the pool  of available skilled labor for businesses. Even a robust  economy includes a significant level of under-employment  or unemployment. In August 2017, the U.S. Bureau of Labor  Statistics estimated that 7.1 million American workers  were unemployed, with an additional 5.3 million working  part-time for economic reasons or as involuntary part-time  workers. These periods are likely to occur many times over a  worker’s life.60   Many existing social safety net programs are already  underfunded and face further fiscal pressures as workforces  age. This means that during periods when there is increased  need, such as during a recession, existing safety nets are  likely to prove inadequate. Compounding the problem,  many comprehensive safety net programs are heavily  dependent on traditional employment relationships. A  significant shift away from traditional employment without  corresponding policy changes could further erode workbased social safety net programs. Finally, these programs  do not take into account newer models of work, nor do  they anticipate that individuals may move in and out of the  workforce with greater frequency or for a greater variety of  reasons. It will be essential to modernize these programs to  encourage labor mobility and enable workers to gain new  skills and connect to new opportunities.  Companies can begin to experiment with public-private  partnerships to explore how to meet the needs of workers.  For example, Microsoft, through LinkedIn, is exploring new  ways to speed the re-employment of workers in the United  States. LinkedIn is working with the state of Utah to test AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
132network-based job searching as a strategy for reemployment  through a pilot program that was recently highlighted  by the Trump administration for saving taxpayer money  by enabling unemployed workers to find new jobs more  effectively. In addition, Microsoft and LinkedIn are building  tools for employment counselors and job seekers that  would improve workforce programs such as unemployment  insurance and state workforce programs. And LinkedIn is  working with the National Association of State Workforce  Agencies to produce job search curriculum for its network of  2,500 publicly managed job centers in the United States.  Enterprises should continue to use data and technology tools  to assist governments in identifying opportunities for worker  redeployment to scale these solutions beyond pilots and  experiments. However, modernizing the social safety net  will require a multifaceted approach such as: • Rethink unemployment insurance and  reemployment programs, including job training  and trade adjustment assistance programs.   Steps have been proposed to begin modernizing  unemployment insurance and to bolster the program’s  solvency. Businesses should engage in discussions  about the importance of next-generation versions of  unemployment insurance and employment services  that take into account newer models of work; anticipate  that individuals may move in and out of the workforce  with greater frequency; promote greater labor mobility;  and help workers gain new skills and connect with new  opportunities. AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
133• Reform tax policy and social safety net. Policymakers  must explore how to adjust policies to adequately fund  social safety net programs. This may include going beyond  existing tax bases to consider other methods of funding  social safety nets. For example, some have questioned  whether wages are the right measure of income to be taxed.  Where business productivity may be better measured by  production than through wages, some propose assessing  taxes to support social safety nets and government revenue  based on other measures.    The case must also be made for how social programs can  increase the size of the labor pool; be structured to help  employees move in and out of work more easily and more  flexibly; and reduce burdens for employers. Without significant  modernization, social safety nets will not adequately support  emerging models of work. The private and public sectors must  join together to explore how to best support workers in the new  economy.   Working Together    As we move forward, it will be essential for governments,  the private sector, academia, and the social sector to join  together to explore how to best support workers in the  new economy. This can be achieved by developing new  approaches to training and education that enable people  to acquire the skills that employers need as technology  advances; by creating innovative ways to connect workers  with job opportunities; and by modernizing protections for  workers to promote labor mobility and cushion workers and  their families against uncertainty in a fast-changing global  economy.AI and the  Future of  Jobs and  Work
134 Conclusion   AI Amplifying  Human  Ingenuity  
135What happens when we begin to augment human  intelligence and ingenuity with the computational  intelligence of computers? What does human-centered AI  look like?    It may look a lot like Melisha Ghimere, a 20-year-old  computer science student at Kantipur Engineering College in  Kathmandu, Nepal. Melisha’s team was a regional finalist in  Microsoft’s Imagine Cup competition in 2016.   Like the vast majority of the people of Nepal, she comes  from a family of subsistence farmers who raise cows, goats  and water buffalo. Over the years, her aunt and uncle,  Sharadha and Rajesh, did well, building a herd of more than  40 animals — enough to raise two children, support four  other relatives, and even hire a few workers to help out. But  then, seven years ago, an outbreak of anthrax wiped out  much of their herd. They are still struggling to regain their  economic footing.    At college, Melisha’s family was never far from her mind.  So she set out to develop a technology-based solution that  would help farmers like her uncle. Working with three other  students, she researched livestock farming and veterinary  practices, and spoke with many farmers. Together, they built  a prototype for a monitoring device that tracks temperature,  sleep patterns, stress levels, motion and the activity of farm  animals. Melisha’s AI system predicts the likely health  of each animal based on often subtle changes in these  observations. Farmers can follow the health of their animals  on their mobile phones, access advice and recommendations  to keep the animals healthy, and receive alerts when there  are signs of sickness or stress, or when an animal might be  pregnant.AI  Amplifying  Human  Ingenuity
136Melisha’s project is still in its infancy, but the early results  have been promising. In the first field tests, the solution was  about 95 percent accurate in predicting an animal’s health.  It already enabled one family to prevent a deadly outbreak  by identifying a cow that was in the earliest stages of an  anthrax infection, before symptoms were evident to the  farmer.    Like Melisha’s project, AI itself is still at a nascent stage.  Thanks to advances in the past few years, we’re beginning  to build systems that can perceive, learn and reason, and  on this basis, can make predictions or recommendations.  Nearly every field of human endeavor could benefit from AI  systems designed to complement human intelligence. From  preventing once-deadly diseases, to enabling people with  disabilities to participate more fully in society, to creating  more sustainable ways to use the earth’s scarce resources, AI  promises a better future for all.   Change of this magnitude inevitably gives rise to societal  issues. The computer era has required us to grapple with  important questions about privacy, safety, security, fairness,  inclusion, and the importance and value of human labor. All  of these questions will take on particular importance as AI  systems become more useful and are more widely deployed.  To ensure that AI can deliver on its promise, we must find  answers that embrace the full range of human hopes, needs,  expectations and desires.   This will take a human-centered approach to AI that  reflects timeless values. And it will take an approach that is  firmly centered on harnessing the power of computational AI  Amplifying  Human  Ingenuity
137intelligence to help people. The idea isn’t to replace people  with machines, but to supplement human capabilities with  the unmatched ability of AI to analyze huge amounts of data  and find patterns that would otherwise be impossible to  detect.    How AI will change our lives — and the lives of our children  — is impossible to predict. But we can look to Melisha’s  device — a device that could help millions of small farmers  in remote communities live more prosperously — to see one  example of what can happen when human intelligence and  imagination are augmented by the power of AI.   We believe there are millions of Melishas around the world  — people young and old who have imaginative ideas for  how to harness AI to address societal challenges. Imagine  the insight that will be unleashed if we can give them all  access to the tools and capabilities that AI offers. Imagine  the problems they will solve and the innovations they will  create.    This won’t happen by itself. A human-centered approach  can only be realized if researchers, policymakers, and  leaders from government, business and civil society come  together to develop a shared ethical framework for artificial  intelligence. This in turn will help foster responsible  development of AI systems that will engender trust. As we  move forward, we look forward to working with people in  all walks of life and every sector to develop and share best  practices for building a foundation for human-centered AI  that is trusted by all.AI  Amplifying  Human  Ingenuity

The availability of broadband in remote and underserved communities  can be instrumental in expanding the quality and accessibility of educa tion, training and broader civic engagement. But there are 23.4 million  people living in rural counties who don’t have access to broadband and  therefore do not have access to on-demand learning tools. To meet that  need, in July 2017, Microsoft launched its Rural Airband Initiative to help  serve as a catalyst for broader market adoption of this new model and to  eliminate the rural broadband gap in the U.S. by July 4, 2022.   https://news.microsoft.com/rural-broadband .   51.

Just as more accurate and up-to-date data is needed to understand  evolving jobs and needed skills, more data also is needed to better under stand how employer and employee relationships and working conditions  are evolving, including how the nature of work is changing. In addition,  many existing government programs rely upon wage data to assess em ployment outcomes; a broader set of data may be needed to understand the  true impact of newer contingent worker arrangements. Platform companies  can contribute private-sector data to enhance this analysis. Endnotes

Although online platforms, by most estimates, still only make up less  than 1 percent of the workforce, the percentage of workers not in tradi tional employer/employee work arrangements (temporary agencies, on-call  workers, contract workers, independent contractors or freelancers) is much  greater. See, e.g., The Rise and Nature of Alternative Work Arrangements  in The United States, 1995-2015.   56. In the absence of modernized laws, regulatory agencies are developing  interpretations that represent vast departures from prior precedent — for  example, expanding the scope of joint employment. With the changing  political composition of many regulatory agencies, there is the potential  for new case law that swings the pendulum in the opposite direction. The  United States Congress is also proposing to legislate key definitions.   57. http://www.goodworkcode.org/about .    58. http://www.care.com .    59.

The National Lon gitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79) tracked a nationally representa tive sample of people born in the years 1957 to 1964; they experienced an  average of 5.6 spells of unemployment from age 18 to age 48. High school  dropouts experienced an average of 7.7 spells of unemployment from age  18 to age 48, while high school graduates experienced 5.4 spells and college  graduates experienced 3.9 spells. In addition, nearly one-third of high  school dropouts in the survey experienced 10 or more spells of unemploy ment, compared with 22 percent of high school graduates and 6 percent of  college graduates.
