Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration    6. Governance, Accountability & Transparency       Annex A: Definitions      Annex B: Endnotes       1. Preamble         These Global Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy (“the Principles”)    have been developed by companies, investors, civil society organizations and    academics (collectively “the participants”) who aim to protect and advance    freedom of expression and privacy in the Information and Communications    Technology (ICT) industry globally. ​ 1         These Principles are based on internationally recognized laws and standards for    human rights, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (“UDHR”), the    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR”) and the    International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (“ICESCR”). ​ 2, 3 ​  The    application of these Principles is informed by the UN Guiding Principles on    Business and Human Rights (“UN Guiding Principles”), the ‘Protect, Respect, and    Remedy’ Framework, and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. ​ 4       All human rights are indivisible, interdependent, and interrelated: the    improvement of one right facilitates advancement of the others; the deprivation    of one right adversely affects others. Freedom of expression and privacy are an    1  
    Principles on Freedom of      Expression and Privacy    explicit part of this international framework of human rights and are enabling    rights that facilitate the meaningful realization of other human rights. ​ 5       The duty of governments to respect, protect, promote and fulfill human rights is    the foundation of this human rights framework. That duty includes ensuring that    national laws, regulations and policies are consistent with international human    rights laws and standards on freedom of expression and privacy.       ICT companies have the responsibility to respect and promote the freedom of    expression and privacy rights of their users. ICT has the potential to enable the    exchange of ideas and access to information in a way that supports economic    opportunity, advances knowledge and improves quality of life. By implementing    these Principles, ICT companies can also work to protect, promote and support    human rights, including through improved responsible decision-making, shared    learning and multi-stakeholder collaboration.      The collaboration between the ICT industry, investors, civil society organizations,    academics and other stakeholders can strengthen efforts to work with    governments to advance freedom of expression and privacy globally.       ICT companies should comply with all applicable laws and respect internationally    recognized human rights, wherever they operate. If national laws, regulations    and policies do not conform to international standards, ICT companies should    avoid, minimize, or otherwise address the adverse impact of government    demands, laws, or regulations, and seek ways to honor the principles of    internationally recognized human rights to the greatest extent possible. ICT    companies should also be able to demonstrate their efforts in this regard. For    these reasons, these Principles and their accompanying Implementation    Guidelines establish a framework to provide direction and guidance to the ICT    industry and its stakeholders in protecting and advancing the enjoyment of    human rights globally.       The participants have also developed a multi-stakeholder governance structure to    ensure accountability for the implementation of these Principles and their    continued relevance, effectiveness and impact. This includes transparency with    the public, independent evaluation and multi-stakeholder collaboration.         The participants will seek to extend the number of organizations from around the    world supporting these Principles so that they can take root as a global standard.       GLOBAL NETWORK INITIATIVE    As Updated May 2017                                               2   
    Principles on Freedom of      Expression and Privacy       2. Freedom of Expression       Freedom of opinion and expression is a human right and guarantor of human    dignity. The right to freedom of opinion and expression includes the freedom to    hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information    and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. ​ 6         Freedom of opinion and expression supports an informed citizenry and is vital to    ensuring public and private sector accountability. Broad public access to    information and the freedom to create and communicate ideas are critical to the    advancement of knowledge, economic opportunity and human potential.         The right to freedom of expression should not be restricted by governments,    except in narrowly defined circumstances based on internationally recognized    laws or standards. ​  7 ​   These restrictions should be consistent with international    human rights laws or standards, the rule of law and be necessary and    proportionate for the relevant purpose. ​ 8 ​  ​ 9         • Participating companies will respect and work to protect the freedom of    expression of their users by seeking to avoid or minimize the impact of    government restrictions on freedom of expression, including restrictions    on the information available to users and the opportunities for users to    create and communicate ideas and information, regardless of frontiers or    media of communication.       • Participating companies will respect and work to protect the freedom of    expression rights of users when confronted with government ​ 10 ​  demands,    laws and regulations to suppress freedom of expression, remove content or    otherwise limit access to communications, ideas and information in a    manner inconsistent with internationally recognized laws and standards.       3. Privacy       Privacy is a human right and guarantor of human dignity. Privacy is important to    maintaining personal security, protecting identity and promoting freedom of    expression in the digital age.         GLOBAL NETWORK INITIATIVE    As Updated May 2017                                               3   
    Principles on Freedom of      Expression and Privacy       Everyone should be free from illegal or arbitrary interference with the right to    privacy and should have the right to the protection of the law against such    interference or attacks. ​ 11         The right to privacy should not be restricted by governments, except in narrowly    defined circumstances based on internationally recognized laws and standards.    These restrictions should be consistent with international human rights laws or    standards, the rule of law and be necessary and proportionate for the relevant    purpose.         • Participating companies will employ protections with respect to personal    information in all countries where they operate in order to work to protect    the privacy rights of users.         • Participating companies will respect and work to protect the privacy rights    of users when confronted with government demands, laws or regulations    that compromise privacy in a manner inconsistent with internationally    recognized laws and standards.       4. Responsible Company Decision Making       The implementation of these Principles by participating companies requires their    integration into company decision making and culture through responsible    policies, procedures and processes.       • Participating companies will ensure that the company Board, senior    officers and others responsible for key decisions that impact freedom of    expression and privacy are fully informed of these Principles and how they    may be best advanced.       • Participating companies will identify circumstances where freedom of    expression and privacy may be jeopardized or advanced and integrate    these Principles into their decision making in these circumstances.          GLOBAL NETWORK INITIATIVE    As Updated May 2017                                               4   
    Principles on Freedom of      Expression and Privacy    • Participating companies, when implementing these Principles, ​ will always    seek to ensure ​  the safety and liberty of company personnel who may be    placed at risk.       • Participating companies will implement these Principles when they have    operational control. When they do not have operational control,    participating companies will use best efforts to ensure that business    partners, investments, suppliers, distributors and other relevant related    parties follow these Principles. ​ 12 13 ​  ​ 14      5. Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration       The development of collaborative strategies involving business, industry    associations, civil society organizations, investors and academics will be critical    to the achievement of these Principles.       While infringement on freedom of expression and privacy are not new concerns,    the violation of these rights in the context of the growing use of ICT is new, global,    complex and constantly evolving.  For this reason, shared learning, public policy    engagement and other multi-stakeholder collaboration will advance the    enjoyment of these Principles.       • Participants will take a collaborative approach to problem solving and    explore new ways in which the collective learning from multiple    stakeholders can be used to advance freedom of expression and privacy.         • Individually and collectively, participants will engage governments and    international institutions to promote the rule of law and the adoption of    laws, policies and practices that protect, respect and fulfil freedom of    expression and privacy. ​ 15       6. Governance, Accountability & Transparency       These Principles require a governance structure that supports their purpose and    ensures their long term success.          GLOBAL NETWORK INITIATIVE    As Updated May 2017                                               5   
    Principles on Freedom of      Expression and Privacy    To ensure the effectiveness of these Principles participants must be held    accountable for their role in the advancement and implementation of these    Principles.         • Participants will adhere to a collectively determined governance structure    that defines the roles and responsibilities of participants, ensures    accountability and promotes the advancement of these Principles.         • Participants will be held accountable through a system of (a) transparency    with the public and (b) independent assessment and evaluation of the    implementation of these Principles.       Annex A: Definitions         Freedom of Expression: ​ Freedom of expression is defined using Article 19 of the    Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 19 of the    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR):       UDHR: ​  Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right    includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and    impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.       ICCPR: ​  1. Everyone shall have the right to hold opinions without interference.      2. Everyone shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include    freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds,    regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or    through any other media of his choice.      3. The exercise of the rights provided for in paragraph 2 of this article carries    with it special duties and responsibilities. It may therefore be subject to certain    restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are    necessary:      (a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others;      (b) For the protection of national security or of public order (ordre public), or of    public health or morals.          GLOBAL NETWORK INITIATIVE    As Updated May 2017                                               6   
    Principles on Freedom of      Expression and Privacy    Privacy: ​ We define privacy using Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of    Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and    Political Rights (ICCPR):       UDHR: ​  No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy,    family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation.    Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or    attacks.       ICCPR: ​ 1. No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his    privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour    and reputation.         2. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or    attacks.       Rule of Law: ​ A system of transparent, predictable and accessible laws and    independent legal institutions and processes which respect, protect, promote and    fulfill human rights.           Personal Information: ​  Participants are aware of the range of definitions for    “personal information” or “personally identifiable information” and    acknowledge that these definitions vary between jurisdictions. These Principles    use the term “personal information” and interpret this to mean information that    can, alone or in aggregate, be used to identify or locate an individual (such as    name, email address or billing information) or information which can be    reasonably linked, directly or indirectly, with other information to identify or    locate an individual.       User: ​  Any individual using a publicly available electronic communications    service, for private or business purposes, with or without having subscribed to    this service.       Best Efforts: ​  The participating company will, in good faith, undertake reasonable    steps to achieve the best result in the circumstances and carry the process to its    logical conclusion.             GLOBAL NETWORK INITIATIVE    As Updated May 2017                                               7   
    Principles on Freedom of      Expression and Privacy       Annex B: Endnotes         1.  This reference to "protect" does not mean that Participants have the State's    duty to protect human rights. Rather, GNI Participants work to protect privacy    and freedom of expression by implementing these Principles, including    developing collaborative strategies to engage governments.      2.  It is recognized that other regional human rights instruments address the    issues of freedom of expression and privacy, including: The European    Convention, implemented by the European Court of Human Rights; the American    Convention, implemented by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and    Inter-American Commission; and the Organization of African Unity, implemented    by the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights.    3.  These Principles have also been drafted with reference to the World Summit    on the Information Society Tunis Agenda for the Information Society.    4.  These Principles were originally launched in 2008, prior to the endorsement of    the UN Guiding Principles by the UN Human Rights Council in June 2011 and the    2011 update to the OECD Guidelines.    5.  It should be noted that the specific scope of these Principles is limited to    freedom of expression and privacy.    6.  Taken from Article 19 of Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article of    19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It should be noted    that these Articles reference the right to “freedom of opinion and expression”,    and then describe the limited circumstances in which the right to “freedom of    expression” (i.e. not opinion) can be restricted. That is the approach taken by    these Principles.      7.  The narrowly defined circumstances should be taken from Article 19 of the    International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), namely the actions    necessary to preserve national security and public order, protect public health or    morals, or safeguard the rights or reputations of others. The scope of permissible    restrictions provided in Article 19(3) of the ICCPR is read within the context of    further interpretations issued by international human rights bodies, including    the Human Rights Committee and the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and    protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression.      8.  See Annex A for an illustrative definition of Rule of Law.    9.  These Principles have been drafted with reference to the Johannesburg    Principles on National Security, Freedom of Expression and Access to       GLOBAL NETWORK INITIATIVE    As Updated May 2017                                               8   
    Principles on Freedom of      Expression and Privacy    Information. These Principles provide further guidance on how and when    restrictions to freedom of expression may be exercised.      10.  Participating companies will also need to address situations where    governments may make demands through proxies and other third parties.      11.  Taken from Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and    Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.    12.  “Operational control” means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct or    cause the direction of the management and policies of the entity. This may be by    contract, ownership of voting stock or representation on the Board of Directors or    similar governing body.      13.  See Annex A for a definition of Best Efforts.    14.  It is recognized that the influence of the participating company will vary    across different relationships and contractual arrangements. It is also recognized    that this principle applies to business partners, suppliers, investments,    distributors and other relevant related parties that are involved in the    participating company’s business in a manner that materially affects the    company’s role in respecting and protecting privacy and freedom of expression.    The participating company should prioritize circumstances where it has greatest    influence and/or where the risk to freedom of expression and privacy is at its    greatest.    15.  It is recognized that participants may take different positions on specific    public policy proposals or strategies, so long as they are consistent with these    Principles ​ .         GLOBAL NETWORK INITIATIVE    As Updated May 2017                                               9
