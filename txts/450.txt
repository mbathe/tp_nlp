    1      National strategies on Artificial Intelligence   A European perspective in 2019     Country report  – Netherlands     In October 2019, the Dutch government has released its strategic action for artificial intelligence  (Netherlands, 2019a); a  less extensive version is also available in English  (Netherlands, 2019b). The policy report presents a ra nge of policy  initiatives and action plans to strengthen Netherlands’ competitiveness in AI on the global market. The vision of the Dutch  AI strategy relies on three strategic pillars, aiming at:    Capitalising  on societal and economic opportunities: policies encouraging the adoption, use and development of  AI in the private and public sector and promoting the use of AI to tackle societal challenges;    Creating the right conditions: policies supporting education a nd skills development in AI; fostering research and  innovation in AI, facilitating the access to qualitative data and improving the digital infrastructure;    Strengthening the foundations: including policy actions related to ethical issues, such as trust, hu man rights,  consumer protection, and safety of citizens.   The strategy contains an extensive list of initiatives aiming at fostering AI in the economy through policies related to  education, research and innovation developments from the lab to the market, ne tworking, regulation and infrastructure.   As per funding, the Dutch version of the strategy mentions in annex that the yearly governmental budget to AI innovation  and research is estimated at €45 million. The supercomputer developed at SURF and financed by the Ministry of Education,  Culture and Science has a cost of €18 million.   1 Human capital   Formal education and training reforms are foreseen through policies targeting increased digital literacy in primary and  secondary education and providing more opportuni ties to develop skills and competences in data science in higher  education ( National Data Science Trainee program ). A national online course on AI  is also available for civil servants in the  Netherlands. Vocational training initiatives funded by the Regional Investment Fund  will t arget more closely the future  (digital) needs of the labour market. Further training and lifelong learning are fostered with the STAP -scheme  – a €200  million investment to create training opportunities in AI and digital skills for individuals – and with a multi -annual  programme for the improvement of Lifelong Development , with particular focus on digital skills.   2 From the lab to the market   In order to stimulate basic and applied research in AI, the Dutch Research Council  is supporting a new research programme  on artificial intelligence. To complement this initiative, the Dutch AI -coalition proposes the establishment of an AI  Competence Centre. In order to create favourable conditions for com panies to invest in AI, the Dutch government improves  access to innovation funding and venture capital through Innovation Credits , the Seed Capital Scheme  and the Dutch  Venture Initiative . In addition, the Chamber of Commerce offers hands -on information on AI, whi ch could support  companies in their innovation efforts.   3 Networking   The Dutch government highly values collaborations and partnerships in AI. To this purpose, the Dutch AI -coalition is  currently drafting a plan to enhance synergies between research, educati on and organisations. Examples of public -private  partnerships (PPPs) in the Netherlands are Commit2Data  and VWData  with a focus on big data. The importance of PPPs  
  2   is further emphasized in the Knowledge & Innovation Agenda 2020 -2023  mentioning the need for collaboration on key  technologies as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, the strategy highli ghts examples of national  collaborations in using AI applications in the legal environment (e.g. document automation and due diligence based on AI)  and the public domain (e.g. chatbots). Finally, collaborations across the national borders are encouraged by  strengthening  Netherlands’ partnership in European AI consortia (e.g. BVDA/EURobotics , AI4EU , CLAIRE  and ELLIS ) and international AI  collaborations such as Holland Innovation Network .  4 Regulation   Regarding regulation, the Dutch government advocates an ethical, trustworthy and re sponsible use of AI with respect for  human rights and consumer protection, and based on a well -developed legal framework. Policy actions relate to various  research activities on ethical, legal and transparency aspects, and responsible use of AI. The Dutch government also  highlights its active participation into High Level Experts Groups and European Directives on these issues.   5 Infrastructure   The Dutch strategy includes policy initiatives to foster the data infrastructure and to provide foundations for data usage  and sharing. It includes the promotion of FAIR principles for private data sharing, the participation into the Common  European Data Sp ace and the creation of an inventory of data sharing solutions. In terms of digital and telecommunication  infrastructure, the Dutch strategy mentions among others the Digital Connectivity Action Plan  (aiming at setting up a high quality connectivity) and the government investments in supercomputing power (e.g. supercomputer at SURF  and  Netherlands’ commitment in the Digital Europe Program ).  6 Update   The outlined strategy will be annually reviewed and updated b y the Dutch government.
