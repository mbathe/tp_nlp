Ethical by Design: Principles for Good TechnologyTYPE:THOUGHT LEADERSHIP
CATEGORY: TECHNOLOGY & DESIGN
PUBLISHED: SEP 2018
DOWNLOADEthical By Design: Principles for Good TechnologyLearn the principles you need to consider when designing ethical technology, how to balance the intentions of design and use, and the rules of thumb to prevent ethical missteps. Understand how to break down some of the biggest challenges and explore a new way of thinking for creating purpose-based design.
You’re responsible for what you design – make sure you build something good. Whether you are editing a genome, building a driverless car or writing a social media algorithm, this report offers the knowledge and tools to do so ethically. From Facebook to a brand new start-up, the responsibility begins with you. In this guide we offer key principles to help guide ethical technology creation and management.





"Technology seems to be at the heart of more and more ethical crises. So many of the ethical scandals we’re seeing in the technology sector are happening because people aren’t well-equipped to take a holistic view of the ethical landscape."
DR MATTHEW BEARD
