4 Preface Technologies can rarely be reduced to their mere commercial added value.   The history of the Industrial Revolution teaches us that nation states have always  endeavored to build or maintain political supremacy through pioneering economic  achievements. In the age of digital upheavals, multiple disruptions and immense  acceleration, this dictum still applies. The topic of “artificial intelligence” plays a special role here – a technology that is  currently being discussed worldwide and increasingly applied. As with any new tech nology, both the Cassandrian pessimists (such as Steven Hawking or Elon Musk) and  the progress optimists (Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt or Bill Gates) contribute their  theses on the future development of humanity. They widely vary from dark dystopia  to paradisiacal future prospects. Let us hope that the recently appointed Enquete Commission of the German Bundestag will counter an agitated and possibly overheated debate with sober stocktaking.  Germany’s AI strategy, which is expected by the end of the year, must define quanti fiable goals and concrete measures, which will then be vigorously implemented. The  political crash barriers necessary for the use of automated machine learning need to  be established. Other countries are well ahead in this respect. They have long since defined AI strate gies, developed business models and subjected ground-breaking applications to initial  practical tests. Therefore, it is worth taking a close look at how other economies are  dealing with the digital revolution: What regulatory framework conditions have they  defined? How do they implement policy strategies and programs to create new indus trial policy facts? With this two-part publication, the Konrad Adenauer Foundation intends to give a com parative overview of the AI strategies of major national economies in order to provide  food for thought and inspire the German debate. We believe: “Tech is politics” – and pol itics and civil society should give this more attention and discuss this more vigorously. I hope you find this publication an inspiring read. Yours  Dr. Gerhard Wahlers Dr. Gerhard Wahlers is Deputy Secretary General and Head of the Principal Department   for European and International Cooperation of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung.
5 Background and Definitions Artificial intelligence:   rapid developments and designs of the  initial conceptual AI frameworks. In July 2018, the German federal government  published a key issues paper on the German  strategy with regard to artificial intelligence (AI)  and there they acknowledge: “Artificial intelli gence has reached a new stage of maturity in  recent years and is becoming a driver of digitiza tion and autonomous systems in all spheres of  life.”1 Therefore, the state, society, the economy,  the government, and science are urged to con sider artificial intelligence in depth and to deal  with its chances and risks. A comprehensive German AI strategy was pre sented at the Digital Summit in December 2018.  The aim is to prominently embed the topic of AI  in the digital policy of the federal government.  In this way, Germany is catching up with a large  number of countries which in recent years have  seen extensive initiatives for AI strategy finding  processes.2 These strategies are motivated by partly spec tacular progress in research and application of  AI systems, based on techniques of Machine  Learning (ML) as well as its subdiscipline of Deep  Learning (DL) and its large varieties of neuronal  networks. The global relevance of AI technologies is dem onstrated by their prominent representation on  this year’s international agenda – from the Munich  Security Conference in February, to the presenta tion of the EU Commission’s3 AI paper in April, to  the joint AI declaration of the G7 states in Canada  in June (“Charlevoix Common Vision for the Future  of Artificial Intelligence”).4 The role of Artificial Intelligence as a potential key  technology of dystopian future concepts, social  control, and autocratic world power fantasies is  also increasingly finding its way into public debate. This overview, however, focuses on the analysis of  AI framework conceptss in six countries and how  they deal with the revolutionary potential of Artifi cial Intelligence. The following definition is used as a basis  for the terminology: “In the broadest sense, artificial intelli gence is the ability of machines to learn,  to think, to plan and to perceive; i. e. the  primary qualities that we identify with  human cognition. This ability is achieved  by digital technologies or digital-phys ical hybrid technologies, which imitate  the cognitive and physical functions of  humans. For that purpose, AI systems  do not only process data, they recognize  patterns, draw conclusions, and become  more intelligent over time. Their ability to  adopt and refine newly developed skills  has improved significantly since the turn  of the century. This also means that what  is referred to as AI changes with each  major technological breakthrough, and  the definition must therefore be periodi cally adjusted.” 1 Cf.

6 The following summary describes the insights and assessments of the status quo of national strate gies for the promotion of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The analysis of the six countries from part 1 of  the study and the findings from the countries examined in this part (Canada, Japan, Israel, United  Arab Emirates, India and Singapore) serve as a basis. Against the background of the results of the  first two parts of the study, there is also a third part in preparation which focuses exclusively on  the analysis of the recently published German AI strategy and the recommendations for action that  follow it. Policy fields for AI:  In the European countries,  the economic potential of AI is considered above  all, while in Japan AI is seen as part of the inevita ble next stage in human development, which will  encompass all areas of life: Society 5.0 . In Israel,  the security policy dimension plays a central role;  an aspect that other countries selectively or only  rudimentarily address in their strategies. The  USA, and China in particular, benefit from mutu ally open civil and military sectors. In India, the AI  focus is on the promotion of social and societal  aspects. Ethics and human orientation as strategic  strengths of the Europeans: Although ethical  issues are discussed in different social forums in  China and the USA, the topic is not given any high  priority by the respective governments. This has  left leeway for France’s Emanuel Macron to take  the lead on the topic of ethical AI. Although Lon don took the initiative faster than Paris to develop  an international AI governance architecture , it was  weakened by the Brexit in its attempts to project  and implement such initiative. Other countries,  such as Finland, also lack the international signifi cance for this. The private sector as driver in AI development:  In the leading AI countries, i. e. the USA and China,  the development dynamics are largely determined  by the private sector, in particular by young com panies and globally operating Internet groups.  These dynamics are enhanced by the deregulation  tendencies that are common in the USA. In China,  on the other hand, trends towards increased  state control of the large technology companies become more and more evident. In Japan and  South Korea, it is also the globally positioned  hardware-oriented conglomerates that are driving  AI forward. In the countries of continental Europe  (including Germany), which focus on science and  the protection of individuals, there is currently a  lack of global technology companies. This is based  in part on a general skepticism towards digital  technologies and the resulting protective attitude  of politics and society. AI superpowers vs. “fortress countries”:  In com parison to the USA, where cooperation between  business and science has grown over decades,  Europeans, but also countries such as Canada,  Singapore, Japan and India, have so far only been  able to achieve this permeability to a very limited  extent. Excellent research results remain in the  ivory tower and its walls of debilitating regula tion. Connecting AI research with the needs of  the industry thus represents a major challenge in  these countries. Ecosystems as a strategic asset:  In order to  develop better solutions and introduce them into  the international dialogue, in addition to research ers, 2. talented developers, 3. data pools, 4. com puting capacities and 5. strategic entrepreneurs,  experienced investors (6.) and an agile (7.) are also  required. While in the USA and China as well as  partly in Israel these factors provide the breeding  ground for the successful commercialisation of AI,  within Europe this is only possible to some extent  in the United Kingdom. In France or Finland, the  small number of AI startups bears witness to the  fact that such ecosystems are not yet actively Summary
7 Summary thought through and supported to the necessary  extent. In Japan and South Korea, the majority  of these factors is concentrated in large corpo rations, while local startup ecosystems remain  small. Lack of computing capacities as a strategic  weakness:  While availability of data and training  of specialists are promoted by many strategies as  a prerequisite for AI research and commercialisa tion, only in a few cases is there also a focus on  the expansion of domestic computing capacities  (except: South Korea, Japan and China). The cur rent global trade conflicts reveal that availability of  powerful chips or access to cloud-based comput ing power is a strategic necessity. Despite a tech nologically highly developed economy, there is  only a small globally competitive semiconductors  industry in Europe. At the moment, US companies  dominate this sector. Vague and inconsistent AI definitions:  In the  strategies compared, there are very different defi nitions of AI, or in some cases no definitions at all.  The only thing that the strategies have in com mon is that they consider AI a driving force in the  digital revolution, which harbours both potentials  and risks in terms of social, economic and secu rity policy. Accordingly, they often leave aside any  existing sector or digital strategies. This is the the oretical foundation and basis for the divergence  and convergence of different national AI strate gies. Such divergence and convergence is both  positive and problematic, since it leads to appli cation diversity on the one hand, but at the same  time increases the cost and time expenditure for  political transition and implementation of global  approaches for cooperation and regulation. Lack of target systems:  The strategies are pre dominantly formulated in general terms. Their  partially vague objectives relate to different levels  of impact. For example, China measures the eco nomic strength of the AI industry, among others,  while Great Britain and South Korea also set tar gets for the number of future PhD students. The  Japanese government has established clear goals  and time frames for AI applications.The countries of the second part of the  study at a glance: Canada: Canada has developed a comprehensive  strategy that involves all levels of economy, sci ence and industry in order to strategically posi tion the relevant players and support each other  across disciplines. The aim is to strengthen the  global presence and improve national prospects.  The country also strives to take on an interna tional leadership role in research and ethical prac tice. Canada’s early involvement in AI research  has made it possible for provincial, regional and  federal governments to provide targeted support  for educational and research institutions since the  1980s. The institutions are now well positioned,  especially in terms of research and development.  The government continues to play an important  role in the development of advanced technologies  by supporting communities with high-level strate gic investments and transfers. The state collabo rates closely with the private sector to improve  financing, access and commercial applications.  At the same time, the value of ethics is empha sized. By supporting academic and commercial  recruiting and loyalty tactics through three major  institutions, Canada aims to offer its economy a  sustainable future and an open approach for the  exchange of knowledge. Japan:  No government in any of the reviewed  countries links the future of their country as  closely to AI as Shinzō Abe in Japan. One of his  two top goals is the realization of Society 5.0 . In  this next stage of human evolution, the physi cal and cyber worlds merge. Numerous govern ment initiatives and an interministerial AI strategy  have already resulted from the implementation  work. The focus of research funding is on three  institutes that perform research on specific AI  applications for increased productivity, mobility,  medicine and safety. So far, the private sector has  been the main contributor to research spending.  Public university research is underfunded and  internationally isolated. The degree of permeabil ity and exchange between research and indus try is also rather low. In order to change this, the  cross-appointment system allows researchers and  developers from science and the private sector, 
8 Summary respectively to work part-time in the other area.  Universities also receive incentives to do more  research together with the private sector. Large  companies such as Toyota, NEC or Toshiba have  recognised that the future of machines lies in  their intelligence. They can scale it globally if they  catch up in software development and adopt the  concept of open innovation. So far, there are only  a few AI startups. With deregulation in sandboxes  and geographically defined Strategic Special Zones ,  AI policy is linked to the development of struc turally weak regions. The government wants to  achieve global integration by adapting data pro tection legislation to the EU GDPR, establishing  international standards for robotics and guide lines for ethical AI. Israel: In the last two decades, the “startup nation”  has created a dynamic high-tech sector with at  least 360 AI start-ups through incentives and sup port programmes. In a highly developed network  approach, national and international business and  science cooperate closely with the state. Virtually  all the major tech companies and corporations in  the world operate research centres in Israel. They  generate many jobs, but often transfer the added  value of intellectual property abroad. Through the  Technology Transfer Companies (TTC), the domestic  universities and research clinics have established  an effective instrument for the commercialisation  of research. Startups can rely on funding run ning into billions by the innovation authority and  Venture Capital , particularly for establishment and  development of marketable technology products.  The military considers AI to be “the key to survival  in the modern world” and acts as a driving force  of innovation through its selection and training  programmes: Israel – a knight of the cognitive era  Although there is still no independent AI  strategy,  yet, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees  great export potential for AI in the fields of cyber  security , digital medicine and mobility. However,  the transformative force of AI has so far been little  reflected in society of the country.United Arab Emirates: Small data pools, no  supercomputers, very low scientific performance,  and practically no AI patents. In contrast to that,  there is an urgent need to reduce dependence  on oil revenues and to diversify the economy, in  combination with the government’s high politi cal capacity to act. As part of a cabinet reshuffle  in October 2017, the government systematically  focused on the vision of making the UAE the “best  country in the world” by 2071. Technology, and  particularly AI and innovation, plays a central role  in this. These ambitions are reflected in the newly  established State Ministry for AI and in many  ambitious and concisely formulated technology  strategies. Their goal is clear: a leading position  for the UAE in the application of AI. For implemen tation, the country relies above all on the creative  power and demands of the authorities and on  partnerships with countries such as India. It is not  yet clear which concrete capacities are to be built  up and how they will fit into the global AI land scape. India:  India has a unique focus on the applica tion of AI to improve welfare and social problems  and seeks leadership in this area. Before this  can be achieved, however, India must overcome  a multitude of challenges. There is a particular  lack of institutional and coordinating capacities,  which the Indian AI Strategy of 2018 aims to rem edy with institutions at two levels: to promote  the basic AI research and to advance AI commer cialisation. Other obstacles include a low level of  data processing capabilities, a weak intellectual  property system and relatively low Internet pen etration. India’s approach will bear fruit only if  and when these factors show progress. However,  important findings on institution establishment  can be derived from the Indian AI strategy, such  as the strategically positioned two-stage institu tions at the level of basic AI research and AI com mercialisation policy. Both aim to build partner ships with relevant stakeholders to found and  expand networks and accelerate AI development.
9 Summary Singapore:  The country is seeking a co-operative  AI ecosystem between industry and science and  intends to provide an environment with appropri ate resources to foster innovative development.  In the absence of mineral resources and geopo litical relevance, the promotion of digitisation and  AI has become one of the government’s priori ties, with the aim of becoming known worldwide  as the AI hub. To this end, the five-year initiative  AI Singapore was developed in 2017. Within the  100Experiments scheme, companies can submit  problems for which there is no standardised AI  solution yet, but for which a solution could easily  be worked out. These companies and their prob lems are then placed with AI developers. Through  Fundamental Research , Singapore supports basic  research and addresses research gaps, with a  view to both technical and ethical societal issues.  Understanding and acceptance of AI among the  population is promoted by the AI for Everyone  scheme, which offers specific learning formats  on AI. The Accreditation@ SGD initiative supports  young companies in their early growth phases by  means of customised consulting services, par ticularly in the areas of technical applications. In  addition to its efforts to create an AI-friendly envi ronment among relevant players and in terms of  legislation, the government also intends to pro mote, through various initiatives, the responsible  use of data and the ethical use of AI solutions.

Introduction In November 2017, Canada’s Prime Minister Jus tin Trudeau stood on stage with Eric Schmidt,  CEO of Alphabet, discussing the importance of  AI as a driver of economic growth.5 Looking at  the text of the Canadian AI strategy paper, it is  striking that social sectors, such as healthcare  and social welfare are not explicitly mentioned –  unlike many other national AI-related strategies.  Rather, the declared objectives are: 1) to prevent  AI talent from migrating to the USA, 2) to create  favourable conditions for the commercialisation  and economic growth of the country. In order to achieve these goals, the various administrative  and governmental levels in the country have allo cated a total of approximately 430 million Euros6  provided by various schemes, either directly or  very closely linked to R&D in AI, talent delivery  and commercialisation. II.) Requirements for AI Canada has about 36 million inhabitants (about  one tenth of the United States), 32 million of  whom used the Internet in 2016.7 The source of  potential data for AI is correspondingly small. 
12 Canada IV.) Research and Development In Canada, total R&D spending in 2016 was at  around 22 billion Euro.13 Around 200 million Euro  have been allocated for AI research; 83 million  via the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy14 and 118 million  are forwarded to the universities of Montreal and  McGill through the Canada First Research Excel lence Fund .15 In addition the provincial govern ments of Quebec and Ontario recently allocated  a further 100 million Euro exclusively for R&D in  AI.16 According to the CSRanking, about 120 teach ers (about 1,060 in the USA) have been engaged  in research on AI in the country since 2016,17  which represents a similar relation relative to the  overall population as in the United States.18 These  teachers are estimated to supervise 370 doctoral  students per year.19 The AI-relevant scientific pro duction is 1,200 citable documents,20 which puts  Canada in eighth place among the twelve coun tries compared. Interestingly, however, Canada  ranks fourth in the H index, which measures the  influence of these publications (after the US, UK  and China),21 which emphasises the high quality  of Canadian AI publications. Research areas and instruments The most important instrument for AI R&D is the  Pan-Canadian AI Strategy managed by CIFAR (see  above), which coordinates research at the three  major AI hubs. These three centres, located in  Montreal, Toronto and Edmonton, are all associ -The public sector, on the other hand (also a rel evant data source for AI) makes its data freely  available in high quality (among the countries  compared, the availability and quality of public  sector data is better only in the UK).8 In relation  to Canada’s small population, about as many  Master’s students are trained in AI-related fields  as in the USA. This puts Canada ahead of Great  Britain and France and behind Singapore and  Israel. In absolute figures, however, it is esti mated that there are currently only 860 Master’s  students, which means that the country still lags  significantly behind the USA.9 In addition, Canada  only operates six of the world’s 500 best super computers.10 III.) Institutional framework Canada has a strong institutional framework to  implement AI R&D funds for a network of estab lished top research institutions. A central pil lar in this framework is the Canadian Institute For  Advancement and Research (CIFAR), founded in  1982, which currently runs twelve different R&D  programmes in 16 provinces, which in turn pro vide orientation for the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy,  and whigh governs the recently established Fed eral Fund with 83 million Euro. CIFAR is currently  forwarding the majority of this fund to the three  main AI R&D centres in Canada: the Montreal Insti tute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) in Montreal, the  Vector Institute in Toronto and the Alberta Machine  Intelligence Institute (AMII) in Edmonton. All three  centres are associated with universities that strictly  focus on AI R&D and not on commercialisation. Ethics – “top down” and “bottom up”:  The  discourse on AI ethics and the impact of AI  progress on society in Canada takes place at  several levels On the one side, CIFAR man ages an independent program (with its own  fund and team) called “AI & Society” . It is  focused on future national economic, ethi cal and legal policies which take into account  the concerns about the impact of AI on the  labour market or on the health sector.11 To this end, the AI & Society  team runs nation wide workshops, conducts surveys with  experts and cooperates with the UK and  France. In addition to this “top down” -Initia tive, the Montreal AI players have compiled  the Montreal Declaration for Responsible  AI, which aims to stimulate the discussion  between the public, the private sector and  the state.12 It proposes a framework and a  set of values, such as well-being, autonomy,  justice and privacy, which must be assessed  and observed in the development or imple mentation of AI technologies.
13 Canada ated to local universities and focus almost exclu sively on AI research and development. These  centres, each led by one of the three famous AI  researchers Dr. Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton  and Richard Sutton, are pioneers in the develop ment of Deep Learning , neural networks and rein forcement learning. It is worth noting that they  continued to operate during the last “AI hiberna tion” of the 1990s and 2000s, financed by a sister  AI programme also managed by CIFAR (“ Learn ings in Machines & Brains ”).22 Today, with renewed  interest in AI research, all three centres benefit  from the basic funding provided by the federal  programmes. The Vector Institute  hub  in Toronto  is currently the best funded. In addition to the  14 million Euro it received from CIFAR, a further  86 million Euro came from the provincial govern ment and the private sector, in particular Goog le.23 It’s not uncommon in Canada for private  investments to be made following public funds.  With the additional funding from the private sec tor and the provincial governments, all three  centres have expanded their basic research and  are now actively participating in the development  of the following key technologies: Deep learning,  neural networks, reinforcement learning, Pattern  Recognition, Computer Vision , unattended learn ing, Natural language processing , Deep Networks,  learning theory and optimisation of Deep learn ing, statistical theory and algorithmic gaming  theory. All in all, the centres directly or indirectly  support a large network of researchers, with  the MILA Montreal Centre taking the lead and  directly supporting 234 AI researchers.24 Canadian companies are also offered 15 to  35 percent tax benefit for basic and applied  research in the field of science and technology  through the Scientific Research and Expert Develop ment (SR&ED) program.25 In addition, the Global  Talent Stream program26 simplifies immigration  requirements for AI researchers, and other spe cialists and talents. According to Navdeep Bains,  Canada’s Minister of Innovation, Science and Eco nomic Development it only takes “two weeks” until  a work permit for these researchers is applied for  and issued.27 Other countries can learn from this  as the battle for AI talent intensifies.V.) Commercialisation Commercialisation of AI research is the weak  point of the country. While a study by Asgard and  Roland Berger in 2018 recorded 131 AI startups  (just under 1,400 in the USA),28 another mapping  of the Canadian startup scene revealed 650 AIfocused startups scattered across the country in  2018.29 In 2016, however, only 2.7 percent of all  global investments in AI startups were made in  Canada (USA 62 percent in the same period).30  Also, only a small proportion of relevant AI pat ents originate in the country (between 2015 and  2017, an average of 1.43 percent of all interna tionally enforceable AI patents worldwide).31 At the  level of automation of the economy, measured  by the number of robots per 10,000 employees in  the manufacturing industry, the country is ranked  in the back midfield (145 robots in comparison  to 631 in South Korea and 71 in Great Britain).32  Among the countries compared, the public sec tor exerts the least influence as a possible driver  of innovation through its demand33 and does not  play a role in the strategy as a possible user of AI,  either. Regulation: The Canadian federal govern ment sets the guidelines for provincial regula tion. Of the ten provinces, the following are the  most economically important: Ontario, Que bec, Alberta and British Columbia. The existing  rules and regulations are not sufficient to pro mote the use and application of AI, in particular  with regard to intellectual property, copyright  and ownership of both inputs (data) and out puts (decisions or actions of robots) and think ing machines that use AI).34 CIFAR, with its “ AI &  Society ”programme, is working hard tochange  this. They focus on cross-company and crossindustry collaboration, data privacy and ethics.  PIPEDA, the law on the protection of personal  data and electronic documents, which in many  respects is similar to the EU GDPR, regulates the  use of data (the input) as well as the actions in  case of data protection violations, as stipulated  by the latest amendment (November 2018).35 The  regulations also include how Canadian startups  and companies can use data in their AI models.
14The Canadian Securities Authority (CSA), the gov erning body of the Canadian capital market, has  established a special regulatory zone ( sandbox )  to explore new business models with innova tive products in the capital markets, such as the  use of AI for trading.36 Similar special zones are  also being developed by Transport Canada for the  development of self-propelled vehicles, after the  institution has specified “Guidelines for Testing of  Highly Automated Vehicles”.37 Health Canada also  promotes the research and testing of technologi cally advanced (and possibly AI-controlled) medi cal devices.38 Generally speaking, while Canada’s current regula tions remain insufficient and overall cautious with  regard to AI applications, they are not too strict to  discourage companies. On the contrary: Compa nies and startups are familiar with what is allowed  and what is not (e. g. through PIPEDA), they are  given the opportunity to participate in the discus sions on future regulations (e. g. through CIFAR  and the CSA Special Regulatory Zone) and have  a good understanding of which industries will be  better regulated next. Promotion of startups and companies: The Cana dian federal government is focusing its direct sup port of commercialisation of technology and inno vation on larger projects and companies. However,  smaller companies and startups, are not left alone  and well supported by private venture capital. The Strategic Innovation Fund of Canada (SIF), a  program designed to accelerate technology trans fer and the commercialisation of innovative prod ucts, is intended to provide grants for companies  and their projects, which will cover up to 50 per cent of the expenditure.39 This fund is also availa ble to foreign companies intending to do business  in Canada. With the 2018 budget, this fund was  replenished with 840 million Euro for a period of  five years.40 Although the SIF is more traditional  in its operation (i. e. ‘grant application’), it is quite  flexible and often changes its parameters. In Feb ruary 2018, for example, the fund announced that  it would adapt to the economic situation and gen eral access to capital by providing 6.7 million Euro  to support larger projects.At the beginning of 2018, the federal govern ment announced a new commercialisation instru ment, the “Supercluster” initiative, which will be  financed with around 635 million Euro over five  years.41 The Superclusters were created specifi cally to promote economic growth and to encour age the private sector to collaborate with educa tion and research institutions to create regional  innovation ecosystems comparable to Silicon  Valley. Three of these superclusters are specifi cally oriented towards applied research and the  use of AI technologies for commercialisation. The  Advanced Manufacturing Supercluster in Ontario  focuses on the next generation of manufacturing  and robotics.42 With 270 participants, the largest  “Digital Technology Supercluster ” in British Colum bia concentrates on the use of larger data records  and machine learning to improve service delivery  in the fields of natural resources, precision health  care and manufacturing.43 The “ AI-Powered Supply  Chains Supercluster (SCALE.AI) ”, headquartered in  Quebec, focuses on harmonising the sectors of  manufacturing, transport, IT and retail as well as  on developing intelligent supply chains using AI  and robotics.44Canada

16 that machines are increasingly taking over peo ple’s jobs is less cause for concern in Japan than  for hope. For the population is aging and shrink ing, especially in rural areas. Since immigration  is very limited for various reasons (less than two  percent of foreigners in 2016),47 AI is intended to  help compensate for a shrinking working popu lation. Consequently, the focus is on practical  fields of application which fundamental research  is intended to serve: 1) productivity, 2) health,  care and wellbeing, 3) mobility and 4) security.48  ›Interministerial AI strategy and numerous government initiatives for attainment of Society 5.0  ›Three research institutes researching specific AI application areas  ›Cross-appointment system and reforms for increased permeability between research   and industry  ›Adapted copyright law for text and data mining and adaptation to EU GDPR  ›Deregulation in special regulatory zones (sandboxes) and geographically defined   strategic special zones  ›But: Hardware focus of large corporations (IoT) and only a few AI startups I.) Introduction  “Abenomics”, Premier Shinzō Abe’s ambitious  economic programme, has two key objectives.  One is sustainable growth. The other is nothing  less than mankind’s evolutionary move towards  the “super-smart society 5.0.”45 “Society 5.0 is a  human-centred society that reconciles economic  progress with the solution of social problems  through a system that integrates cyberspace and  physical space to a very high degree.”46 The fact Japan  On the way to   “Society 5.0” with AI
17Japan  AI-supported robots are to be used primarily in  geriatric care,49 which is also based on a cultural  openness to non-human forms of intelligence.50  AI technology should be understood as a service  (AIaaS ) based on large amounts of data from the  Internet of Things (IoT), as the strategy presented  in March 2017 explains.51 For the 2018 financial year alone, the govern ment has planned total investments of around  580 million Euro in the AI sector, which repre sents an increase of 30 percent over the previous  year, but which the Japanese press still considers  to be too low.52 The globally operating Japanese corporations  are strong in the hardware sector, but lack soft ware innovations. They try to buy these abroad,  as there are hardly any AI startups operating in  the country at the moment. There is also a lack  of training for AI talents, but research is interna tionally isolated. If, however, AI research support  is successful, the country catches up in terms of  software development and the state regulation  measures become effective, Japan has the poten tial to become a world leader in AI in the areas of  industrial production, medicine and mobility. II.) Requirements for AI With around 118 million, Japan has comparatively  many Internet users (fourth place after China,  India and the USA),53 however, due to the continu ing negative demographic trend, the population  is ageing and shrinking. The country ranges more  in the midfield in terms of access to and qual ity of public data (sixth among the twelve coun tries surveyed).54 Of the 500 strongest computers  worldwide, 36 are in Japan (third place after China  and the USA). One of them (ABCI) currently ranks  fifth in the top 500.55 In the strategically important  semiconductor industry, four companies56 gener ated sales of around 30 billion Euro in 2017, which  represented around 17 percent of the sales of US  companies.57 The 2018 budget therefore foresees  investments for “R&D in AI chips of high efficiency  and speed through industry-government-science  cooperation” at an amount of 77 million Euro. In turn, investments of 17 million Euro are planned  for research into quantum computers and chips,  and around 15 million Euro for the establishment  of an “open platform for nanotechnology and  materials research”.58 The talent pool for AI is valued at 210 Master stu dents who graduate annually at computer science  institutes, and rather small compared to South  Korea.59 III.) Institutional framework Shinzō Abe and his party have a comfortable  majority in both houses of parliament with regard  to implementation of Society 5.0 . The strategies  of most ministries include references to AI, such  as the Integrated Innovation Strategy and the Japan  Revitalization Roadmap .60 The framework conditions for research and devel opment of innovations as well as the allocation of  budget and personnel are set by the “Council for  Science and Technology and Innovation” (CSTI).  The CSTI is chaired by the Prime Minister and the  individual sector ministries follow the guidelines  of the CSTI.61 Already in April 2016, the “Strate gic Council for AI Technology” was founded on  the instructions of Shinzō Abe, which presented  an AI strategy in March 2017. The Council con siders itself a “control tower”62 that coordinates  the efforts of various ministries. The coordinated  ministries are: 1) Ministry of Internal Affairs and  Communications, 2) Ministry of Education, Cul ture, Sport, Science and Technology, 3) Ministry  of Economy, Trade and Industry. Coordination  includes the research centres subordinated to the  ministries as well as the “Japan Science and Tech nology Agency” (JST) and the “New Energy and  Industrial Technology Development Organization”  (NEDO).63 The CSTI also includes representatives of  the Ministries of Health and Labour, Land, Infra structure, Transport and Tourism, as well as Agri culture and Fisheries, which have large amounts  of data at their disposal,64 as well as representa tives of universities and the industry association  Keidanren . The Ministry of Defence has so far only  played a minor role.
18Japan In addition to promoting R&D, the Council coordi nates with the industries that use AI (exit indus tries) and promotes the social fields of application  for AI within an industry coordination body. The  AI strategy also calls for an ambitious industrial  strategy ( Industrialization Roadmap ), which com bines the “wisdom of industry, science and gov ernment” to arrive at “consistent approaches” in  terms of research, commercialisation and social  implementation of AI.65   Numerous proposals and initiatives for  ethical AI with positive basic tenor: Already  in May 2016, the Advisory Council for AI and  Human Society was established on the initia tive of the CSTI. It consists of twelve members  from the fields of engineering, philosophy,  law, economics and social sciences. Its report  of March 2017 takes a critical look at ethical,  legal, social and economic considerations,  as well as the influence of AI on education  and research, but comes to the conclusion  that the positive aspects clearly predomi nate. New forms of interaction between man  and machine are an opportunity to rethink  the concept of humanity.66 The Council also  proposes that an Institutional Review Board  (IRB) on AI be established at all universities.67  International rules and standards for AI were  adopted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs  and Communications (MIC) in 2016 at the  G7 meeting of ICT ministers.68 In addition,  the Japan Society for Artificial Intelligence has  developed principles for ethical AI.69 The lack  of diversity (gender, age, origin, language)  within the research and development teams  in Japan could become a problem for devel opment of neutral (unbiased) algorithms.at the University of Tokyo as the only Japanese  university AI institute in the country.70 Since 2016,  30 faculty members have been actively research ing in AI areas at this institute71 and supervising  approximately 90 doctoral candidates in this field  every year. The three non-university AI research centres  AIST, RIKEN and NICT are “ integrated administra tive institutes ” subordinated to various ministries.  They employ numerous researchers, but do not  offer any training or educational courses. Moreo ver, there are more than 70 robotics laborato ries nationwide,72 some of which also deal with  AI applications.73 Elderly gentlemen dominate the  management of these research labs, which in  turn hardly cooperate with each other. Moreo ver, the higher education system is underfunded  and becomes less and less efficient.74 In 2017,  researchers in various fields have been able to  issue 2.800 citable AI publications (fourth place  among the twelve countries surveyed). However,  their overall influence was rather small (sixth  place out of twelve).75 Only publications on Com puter Vision and Pattern Recognition (fourth place  worldwide) and Human-Computer Interaction  (fifth place worldwide) had a noteworthy world wide influence.76 In order to implement Society 5.0, Prime Minister  Abe’s government intends to increase total R&D  spending to one percent of GDP,77 to fund three  research centres for concrete AI applications in  four areas of activity, train AI talents, increase per meability between business and science and over come the international isolation of the research  sector. Research areas and instruments In the centre of state funding of AI research are  three research centers,78 that work interdisci plinary and collaborate with each other. These  research centres are also planned to be used as  “research hubs” for “open innovation” created by  cooperation between industry, government and  science (by other universities).79 According to the  Industrialization Road Map , there are clear plan ning guidelines for roles, timelines and expected  results of these centers.80 They will focus on IV.) Research and Development In absolute figures, total R&D spending in 2016  amounted to around 140 billion Euro (third place  among the twelve countries surveyed). The pub lic sector contributed only around 22 percent of  this sum, the lowest of all the countries surveyed.  CSRankings rates the Computer Science Institute 
19Japan research in four strategic application fields (pro ductivity, mobility, health, safety). This involves  approaches that must be consistently pursued  from fundamental research through to social  implementation. On the other hand, there are  approaches for which a short-term monetarisa tion and thus a commitment of the private sec tor is not expected, or approaches in cooperative  areas, such as international standardisation and  common infrastructure technology.81 From 2020,  the results of the individual centres are to be com bined in cooperation with companies and minis tries to form “integrated systems”. The Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC) at  the AIST Institute considers itself a “central contact  point for the promotion of large-scale research”82  and has at its disposal 123 million Euro (2016),  the largest budget among the three centres men tioned above. This is expected to almost dou ble in 2019 to around 212 million Euro.83 On the  basis of Deep learning  and neural networks twelve  teams are performing research on the interaction  of AI and IoT, among others, as well as pattern  and image recognition (for medicine or security).  According to AIST information, the world’s largest  open AI computing infrastructure (ABCI) is avail able to AIST.84 AIST also maintains a joint AI labora tory with NEC and partnerships with foreign insti tutes such as the DFKI in Germany. The Center for AI Development (AIP) is part of the  RIKEN Institute for Physics and Chemistry gov erned by the Ministry of Education (MEXT). More  than 50 teams do research on fundamentals,  “goal-oriented technology research” and “AI in  society”.85 The AIP will have an important role to  play, especially in the development of AI-support ing “all-purpose infrastructure technology” for the  purpose of “revolutionising industrial production”,  for medical diagnostics and damage limitation in  the event of natural disasters.86 In 2016, around  56 million Euro were available for these areas.87  The AIP cooperates with NEC, Toshiba, Fujitsu and  Fujifilm through separate, respective AI centres.  Also under the authority of the Ministry of Educa tion (MEXT) is the Japan Science and Technology  Agency (JST), which in turn runs programmes for  the promotion of “strategic fundamental research” related to AI. A laboratory for interlinking of vari ous AI projects both of the research institutes and  the universities ( AIP Network Lab , PRISM )88 is a par ticularly noteworthy project in this context. The National Institute of Information and Commu nication Technology (NICT) reports to the Ministry  of the Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC)  and was endowed with around 17 million Euro  in 2016. On the one hand, research is being car ried out there on the development of “universal  communication technology”.89 On the other hand,  CiNet is also located there and engages in applica tions of nerosciences in computer science, inter faces between brain and machine, and robotics  for medical applications, which “helps us under stand how humans and robots can best coexist in  future.”90 Counteracting the lack of AI talents is one of the  most urgent challenges because by 2020 the METI  Ministry of Economics expects a shortfall of about  48,000 people in “leading IT human resources”.91  These are divided into three groups: those that  1) solve basic AI problems (especially in the fields  of information technology, robotics, Natural Lan guage Recognition , neurosciences), 2) translate AI  fundamentals (e. g. in algorithms, database archi tectures and programs), 3) are able to apply and  use AI practically in industries and services.92 The first two groups are to be expanded through  attractive salaries, favourable research condi tions and contents for domestic and foreign  researchers. Young AI researchers, in particular,  are intended to benefit from this and to access  funds, for example through JST programmes.93 The  third group needs AI further training and overall  improved training and education in mathematics  and IT subjects. The exact needs and strategies  for this are to be clarified in a discourse between  industry and science under the auspices of the  METI Ministry of Economics.94 To date, the degree of cooperation between uni versities and industry has been rather low (sixth  place among the twelve countries surveyed).95  An important instrument to improve this is the  cross appointment system,96 which allows research -
20ers from universities to also work part-time at  national research institutes or in the private sec tor. In return, researchers from the private sec tor are allowed to work part-time at universities.  New subsidy mechanisms are also intended to  benefit universities that implement “manage ment reforms” and seek funding from the private  sector. At the same time, companies are to be  encouraged to invest more in long-term research  projects at and in cooperation with universities97  and establish so-called Moonshot initiatives .98 Moreover, in 2016, the Ministry of Economics  (METI) stated that Japan was isolated from the  global flow of researchers and research funds.99  Therefore, the immigration requirements for  highly qualified foreigners and the underly ing points system were revised and updated in  2017.100 Now, researchers are permitted to take  on multiple employment, obtain permanent stay  permits much faster, initiate family reunion and  obtain work permits for their partners. In the  field of AI, research partnerships have also been  agreed, for example with Israel101 and Germany102 V.) Commercialisation In addition to cooperation with the aforemen tioned centres, many of the globally operating  corporations (Toshiba, NEC, Hitachi, Sony, Mit subishi Electrics, Fujitsu, Canon, etc.) conduct their  own application-oriented research programmes  on AI.103 According to government information, the  private sector invests around 4.5 billion Euro in  technology per year.104 On average, between 2015  and 2017, 5.17 percent of internationally enforce able patents came from Japan,105 which puts the  country in second place in the world. Despite this  ranking, the gap to the USA, who are at first place,  is still enormous, since around three quarters of  the mentionend AI patents in the same period  came from the USA. Although Japanese companies continue to be  leading in the production and export of robots,  this position is threatened because manufacturers  have invested too little in software development.106  The concept of open innovation has not yet been sufficiently adopted by the corporations.107 At the  same time, only few impulses are generated by  the domestic innovation ecosystem. Asgard and  Roland Berger only count 113 AI startups (USA:  1,393, China: 383),108 of which CB Insights consid ers at least two to be among the most influential  AI startups in the world, i. e. “Preferred Networks”  and “LeapMind”.109 Similar to South Korean con glomerates, Japanese corporations buy innovation  abroad, such as Toyota in Silicon Valley. The Abe government supports AI commercialisa tion alongside its commitment to global indus try standards for industrial robots under the New  Robot Strategy ,110 through adjustments in copy right law, an EU-compatible data protection law,  accelerated or suspended approval procedures,  startup support and tax relief for modern IT pro curement. Regulation:  From January 2019111 an already  resolved extension of copyright law will apply,  which through three new articles permits the  use and further processing (text and data min ing) of protected contents by commercial and  non-commercial AIs even without the consent of  the authors ( fair-use principle).112 Access to large  amounts of data is important to improve the selflearning capabilities of machines. A similar regula tion is currently initiated in Singapore and Can ada. The legal framework is also to be extended  for copyright of products created by AI (e. g. texts,  music).113 In May 2017, the Act on the Protection of Personal  Information was also revised in order to promote  the collection and sharing of data while at the  same time decoupling them from personal data  and processing them anonymously. The revised  version has many similarities with the EU GDPR.  Against this background, the EU has put Japan  on a “white list” of countries with data protection  standards comparable to the high standards of  the EU.114 This promotes global integration of the  country, as Japan, unlike China, allows its AI prod ucts to be exported to the EU. A law adopted in June 2018 allows companies to  develop innovative pilot projects within previously Japan
21approved and clearly defined boundaries (sand boxes ). Within these deregulated test environ ments, companies can try out new technologies  and business models and generate data. If the  pilots are successful, the government can extend  the same (de-)regulation to the entire country.  For this purpose, an office was specifically estab lished to coordinate the application process.115 The  establishment of geographically defined National  Strategic Special Zones is aiming in a similar direc tion.116 At ten locations in the country tax relief  is granted for new companies settling there and  regulations are relaxed or repealed – for exam ple in the field of mobility or medical research –  in order to strengthen regions outside Tokyo and  develop interesting “test cases” for the country.  In 2016, for example, the city of Senbocu created  such a test case for driverless buses.117 In terms of  regulation of autonomous driving (up to level 4),  a strategy already worked out in 2016 is currently  being specified118 and the world’s first functional  system of driverless taxis will probably be operat ing in Tokyo by the 2020 Olympic Games.119 In order to make the country the central “hub” for  regenerative medicine, allocation of National Stra tegic Special Zones as well as the approval proce dures for medications and medical devices have  been revised. As a result, Japan has the fastest  approval procedures in the world.120 Support of startups and companies:  The low  number of AI startups is due to the generally  small startup scene. Traditionally, society has  a rather high risk aversity, is self-regarding and  many of the existing skilled workers are absorbed  by the large technology groups.121 This in combina tion with a restrictive immigration policy makes  it difficult for startups that were founded despite  these unfavourable conditions to find good staff.  To make matters worse, startups have virtually  no private startup capital and an exit by purchase  is the exception (rule: IPO).122 However, due to  the number of founders returning from abroad  and the increase in corporate venture capital123  the number of startups is rising, nevertheless.  In order to promote this trend further, the gov ernment is paying into the “500 Startups” fund.  Furthermore, in 2018, the Ministry of Economics approved a new incubator programme that was  launched to found a total of 20 companies with a  market value of more than one billion US dollars  (unicorn companies ) by 2023. In addition, since May 2018, the government has  reduced property tax rates for small and mediumsized companies investing in “ ICT, robotics and  cloud tools” .124 Apart from that, companies of all  sizes are going to receive tax relief if they procure  “advanced IT.”125 The state as user:  In terms of procurement of  advanced technology, the public sector is in the  midfield compared to other countries (together  with Finland, it ranks eighth among the twelve  countries surveyed).126 Nonetheless, the coun try strives for becoming the most advanced IT  nation in the world, based on the Basic Act for the  Advancement of Public and Private Sector Data Uti lization . In accordance with the aforementioned  law, the entire administration is to be digitised  and public and private data made available for  use to the private sector. The concept of “Society  5.0”, in which AI will permeate all areas of life, is  superior to the law, so that this concept will cer tainly bring along further demand from the state.  The results in the “Security” research field serve  the disaster control authorities in forecasting, lim iting damage and initiating rapid reconstruction.127  There are further AI projects carried out by the  military (AI-based archive management as a pilot  project for the entire administration)128 and the  police (image recognition, detection of financial  fraud).129Japan

23  ›Doubling of research expenditure by foreign corporations  ›Military as a talent factory and innovation driver  ›Commercialisation of research by Technical Transfer Companies  ›Support programmes and incentives for startups and multinational corporations  ›But: scaling and added value from AI application research is generated abroad   (especially in the USA) I.) Introduction  In Israel, the highest density of researchers and  the highest share of research expenditure in the  gross domestic product (GDP) in the world meet  an innovation ecosystem (“Silicon Wadi”) in which  science, business and government (military)  closely cooperate. With only about eight mil lion inhabitants, there are now more than 360 AI  startups, which, after the USA, have at their dis posal the second highest density of venture capi tal worldwide. For all these developments, there  has been no need for an AI strategy so far, yet  such a strategy is now apparently in progress.130 Like the US and China, Israel can be viewed as  a “knight of the c ognitive era”, since “defensebased innovations that radiate into academic  and private fields and enable a range of commer cial applications”.131 In the absence of domestic  Internet giants, research institutions and start ups are adopting a network approach with a  highly international orientation, but a focus on  the USA, above all. Globally operating tech com panies, such as IBM, Google, SAP and Samsung,  are present with research centers and account  for a large proportion of research spending. At  the same time they take over local start-ups. This  promotes innovation but at the same time it also Israel  Startup Nation and Knight   of the Cognitive Age
24Israel means that scaling and added value of applica tions and developments is generated mostly  by multinational companies and hardly by local  companies. II.) Requirements for AI The country has comparatively few Internet users  (around 6.8 million, only Finland and Singapore  have fewer).132 In terms of access to and quality of  public data, Israel only ranked 28th in the world  in 2016 and is roughly on a par with India in the  countries surveyed.133 So far, none of the commercially available Top 500  supercomputers are in operation in Israel,134 which  could prove to be a strategic disadvantage in the  further development of AI in the country and in  comparison with other major AI players, as a sen ior NVIDIA employee warns.135 At the computer  science institutes in which AI research has been  actively performed since 2016, about 560 Master’s  students graduate annually. This is a compara tively large pool of talent (ranked fourth after the  USA, China and Great Britain) and impressive con sidering Israel’s small population.136 III.) Institutional framework Although Prime Minister Netanyahu speaks on  AI in public and envisages economic opportuni ties in the fields of medicine, cyber security and  mobility,137 his office refers to the Israel Innova tion Authority (IIA) as the competent authority  (November 2017).138 So far there are no signs of a  coherent interdepartmental AI policy, which might  change with the development of an AI strategy. As successor to the Office of the Chief Scientist ,  which had existed since 1969, the Israel Innova tion Authority (IIA ), which reports to the Ministry  of Economics and Industry, was established in  2016139 and was granted funds of around 380 mil lion Euro.140 It is expected create and strengthen  the necessary infrastructure and the required  framework conditions to support innovation and  technology development. Moreover, the authority monitors all state-funded industrial R&D. In addi tion to the IIA, the Ministry of Science, Technology  and Space, the Planning and Budget Committee  of the Council on Higher Education and the Ministry  of Finance are involved in the formulation and/or  implementation of guidelines for innovation and  technology industries. The Prime Minister’s office  manages the relevant sector ministries for auton omous driving and digital health programmes141  and the Ministry of Defense develops and pro cures AI technology for the military. There is also a  digitisation strategy in place, referred to as Digital  National Initiative that the Ministry of Social Equal ity presented, but which is not mentioned in AI. IV.) Research and Development The country has the highest density of research ers (8,250/one million inhabitants)142 and the  highest research expenditure in relation to its  GDP among all the countries surveyed (currently  more than four percent).143 Total expenditure on  research and development has more than dou bled in the last ten years.144 In absolute figures,  however, they amounted to only around 12 bil lion Euro in 2016 (eighth place among the twelve  countries surveyed), with the share of the public  sector in these expenditures declining.145 More  than 65 percent146 of research spending origi nated from foreign private donors in the form of  research centres, mainly US companies such as  Intel, Google or Qualcomm. Roland Berger esti mates for 2016 that “almost every major IT com pany in the world” will operate research centres  in the country, including Deutsche Telekom and  SAP.147 The total number of research centres is  estimated at about 300.148 This is a blessing in dis guise, as it promotes research in the country and  creates jobs in R&D, on the one hand, but at the  same time absorbs many AI talents whose devel opments are primarily scaled and translated into  value by US companies.149 Research areas and instruments In the absence of an AI strategy, there is no  dedicated AI research funding, either. Due to the  dominance of foreign research institutes, the  commercial application research predominates. 
25Israel At public universities, research is carried out into  AI fundamentals and applications, which the state  only supports with investments in framework  conditions. A single governmental (Israeli-French)  science program supports research on the appli cation of AI for “digital agriculture” on a small  scale.150 Although research on AI has been going on since  the 1980s and Israeli researchers have already  won the prestigious Turing Award,151 five times  (of 62), they produced a total of only 225 citable  AI publications, whose worldwide influence also  remained rather small (H index 132, ranking them  seventh among the twelve countries surveyed).152  This is due on the one hand to the fact that the  number of scientific publications is generally  decreasing, and on the other hand to the fact  that many computer science publications are  only presented at conferences and are therefore  not effective for the H-Index.153 At the same time,  the research universities are very focused on the  application and commercialisation of their results.  CSRankings currently identifies six information  technology institutes,154 in which about 80 faculty  members have been actively researching AI since  2016. It is estimated that they supervise 240 doc toral candidates per year. The Israeli Association  for Artificial Intelligence , on the other hand, lists  eleven public AI institutes as well as a number of  industrial researchers, AI laboratories and compa nies in an overview.155 What they have in common  is good international networking with universities  and companies doing research in AI.156 The Hebrew University stands out from this  research landscape, researching at various insti tutes with a total of around 40 doctoral stu dents and thus having the largest number of AI  researchers.157 Interdisciplinary centres conduct  research there on algorithm designs and together  with Intel and the Technion University on Machine  learning and new computer architectures. The Fac ulty of Computer Science also conducts research  in the following fields of application Cyber secu rity158 and cooperates with the Fraunhofer Insti tute, among others. The second largest number  of AI researchers (about 30 doctoral candidates159  and at least 15 professors) work on AI at faculties of the Technion University;160 the Faculty of Com puter Science is active among other things, in  basic research on Deep Learning (theory of neural  networks).161 In October 2018, an AI centre was  also opened together with Intel, which intends to  do research on Natural Language Processing , Deep  Learning and hardware optimisation for learning  algorithms.162 A total of about 22 doctoral stu dents163 research at the Tel Aviv University  including  on Machine learning (in cooperation with Yandex)  and Optical Signal Processing and image recogni tion. For the “Smart Cities” application field, coop eration with Stanford University is maintained. Within the multiannual funding framework of  the Council for Higher Education (2017 and 2021),  around 480 million Euro will be used to support  the development of a “national research infra structure” in which the areas of IT and big data  infrastructure  are just as important as the train ing of specialist personnel in various fields. These  areas include life sciences (personalised medi cine), quantum physics, chemistry (materials),  social sciences and humanities. Around 170 mil lion Euro will also be used to support research  and the number of students and faculty members  in precisely those areas that “the market needs”,  i. e. electronics and software engineering, infor mation technology and IT.164 V.) Commercialisation Since the 1990s, Israel has developed into a hightech and innovation location and has become the  brand of the “Startup Nation”. Asgard and Roland  Berger have counted an impressive number of  362 AI startups (third place among the twelve  countries surveyed), of which CB Insights consid ers four (OrCam Technologies, Workey, Twiggle  and Prospera) to be among the 100 most influ ential startups worldwide. The Israel’s State of AI  report counts 950 startups that use or develop AI  and estimates that by 2018 they will have cumula tively raised around 3.8 billion Euro through Market Exits .165 CB Insights assumes that four percent  of all private equity deals concluded worldwide in  2016 took place in the field of AI in Israel (third  place after the USA and Great Britain).166
26In addition to the investment activities of ven ture capital funds and the establishment of R&D  centres in Israel by foreign groups on the basis of  incentives and tax relief, the current good position  in AI commercialisation is primarily attributable  to the following further points: 1) Influs of scien tific and technical talents from the former Soviet  Union, 2) successful technology transfer from sci ence and the military to the private sector. In the  global AI race, however, the country is coming  under increasing pressure, to which the govern ment is responding with new initiatives. The lack of well-trained personnel “is the main  obstacle to Israel’s growth and competitiveness,”  states the IIA, estimating the shortage of engi neers and programmers for the next decade at  up to 10,000.167 In the past, the the innovation and  technology sectors mainly benefited from aca demics and state industry workers moving into  the private sector, and the arrival of tens of thou sands of Jewish engineers from the former Soviet  Union. Both sources of young talent have dried  up in the meantime.168 In addition, the share of  science graduates in the total number of gradu ates fell from 13 percent in 2004 to 8.7 percent in  2014.169 Enforced by the increasing global com petition, all this has led to a shortage of AI talent  whose supply in Israel can hardly keep up with  demand in the country.170 On the one hand, the  country’s scientific institutions are responding  to this by expanding the range of courses they  offer in AI.171 On the other hand, the Center for  Absorption in Science under the Ministry of Return  and Immigration (Alija ) continues its incentive  and support programmes for support of Jewish  “returning” specialists and scientists from all over  the world as well as companies that integrate  them. Besides, the Innovation Authority intends  to promote extracurricular training programmes  relevant to the high-tech industry (“ Coding  Bootcamps ”).172of innovation and technology since the  1970s. A highly effective system has evolved  to identify top talent and involve them in  sophisticated high-tech training programmes  equipped with the most advanced technology  platforms and extensive resources (especially  data).173 The research and development car ried out there serves as a de facto training  center and incubator for AI talents.174 When  reserve forces are deployed, others return  with extensive AI or digital experience and  act as mentors: a reinforcement system for  knowledge transfer in both directions. Many  of the country’s leading high-tech startups  were therefore founded by partners who had  met during their time in the army.175 However,  the number of recruits is currently falling for  demographic reasons. Technology transfer from universities to the  private sector:  Together with the USA, Israel is  the world leader in cooperation between indus try and universities.176  An important reason for  this are commercialisation companies ( technology  transfer companies  – TTC), which were founded as  subsidiaries of universities, colleges or hospitals.  The role of these companies is to seek, develop  and market the know-how accumulated in their  institutions, to transform a patent into a com mercial product and to help set up startups.177  For example, the well-known AI startup Mobileye,  which was taken over by Intel for around 13 bil lion euros, was a spin-off of the TTC of Technion  University. The technology transfer process follows some  basic principles: (a) Researchers are obliged to  report an invention to the TTC of their univer sity. If the TTC gives a positive assessment of the  invention’s commercial potential, it can apply for  a patent and develop a marketing strategy for the  invention in order to identify potential trading  partners (or licensees) who might be interested  in the invention. It negotiates licence agreements  with them under which commercial partners can  further develop, exploit or market the inven tion. The revenues from royalties payments and/ or royalties from licensees are shared between Israel The military as innovation driver In spite  of all the above, the most important talent  factory for the high-tech industry is prob ably the military, which every citizen must  join and which has been an important driver 
27the inventors and the research univer sity.178  Among the renowned university TTCs are the  Yeda Research and Development Company Limited  ofthe Weizmann Institute of Science and the Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew  University of Jerusalem . This model puts Israel in  fourth place (among the twelve countries sur veyed) in terms of the number of AI patents regis tered in the country and internationally enforce able. However, UNESCO estimates that since 2002  almost 80 percent of all applications to the Israeli  Patent Office have been filed by foreigners, in par ticular through the research centres of US com panies. Intellectual property therefore primarily  migrates abroad.179 Promotion of startups and companies:  The Inno vation Authority is the largest public investor in AI  startups with its programmes for innovative tech nology concepts (see text box).180 The IIA can act  largely independently and operates flexible instru ments (loan programmes, guarantees, funds and  financial instruments).taken over if the company invests in the country’s  periphery. The number of foreign research cen tres is also to be further increased, particularly in  the fields of biotechnology and medicine.183 Private  investors, who are invest in R&D startups can also  deduct investments of up to 1.2 million Euro per  startup as current expenses from the tax, thanks  to the so-called Angels Law.184 With regard to autonomous driving, the Ministry  of Transport and the Prime Minister’s Office jointly  launched a five-year programme in early 2017 for  which some 60 million Euro will be made avail able. The aim is to further develop Israeli industry  in this field. Transport technology companies can  receive financial support under the programme  of up to 50 per cent of their approved R&D costs.  75 percent of the funds will be allocated to a  programme which could have an exceptional  impact on the rationalisation and improvement  of transport. The supported company pays back  the money received from the innovation authority  through royalties on the sale, but only if it reaches  the commercial phase. So far there is no regula tion on autonomous driving in the country, but  some test tracks for autonomous d riving on mil itary premises and abandoned roads have been  authorised.185 Some 240 million Euros will be invested in the  digitisation of all patient files, in a database open  to companies and researchers (with SAP SE) and  in support for researchers and startups, with the  aim of developing preventive and personalised  medicine. The government sees this as an impor tant growth engine.186 Regulation of the high-tech sector : So far, it has  been more the environment in which commercial  AI products can be created that has been regu lated. In order to remain attractive for high-tech  companies, at the end of 2016, the corporate  income tax for these companies was reduced  from 25 percent to six to twelve percent, depend ing on the type of company. This change also  introduces additional tax benefits for dividends  and investment income. In August 2017, a law  was also passed on the completion of high-tech  mergers and acquisitions, aimed at facilitating Support instruments of the IIA   „Startup Division“ 181 Tnufa Incentive: Support for the development  of “innovative” technology concepts (up to  85 percent of the costs, maximum around  50,000 Euro over two years) Incubator Incentive: Up to 85 percent (maxi mum around 800,000 Euro) of the costs for  research and development of “innovative  technology concepts” by IIA as an incentive  also for private incubators to provide the  remaining 15 percent plus premises, legal  assistance and partner inventions.Israel IIA’s Growth Division also subsidises the research  spending of larger domestic and foreign com panies by 20 to 50 percent for cases where new  products are developed or existing technologies  are upgraded. Long-term R&D projects of local  large companies (more than 86 million Euro turn over and more than 200 employees in R&D) can  be funded by half.182 A further ten percent will be 
28 “necessary structural adjustments”.187 A scheme  that reduces capital gains tax for domestic compa nies by four to six percentage points when “new  intellectual property is generated, or acquired  from a foreign company”188 can be understood as  an instrument for keeping intellectual property in  the country. The state as user:  In addition to its role in the  training of talent and knowledge transfer, the  military itself is an active developer and user  of AI, which the military considers to be a “key  to survival in the modern world.”189 Thus, the  Israeli Armed Forces (IDF) use AI in autonomous  drones190 and the new version of the standard  Merkava IV tank. In the area of cyber security , the  military carries out its own developments, but also  buys from domestic startups, which in turn func tions as a pull factor for startups.191 Through the  digital medicine program Big data and AI based on  that can also be used in public hospitals.192Ethics – the discussion is still in its infancy:  Although Jewish intellectuals have a critical  attitude towards AI (e. g. Prof. Yuval Noah  Harari),193 this has not yet translated into  institutions or guidelines on ethical AI. After  a scandal over the collection of patient data  for an AI application, the Knesset has been  dealing with data protection regulation in  the health sector since the end of 2017. Uri  Maklev, chairman of the Science and Technol ogy Committee of the Knesset, said he would  further the efforts: “We see the latest tech nological developments and are enthusias tic advocates of the further development of  AI. The use of the technology is a question of  human life, and concerns can be dealt with  by appropriate regulations and laws.”194 An  IEEE report of 2017, however, sees a number  of institutions that could deal with ethical AI,  and names the Initiative AI Ethics Open Source,  which is intended to serve as an umbrella  for a discussion on this topic in Israel and to  develop guidelines.195Israel

30 world” by 2071.197 According to Sheikh Maktoum,  Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE, this  means enabling future generations to “live hap pier and better lives, in a better environment, with  greater opportunities and greater communication  with the world”.198 AI plays a central role in this. It  is “the new wave” on which, according to Sheikh  Maktoum, all “services, sectors and future infra structures will rely”.199 The UAE is the first country  in the Middle East to publish an AI strategy and  the first country in the world to appoint a Minister  of State for AI. In addition to using AI to achieve  the Vision 2071 scheme and improving govern - ›AI and technology as pioneers for a diversified economy  ›The first approach of an AI strategy in the region, the first AI Ministry of State worldwide  ›Focus on AI applications through public sector demand and strategic focus on the   healthcare sector  ›Cooperation with India to develop the mutual potential of both markets for AI  ›Ethical issues do not play a role in the government’s public deliberations I.) Introduction  The United Arab Emirates (UAE), which owe the oil  and high finance sector their rapid rise to the inter national stage, have learned their lessons from the  growth and crisis cycles of a globally networked  economy.196 Against this background, the coun try must diversify its economy and compete with  technologically advanced neighbors such as Qatar  and Iran. In October 2017, the UAE published the  rough structure of an AI strategy as one of the  major initiatives of the UAE Centennial Plan with  the goal to make theUAE “the best country in the United Arab Emirates  On the way to the user country   with central support of the public sector
31United Arab Emirates ment performance the strategy is to position UAE  as a leader in AI investments in a variety of sectors  and to generate a new market for AI. However, the  methods to achieve all these objectives have not  been specified. Nevertheless, Accenture estimates  an annual gross value added potential of 160 bil lion Euro by 2035 for the UAE.200 As part of the AI  strategy, the government will invest in nine sec tors: transport, health, space, renewable energy,  water, technology, education, environment and  transport. The strategy is embedded in a num ber of other relevant national plans and strategies  designed to pave the way for the UAE to become a  knowledge-based economy.201 II.) Requirements for AI The AI ambitions of the government are at odds  with the country’s hitherto unfavorable condi tions in terms of the size of existing data pools,  the computing power available within the country,  and the size of the talent pool. The low popula tion of the UAE is also reflected by a relatively  low number of Internet users (2016: 8.4 million),  which is lower only in Israel (6.8 million), Finland  (4.8 million) and Singapore (4.5 million) among  the countries surveyed.202 Measured by the Open  Data Barometer 2016, the UAE also have catch ing up to do in terms of access to and quality of  public data (only ahead of China among the com pared countries).203 Furthermore, not one of the  top 500 supercomputers is currently operated  in the UAE.204 Although the country has a focus  on building a knowledge-based economy, there  were fewer enrolled students in tertiary educa tion across the country than in the smaller Singa pore.205 According to CSRankings, there is also only  one institute in the UAE that has been actively  researching AI areas since 2016. The AI talent pool  is correspondingly small. That this could change  in the near future is shown, among other things,  by the launch of the country’s first AI bachelor’s  programme at the British University Dubai in  2018.206 In addition, the country has hosted its first  AI summer camps in cooperation with companies  such as IBM and SAP207 and launched the One Mil lion Arab Coders initiative,208 to increase the pool of  qualified professionals.III.) Institutional framework The federal constitutional hereditary monarchy  consists of seven emirates whose executive is  the Cabinet. In October 2017, the cabinet was  reshaped in the course of the largest “structural  change” in the country’s history and oriented  towards achieving the goals of the Centennial  2071 Plan .209 As part of this reform, new minis tries were introduced and structural changes  were made to existing ministries. This also  implied the establishment of of the world’s first  ministry of state for AI, which Omar Al Olama  has taken over.210 This restructuring also explains  the early stage at which many of the govern ment’s relevant strategies still are. As part of the  national AI strategy, a ten-member AI council,  also headed by Omar Al Olama, was established  in March 2018 to monitor the integration of AIs  in the government and education sector.211 The  newly established government apparatus reflects  the country’s ambitions and promises to increase  its capacity to act in order to shape technological  change in the country. IV.) Research and Development In none of the countries surveyed did abso lute R&D spending in 2016 turn out to be lower  than in the UAE (3.1 billion Euro, or around  one percent of GDP). Of the R&D expenditures,  60 percent were financed by the private sec tor. This value is roughly comparable to France  (55 percent).212 In 2017 only 108 citable docu ments on AI were published (last place among  the twelve countries examined)213 and their influ ence remained very limited – while the UAE had  a value of 29 in the H index, the USA achieved  a value of 437.214 The reason for this may be the  fact that since 2016 only one university institute  has actively researched AI.215 The current weak ness of research stands in contrast to the coun try’s ambitions, which Sheikh Maktoum describes  as follows: “We believe that science, technology  and innovation are the roadmap for building  future generations.”216
32United Arab Emirates Research areas and instruments R&D is not mentioned in the very concise UAE AI  strategy so far. Nevertheless, there are various  indications that the country is planning to use sci ence to advance AI in the health sector. The scientific priority areas of the new research  funding strategy 2031217 aim, among other things,  to ensure that all the country’s strategic natural  resources are made available through national  capacity building, promotion of the sustaina ble energy sector, improvement of water safety  and development of an advanced scientific food  security system. The health challenges in the  UAE are to be mastered by a national science   system – however, without describing it in detail.  In addition, efforts are being made to develop an  advanced industry, to build a system of logisti cal support based on scientific studies and data,  and to create a complex of strategic industries.218  Although the research strategy does not specify  AI in particular, an institution was founded in the  form of the Inception Institutes for Artificial Intel ligence (IIAI), which intends to be active in basic  and applied research in AI areas. In the area of  fundamental research, the research areas cur rently planned are the following: Deep Learning,  Reinforcement Learning, Computer Vision and Natu ral Language Processing . In application-oriented  research, the healthcare sector again is given pri ority, particularly with the fields of Video Under standing and Medical Imaging .219 In order to meet the Institute’s claim to global  leadership, the IIAI aims to establish state-of-theart research conditions. This includes: 1) freedom  in in academic research, without the pressure of  scholarships and teaching, 2) access to data, 3) an  advanced computing centre, 4) “extremely com petitive” incentives for researchers.220 V.) Commercialisation The economic environment is characterised by  a centralised government and a much stronger  emphasis on security, protection and stability  than on the privacy and freedom of the individ ual. There are neither AI startups nor significant internationally enforceable AI patents.221 Robotics  and AI are recognised as important trends in the  important economic sectors of the country, as the  example of the Jebel Ali harbour in Dubai shows.222  However, the country does not appear in interna tional comparative statistics on the use or manu facture of robots. However, the weak starting  position is countered by the ambition to become  a leading AI user country. According to a survey by  Accenture, half of UAE executives plan to invest in  the field of AI next year, putting it second only to  the Internet of Things (58 percent).223 The biggest  impacts of AI are expected in the financial ser vices, healthcare, transportation and warehous ing industries.224 In order to tap the potential of  technology for politics, the economy and society,  the national government as well as the individual  emirates have launched various strategy papers  in recent months. It will have to show whether  the goals set are realistic and whether the gov ernment has identified the right instruments for  implementation, most of which are still lacking.  However, it is emerging that AI is understood as  part of a holistic plan of economic development.225 Regulations and political objectives:  Since the  concept was introduced in 1985, more than  30 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) have been  established in the UAE.226 Founded in 1999, Dubai  Internet City, one of these SEZs, is now home to  technology companies such as Microsoft, Dell and  IBM and is the largest information and commu nications technology hub in the Middle East and  North Africa.227 It can therefore be assumed that  SEZs will also play a central role in the economic  exploration of AI in the UAE. The instruments with  which AI commercialisation is to be achieved in  the application areas mentioned remain vague.  The multitude of different strategies gives an ini tial picture of a complex system of objectives with  which the government will align future regula tions. The strategy to promote the fourth indus trial revolution pursues the goal of “strengthening  the UAE’s position as a global hub for the Fourth  Industrial Revolution and increasing its contribu tion to the economy through the promotion of  innovation and future technologies.” In addition  to initiatives at the national level, the local govern ments of the seven Emirates have also established 
33United Arab Emirates various policies. In particular, the Emirate of Dubai  has developed strategic objectives that are not  only sector-specific but also technology-specific.  These include autonomous traffic systems, 3D  printing and data. The Dubai Autonomous Trans portation Strategy aims to automate 25 percent  of transport by 2030 and to achieve an annual  economic return of 4.25 billion Euro through  increased transport efficiency.228 The most impor tant goal in the 3D printing strategy is to “ensure  that 25 percent of Dubai’s buildings are based  on 3D printing technology by 2030.”229 The data  strategy of Dubai’s government pursues the aim  of developing and implementing a culture of data  exchange and evidence-based decision-making in  Dubai.230 This is particularly targeted at high qual ity data. In the field of cyber security, a separate  strategy pursues five strands of action: 1) increase  of public awareness, 2) cyber innovation, 3) cyber  security, 4) cyber resilience, 5) national and inter national cooperation.231 Direct support for companies and startups:  The  only element explicitly promoting an ecosystem is  the Centennial 2071 Plan referred to as AREA 2071.  It is understood as a “room and ecosystem that  is geared towards connecting companies, gov ernments, startups, investors, young people and  the public with one another in order to shape the  future together”232 The planning and partial imple mentation of this began already in 2017. With out more comprehensive measures to support a  startup ecosystem, the innovative strength and  thus productivity of the country’s economy will  remain limited or dependent on the purchase of  innovative technologies from abroad. In this way,  the country risks not living up to its ambition of  becoming a leading user country. The state as user:  More than in any of the other  countries examined, innovation and the use of  new technologies are driven by demand from the  government apparatus and public procurement.  This is also underlined by the results of an opin ion poll conducted by the World Economic Forum,  according to which the country’s government is  a global leader in the procurement of advanced  technologies and uses this as a targeted stimu lus for innovation.233 This is impressively reflected, among other things, in the plan to have the immi gration officials at airports replaced by artificial  intelligence by 2020.234 The central role of the state as a user of AI is  made clear by the cornerstones of the AI strategy  as well as in the strategy to promote the “Fourth  Industrial Revolution” or the Blockchain Plan ,  which in turn provides for “50 percent of state  transactions to be converted into a blockchain  platform  by 2021.”235 The third of the six pillars  of the strategy to promote the Fourth Industrial  Revolution lists intelligent government services  and smart cities. These are used as a basis for  the satisfaction and wellbeing of citizens as well  as ecological sustainability and improvement of  the human lifestyle.236 VAE’s track record in this  field is mixed. Masdar City, once a model of an  ecological and smart city, is still more a con struction site than reality after ten years.237 At the  same time, according to McKinsey, Abu Dhabi  and Dhabi are considered leaders in the region  in terms of the strength of the Smart City tech nology base.238 The eGateways of the Emirate of  Abu Dhabi (www.abudhabi.ae) already offer over  1,250 government services in 18 different areas,  such as transport and real estate. In Dubai,  the Smart Dubai Plan includes WiFi hotspots as  well as networked technology for controlling  water consumption and traffic. To develop new  technol ogies for the public sector, the Emirate  of Dubai has also launched an initiative called  Dubai 10X in which 24 government agencies have  already participated.239 Dubai 10X: 240 While the number 10 stands for Dubai’s  claim to be ten years ahead of other world  cities, the X stands for “Thinking Out of the  Box” . The Dubai Future Foundation initiative  provides for the creation of “X units” in each  agency, equipped with sufficient resources  and staff, with the aim of promoting disrup tive innovation and developing so-called  Moonshoot  solutions for the achievement of  their goals. The other two components of  Dubai 10X are for public authorities to scale  radical technologies and partner with busi -
34United Arab Emirates The GovTech Award also underscores the efforts to  integrate innovation and technology into govern ment structures worldwide.241 The annual prize,  has been awarded for the fifth time as part of  the World Government Summit an event in Dubai  chaired by the Emir of Dubai. Each year, the sum mit develops the next generation of governance  systems, focusing on innovation and technology  for the public sector.242nesses and startups. Regulatory obstacles  that disruptive companies encounter in such  partnerships are to be removed.Despite political support, commercialisation of AI  is limited by the small size of the internal mar ket. It is against this background that the signing  of an agreement between the UAE and India is to  be understood in order to combine “the fastest  growing market opportunity in the world, with its  talent pool of human capital recognised for inno vation – and the UAE, a centre for cutting-edge  technologies”243 From this AI partnership both  sides expect economic advantages worth 17.5 bil lion Euro, which are expected to materialise in the  next decade.244 However, similar to the range of  strategies mentioned above, concrete contents  and specific implementation instruments are not  yet known from this document.

36 both of whom studied in India but then moved to  a more promising environment. Despite the exist ing hurdles, significant technology service compa nies, such as Infosys and Tata, have already been  founded in India. In view of this situation, the gov ernment aims to create a formalised pan-Indian  network to foster cooperation between science  and industry and strengthen the AI value chain. II.) Requirements for AI India has over 1.3 billion inhabitants, of whom  only about 390 million were connected to the  Internet in 2016.248 This clearly illustrates the  growth potential for the domestic data pool and  ›AI for the improvement of education, health and other social areas  ›Focus on establishment of institutions to catalyse synergies between science and industry  ›Planned establishment of multi-actor institutions as nodes of a pan-Indian network of research  (CORE) and commercialisation (ICTAI)  ›So far hardly any directives to implement the AI strategy, no prioritisation of areas   of basic research I.) Introduction  On February 18, 2018, Indian Prime Minister Nar endra Modi opened the Wadhwani Institute for  Artificial Intelligence at Mumbai University and  expressed optimism about the role of AI in solving  social problems.245 As the largest democracy in the  world, the Indian AI strategy concentrates on the  areas of poverty reduction, education, health and  universal speech, embedded both in the larger  industrial policy Make in India246 and the broader  Digital India  Strategy247. Until now, the country  has not been able to fully exploit its considerable  potential in AI, for example, its large pool of quali fied talents. Microsoft and Google are currently  managed by Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai, India  AI for everyone
37India the internal market for AI applications. At the  same time, an estimated 480 Master’s students  graduate from computer science institutes with a  focus on AI each year, compared with over 7,000  in the USA and nearly 2.000 in China (Germany  approx. 410).249 There is also a need to catch up in  the availability of machine-readable and openly  accessible data: According to the Open Data  Barometer , in 2016 the country only ranked elev enth ahead of China and the UAE.250 As these areas  improve, large data sets with large sample sizes  will accelerate the potential for AI in India. But  also the low data processing capacity is remarka ble: India only operates five of the 500 best super computers in the world, which is far from China’s  206 and the 124 of the USA.251 In semiconductor  production, the country is a global player and also  dependent on foreign computing power. III.) Institutional framework So far, the goals of social progress through AI  have been embedded in other government poli cies and schemes. However, these for their part  hardly refer to AI. Institutions that can substantiate synergies  between science and industry are the focus of  India’s National Strategy for AI : #AIforALL which  was published in June 2018 by the Policy Think  Tank of the government (NITI Aayog).252 Although  the actual budget expenditure for their projects  is unknown, #AIforALL is expected to be imple mented promptly. It has strong political appeal in  New Delhi, since it was supported by high-rank ing government officials at the federal level – an  important sign in the federal Indian state system. The comprehensive strategy is strongly influenced  by the federal government structure. Every state  in India has strong government and the central  government often lacks mechanisms to imple ment certain policies at the local level. Although  laws can only be passed by the Indian Parliament,  the executive and regulatory authorities have a  wide margin of discretion when it comes to imple mentation. The national AI strategy needs to be  implemented in coordination with the Ministry of Industry and Technology and the Indian Regula tory Authority for Telecommunications. However,  it must be noted that in 2019 general elections will  be held in India in a polarised political climate that  could influence the priorities of the government  apparatus. The Digital India programme mentioned above  has been allocated almost 420 million Euro by the  central government in the latest budget.253 How ever, it concentrates mainly on the development  of the telecommunications infrastructure and  does not yet have a programmatic approach for  the targeted introduction of AI. The Make in India   programme, which is primarily aimed at industrial  policy and export promotion, does not make any  substantial mention of AI, either.254 Leading Indian universities and industrial com panies have each organised several conferences  to discuss the potential of AI for India. However,  these events took place independently of each  other. For example, an influential business con sortium, the Confederation of Indian Industry , will  host the Indian Innovation Summit : India AI in July  2018 . The over 70 speakers at the summit, how ever, were almost exclusively business and gov ernment representatives. No representative from  civil society gave a speech and only two academics  from the field of science made it onto the agenda:  the director of the Indian National Centre for the  Arts and a Brazilian professor from the University  of São Paulo.255 IV.) Research and Development In 2015, India spent around eleven billion Euro  on R&D, equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP. India  is thus investing the lowest percentage of all  the countries compared here.256 This translates  into the lowest number of researchers per mil lion inhabitants (156).257 As a result, Indian AI  research performance was weak across all indi cators. According to CSRankings, between 2016  and 2018, there were about 70 professors at  15 institutes who did active research on AI and  an estimated 200 doctoral students.258 In terms of  citable publications in AI areas the high quantity 
38India is striking, but this is not in line with their qual ity. India, for example, only lags behind China  (6,214) and the USA (4,673) in the broad field of  IT applications and in the AI-focused areas of  computer vision and pattern recognition in terms  of the number of citable documents (2,223).259  Measured in terms of the H index, however, in a  quality comparison it only ranks tenth among the  twelve countries surveyed (ahead of Finland, but  behind South Korea).260 This is due to rigidities in  the academic system and the process of award ing research grants in India, which is strongly  administrative and slow, creating incentives for  less risky but less effective research. Research areas and instruments The AI strategy aims at the creation of two types  of networks: on the one hand research excellence  centres for AI (COREs), on the other hand inter national centres for transformative AI (ICTAIs).  The COREs will be located at technical universities  and will focus on the promotion and financing of  AI fundamental research. In contrast to that, the  ICTAIs will closely cooperate with the industry to  use research to create commercial applications.  Using a cloud-based pool of robust data, which  COREs and ICTAIs will contribute to and draw on,  these centres will form a network whose scal ing effects will increase over time. These clusters  of research and industry would enable scalable  knowledge transfer systems and generate the  necessary dynamics to create a basis for the start  of a domestic AI industry. According to the Indian national AI strategy of  2018, COREs and ICTAIs are towork together  under the umbrella of the Centre for Studies on  Technological Sustainability (CSTS), which is to  ensure that science and industry move in paral lel. To bring all major universities together in one  “Hub-and-spoke ” model, India would ideally need  about two dozen COREs, each of which would  cost about eight million Euro over a period of  five years. The costs of ICTAIs are estimated at  40 million Euro over the same period, which may,  however, be partly borne by contributions from  the private sector, which the strategy considers  to be optimistic.The main channel for the improvement of AI  research is the strengthening and equipping of  researchers. The strategy recognizes that in the  rapidly changing field of AI, university research  must work according to a fast-failure  model. The  aim is to enable researchers to leave a failed pro ject early and smoothly, to take risks and cross  borders. As mentioned earlier, there is a lack of  powerful or high-quality AI researchers based in  India and the thematic focus areas of AI research  are still unclear. To address the low availability of  rich data , it is recommended to use a cloud-based  pool of robust data that COREs and ICTAIs can  use, but also contribute to. In this way, the cen tres generate mutual benefits and form a network  with increasing scale gains that maximise the  potential for generating high-quality data. #AIforALL – Indian proposals for ethical AI:  For Prime Minister Modi and his government  the provision of a social security network for  the poor population of India enjoys high politi cal priority. Many programmes are subject  to the “Sabke saath, sabke vikas”  framework  scheme, which translates as “self-determina tion for all parts of society”. Thus, the Indian AI  strategy also focuses on directing AI in areas  relevant to social progress. These include edu cation and health care, hygiene and the fight  against corruption. India, as a voting member  of the G77 coalition, has also spoken out on  these issues in international fora. In addition, the strategy aims for incentives to  keep Indian AI researchers in the country. A  national AI scholarship programme is currently  under consideration, to attract the numerous  doctoral students who work abroad and main tain connections to India.261 However, these parts  of the proposal are described only briefly and  remain unclear as to their actual implementa tion. Many of the details of India’s AI strategy  also remain to be determined by India’s political  process, which can often be opaque. An example  of unclear recommendations are the potential  research areas for COREs. These are supposed  to concentrate on areas with high potential in 
39India AI fundamental research. However, the strategy  lists virtually all components of AI research with out prioritising them: “Possible AI focus areas for  COREs could be: a) Sensory AI (Computer Vision , IoT,  among others), b) physical AI (robotics, industrial  automation, among others), c) cognitive AI (Natu ral Language Processing , further education), d) gen eral AI, e) high-precision learning based on small  data sets, f) research on new algorithms (such as  advances in cryptography, security), data sets, and  g) explainable AI. A CORE can decide to work on  one or more [sic!] of the focus areas.”262 India would be able to formulate a stronger AI  strategy if it oriented the list of possible areas  towards contextual realities. For example, natu ral language processing in local Indian languages  would require collaboration with interest groups  at subnational level, as Indian citizens speak dif ferent mother tongues in over 20 regions of the  country. This already gives India a comparative  advantage in the creation of cognitive AI adapted  to local contexts, which would be difficult for a  researcher in the USA or China to replicate. V.) Commercialisation At the heart of AI commercialisation are the  ICTAIs. These are intended to act as industrial  accelerators to catalyse the creation of successful  companies and apply basic research. The motiva tion for commercialisation of AI is the solution of  social problems, as formulated by Prime Minister  Modi. The ICTAIs focus on the following five areas:  healthcare, agriculture, education, smart cities  and smart mobility/transport.263 In each of these  areas, intensive efforts are being made to improve  affordability and quality for economically weaker  parts of society. This is unique as almost all other  countries focus their AI strategy more on eco nomic growth than on the prosperity and emanci pation of broad sections of the population. Since the economic liberalisation reforms of 1991,  India has seen development of an influential and  skilful private sector that largely follows market  forces rather than government dictates. This, how -ever, is facing a weak AI R&D landscape, leaving  the commercialisation of AI lagging behind their  potential. According to a study by Roland Berger  and Asgard, there are only 82 AI startups in India  (2017), while there are almost 1,400 in the US, 106  in Germany and 35 in Singapore.264 None of the  Indian startups ranges among the Top 100 of the  most influential AI startups.265 This small num ber, especially compared to the overall size of the  country, leads to a small proportion of AI patents  that are internationally enforceable. Between 2015  and 2017 on average, only 0.4 percent of the inter national enforceable AI patents came from India,  fewer only from Singapore.266 Also the number of  installed industrial robots per 10,000 employees in  the manufacturing industry is the lowest indica tor of the degree of automation of the economy  among the countries compared here (three com pared to 631 in South Korea or 309 in Germany).267 Support of startups and companies:  At the  moment, only little progress by Indian companies  and start-ups in AI commercialisation268 is notice able and even large technology companies like  Infosys and Tata Services are no exception. Also  the projects announced by these companies269  currently appear little innovative, but it is still too  early to judge their success or failure. Although  Indian AI startups are currently overshadowed  by most counterparts in the countries compared  here, they have shown resilience in parts of the  Indian market and still hold untapped growth  potential. For example, the Sigtuple Technologies  startup in Bangalore, which uses AI to read medi cal tests accurately and cost-effectively, raised  five million Euro in Series A funding in 2017 and  a further 16 million Euro in Series B funding in  early 2018.270 In a country where there is a seri ous shortage of physicians in many regions, a  startup that can help close this gap at low cost  has a high potential for scalability. These startups  are typically financed by smaller venture capi tal funds, such as Endiya Partners, which alone  have invested 25 million Euro in startups operat ingin the fields of Big Data , Internet of Things and  sensory AI.271 Although such funds do exist, most  Indian AI startups do not make significant pro gress in Series A or B financing.
40In 2016, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry  launched a programme to directly support start ups (Startup India) . Advantages include acceler ated patent filing, tax advantages and simplified  application procedures for releases and approv als.272 Startup India also has an investment fund  of almost one billion Euro, however, with no  mention of the share earmarked for AI startups.  India has also proactively signed bilateral agree ments in connection with the commercialisation  of AI, such as with the UAE in July 2018, to gener ate over 17 billion Euro of economic value added  through AI over the next ten years.273 Meanwhile, Google, Microsoft, Bosch Engineer ing and many others in India have made signifi cant investments in AI to gain access to the large  potential Indian customer base.274 There is cer tainly reason to be optimistic about the future  of AI startups in India, but it remains to be seen  whether they will be able to manoeuvre out major  investments by international competitors in the  coming years. Regulation: The AI strategy itself does not directly  address the issue of the regulatory reform. How ever, the necessity of combining existing data  archives in order to make them machine-readable is mentioned, on the one hand. On the other  hand, regulations for commercial applications of  online user data and data protection are identi fied as necessary. India’s first national telecommu nications policy was established in 1994, shortly  after economic liberalisation.275 The latest update  of this policy was adopted by the Indian Cabinet  in September 2018 under the name National Digi tal Communications Policy (NDCP). The NDCP aims  to attract around 90 billion Euro in private sector  investment, although it is not clear how much the NDCP focuses on AI-based technologies.276 India  could benefit from the establishment of a tailormade regulatory framework for the commerciali sation of AI. Since the Special Economic Zones  (SEZ)  Act of 2005, the Indian government has used  the SEZ model to promote certain industries.277  In the future, this model could also be used to  create special regulatory zones ( sand boxes ) that  can be used for AI commercialisation. However,  the Indian Special Economic Zones are facing the  great challenge of weak relationships with the rest  of the economy. At the same time there are accu sations of corruption and that they provoke tax  disputes.278 Large social media companies like Facebook are  preparing for negative reference in Indian political  discourse for the upcoming elections, which could  serve as a stress test for AI-generated filtering of  online abuse and harassment.279 The state as user:  The Indian AI strategy also  mentions the possibility of the government as a  user of AI, but without providing further details or  explanations. With the strong focus on improve ment of prosperity through AI, the bureaucratic  structure of the government must adapt to that  in order to integrate AI, but many basic prerequi sites are not yet met. As mentioned earlier, many  of the Indian government’s data stores have not  yet been commented and some data points are  not yet machine-readable. In order for the govern ment to start using AI, the first step would be to  identify areas where it is possible to conduct shortterm AI tenders so that the bureaucratic structure  can get used to the use of AI to rationalise differ ent processes. Until these issues are resolved, the  Indian government is not well equipped to use AI  on a large scale.India

Compared to that, in China an industrial invest ment fund of 15 billion Euro represents a single AI  promotion instrument.282 AI Singapore pursues an  application and commercialisation approach, as  the initiative is designed in particular to contrib ute to “strengthening the bonds between industry  and research to ensure that AI research meets the  needs of industry”283 ›Promotion of fundamental research not only from a technical point of view,   but also in terms of ethical and social issues  ›With 100Experiments , companies can submit problems for which there is no standardized   AI solution and are referred to AI developers  ›Understanding of AI within the population through the AI for Everyone training programme  ›The Accreditation@SGD initiative offers customised consulting services in the areas   of technical application for companies in early growth phases I.)

43Singapore II.) Requirements for AI Due to the small population of the country, the  number of active Internet users is the lowest  among the compared countries.284 In terms of avail ability and accessibility of public data, the coun try is only half as good as the UK according to the  Open Data Barometer 2016.285 This data source for  data mining is correspondingly limited.286 In con trast to that the country has established itself as a  strategic location for the data centres of neighbour ing countries. Consequently, half of the Southeast  Asian data centres are located in Singapore.287 With  an estimated number of around 525 AI Master’s  students, the country ranks sixth among the coun tries surveyed here. In relation to the small number  of inhabitants this value is remarkable.288 Further more, although only two of the top 500 supercom puters worldwide are located in Singapore, this  value is also considerable in relation to the small  number of inhabitants.289 The semi-conductor  industry has been a strong driver of the growth of  the city-state over the past year. According to the  Economic Development Board , semiconductor pro ductionincreased by 48 percent in 2017,290 which  does not yet make the country a global location in  this sector.291 The technology-friendly conditions  created by the government, especially in relation  to the size of the country, are also appreciated by  private sector players, who increasingly consider  the country a location for innovation.292 The deep  technology company DataRobot has announced,  for example, that it will invest 13 million Euro in  Singapore as part of its expansion plans.293 III.) Institutional framework The government regards technical progress and  the promotion of AI as crucial for the develop ment of the country:294 “Singapore must think and  act like a startup to survive as a small open citystate.”295 said the Minister of Communications and  Information S. Iswaran. This idea is implemented  through numerous initiatives: Through the Smart Nation Initiative , the govern ment aims to steer investment in and use of tech nological infrastructure to support commercialisa -tion by developing realistic and targeted solutions  to urban challenges. In doing so, the initiative  refers to the Digital Government Blueprint , the  Digital Readiness Blueprint and the Digital Economy  Framework for Action .296 The latter focuses on four  frontier technologies: AI, cyber security, immer sive media (such as Virtual reality ) and Internet of  Things .297 The Smart nation  initiative has the high est political priority and is supported by the Smart  Nation and Digital Government Office coordinated  in the Prime Minister’s office and supported by  other government agencies.298 The interdepartmental initiative AI Singapore com pletes Singapore’s ambitions in the field of tech nology promotion. Participants in AI Singapore are  the National Research Foundation (leading entity),  the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office  (SNDGO), the Economic Development Board , the  Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), the  state-owned company SGInnovate , which funds  and promotes Deep-Tech startups, as well as the  leading IT analyst in healthcare Integrated Health  Information Systems .299 Through AI Singapore AI is  expected to contribute to overcoming major soci etal challenges, to adapting human capital to tech nological change in the sense of AI, and prepare  the adoption and use of AI by the industry. Specifi cally, the Initiative consists of the following pro grammes: Foundation Research, Grand Challenge,  100Experiments, AI Apprenticeship, AI For Industry  and AI For Everyone .300 IV.) Research and Development The good education of the population and R&D  are important components of the policy to pro mote competitiveness and economic growth.  With about 6,729 per million inhabitants, Singa pore has a high density of scientists, especially in  comparison to the other countries examined here  (USA: 4,255, China: 1.096).301 The Government pro vides financial incentives for small and mediumsized local companies to become involved in R&D  and thus support the development of innova tions.302 In total, the country spent 5.9 billion Euro  on R&D in 2016, which corresponds to about  2.1 per cent of GDP (GDP share comparable to 
44Singapore France, about half the size of Israel).303 Around  53 percent of investment comes from the private  sector, while in China and Japan almost 80 per cent of R&D investment comes from the private  sector. This conveys the impression that the  research impulses in Singapore are set by the  state in particular, which basically contradicts the  project of developing application-related innova tion. The majority of AI research is also financed  by government agencies: NRF, Ministry of Edu cation, A*Star Science and Engineering Research  Council .304 It is estimated that 225 doctoral stu dents graduate annually in AI areas, outperform ing competing countries due to Singapore’s small  population.305 Scientific publications still have little  influence beyond the borders of Singapore. Meas ured by the H index, which is 125 for the AI sector  in Singapore, it is far behind countries such as the  US (437) or Germany (186).306 Research areas and instruments In order to address existing deficits in national  AI research, various programmes were  initiated –  both to improve the coverage of the needs of  industry and research and to promote young  scientists. In the past, the focus of AI research in  Singapore was on applications in health care and  robotics, while the research directions concen trated on graphic models, neural networks and  Fuzzy systems . In recent years, the main areas of  research have largely been adjusted to the strate gies of Smart Nation and AI Singapore .307 Through the recently formed Singapore Data Sci ence Consortium , NRF, universities and the Agency  for Science, Technology and Research are seek ing research partnerships between institutions  of higher education, research institutes and The  industry in order to make technologies usable for  practice-oriented challenges.308 In the course of receiving a research grant of  2.8 million Euro from the NRF and the IMDA,  Singapore Management University established  a five-year AI research programme, with par ticular attention being paid to three research  areas: AI and society, AI and industry as well as  AI and commercialisation. Critical and interdis ciplinary perspectives will help to build bridges between academia, industry and government.309  These research priorities are also considered by  research institutions in other countries, but with a  funding amount of 2.8 million Euro the Singapore  Management University cannot keep up financially  with the research budgets of institutes of other  nations. For example, the Academy of Finland  made available 13 million Euro for research in the  field of the Machine learning and AI applications in  physics and engineering.310 The AI Singapore  Fundamental Research  programme  supports basic research and seeks to fill exist ing research gaps. This includes purely technical  research, such as image recognition algorithms,  but also research on the social impact of AIs and  their socially acceptable use.311 The research grants  will be distributed by means of a tender. Individu als as well as research institutions could apply to  obtain subsidies up to 632,000 Euro.312 Propos als were expected to focus on methodology and  algorithms, in particular deep learning , rather than  sector-specific solutions.313 At the time of writing,  decisions on recipients had not been made. The Grand Challenges programme is designed to  work with the public to promote new, innovative  ideas in three long-term areas: healthcare, urban  solutions and financial technology (in short: FinTech).314 Criteria for a Grand Challenge are: Inspira tion (for researchers, users and the public), meas urability (success criteria) and impact (solutions  that benefit many people).315 The funding will be  provided in two phases: up to 4.4 million Euro in  the first two funding years and up to 17.4 million  Euro in the second phase (three more years).316 V.) Commercialisation The cooperation between research and industry  is one of the key factors for the adaptation of AI  solutions by the private sector. However, it has so  far hardly been accepted and used by companies,  which the government wants to change by means  of initiatives to link research and industry. There are between 1,600 and 2,400 technology  startups in Singapore,317 however, according to 
45Singapore Asgard and Roland Berger, only a few of them  specialise in AI (35). This is a long way from the  global peak (just under 1,400 in the USA) and is  the lowest in comparison with the countries ana lysed in this study.318 Meanwhile, the interest of  foreign companies in the AI ecosystem is growing.  Thus, in 2017, the investment group Marvelstone,  financier of the global Fintech hub “Lattice80”  announced to open an AI hub in Singapore. The  group wants to bring together scientists, com panies and the government to develop AI tech nologies for the market. To this end, up to 100  AI startups per year can be funded.319 One of the  25 Hottest AI Companies 2018 according to the CIO  Advisors Ranking is located in Singapore: AIQ, a  company specialising in technologies for visual  capture and intelligent recognition.320 These devel opments are reinforced by well-trained profes sionals and close cooperation between universi ties and industry in research and development  (fifth place among the countries surveyed).321  Between 2015 and 2017, however, only 0.31 per cent of all internationally enforceable AI patents  were from Singapore – for comparison: in South  Korea the figure was around 3.8 per cent.322  The manufacturing industry accounts for 20 to  25 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP)  in Singapore. The key industries are electron ics, chemistry, biomedicine, logistics and trans port technology.323 The country with the second  highest robot density in the world (behind South  Korea)324 expects strong consequences of AI for  the labour market: Nearly 21 percent of fulltime workers could lose their jobs in the next  ten years – more than in other ASEAN coun tries – through the increased use of technolo gies such as AI and robotics.325 In order to pro mote understanding and acceptance of AI among  the population, the government offers the AI  For Everyone programme: In free workshops, up  to 100,000 Singaporeans are informed about AI  applications in their own companies and in daily  life.326 AI For Everyone is financially supported by  IMDA and Microsoft.327 Regulation:  In his speech at innovfest unbound  2018, the largest Southeast Asian innovation festi val, S. Iswaran promised a progressive regulatory framework for the ICT sector in Singapore. With  regard to data protection, this means, in particu lar, that the Personal Data Protection Act of 2012  will be examined for favourable regulations. Up  to now, this has legitimised the needs of compa nies to collect and use personal data on the one  hand, and regulates the responsible handling of  data on the other.328 The law has also established  the Personal Data Protection Commission Singa pore (PDPC), which administers the law and its  implementation.329 As early as July 2017, the PDPC  issued a guideline for data exchange to explain  the Data protection acts published. In addition, a  framework for the agreement on the exchange  of data within a regulatory- sandbox will be estab lished that releases companies from certain obli gations to test and promotes innovative uses of  personal data.330 Since text and data mining are essential for the  development of AI, this topic was part of the pub lic consultation on amendments of the Copy Right  Act in 2016. In it, the Ministry of Justice proposes  an exception in the Copy Right Act which allows  copying of copyrighted documents and data for  the purpose of data analysis.331 Politicians are  expected to agree to this proposal.332 Business support and startup promotion:  The  conditions for startups in the country are already  very good. According to Genomes 2017 Startup  Ecosystem Ranking singapore ranks twelfth in the  world and promises young startups in the country  great opportunities for global success.333 The value  of the Singapore startup ecosystem in 2017 was  9.6 billion Euro, which is comparatively high com pared with the global average of 3.6 billion Euro.334 In addition to the SME Go Digital Initiative   announced in 2017,which aims to support small  and medium-sized enterprises in strengthening  digital capabilities,335 young companies will be sup ported by the initiative Accreditation@SGD in their  early growth phases with tailor-made advice on  technical applications.336 In fact Accreditation@SGD  was instrumental in the Taiger startup company  transferring its intellectual property and key oper ations to Singapore in 2015.337 The Infocomm Media  Development Authority (IMDA) through its coop -
46eration with the leading banks DBS, OCBC and  UOB offers the following services Accreditation@  SGD participating companies improved access to  innovative Fintech projects.338 In addition, IMDA  has decided to support AI developers in the field  of language recognition for the national language  corpus in order to prepare their long-term entry  into the global speech recognition market.339 The AI for Industry programme of the AI Singa pore Initiative is aimed at developing the skills of  engineers, managers and executives who already  have technical knowledge and wish to develop  their programming skills to use data and create AI  applications.340 In addition, the 100Experiments programme is  intended to connect AI researchers and develop ers with players from the industry who want to  address their specific challenges through AI solu tions. Companies can submit problems for which  AI could be used as a solution and will be referred  to AI experts accordingly. AI Singapore finances  the project together with the company in equal  shares with up to 160,000 Euro.341 The programme  is popular with the industry and initial solutions  are already being tested.342 High initial investment  in AI solutions are entry barriers for companies,  which the programme helps to overcome.343 IMDA has also launched the AI Business Partner ship Programme . It provides a guided process to  bring local companies with potential problems  (AI end-user companies) together with providers  of existing AI solutions and support these partner ships in the development and deployment of pro totypes. In addition, quarterly free AI workshops  are offered by IMDA.344 Problem areas that do not  yet have commercially available solutions will be  forwarded to 100 experiments of AI Singapore .345The public sector as users of AI:  Through the  public procurement sector, the government is  increasing its demand for cutting-edge technolo gies and thus encouraging innovation. From  2017–2018, in the World Competitiveness Index , the  country ranked in fifth place of the 137 countries  surveyed in the field of government procurement  of cutting-edge technology.349 The Smart Nation Ini tiative also intends to expand the area of E-govern ance further. This has been specified in the Digital  Government Blueprint paper, which also states  that digitisation and AI are defined as elementary  components of the transformation efforts of the  public service at the interface between state and  citizens and that digital payments and digital sig natures are concrete applications. Employees of  public institutions are to be provided with digital  competences in the workplace in order to meet  the challenges between public authorities and   citizens more effectively.350 Since access to data sets is essential for machine  learning , S. Iswaran announced that he would  expand the provision of public data via the data. gov.sg platform and motivate companies to  exchange data responsibly among themselves  in order to solve common business problems. Labour market: As a country with a knowledgebased economy, Singapore also focuses on the  training of specialists in the field of AI. This is  reflected in the relatively high number of AI tal ents.351 As part of the Industry Transformation Map  that Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA)  aims to further develop the IT and communica -Singapore Ethical use of AI and data: For the Singa porean government, ethics plays a central  role in the use of AI applications and the  handling of data. So S. Iswaran in his speech  at innovfest unbound 2018 announced the  establishment of an advisory board on the ethical use of AI and data.346 In June 2018, the  Personal Data Protection Commission Singapore  published a discussion paper on responsi ble handling of AI, which stresses the prin ciples of transparency and “Do no harm” .347  After receiving a research grant in 2018, the  Singapore Management University opened  the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Data  Governance , which will examine the societal  opportunities and risks arising from these  technologies.348
47tions industry through the targeted promotion of  skilled workers in the transformation towards a  digital economy.352 It is not clear from the search  whether funds have already been spent on this. SkillsFutures is a comprehensive initiative to  spread ICT skills and knowledge across the  population.353 Part is also the 2016 announced  TechSkills Accelerator (TeSA), which takes an inte grated approach to the acquisition of ICT skills  and the training of ICT practitioners.354 Through a partnership between AI Singapore and  the TechSkills Accelerator , a “pipe line of locally  grown, world-renowned AI talents”355 is to be created: the AI Apprenticeship Programme . The  training is designed by industry players to meet  the demand for trained professionals. Contents  include the construction of data pipe lines, Data  warehouses for AI Use cases and adjustment of  machine learning algorithms. The nine-month  programme is aimed at experts from all fields  within the first three years after graduation and  includes a combination of in-depth AI courses and  hands-on training in industrial projects.356 The pro gramme has been completed by the first year of  students and partnerships have been established  between the trainees and industrial actors. The  second group will start in November 2018.357Singapore

49The analysis on which this report is based  assessed the countries on the basis indicators  that incorporate the countries’ preconditions,  the research and development situation and the  degree of commercialisation of AI. In an attempt  to integrate these indicators and determine the AI  position of a country in an international compari son, the Cambrian AI Index © was developed. The  Cambrian AI Index consists of the three segments  mentioned above, which in turn consist of dif ferent components for which one or more proxy  indicators have been identified. The methodol ogy must be specified more, since the index is  defined by proxy measurements for which reliable  and comparable data from different countries are  available. The reason for using the proxies is that  the field of AI in its latest phase only provides lim ited measurable outputs. This is likely to change  over the next few years, as the accompanying  research on AI is also developing rapidly.The values of the different proxies are indexed  from 0 to 1, with the USA representing the “bench mark” value 1 against which the other countries  are measured. Due to the world leadership AI, the  United States have been selected the AI bench mark country. The mean value of the indexed  proxy values of a component is the component’s  intermediate value. The mean values of all com ponents of a segment, in turn, result in the total  value of the segment. The mean values of the  three segments result in the comprehensive  Cambrian AI Index. Weighting was not carried  out at proxy, component or segment level, since  well-founded empirical studies are required for   adequate weighting.Methodology of the Cambrian AI Index ©
50Methodology of the Cambrian AI Index © Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source General  require mentsFramework  conditionsNetwork Readiness Index   Value (2016) Explanation: The index provides  insights about the performance of  national economies in the use of  information and communication  technologies to enhance competi tiveness, innovation and well-being.  Thus it serves as a proxy for the  framework conditions of AI.Survey based on a scale from   1 (worst) to 7 (best). World Economic Forum:  https://widgets.weforum.org/ gitr2016/ Data OpenData Barometer (2016) Explanation: In addition to individu als with internet access and busi nesses, the public sector is the third  important source of AI-related data.  The OpenData barometer assesses  governments worldwide in their will ingness to implement OpenData ini tiatives. It also measures the impact  of OpenData on business, politics  and civil society.The data for the OpenData barom eter is collected through expert inter views, self-assessments by govern ments and secondary data sources. World Wide Web Foundation:  https://opendatabarometer.org Number of Internet users (2016)  Explanation: Internet users are  persons who have used the inter net (from anywhere) via comput ers, mobile phones, personal digital  assistants, gaming machines, digital  television, etc. in the last 3 months.  This proxy measures internet users  in absolute numbers rather than  as a percentage of the population,  since the quantity of data is what  counts for AI.World Bank:  https://data.worldbank.org/ indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS Computing  powerNumber of 500 most powerful  supercomputers per country (2018)  Explanation: Even if computing  power can be used across borders,  the availability of supercomputers to  cope with large amounts of data and  increasingly complex algorithms is a  strategic factor for a nation.The website Top500.org counts and  lists the top super computers that  are publicly known and commercially  available worldwide in semi-annual  surveys (June and November).

55Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source AI-relevant  R&D (Input)Number of citable publications   in the subject area of AI (2017) Explanation: The number of citable  publications in the field of AI pro vides information about the scien tific productivity of a country in the  field of AI.Scimago Journal & Country Rank: https://www.scimagojr.com Cf. the methodology used there Influence of publications in   the subject area of AI (2017) Explanation: The influence of publi cations is a proxy for the quality and  innovative power of research in the  field of AI. It is unknown whether the index  takes into account co-authors and  their nationality.The influence of publications is meas ured on the basis of the H index. The  figure is based on bibliometric analy ses, i. e. on citations of the scientist’s  publications. Scimago Journal & Country Rank: https://www.scimagojr.com Commercial izationKnowledge  and technol ogy transferCooperation between universi ties and industry on research and  development (2017–18) Explanation: This proxy delivers  information on the knowledge and  technology transfer between univer sities and the private sector.Opinion polls among executives:   In your country, to what extent do  business and universities cooperate  in research and development (R&D)?   (1 = not at all; 7 = intensively).  Weighted average. World Economic Forum:  https://www.weforum.org/reports/ the-global-competitivenessreport-2017-2018 Public procurement of cuttingedge technology (2017–18)  Explanation: This proxy provides  information about the incentives that  the public sector creates by demand  for certain technologies and thus  innovations.Opinion polls among executives: To  what extent do government purchas ing decisions promote innovation in  your country? (1 = not at all; 7 = to a  large extent). Weighted average. World Economic Forum:  https://www.weforum.org/reports/ the-global-competitivenessreport-2017-2018Methodology of the Cambrian AI Index ©
56Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source Patents AI patents (with international  enforcement expectations) by  assignee country in % (average   of the years 2015, 2016 and 2017). Explanation: This proxy provides  information on the patent activities  of a country’s companies. Neverthe less, this proxy is subject to reserva tion, since the patents are not indic ative of the quality of an innovation  and are often merely incremental in  nature.Although various sources suggest  that China has overtaken the US in  terms of AI-related patent applica tions, most Chinese patents have no  international equivalents and are  therefore unenforceable outside  China. The patents cover AI as well as  Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Notice: The process of patent appli cation for patent publication is  associated with a considerable time  delay, which is why the figures may  also vary retroactively. Research by M-Cam:  https://www.m-cam.com AI startup  landscapeNumber of AI startups (2017)  Explanation: The number of AI start ups provides information about  the diversity of the potentials of AI  and the innovative strength of the  national economies.The data collection focused exclu sively on startups active in the AI  technology industry and ignored  companies dealing with other digital  topics and technologies. These are  startups that produce AI solutions  and expressly excludes startups  that use existing AI solutions on the  market to develop new services or  products. Asgard und Roland Berger/Lemaire,  A.; Lucazeau, H.; Carly, E.; Romain;  Rappers, T.; Westerheide, F. (2018):  https://asgard.vc/global-ai The 100 most influential   AI startups (2017) Explanation: While the above proxy  reflects the quantity of AI startups,  the number of AI startups in the list  of the 100 most influential AI start ups per country is a proxy for the  quality and future potential of the  companies.The companies were selected from  a pool of more than 2,000 startups  based on several criteria, including  investor profile, technological inno vation, team strength, patent activity,  financing history, valuation and busi ness model.

57Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source Share of AI private equity   deals in all AI private equity   deals worldwide (2016) Explanation: This proxy provides  information about the countries with  the startup landscapes with the high est future potentials in AI as seen by  investors.CB Insights:  https://www.cbinsights.com/ research/artificial-intelligencestartup-funding Number of most active venture  capital investors (2012–2016)  Explanation: This proxy indicates in  which countries the most AI-savvy  investors are based and thus have  the largest influence in terms of AI  startups.CB Insights:  https://www.cbinsights.com/ research/artificial-intelligencestartup-funding Robotics Number of industrial robots  installed per 10,000 employees in  the manufacturing industry (2016)  Explanation: This proxy provides  information about the automation  of the manufacturing industry and  the consumption and implementa tion of robot technology, and thus is  indicative of the level of experience  of the labor market in interaction  with machines.International Federation of Robotics: www.ifr.org Number of manufacturers   producing service robotics (2016) Explanation: Complementing the  proxy, specified above, the number  of manufacturers of service robots  provides information about the size  of the ecosystem in this future tech nology.The data only represent the individ ual figures for the eleven countries  with the largest number of such  companies. The other thirteen coun tries in which companies produce  service robots have been consoli dated in the category “Rest of the  world”, with an average of four com panies per country.

Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung e. V.The race for world leadership in Artificial Intelligence  (AI) technologies has begun. Since the publication of the  AI strategy of the Obama government in 2016, other  countries have also started to explore ways to support  research and development (R&D) as well as the com mercialisation of AI and to catch up with the U. S. as the  leading AI nation. With this two-part publication, the  Konrad Adenauer Foundation intends to give a compa rative overview of the AI strategies of major national  economies (Part 1 & 2) and to analyse the German AI  strategy in an international comparison (Part 3) in order  to enrich the German and international debate. We  believe: “Tech is politics” – and politics and civil society  should give this more attention and discuss this more  vigorously.
