      4  PRESENTATION   An agenda for the digital society of the future.      The Brazilian Digital Transformation Strategy (E -Digital) is an initiative by the federal government ,  coordinated by the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC) .  An  Inter -Ministerial Working Group composed by nine government  bodies developed this public policy  after seven months of meetings, evaluations and experts and public consultations . Additionally,  representatives of over thirty e ntities of the federal government interacted with that  core group  throughout the process.   The resulting document also reflects the broad engagement of the private sector, the scientific and  acade mic community and civil society  through many  stages of the elaboration process . Such actors  had significant participation in seminars and  workshops , and  also at  the public consultation of the draft  document, which received thousands of contributions.  This led to a comprehensive review and to  improvements to the draft version, now consolidated into an official public policy document.   The rapid changes in the economy and society effected by the digital environment impose new  challenges to  the government ’s tasks and responsibilities.  This policy proposes strategic actions  focus ed on the role of the government as an enabler of the digital  transformation in the economy’s  productive sectors, as an important contributor for capacity -building in this new era, as well as a  service provider and guarantor of  rights.   Each thematic axis which composes the E-Digital is explored in detail , according to four dimensions: a  broad diagnosis of the current challenges, a vision of the desirable future, a set of strategic actions  that bring us closer to that vision, and , when applicable,  a set of indicators and metrics to monitor  progress in the achievement of the goals.    This strategy ought to be regarded as a “living” policy, designed to be constantly monitored, evaluated  and adjusted, as the rhythm of global digital transformation tends to accelerate.   Perhaps the most important aspect, however, is to embra ce digital transformation as an opportunity  for the entire nation to take a leap forward.  Digital technologies provide the tools for a profound  transformation in government actions, in competitiveness and productivity in the private sector, and  in empowerm ent and inclusion in society, so that everyone can develop economy and socially, and  thrive in quality of life.     
      5  INTRODUCTION   Harness the full potential of digital technologies in order to increase  productivity, competitiveness, and income and employment levels  throughout the country, building a free, just and prosperous society for all.     Digital technologies are increasingly present in everyone's life: at home, at work, in schools, media and  in social relations. Our  national economy must transform with dy namism, competitiveness and  inclusion, embedding digitalization in processes, values and knowledge, so that Brazil can completely  explore the digital revolution and reap the benefits that the information and knowledge society can  offer.   The economy of the  future will be digital. All Brazilians must have a part in it.  One cannot conceive of  a modern and dynamic economy that does not offer equal opportunities in all regions of the country.   Digital technologies have appeared as a new vital center of modern ec onomies, and leading countries  have positioned themselves strategically on this issue.  On the international stage, countries seek to  leverage their core competencies and advantages while filling important gaps to maximize the benefits  of the digital econom y. According to their strengths, some countries seek leadership in specific and  promising sectors, such as robotics, artificial intelligence, high -precision manufacturing or financial  digital innovations; while others tune their regulatory framework so tha t the market can seize the full  potential of digital technologies.  Priorities for digitalization initiatives include strengthening  competitiveness in digital business, digitization of public services, creation of skilled jobs in the new  economy, and better  and more advanced education for the population.   The Brazilian case is no different: Brazil’s advantages must be leveraged  to overcome challenge s and  promote  the digitization process.  Despite a significant competitive advantage in a number of areas,  such a s agribusiness, and its  large, diverse economy with a globally significant consumer market, Brazil  still has major challenges to face.   An important focus of the Brazilian Strategy for Digital Transformation is to propose strategic actions  under the perspec tive of Sustainable Development Goals1 (SDGs) of the  2030 Agenda of the United  Nations.   There are 17 Sustainable Development Goals with a total of 169 targets – one of which has specific  indicators related to information and communication technologies2. Actually, digital transformation                                                              1 See the UN Sustainable Development Goals at https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable -development goals/ , access on 09/04/2018.   2 Objective 9, Target c: “Significantly increase access to information and communications technology and strive to provide  universal and affordable access to the Internet in least developed countries by 2020”.  
      6  may influence, direct or indirectly, many of the goals and objectives of the SDGs:   • Goal 1 – No Poverty:  financially include the poorer population by combining mobile devices  with Internet access, mobile payments and new finan cial instruments in the digital  environment.   • Goal 2 – Zero Hunger:  Internet of things may increase agricultural productivity, reducing  produ ction loss in the field and during transport and distribution.   • Goal 3 – Good Health and Well -Being:  use of mobile te rminals with access to medical  databases and electronic records.  Internet of Thins technology, with monitoring and remote  diagnosis.   • Goal 4 – Quality Education:  use of computers with access to digital content, distance learning,  teacher training and profes sional qualification.   • Goal 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure:  expansion of Internet and communication  infrastructure for industry and R&D.    • Goal 13 – Climate Action : implement combined sensor networks with access to the Internet,  enabling  swift a ction to prevent and mitigate  natural disasters.   In order to assess  the contribution of digital transformation to Brazil's global competitiveness, this  strategy takes into account some indicators and metrics that provide international comparison , most  notably those compiled by specialized agencies of the United Nations, which include :  • Infrastructure: ITU ICT Development Index (IDI)   • Cybersecurity: ITU Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI)   • E-commerce: UNCTAD B2C E -commerce Index   • Electronic Government: UN E -Government Development Index (EGDI)   The World Economic Forum annually compiles the Global Competitiveness Index (GCI)3. This index  compares the economy of 137 countries, and defines competitiveness as a set of institutions, policies  and other factors that determine the level of productivity, seeking to reflect the level of prosperity that  every country can achieve.  The GCI index combines 114 indicators, aiming to capture and incorporate  statistical data from various international organizations.   Currently, B razil ranks 80th among the countries listed on the GCI.  This ranking is below the country’s  potential. The current rank affects the level of attractiveness for new investments and the Brazilian  image on the international scene, harming its social and econo mic development.  The goal of this  strategy is to raise significantly Brazil’s rank over the next five years.  Progress on this and other                                                              3 Available on: http:// www.weforum.org/reports/the -global -competitiveness -report -2016 -2017 -1, access on 06/07/2017.  
      7  indicators will closely reflect the level of success of the Brazilian economy, including the digital  economy.   A recent s tudy4 points out that the digital economy accounted for approximately 22% of the Brazilian  GDP in 2016, and may reach 25.1% of GDP in 2021. It also points out that an optimal digital strategy  can bring an additional estimated 5.7%  increase in GDP (equivale nt to US$115 billion) for a given  year.  Another study5 indicates that the global digital economy is expected to grow at a rate 2.5 times  higher than the growth of the global economy in other sectors over the next few years.  The global  digital economy shoul d amount to US$23 trillion in 2025.   Society is undergoing profound technological changes, and although this is a means of advancement,  inevitably they affect some more than others. The role of the Brazilian Digital T ransformation Strategy  is precisely to c oordinate various public policies to ensure broad adoption of digital technologies and  a productive transition for the dif ferent sectors of the economy, while building a more prosperous,  free and fair society.   Digitalization opens new opportunities in many  ways.  Today it is possible to imagine equal access to  educational resources, with no distinction whatsoever by geographic location, income, race, gender,  and other factors.  Automation,  data analysis and al gorithm improvement in decision making offer  signi ficant gains. Health care may be more accessible, cheaper and of higher quality for everyone due  to digital technologies. Meanwhile, new concerns on privacy and rights protection arise with the quick  spread of information and the expanding economic value o f its use.    Such innovations involve creating and updating an appropriate regulatory framework, to ensure  harnessing the full potential of digital technology. They also require the establishment of a governance  framework for the digital strategy, coordinat ing existing institutional mechanisms and ensuring priority  in implementation, monitoring and evaluation of several initiatives.   The Brazilian Digital Transformation Strategy, similarly to the digital strategies of other countries,  focuses on a period of f our years (2018 -2021). The strategy aims to coordinate different governmental  initiatives on digital issues within a coherent framework, in order to further the digitalization process  of production, promote education and training for the digital environm ent, and enable economic  growth .                                                                 4 See Accenture: “Digital Disruption: The Growth Multiplier”, available on  https://www.accenture.com/us -en/insight -digital disruption -growth -multiplier .

      8     The relationship  between government and private sector in the economy provide the framework for  the approach adopted in the E -Digital strategy, which comprises a set of thematic axes, as illustrated  in the figure below:     These axes provide an integrated approach to digitalization, and  to the role of government in this  process. The complexity of the digitalization process is greater, due to additional crosscutting elements  and mutual influences among these axes. The strat egic actions that are proposed take into account  such interdependences in the context of a common strategic vision.   E-Digital comprises two blocks of thematic axes: enablers of the digital transformation, and those of  the digital transformation per se .  
      9       The enablers  include initiatives aiming to create an environment conducive of the digital  transformation of the Brazilian economy.  Such initiatives include infrastructure and access to  information and communication technologies;  activities in research, de velopment and  innovation;  development of an appropriate regulatory environment;  rules and norms that promote  trust in the digital environment;  educational and professional skills for the digital economy;  and  international presence of Brazil.   This enabling environment provides the setting for a number of initiatives of digital transformation,  both in government and in the private sector.  In this context, specific actions relate directly to the  process of digital transformation :  • Digital transformation of the economy (data -driven economy, connected devices, new  business models), and   • Digital transformation of government (citizenship in the digital world and efficiency on  provision of government services).   Many challenges lie ahead of implementing these initiativ es. Therefore, from its inception the  development of this Strategy has sought synergy and the involvement of different actors and  stakeholders, with an aim to explore the full potential of digital technologies in providing equitable  growth throughout Brazi l.     
      10  METHODOLOGICAL APPROACH   The activities related to the development of the first Brazilian Digital Transformation Strategy began  on 17 February 2017, with the publishing of Ordinan ce MCTIC No. 842/2017. An Inter -Ministerial  Working Group (IWG) was established and tasked with preparing a base -document of the Strategy,  ready for submission to public consultation.   This Working Group set up subgroups divided according to the main thematic axes of the Brazilian  Digital Transformation Strategy.  Five subgr oups (SG) were established: i) SG Infrastructure;  II) SG  Citizenship and Digital Government;  III) SG Research, Development and Innovation;  IV) SG Trust and  Security in the Digital Environment v) SG Digital Economy. The IWG reviewed and approved the results   of each subgroup.   The IWG held nine meetings held, as well as 25 meetings of the subgroups for presentation and  discussion of the related topics.  The work of the subgroups involved intense interaction with  participating agencies and entities, providing an  exchange of knowledge and ideas, as well as the  coordination of Government initiatives in the  digital economy.   In addition, the IWG sponsored a preliminary Consultation focused on a group of 130 experts in  Government, academia and the private sector.  This online consultation, conducted with the support  of the center of Strategic Studies and management (CGEE), aimed at identifying relevant topics for a  digital transformation strategy for the country, as well as to indicate priority strategic actions.   A seri es of meetings provided further engagement of representatives of the private sector, non governmental entities and government agencies. These events, known as "Sectoral Meetings",  covered the following topics: education;  ICT in health;  application service providers and the ICT  industry;  social impacts of the digital transformation;  banks, fintechs and venture capitalists;  among  others.    Finally, four major workshops and seminars were held: Privacy and Data Protection, March  2017;  Education in the Digital Ag e, May 2017;  ICT indicators and metrics, May 2017;  Cyber Security,  June 2017). All of these events actively engaged representatives of civil society, academia, the private  sector and Government.    The chart  below illustrates the process of bu ilding the draf t Brazilian Digital Transformation Strategy  (E-Digital), from February to June 2017.  
      11    In order to organize and provide a standard format for the conclusions of each subgroup, the  participants of the IWG defined a common standard for presentations, contain ing the following  elements for each topic covered in the Brazilian Digital Transformation Strategy:   • Diagnosis: current status and challenges;   • Vision: desired future scenario;   • Strategy: actions to get form current status to vision;   • Indicators: metrics to tr ack progress on strategic actions.   The conclusions of this process provided the basis for the first version of this document, submitted to  public consultation from August 1st 2017 to September 20th 2017.  This online consultation via Internet  was conducted on a dedicated digital platform provided by CGEE. Over 2,000 participants accessed the  platform.  Among these, more than 700 individuals and organization offered suggestions and  contributions. These includ ed representatives of Government (at the Federal, State and Municipal  levels), the productive sector (companies and associations), the scientific and academic community  (universities, institutes and  schools) and civil society (associations, entities, NGOs and citizens).   Based on the contributions received during the public consultation process, the IWG conducted a  review with improvements to the draft version.  This final consolidated version, accompanied by draft  normative instrument, is ready for submissio n to the consideration of the President of the Republic,  based on the recommendation of the economic and Social Development Council (CDES).    
      12  THEMATIC AXES  – ENABLERS      A. Infrastructure and Access to Information and  Communication Technologies   Increasing the a ccess of all Brazilians to the Internet and digital  technologies, with quality service and economy.      Telecommunications emerged as the main driver of economic and social development in a global  scenario of intense growth and demand for knowledge.  Telecommunications services connect and  power various sectors of the economy, contributing to social development and attracting large  amounts of national and foreign investments.  Such services also generate multiple job opportunities  in many ind ustries.   In a country with gigantic territorial dimensions such as Brazil, the need for Internet network expansion  imposes continuous challenges for broadening the telecommunications infrastructure.      There is wide room to increase the provision of terrestrial telecommunications infrastructure in Brazil  through market solutions, in order to expand the availability of broadband Internet access with  efficiency and economy.  Many public policies and government agencies, as well as new and updated  regulations for telecommunications, ai m to improve the provision of such services.   Two separate studies of the World Bank on the infrastructure expansion of telecom and Internet in  Area (km2): 8,358,140   4.300 km   4,400 km   Population (millions of hab itants )  Proportion of population livin g in urban  areas with over 1 million habitants.   Proportion of urban population   206.1  22%   85%  
      13  developing countries (20026 and 20107) point out the main difficulties for universalization of  access.  According to these studies, areas of infrastructure coverage deficit ("access gap"), combining  high cost and low income population, persist in such  countries, even when  market -drive n enlargement  happens in economically more  viable areas (thereby reducing the "market gap").   The following figure  illustrates the opportunities for supply expansion to meet the demand for  telecommunications services – in this case, Internet broadband netwo rks. Expansion must occur  initially by increasing supply  through market players, meeting the suppressed demand (represented  by the “market efficiency frontier ”). Nevertheless, there is also a further segment where the service  offer may be possible by the c ombination of market action and complementary induction mechanisms  (the so -called “ sustainability frontier ”). Finally, portions of unattended territory and population will  persist; demand in those areas can only be addressed by a service with universalizat ion characteristics.   FIGURE 1: MARKET GAP AND ACCESS GAP MODEL     Source: World Bank, “Telecommunications and information services for the poor – toward a strategy for universal access”,  2002.   In further remote areas, network solutions via satellite are often required  either for access (to connect  the population to the Internet) or for data transport (to connect those areas to national  backbones ). In                                                              6 NAVAS -SABATER, J.,  et al .

      14  such  case s, public policies ensuring Internet  access to government institutions and facilities –  administrative, educational, health care, public security and the armed forces – are specially relevant.   Once the access infrastructure is locally available, either by satellite or other technology, it op ens up  the possibility of establishing various business models for Internet services to the general public.  Education also plays a big part: as children and young people have contact with the technology in  educational activities, service offering broadens also to their families, who can access digital  government services, digital shopping services, leisure and culture.   Diagnosis   Our population is mostly urban and concentrated – 86% of Brazilians live in 58% of the municipalities8  – which facilitated the fas t increase of Internet access for a large part of the population in  the past few  years.  One determining factor of that transformation was the rapid evolution of mobile technology ,  with the continuous expansion of 3G networks (which today attends the majori ty of the population)9  and 4G10, and the availability of low -cost mobile devices.   Fixed broadband access is present in 40% of households11, but is increasing at slower rates in recent  years.  Due to the immense territory, with remote, secluded areas and development challenges, the  task of offering Internet acc ess to all must be in the focus of a connectivity public policy.   The National Telecommunications Agency (Anatel) generates monthly information on the number of  accesses in current telecom service providers.  The consolidated data shows a growth on access  numbers for the following Internet services: fixed broadband connections (identified in the chart below  as SCM) and cellphone connections (with the acronym SMP). The regular landline telephone  connections (identified as STFC) kept steady for the past seven y ears.                                                               8 9 10 11  Data from t he National Telecommunication Agency (Anatel).

Despite the consistent growth on access, the largest portion is concentrated on Southeast Brazil:   FIGURE 3: ACCESSES BY TYPE OF S ERVICE  AND REGION IN 2016  (THOUSANDS OF ACCESSES )    Source: QMS systems, SGMU, JCL and SMP (Dec/2016).  41,0 42,0 43,4 44,0 44,1 42,8 41,0 202,9 242,2 261,8 271,1 279,2  257,8  244,1  15,0 17,0 19,8 22,2 24,0 25,5 26,6  050100150200250300 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016Millions of accesses Landline Cellphone Fixed broadband 41.006  1.211 4.668 3.133 25.120  6.872 24.066  16.880 58.799  2.207 111.411  36.135  26.586  965 3.126 20.840  15.654  4.633  020.00040.00060.00080.000100.000120.000 Brazil (total) North Northeast Midwest Southeast SouthThousands of accesses Landline  Cellphone  Fixed broadband
      16  A study recently conducted by Anatel showed that 48.2 percent of municipalities had fiber optics  backhaul   in 2015.  In 2016, that amount has increased to 57.9%, which represen ts 3,225 municipalities  connected with fiber.  The resident population in those municipalities with fiber backhaul  was 86% of  total Brazilian population in 2016.   According to the ICT Households Survey 2016  (formulated by Cetic.br, a branch organization of the  Brazilian Int ernet Steering Committee  – CGI.br ), 107.9  million people used the Internet in a three months  period.  The percentage of households with Internet  access varies from 40 to 64%, depending on the region  –half of Brazilian households , on average,  have  Internet a ccess.    A major vector for digital inclusion, however, is the  cellphone.  Mobile access to the Internet is already  higher than through computers: in 2014, 76% of  Internet users accessed via mobile, compared to 80%  who used the computer.  In 2016, the use of the  cellphone to access the Internet rose to 94%, while the  access by computer dropped to 49%.  In lower income  classes, the rate of Internet access exclusively by  cellphones is even higher.   Inclusion is also more intense  among the younger population: 86% o f people aged 16 to 24 have  accessed the Internet, regardless of income.  Of those Internet users, 98% used the cellphone for  access.  The Cetic.br report also reveals that 98% of broadband access is installed in municipalities with  fiber optic  backhaul in 2 016.   In the Brazilian scenario, the network infrastructure for the provision of personal mobile service  (mobile telephony, including mobile access to the Internet) is marked by the presence of four major  economic groups , which concentrate 98.1% of accesses : Telefónica, Claro, Oi and Tim.   The 4G technology is present in 2,852 municipalities (51% of the total), already covering approximately  86% of the population.  Using 3G technology, Internet access reaches 98.6% of the population by  attending 91 percent of Brazilian cities, since  the country's population is concentrated in urban  centers.  The evident challenge , then, is  to meet rural and small urban areas further away from major  urbanized centers.   There are 239 million  active accesses on mobile   telecom in Brazil, with a  teledensity of 120 lines per   100 habitants.  Cellphones  are the main Internet  connection device for 89%  of Brazilians.  
      17  FIGURE 4: MUNICIPALITIES WITH F IBER OPTIC BACKHAUL  (IN BLUE )   FIGURE 5: MUNICIPAL NON -HEAD DISTRICTS WITHO UT BTS    In Brazil, most municipalities are divided into districts, and the district with the largest urban  population and which holds the seat of municipal government is the “ head -district ”. Districts other  than head -districts – usually large areas of rural occupation – configure a peculiar challenge to  territorial coverage.  The service providers have no regulatory obligation to offer coverage to such  districts, which may represent vast area s of scarcely populated territory with little or no infrastructure,  particularly in the North and Midwest.   There are 4,717 districts which are not head -districts in Brazil. Of those districts, 2,012 do not have an  base transceiver station (BTS) installed. The districts without mobile -network BTS, however, represent  only 11% of the total population living in non -head -districts.   Hence, Brazil presents a dual challenge in developing broadband networks. In one hand, it is necessary  to expand the transport netwo rks infrastructure in fiber optics , in order to direct the data flow into the  national  backbones . In other hand,  it is fundamental to extend the fixed and mobile access  networks.  The response to these challenges should  result in an increased capacity of transport  networks,  backhaul s and access infrastructure in urban centers (adopting fiber networks), and also in  greater network penetration across the country, in order to provide connectivity to sparsely populated  areas , with multiple fixed and mobile network technologies, rural areas, roads, etc.  The following  images illustrate the magnitude of these challenges.   
      18  FIGURE 6: BRAZIL – POPULATION DENSITY    FIGURE 7: BRAZIL – DATA TRANSMISSION NET WORKS     Currently, there are  a few possible significant contributions by the telecom operators to expand  network and data access through fixed and mobile broadband.  One of them is the financial reserves  associated with “adjustment agreeme nts” (known by the acronym TAC12), which are contractual  penalties against telecom companies converted into investment obligations. Another opportunity is  the surplus balance resulting from the adaptation of public telecom concession framework under the  context of the General Telecommunications Act13, which establish es investment goals for network  and  broadband access.  In this subject , a public consultation on the proposed Decree14, revising the telecom  policy, was launched on MCTIC’s initiative.  The proposal points out three priorities for investment on  networks: (1) expand the terrestrial transport networks, (2) increase co verage of mobile broadband  networks, and (3) expand the scope of  fixed broadband access.   Another possibility to quickly expand mobile broadband networks is to accelerate the implementation  process of 4G networks using the 700 MHz band, nominally in those municipalities where this band is  already free and do not have to be previously released b y broadcast services on the transition to digital                                                              12 Resolution about TACs available at http://www.anatel.gov.br/legislacao/resolucoes/2013/680 -resolucao -629 (in  Portuguese).   13 Available on https://www25.senado.leg.br/web/atividade/materias/ -/materia/127688 , access on 30/06/2017.    http://www.cgee.org.br/prospeccao/exercicio/delphi/doc/170/decretoPoliticaTelecomunicacoes.pdf , access on  26/10/2017.   14 On October 18, 2017, MCTIC had launched a public consultation on the dec ree proposal aiming to review the  telecommunication policy:   www.mctic .gov.br/mctic/opencms/salaImprensa/noticias/arquivos/2017/10/Revisao_das_politicas_de_telecomunicacoes_ marca_uma_nova_etapa_para_o_setor_diz_ministro.html .

      19  TV15. In practice, this amounts to over 3,000 municipalities throughout the country, urban and rural  areas  included , able  to benefit from mobile 4G service, given the excellent conditions for propagation,  coverage, and the high -capacity for data transmission of the 700 MHz band.   The Telecommunication Services Universalization Fund (FUST) is also noteworthy on this subject. A  couple of bills are under discussion at the House of Representatives16 and the Senate17 to modify the  legislation applicable to this  fund, whose goal is to effectively use the resources to expand broadband  infrastructure.   Moreover, Anatel is currently analyzing the possibility to revise the radio -frequency pricing  model18. The proposal aims to channel those resources to investments in the expansion o f the telecom  network.   Some state governments have developed effective programs to encourage infrastructure installation  in regions with sparse population and less coverage.  States such as Minas Gerais and Ceará have  implemented similar  tax incentives policies for the deployment of base transceiver stations with 3G  connection in municipal districts without coverage, achieving very positive results.  Similar initiatives  can be encouraged in other states as a way to expand coverage using mobile technology.

      20  CEARÁ     2014       2016      5G Technology   The fifth -generation technology for mobile telephony (5G) is currently in standardization process at  the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).  At the end of 2015, ITU published its 5G outlook,  gathering the main features/functionality that should be  present on systems using this technology,  including very high speeds (up to 20 Gbps), low latency (up to 1 millisecond ) and a large number  of connected devices.   In 2019, ITU will promote the next World Radio Conference (WRC -19), when the spectrum bands to   be used by 5G should be globally defined and harmonized. It shall be a landmark for a large -scale 5G  technology implementation in telecom networks, possibly starting on 2020, although some countries  are already planning pilot projects to begin on 2018 -2019.  Brazil has engaged in research and development initiatives at the current stage of 5G technology. Good  examples of R&D projects are the Radiocommunication Reference Center (RRC) of the National  Institute of Telecommunications (Inatel), and the partnership between Ericsson and the Federal  University of Ceará (UFC).   The international  cooperation o n research and development in 5 G has various actors funding  education al agreements , such as the Brazil -EU Strategic Cooperation in 5 G, signed in 2016.  At the  same time, Brazil has been engaged in multilateral fora for discussion of this issue,  approaching  multiple world organizations dedicated to 5G standardization , harmonization and definitions : 5GIA  (Europe), 5GForum (Korea), 5GAmericas (USA), IMT -2020 ( China) and 5GMF (  Japan).   The next steps include :    establishment of a  roadmap  of development and deployment of 5G technology in Brazil , in  partnership with the private sector ;    use of R&D funding sources, such as Funttel (Telecommunication Technology Development  Fund) and FNDCT (Science and Technology National Development Fund);    strengthening of the dialogue between government and private sector through the industrial  association "5 G Brazil".   Reaching remote regions and connect ing communities further away from the major  telecommunications infrastructures are the goals of major public initiatives.  The Connected Amazon  
      21  Project 19, for example, deploys telecom  cables in riverbeds of the Amazon basin to form a  backbone  of  fiber optics for remote areas of the country’s Northern region .  The project is innovative in both technology and governance.  In the technological aspect, actions are  implemented in such a way to tackle budget limitations with technological solutions  that are   developed and commercialize d in Brazil.   One of the most notable aspects of the Connected  Amazon Project is its governance and sustainability   model s of cooperative work.  The initial project costs  are shared between public authorities , both Federal  and state, which demand broadband infrastructure in  Northern municipalities.  In the following phase, after  such infrastructure and data transport capacity is  available in municipalities, local data and access  providers can implement viable and a sustainable  business model s to offer telecommunications services  and Internet access to the resident population.   In 2017, it was launched the  Geostationary Defense and Strategic Communications Satellite (SGDC)20  in order to cover areas yet unattended by terrestrial broadband infrastructure,  and to provide  communication resources to meet strat egic and defense needs.   Another project currently in development is the Brazil -Europe submarine cable21, which will assist the  distribution of international data traffic with improved quality of the connection,  decreased latency,  enhanced connection with major research centers in Europe , and reduced traffic cost.   The traffic exchange points (IXP or - Internet Exchange Points ) are an important element of data  transmission networks architecture in Brazil. IXPs allow direct interconnection between networks  (autonomous systems , or AS ) which constitute the Internet in Brazil.  The country already has 28 points  operated by IX.br22 and located in metropolitan regions with the largest Internet traffic, allowing  rationalization of costs, better  performance, quality and  efficiency in the Internet  operation . Future  expansion IXPs coverage in Brazil may contribute to strengthen and broaden  the Internet  infrastructure in the country, besides allowing the attraction of investments for local hosting of content                                                              19 Available on www.amazoniaconectada.eb.mil.br/pt/ , access on 06/09/2017.   20 MCTIC news release on: www.mcti.gov.br/noticia/ -/asset_publisher/epbV0pr6eIS0/content/satelite -geoestacionario -vaicumprir -importante -papel -social -no-brasil -diz-ministro , access on 06/07/2017.   21 More information about this project can be found at the Brazilian Association of Technology Research Institutions  (ABIPTI) website, at: http://www.agenciacti.com.br/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=10565%3Acabo subma rino-que-conecta -brasil -e-espanha -estara -concluido -em-2019&catid=1%3Alatest -news&Itemid=190 .

State -level incentives for  installing cell towers with 3G  connectivity are an effective  alternative to increase  infrastructure coverage.  
      22  (notably CDN – Content Delivery Networks  servers )23.  IXPs also benefits competitiveness, as they converge small, medium and large -sized service providers  into neutral hubs of data transport.  It is worth mentioning that the IXP of São Paulo is already one of  the five largest in operation globally, both in volume of traffic and the number of participants.    On the issue  of the expansion of Internet networks, it is necessary to emphasize the relevance of the  use of unli censed spectrum.  A recent study24 with a 2021  projection  points out that 60 percent of  Internet traffic in Brazil should be provided by wifi networks (including those present in private and  public environments).   In recent years has widely adopted by small s ervice providers in Brazil to offer Internet access  infrastructure with Wi -Fi networks.  The adoption of Wi -Fi networks, as well as others who use  unlicensed spectrum, can boost goals of this strategy.  In this sense, Anatel has updated and simplified  regula tion25 providing specific services.   At the same time, the offer of free wifi connection in heav ily frequented public places (hospitals, bus  terminals and airports, for example) has been used as a tool for providing public services and  information , as well as a mechanism of digital inclusion.  Some initiatives have sim ilar effects on public  internet access, such as the Broadband in Schools Program.   Finally, it is worth mentioning the MCTIC’s Smart Cities Program for the deployment of fiber -optic  network infrastructure.  One of the goals of s uch networks aim is to connect g overnment agencies,  provide public Internet access points, and encourage  partnerships between local public authorities and  private institutions to provide sustainability the project . The public consultation of the project’s draft  decree was recently launched by MCTIC .                                                                  23 See http://www.adlittle.com/downloads/tx_adlreports/ADL_Libe rtyGlobal_2014_FutureOfTheInternet.pdf , access on  29/09/2017.   24 The study from Cisco VNI 2017 can be found at http://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/solutions/se rvice -provider/vni -forecast highlights.html .  25 See Anatel Resolution n. 680/2017, available on www.anatel.gov.br/legislacao/resolucoes/2017/936 -resolucao -680, access  on 1 1/10/2017.  
      23  Challenges for digital inclusion    The challenges of digital inclusion in Brazil were object of a report by the Brazilian Federal Court of Audit  (TCU) , entitled  Public  Policy for Digital Inclusion  (2015).  The report contemplates  the actions beginning  in the year 2000, and it highlights the creation , in 2002  of the E -Government and Services to Citizens  Program   (GESAC). GESAC is under shared responsibility among differen t ministries, with the purpose  to provide internet connections, mainly satellite, to telecentre s, schools  and government agencies located  in remote and international border  regions .  Other projects also mentioned in this report  include the Digital Inclusion  Program, the Connected Citizen  Project , the One Computer per Student P roject and the Telecentros.br Program.  Other highlights ar e the  Broadband for Schools Program  (PBLE), the National B roadband Program  (PNBL ), and the special tax  rule of the National Telecommunication Broadband Network Implementation Program ( REPNBL ).  The most financially important PNBL action mentioned at the report is the launching of the  Geostationary Defense and Strategic Communications Satellite  (SGDC) . Additionally, the TCU repor t  makes reference to the international negotiations for the construction of a new submarine cable  connecting Brazil and Europe , which will expand traffic capacity between the two continents, reduce  transmission costs and make data  transmission safer .  In addition, the TCU report points out the lack of digital literacy  of part of the population, as well as little  formal literacy,  as barrier s to full digital inclusion of Brazilian  society .  Finally, the TCU report draws a diagnosis for  public policy manage ment, stressing the coordination and  articulation difficulties in different government  levels : between federal government agencies somehow  related to digital inclusion, and between the  federal g overnment and the many State and municipal  bodies.   Vision   It is essential to design a clear investment plan, with short, medium and long -term goals, to achieve a  the future in which :  • All Brazilian municipalities are supplied with high -capacity transport networks;   • All municipalities have mobile broadband service, both in their municipal head and non -head   districts;   • Most of the Brazilian  population covered with fixed broadband access, with the expansion of  optical fiber access networks;   • Broadband infrastructure reaches r emote and isolated areas , providing the popula tion with  efficient connectivity and allowing the digitalization of communications and services;   • Wide spread presence of wifi networks in highly -frequented publi c places , in order to provide  public services and digital inclusion opportunities.  
      24  • Integration o f research , education, health and institutions by high -speed networks, which  include connectivity, data processing and storage, as to encourage the scientific and  technological exchange for the benefit of the society at large, especially in remote regions;   Strategic Actions   In order to achieve the intended  objectives, a series of actions are required to combine funding sources  for the telecommunications industry, meet service needs, update rules and regulations, and  implement specific public policy . The pro posal of this Strategy is to establish a plan for short, medium  and long -terms  actions , and to implement  mechanisms to fulfill the following priorities :  • Connect 22,000 public schools, both urban and rural, with high -speed broadband, either with  terrestrial or satellite network, with in the framework of the Connected Education Program .  • Enable the use of funds from different sources for the construction of data transmission and  broadband networks.   o Such sources include the financial reserves associat ed with the Conduct Adjustment  Terms – TAC ( TACs are “adjustment agreements” which convert penalties into  investment commitments ) with the telecom companies; and also the balance resulted   from adaptations in the service concession model , as stated by the G eneral  Telecommunications Law, which establishes investment goals on broadband  networks.   • Set priorities to define new investment obligations to build mobile broadband networks, and  incorporate such obligations into bidding notices for radio frequencies.   • Speed  up the  4G implementation  process using  the 700 MHz band , especially in those  municipalities which do not depend on releasing that radio band for the transition to digital  TV.  • Encourage state governments to implement tax relief policies focusing the e xtension of  coverage of mobile networks, as some states have already performed.   • Adapt the legislation concerning the Telecommunications Universalization Fund (FUST) , in  order  to enable its application in broadband expansion, both in urban areas and in rura l and  remote regions .  • Strengthen the participation of research and development centers in multilateral fora whose  mandate include the definition of international standards and frequency bands for the fift h  generation mobile telephony (5G ).  • Promote infrastr ucture  building (including connectivity, data processing and storage  features )  to integrate research, education, health, and security institutions with high -speed networks 
      25  (including the expansion of the  Giga Project26), encouraging scientific and technological  exchange for the benefit of the society at large, particularly in remote regions;   • Perform long -term investments and coordinate initiatives on data communications  infrastructure ( known as national critical infrastructure ), compu ting (e.g. high -performance  computing) and data storage, with the purpose of meeting the needs of cyberinfrastructure  for large science and technology  projects; supporting RD&I projects in those areas; and  strengthening cooperation with digital -intensive b usinesses.   Indicators   In order to  track and measure the performance and efficiency of the proposed actions committed, the  following indicators  are recommended : (1) density of fixed Internet services, (2) percentage of mobile  phone coverage ( detailed into 3 G and 4G technologies) , and (3) backhaul coverage (detailed into fiber  optic and other high -capacity technologies , for example, Radio IP).  Such data can be extracted from  Anatel data bases27, as well as the sector research es carried out by the Center for Reg ional Studies of  the Information Society ( Cetic.br )28.  It is also important to consider indicators which allow international comparison:  for instance, the ICT  Development Index (IDI)29, a global performance index developed by ITU which compiles a set of  indicators for ICT access and effective use of ICT skills.   Regarding digital inclusion, the  Economist Intelligence Unit  (EIU) has developed an international  indicator for " inclusive Internet ", based on four dimensions: availability, accessibility, relev ance  and readiness.  In the EIU ranking Inclusive Internet (2017)30, 75 countries are evaluated ; Brazil  currently ranks at the 18th position.                                                                      26 Details about Project Giga can be found at http://memoria.rnp.br/pd/giga/  and also http://www.giga.org.br/ ,  access on  12/09/2017.   27 Available on  http://www.anatel.gov.br/dados/ , access on 05/07/2017.   28 Available on http://cetic.br/ , access on 05/07/2017.   29 Available on http:// www.itu.int/net4/ITU -D/idi/2016/ , access on 05/07/2017.   30 EIU Inclusive Internet Rankings available on https://theinclu siveinternet.eiu.com/explore/countries/performance , access  on 14/09/2017.  
      26  B. Research, Development and Innovation   Stimulat ing the development of new technologies through the increase of  scientific and technological output, aiming to solve the most important  national challenges.     Information and communication technologies ( ICT) are today’s economic and social drivers.  Investment in Research, Development and Innovation (R&D+I) in this sector is key to ensure that a  country participates in the global value chains, promotes jobs, increases income levels and economic  activity, and provides its c itizens with access to information and knowledge generated globally. Given  that the digital industry  is a very dynamic  sector, it is indispensable to invest in R&D+I in order to keep  competitiveness and to take full advantage of the knowledge generated by new technologies in the  digital economy.   For a country such as Brazil , the R&D+I sector is vital to support domestic development and increase  presence in the global economy. As a growth enabler, R&D+I  is an essential element of a national  development strat egy. Brazil should rely on recent success es to establish an R&D+I policy for the 21st  century, which is aligned with advances in industry, agriculture and other  strategic sectors, and able  to fully benefit from the potential of digital technologies.   The Br azilian initiatives in R&D+I should seek an active role in the world scenario for digital  technologies, advancing in scientific production, technological development , and innovation   international rankings, particularly in the ICT sector. Furthermore, polic ies should  focus on addressing  national issues with digital technologies, increasing productivity, and economic and social  development.   Diagnosis   The R&D investment level in Brazil as a proportion of GDP , although close to some European countries,   remains much lower than in leading countries worldwide . Figure 9  shows that this indicator in Brazil is  1.27%, the average in the European Union is 1.95%, and 2.39% for OECD countries. Leading countries   typically score this indicator above 3.5%, such as t he Republic of Korea (4.28%), Israel (4.27%) and  Japan (3.58%).

Data from PINTEC ( years 2012  to 2014) show that the most access ed government innovation support  instrument in the ICT sector was the financing program for machines and equipment acquisition (37%  of innovative  companies utilized this instrument), followed by R&D incentives of the Lei do Bem  (27%).   Within the ICT industry, the more utilized instrument was Lei de Informática  (51%  of innovating  businesses ), followed  by financing program for machines and equipment acquisition (47%). In ICT  services , financing for the purchase of machines a nd equipment (34 %) and Lei do Bem (2 6%) were the  top adopted instruments . See Figure 12 for more details .  One public initiative for innovation support which is increasingly adopted in many countries is the  public acquisition or government purchases  instruments, by which the purchasing power of the state  is used as leverage to stimulate R&D+I activities , with a final goal to increase social and economic  development. In Brazil , the adoption of such instrument is still very low . PINTEC has ma pped the  number of businesses enrolling  on government acquisition programs: the proportion of ICT businesses  that performed some kind of innovation under such programs (25% of companies, mainly in ICT and  telecommunication services) was higher than the national average (15%). In contrast , that proportion  was only 2% among ICT industry (manufacturing businesses) .                                                               36 Laws nº 10.664/2003 e 11.077/2004.   37 Law nº 11.196/2005.   Instruments that promote investment        in R&D+I can be better coordinated         and geared towards the solution of  specific national challenges.

Despite  the amount  of important innovation support instruments available in Brazil, the most recent  edition of Innovation Research also shows the barriers mentioned by businesses that did not invest in  innovation: high costs (58.4% of all businesses  and 61.3% in  the ICT sec tor), economic risk  to innovate  (50.4% of all businesses and 42% in the ICT sector), lack of appropriate financing for innovation (41.1%  of all businesses, 39.2% in the ICT sector), lack of qualified personnel (29.8% of all businesses , 30.1%  in the ICT sec tor), and few cooperation opportunities with other businesses or research institutions  (20% of all businesses , and 21.5% in the ICT sector).   Human resources are of great importance to research,  development and innovation activities, particularly in a  dynam ic and  knowledge intensive sector such as ICT .  According to data from PINTEC/IBGE for the period 2012 2014, ICT sector businesses employed 6, 417 researchers  and technicians in R&D activities. This represents 6% of  the total workforce employed in R&D by all  companies in  the country.    As mentioned  before , 30% of businesses with no innovation activities pointed out  the lack of qualified  personnel as highly relevant barrier . The absence of qualified human resources for R&D+I activity is a  particularly crucial  weakness for businesses in the ICT services segment. In this group , 36% of  businesses that did not invest in innovation mentioned identified this reason as a highly important 27,4 21,2 9,314,8 8,636,8 14,633,350,9 19,918,9 19,046,6 2,126,0 14,1 6,813,8 6,234,5 17,5 0,010,020,030,040,050,060,0 Lei do Bem Lei de Informática Subvenção EconômicaFinanciamento à P&D sem parceria com universidadesFinanciamento à P&D com parceria com universidadesFinanciamento a compra de máquinas e equipamentosCompra pública Setor de TICs Indústria de TICs Serviços de TICs The State ability  to induce  R&D+I activi ty is an  instrument that can be  more intensely used in  Brazil.

      32  issue .  In fact, the ongoing industry and services  transformation in the digital economy has  significantly changed the required skills and  qualification for professiona ls, not only in  the ICT sector but also in other sectors in  economy. Applications in microelectronics,  automation, computing and platforms, and  the massive volume of dat a generated at  increasing speed , it all had imposed on  businesses and governments a demand for  new skills in the workforce. This new type of  professional must have enough qualifications deal with the management and analysis of large volumes  of information and data (also known as big data ), which are key competences to ensure competitive  advantages.    Many countries are dedicated to develop and train such kind of professional . For example, the National  Science Foundation announced in 2012 a new program to su pport training of data professionals, while  giving assistance to universities and research centers to develop interdisciplinary graduate programs  for students in this area. This means that even those countries included in the world digital economy  value ch ain are in risk of a specialized professional shortage. Recent studies have mentioned that the  United States will face a deficiency of 140,000 to 190,000 data analysts , and of up to 1.5 million  professionals capable of making decisions base d on big data  by 2018 .38  Brazil has a vigorous  higher education and  research system. Statistics from the INEP  higher education census of 2016 reveal that  the country has 195 universities, 149 higher  education centers, and 40 federal technology  and professional education institutes. There  is also a relevant educational system for labor  and professional skills , notably the National  Industrial Apprenticeship Service (SENAI), which offers professional educationa l and industrial skills, as  well as provides technical assistance to industry.   Most of these institutions are connected with high -speed data networks and other connectivity  services provided by the National Teaching and Research Ne twork (RNP), an organization incorporated  to the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications  (MCTIC) .  This infrastructure provided by RNP has a positive impact on scientific output, national and  international research collaboration, knowledge dissemination, and in offeri ng online courses.                                                              38 Available at: http://www.mckinsey.com/business -functions/digital -mckinsey/our -insights/big -data -the-next -frontier -forinnovation , viewed on 06/07/2017.   Confidence building measures for the  private sector can be reinforced with  predictability of po licies and programs  in the R&D+I sector. Further  improvements in the legal framework  for R&D+I are necessary in order to  ensure and expand investments in  R&D+I activities in ICT.  Technical training and workforce skills  development remain as challenges to  make the Brazilian ICT sector more  competitive internationally.  
      33  Currently , the RNP network connects 739 campuses of universities and fed eral institutes .   With regard to research facilities, a study b y IPEA39 in  2012 identified 1.760 facilities40 devoted to research  and education , of which 14% are specifically  dedicated to ICT research. According to the study,  these facilities are located within 143 institutions and  availabl e to 7.090 researchers (an average of four   researchers per facility ). Nonetheless , 60% of such  facilities hold up to R$ 500 thousand  in total assets  (equipment and other resources)41. This indicates  that a significant part of the country’s research  infrastr ucture is small, fragmented and  unarticulated , unable to build up the scalability  required to provide high -impact, competitive , new  generation R&D+I in digital technology.   Despite such findings, it is important to note that  Brazil presents some very good examples of large scale research infrastructures , which are network  connected and well ranked in international scientific production. This is  the case of the National  Research Center for Energy and Materials  (CNPEM), the research units of the Brazilian Agr icultural  Research  Company (Embrapa), the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (Fiocruz), and the integration and testing  laboratory of the Space Research National Institute  (LIT/Inpe).   Some noteworthy examples of the ICT research infrastructure are the National Scientific Computing  Laboratory (LNCC)  – where the supercomputer Santos Dumont is the central node (Tier -0) of the   National High -Performance Data Processing System (SINAPAD); the Telecommunication Research and  Development Center  (CPqD), the Cybe rnetic Defense Center (CDCiber), and the  National  Telecommunication Institute  (Inatel).   This infrastructure has in fact , over the last few decades ,   provided the basis fo r a prominent international status  of national scientific production. In absolute numbers,  between 2007 and 2016, the number of papers  published by Brazilian researchers in internationally  indexed periodicals has grown 88% (from 36.573 to  68.908  yearly ). During this period, the country remained  in 14th position in the rankings of world scientific production, accounting for 2.1% of total production.                                                              39 DE NEGRI, Fernanda; SQUEFF, Flávia de H.S., org.

Available in Portuguese at:   http://www.ipea.gov.br/portal/images/stories/PDFs/livros/livros/livro_sistemas_setoriais.pdf .  40 Research facilities includes laboratories, specialize d libraries, observatories, experimental stations, high speed networks,  telescopes, research vehicles and vessels, etc. (DE NEGRI e SQUEFF, op.cit., 2016:17).   41Cf. DE NEGRI e SQUEFF, op.cit., 2016.   We need better coordination  among ICT research facilities  throughout the country.   Infrastructure development for  research labs and teaching  facilities are an important  driver in increasing network  connectivity in many areas of  the country. Currently there  are 739 univ ersity campuses  and federal ins titutes  connected via high speed  networks in Brazil.  
      34  However, patent requests in Brazil did not grow in the same rate . Between 2007 and 2016, the number  of patent requests to the National Institute of Industrial Property – INPI (the Brazilian patent office)  went from 21.638 to 28.009 (29% growth during the period, with a peak of 30.876 in 2013). One  positive fact is that the 5,199 patent requests  from residents in 2016 represented a 12% growth in  comparison with the previous year , and it was the highest amount since 200742.  FIGURE 13: PUBLISHED ARTICLES , PATENT REQUESTS  (INPI)  BY RESIDENTS AND NON -RESIDENTS , BRAZIL (2007 -2016)     Sources : SJR SCImago Journal & Country Rank, INPI Assessoria de Assuntos Econômicos, BADEPI v4.0.     Such numbers reflect a big gap between scientific and technological production in Brazil, resulted from  many interdependent factors that must be appropriately addressed. These factors  include the  existence of a sign ificant backlog  of pending patent analysis. Th e government has recently  implemented a number of measures to improve the struc ture and management of  INPI43.  In technologically dynamic sectors , such as ICT, obsolescence cycles are shorter and faster, and  agility  in patent processing is vital. ICT are among the types of technology  with the most patents published in  Brazil during 2016, which includes electrical and ele ctronic devices and technology  (representing 4.7%  of all patents that year).  For this reason , INPI has expanded its pilot projects  network of Patent  Prosecution Highway  (PPH) to include ICT, as it was done in Japan and China, which shou ld greatly  increase the speed in patents processing for new ICT technologies in Brazil.                                                               42 Source: “Indicadores de Propriedade Industrial 2017”, IN PI.

      35  Along with the issues highlighted in this section, other measures can contribute to stimulate the  involvement of businesses in technologi cal development and innovation. One example is c onfidence  building in the business environment , which includes simplifying laws and norms, ensuing continuity  of government support progr ams, stimulating  public -private partnerships , and making ownership of  intellectual property more clear and simple . For this purpose, a very positive step was the approval of  an Executive Decree (no. 9,283/18), applied to the I nnovation Law (Law 13,243/2016 ).  Vision   Actions related to R&D+I in this Brazilian Strategy for Digital Transformation – E-Digital must be  immersed in a prospective methodology  which defines technological choices that can generate jobs  and increase general income, productivity and competitiveness of the industry and services sector s.  They must also ensure that Brazilian businesses take part in global value chains. Relevant tools to  determine choice in with this type of methodology  include foresight and forecasting, consulting  experts (Delphi, panels and surveys), scenarios mapping and technological roadmaps.   Regarding  specifically the ICT sector, it is important that E-Digital establishes priorities  on research,  development and innovation to stimulate and modernize t he national production structure. According  to the  National Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation 2016 -2022  (ENCTI)44, “enabling  technologies are those with potential impa ct on the manufacturing industry , particularly the  convergent technolo gies ( e.g., biotechnology, nano technology and ICT ), as well as additive  manufacturing and advanced materials ”. Furthermore, ENCTI stresses the critical necessity of  developing and modernizing  existing technologies such as sensors, networks, high performance  comp uters, communication protocols and software. They provide the basis for new ICT applications  ICT, for instance, the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and Cloud Computing.   To this end, E -Digital must encourage R&D+I initiatives and develop production structures in  microelectronics ( namely capacity -building in design houses), sensors, automation and robotics ,  supercomputers, artificial intelligence, big data and analytics, high performance networks,  cryptography , 5G networks, and cloud computing.   Furthermore, bearing in mind the diagnosis  in this chapter , the strategic actions in R&D+I for ICT must  aim at:   • Optimizing policies to expand private investment in R&D+I in ICT, as to improve  competitiveness of Brazilian eco nomy, generate jobs and promote social development.   • Articulating R&D+I promotion instruments, including budget managing , by int egrating projects   and research facilities in the ICT sector.   • Broadening the role public policies  focusing demand , including gove rnment purchases in ICT  and other technologies in strategic areas, as a way to promote R&D+I activity.                                                               44 Available at: http://www.mct ic.gov.br/publicacoes , accessed on 25/07/2017.  
      36  • Connecting research institutes in all regions  in Brazil  with high -speed data networks, in order  to foster scientific and technological exchange, while al so extending the coverage of  broadband network  throughout the country.   • Establishing a technological roadmap for research, development and innovation in  cyberinfrastructure, with long term investment goals , able to meet the private sector demand  in ICT.  • Intensifying c apacity -building  in order to meet the challenges presented by new ICT  technolo gies ( e.g., big data, m anufacture  4.0, artificial intelligence and internet of things ).   • Promoting an enabling environment for R&D+I investments in ICT by the priva te sector, along  with increased interaction between universities, research centers and businesses .  Strategic Actions   While enabling ICT technologies can provide the elements to modernize and expand national  production, strategic actions in R&D+I must also identify  choices in specific sectors. Thus, it is essential  to define as  a priority the investment on areas in which experimental ICT innovation and development  may increase competitiveness, such as:   • Security and defense:  development of platforms that ensure interoperability and co ordination  between command and  control systems of the armed forces, with emphasis on radio  communication technologies. It is important to e ngage the private sector in the development  of communication protocols, cryptography an d security equipment.   • Health : in particular, to implement actions directed to digitalize  health records through public  technology purchase contracts for the public health  system, and to improve communication  tools between citizens and health service provid ers using data analytics  and t elemedicine .  Such actions may include use of RNP services and networks, for instance, the RUTE  telemedicine network and the SIBRATEC network.   • Agribusiness,  especially technologies rela ted to precision agriculture, unma nned aer ial  vehicles (UAV) , remote sensing and agribusiness data management.   • Smart cities , through the use of Internet of Things (IoT)  related technologies , particularly in the  fields of urban mobility, security and utility smart grids  (electric power, water and sewage,  etc.), among others.   Furthermore, it is important to implement actions aiming :  • To integrate  instruments of R&D+I promotion, as well as research facilities devoted to the  development of digital technology, using technology hubs and testbeds  of innovative  technologies, in order to ensure scale and a strategic approach in technology development.   • To develop  prospective scenarios for R&D+I priorities that could increase employment,  income, productivity and competitiveness , using methodologies such a s foresighting  and 
      37  forecasting , consulting experts (Delphi, panels and surveys), and/or building scenar ios and  technological roadmaps.   • To utilize the purchasing power of the State to foster the development of innovative solutions  based on digital technolog ies.  • To improve legislation and the regulatory framework – such as the Lei de Informática  and Lei  do Bem  – in order to make R&D+I  support programs more predictable and reliable .   • To stimulate interaction between universities, research institutes and businesses in digital  technology R&D+I, through support programs such as  RHAE scholarships  (Strategic Human  Resources Training Program ),  as well as startup incubators, technological parks and other  innovation environments.   • To ensure permanent dialogue be tween government, academia and industry, as means to  obtain coordination and convergence of these strategic actions within the scope of E -Digital.   • To expand scientific and technological partnerships with other countries, with extensive use  of joint calls f or international cooperation projects in R&D+I.   • To strengthen  governmental science and technology research institutes, in order to increase  performance and information sharing.   • To support R&D+I projects in new digital technologies that have been identified as key  enablers, with a focus on technology hubs , utilizing funds made available as a result of the  revision of the Lei de Informática (MPV 810/201745).  Indicators   • Traditional indicators of R&D+I for the evaluation of the overall performance in national  economy (e. g., level of investment vs. GDP,  level of investment in a sector compared to total  investment , technical qualification  levels , etc.), as well as indicators  for specific cases  (business ) or business sectors.   • Indicators based on acknowledged international benchmarks , particularly those providing  comparisons with other countries with relevance in the ICT sector (e.g.,  Korea, China and  Japan) or on specific R&D +I indicators (e.g, Finland, Sweden and Israel).   Other existing recognized international indicators  may be used as reference , such as the Global  Innovation Index ,46 in which Brazil appears in 69th on the rankings for 2016 and 2017.                                                                  45 http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_Ato2015 -2018/2017/Mpv/mpv810.htm .

      38  C. Building Trust and Confidence in  the Digital Environment   Making the Internet a safe and reliable environment that enables services  and business transactions while respecting citizens’ rights.     The Internet is still regarded by many as a separate dimension of our everyday lif e. The expression “to  go online” is still of common usage.  However, the growing volume of business transactions, financial  operations and public services provided online tend to make this phrase a thing of the past.   The expansion of the digital environmen t translates into enormous opportunities for economic  development, social inclusion and technological innovation.  It also affects the exercise of fundamental  rights. On one hand, digital technologies may act as facilitators of the implementation of such ri ghts  (for example, the Internet may serve as a means for citizens to express their thoughts and opinions);  on  the other hand, it may also represent risks (such as the use of digital tools to unduly expose the privacy  and intimacy of third parties).    In thi s context of opportunities and challenges, coordinated action between governmental and private  agents is necessary to mitigate risks and to ensure the continued development of the digital  economy.  This notion, present in most digital strategies worldwide, can be translated as the idea of  building trust and confidence in the digital environment.   Ensuring that users and the private sector feel confident to develop their activities in the digital  environment is a complex task, involving different dimensions of  State action, here grouped into broad  categories of (1) protection of rights and of privacy; and (2) safety and security in the digital  environment.      1. PROTECTION OF RIGHTS  AND PRIVACY   Diagnosis   The protection of rights in the digital environment is crucia l to build trust and confidence.  It is not  enough for companies and individuals to feel secure from cyberattacks and security incidents;  it is also  necessary to envisage the digital environment as a space in which human rights are fully  protected.  Therefor e, new technologies must be directed towards the protection of rights and  promotion of the public interest.   In Brazil, there are important legislative guidelines on the subject.  The Brazilian Civil Rights Framework  for the Internet – Law n. 12 ,965/ 2014 , known as “Marco Civil da Internet” or the Internet Bill of Rights 
      39  – provides principles, guarantees, rights and duties, but does not exhaust the subject, leaving room for  future regulation  of important aspects related to the Internet, such as personal da ta protection, e commerce, cybercrimes, copyright, Internet governance, digital citizenship, among others.   The first and most fundamental dimension is that of human rights.  Freedom of speech,  communication, expression and association, the right to access i nformation and the right not to be  discriminated, must be embedded in the architecture and governance of the Internet.  Violations of  these freedoms and rights by the State, by businesses and even by other users need to be monitored  and repelled.  The Marco Civil clearly states, in its first two chapters, the commitment of the Brazilian  legal system towards the protection of human rights on the Internet.   Ensuring the right to privacy and to personal data protection is a particularly relevant topic for Brazil,   given the intense participation of Brazilians in social networks, instant messaging applications, internet  banking and e -commerce platforms . The Marco Civil  already brings an important set of provisions on  privacy and personal data, ensuring certain right s, in particular the need for user consent for collection,  treatment and transfer of personal data;  the right to clear and complete information about personal  data treatment;  and the free provision of this consent, except in the cases of mandatory log rete ntion,  as provided for in the Law.   In any case, the need for further legislation to complement the provisions of the Marco Civil is widely  recognized.  Among the points to be addressed are further clarification of governmental  responsibilities related to la w enforcement, as well as broader rules on the use and treatment of  personal data, encompassing both the public and the private sectors, throughout different economic  activities. Future legislation on this issue should allow for the rational use of informa tion, as well as for  the protection of citizens’ personal data.   Currently, over 100 countries, both from the developed and from the developing world, in different  continents, have specific legislation on the subject.  Different approaches have been adopted  throughout the world, with different legal and economic impacts47.  Brazil, for the time being, does not  have a law to comprehensively regulate the protection of personal data.   In a globalized and interconnected market, large volumes of data flow across na tional borders in a  continuous stream of long and complex value chains.  The importance of free flow of data  is recognized  by leading countries in the digital economy48 and by international organizations.  The Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), for instance, considers that this data -driven  technological ecosystem will be one of the engines of eco nomic growth in the 21st century49. The  organization ha s dedicated efforts towards the discussion of the theme since the beginning of 1980,  when it drew up the recommendations of the  Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder                                                              47 For an overview of different data protection models and a debate about their impact, see a study by UNCTAD entitled  “Data protection regulations and international data flows: Implications for trade and development” , available at  http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/dtlstict2016d1_en.pdf , acc essed on 10/11/2017.   48 An insight on the concepts and main questions in this subject may be found at https ://ec.europa.eu/digital -single market/en/news/staff -working -document -free-flow -data -and-emerging -issues -european -data -economy , accesed on  10/11/2017.   49 More details on http://ww w.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/data -driven -innovation.htm , accessed on 10/11/2017.  
      40  Flows of Personal Data50,  subsequently updated in 201351.    It is, therefore, desirable for Brazil to establish a specific legal framework regarding personal data,  protecting citizens' rights and conferring legal certainty for investments in the digital  economy.  Personal data is currently ruled by several legal pro visions, including the Consumer Defense  Code (articles 43 and 44 of Law 8,078/1990), which protects the personal information of  consumers;  the Law on Access to Public Information (article 31 of law n. 12,527/2011), which protects  personal data in the conte xt of governmental transparency obligations;  the Consumer Database Credit  Scoring  Law (Law n° 12,414/2011), which safeguards personal data within the framework of credit  analysis ; among others.  The Marco Civil (article 3, sections II and III, and article 7  of the law n°  12,965/2014) also ensures the protection of privacy and personal data protection.   There are sensitive issues related to consumer rights and consumer relations involving the use of digital  technologies.  Consumer protection issues, such as con fidence in transactions, corporate  accountability, transparency of contractual terms, transnationality, treatment of consumer complaints  (exchanges, cancellations, complaints) and many others, assume complex dimensions in the digital                                                              50 Available on:  http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/oec dguidelinesontheprotectionofprivacyandtransborderflowsofpersonaldata.htm ,  accessed on 10/11/2017.   51 Available on http://www.oecd.org/internet/ieconomy/privacy -guidelines.htm , accessed on 10/11/2017.  Digital Certification   In Brazil, digital certification was officially introduced with the creation of the Public Keys  Infrastructure (“Infraestrutura de Chaves Pública s - ICP-Brasil”) , by means of the Provisional  Measure 2.200 -2/2001. Today the country has approxi mately 7 million active digital certificates, 61%  owned by legal organizations and 39% by natural persons. In the context of ICP -Brasil, there are  currently 76 certifying authorities, 614 registration authorities and 8 timestamping authorities.   The Digital  Certificate is an electronic document, that uses a cryptographic key and a specific  standard (X.509) containing the owners ’ data and guaranteeing their identity, thus ensuring  confidentiality, authenticity and endorsement of any signed electronic transact ions, as well as the  exchange of information with integrity, confidentiality and security.   The first application to widely use digital certificates was the Brazilian Payment System (“Sistema de  Pagamentos Brasileiro – SPB”), under coordination of the Brazi lian Central Bank. The Brazilian  Secretariat of Federal Revenue was a pioneer in adopting digital certificates in the provision of online  services to citizens, such as the Virtual Citizen Information Service (“ Centro de Atendimento Virtual  e-CAC ”, the Publ ic System for Digital Bookkeeping (“ Sistema Público de Escrituração Digital –  SPED”) and the Electronic Tax Invoice (“ Nota Fiscal Eletrônica  – NF-e”). In the Judicial Branch  digital certification is also widely  available , especially in electronic filing, a vailable at the Federal  Supreme Court, the Superior Justice Court and at several other courts nationwide.   New technologies such as blockchain and advanced biometric identification promise a large range of  applications in this field and are already being te sted, including with in the Federal Government .  However, up to this point in time, digital certificates are still the only technology that have the  essential a ttribute of legal validity in the country.    
      41  environment.   Legal unc ertainties related to the so -called collaborative economy also make the situation more  complex, since innovative business models frequently raise questions related to the applicable legal  framework and jurisdiction. This should not, however, imply a dimini shed level of consumer  protection, especially in face of large platforms and  marketplaces .  The protection of children and teenagers in the digital environment is also a topic that requires  attention, since the Internet and other digital technologies offer risks to their security and  privacy.   Brazil already has legislation and  specialized enforcement  units to fight serious crimes like  pedophilia, but it is necessary to curb other threats, such as abusive advertising directed at children  and teenagers and mi suse of their personal data.   There are also a number of other dimensions in which it is necessary to determine more clearly how  the protection of rights will occur in the digital environment.  The debate around algorithms and  automated decisions is an impor tant example.  The understanding that individuals have the right to  know which parameters direct the operation of a particular algorithm that can have impacts on their  personal lives is becoming more consolidated, along with the possibility of appeal to a h uman decision  in more serious cases.   New themes such as algorithmic transparency, artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things will  require governmental capacity for innovation, with a view to ensuring citizen protection without  inhibiting innovation  and the beneficial use of new technologies.   Vision   The protection of human rights in the digital environment must be ensured through the development  of mechanisms for institutional cooperation between public institutions and through partnerships with  mark et agents.  There is a long list of rights guaranteed by the Federal Constitution, by international  treaties of which Brazil is a signatory the and, more specifically, by  the Marco Civil , fully applicable to  cyberspace.  Proactive engagement of public author ities and large private Internet agents is necessary  to ensure their application.   The guarantee of privacy, on the other hand, still depends on progress in the normative and  institutional fields.  The adoption of a law on personal data protection and the cr eation or designation  of a national authority for its application are essential measures to avoid the abusive use of Internet  users’ personal data.   It is also necessary to introduce and stimulate the voluntary adoption of international standards  of privacy  by design and default an d security by design and default52, both in the production of national                                                              52 The concepts of privacy/security by design and default imply that minimal standards for privacy and protection and  information security on digital products and services must be applied since the product or service conception (“by d esign”)  and automatically applied without any configuration or indication required by the user (“by default”).

      42  technology  as well as in the purchase of hardware, software and applications.   In the field of consumer law, the challenge is to improve the mechanisms of consumer protection in  the digital environment.  It is necessary to discuss the specific characteristics of rights such as access to  information, transparency, accountability, and dispute resolution in the digital environment.   All of the abovementioned effo rts must have a special focus on the protection of children and  teenagers online, through specific and more protective regulations for this group.  Institutional  cooperation and educational campaigns are also important instruments for the effective protecti on of  children and teenagers.   Finally, it is essential to open a broad debate on new digital technologies and the protection of rights  in the digital environment, with a view to assessing the legal and ethical implications of artificial  intelligence applic ations, Internet of Things and other industries close to the technological frontier.   Strategic Actions   • To p romote the approval of a specific law on personal data protection.   • To stimulate cooperation mechanisms and partnership between public institutions an d market  agents with a view to the protection of human rights online, with special attention to the rights  of children and teenagers, in order to ensure the principles laid out in the “Marco Civil da  Internet” and in the Federal Constitution.   • To strengthen  international cooperation instruments between authorities and between access  and content providers operating in different countries, in order to ensure the application of  the law in the digital environment.   • To create or designate a national authority comp etent in the field of personal data protection  and international data flows, able to standardize best practices and ensure the application of  the law.   • To d isseminate the adoption of digital technologies in the validation of transactions and  electronic docu ments produced in the digital environment.   • To stimulate the definition and adoption of standards and certification of  privacy by design  and  default  and security by design and default .  • To u nderstand and adapt to the specific characteristics of consumer rela tions in the digital  environment, seeking flexibility for new business models and adequate consumer protection.    
      43  2. DEFENSE AND SECURITY IN THE DIGITAL ENVIRONMENT   Diagnosis   The data presented in the previous Chapter  (“Infrastructure and Access to Information and  Communic ation Technologies”) reveals that Internet  access levels are on the rise in Brazil.  According to  ANATEL, fixed broadband is present in 40% of the  households, the 3G network covers 95% of the  population and the 4G network covers 72% of the  population.  The i ndicators are positive, but increased  access rates and larger adoption of digital technologies  also increase the chances of cyber security incidents and  the vulnerability of the network.   Brazil has made progress in the area of cyber defense in  recent years . The creation of the Cyber Defense Center  and Cyber Defense Command, specialized units linked to  the Brazilian Army, and the prioritization of the topic in  the context of the National D efen se Strategy53 are  important milestones.  The continuity of investmen ts in  this field, including research and development, and the  training of qualified human resources are critical to  national defense.   Most of the threats in cyberspace, however, consists of  illicit actions aimed at obtaining undue advantages  through the ex ploitation of security breaches  in software and devices.  Cybercrimes bring huge losses54  for the economy.  There are no reliable statistics about  the financial impact of cy bercrimes on Brazilian  companies or about the volume of their investment in  cyber security, although several international studies mention Brazil as one of the largest targets and  sources of attacks.   Brazil occupies an intermediate position in the Global C ybersecurity Index55 of the International                                                              53 Available on: http://www.defesa.gov.br/arquivos/estado_e_defesa/END -PND_Optimized.pdf , accessed on 06/07/2017.   54 The global cost of digital illicit activities is estimated by the company McAfee from US$ 400 billion to US$ 600 billion,  although there are even higher estimates by other expert consultants.

National Policy for Information  Security   The Federal Government, under the  leadership of the Office of Institutional  Security (GSI), is finalizing the formulation  of the National Information Security  Policy (PNSI) in the form of a bill to be  presented to the National Congress. The  PNSI focuses on cyber security by the  dimension o f information security  management and recognizes the  economic and social value of information  in a data economy.   The policy is openly guided by respect for  human rights and b y the emphasis on  coordination  between federal and local  governments , partnership s between  state and private agents, international  cooperation and prevention and  education practices to promote greater  security in the digital environment.    
      44  Telecommunications Union (ITU), ranking 38th in a list of more than one hundred countries.  ITU’s  analysis considers several aspects, such as legal measures, sector regulation, organizational structures  for response to incidents, capacity building and the existence of governmental agencies  dedicated to  information security.   The ITU classifies countries into three broad categories related to the strength of  cybersecurity:  initiating stage , maturing  stage and  leading  stage .  Brazil  is in the intermediate group,  since the country already has practical experience and a developing institutional architecture: there is  criminal and  compliance legislation , an incident response structure (CERT CSIRT etc.) and Government  agen cies that  deal with the subject.   However, the detailed assessment of the elements that make up the index demonstrates that there  are still major challenges to overcome.  Despite recent advances, the country still needs to improve its  regulatory and institut ional framework to be equal to the challenges of digitalization of society and  economy.   Vision   The continuous expansion of Internet access, the higher digitization of economy and the rapid growth  of the Internet of Things increase the points of vulnerabili ty and make the threats to cybersecurity and  cyber defense more complex.  The issue should, therefore, be regarded as a national priority.   Brazil has been treading a successful path in this area, but it is necessary to overcome some challenges  that could di srupt this trend.  Firstly, it is important to mention the need for a broad review and  integration of legislation aimed at combatting cybercrime.  Sparse and disconnected norms weaken the  States’ capacity for action and make the legal framework more opaque t o users and private agents.   It is also necessary to invest in specialized human resources training and in the capacity for research,  development and innovation in cyber security and cyber defense, in order to promote national  technological autonomy in this  sector.  Efforts should be made towards the development of dual -use  technology and knowledge, i.e. technology that can be used for both peaceful and military aims.  The  State should use its purchasing power to leverage the private sector in this field and d irectly promote  basic research and technological development.   The biggest challenge, however, is the establishment of an appropriate institutional structure.   It is  important for Brazil to formulate a comprehensive national strategy for cyber security and defense, as  well as mobilization plans for the different levels and spheres of Government.  The strategy should  devote special attention to the protection of national critical infrastructure, both to the infrastructure  directly related  to the operation of t he Internet (servers, traffic exchange points,  data centers ), as well  as to other critical sectors (electricity, water, oil and gas, basic industry etc.).   To ensure the successful implementation of this strategy, create expertise within the government, and   increase the general level of alert and readiness in the country, it is also essential to rely on  a specialized body within the public administration.  This institution will have the central task of  promot ing wide cooperation between the public and private  sectors – including for the protection of 
      45  critical infrastructure – a factor that is crucial for the effectiveness  of the actions envisaged in the  strategy and action plans.   To measure the success of the country in the areas of cyber defense and cybersecu rity, and also to  calculate the cost of failure, public authorities and the private sector should also unite to produce  reliable statistics and data on vulnerabilities and on the economic costs of  cybercrimes in  Brazil.  Appropriate metrics and information -sharing models can be developed through international  cooperation with pioneer countries in this sector.   In the universe of cybersecurity, the limits of national jurisdiction are constantly challenged by attacks  and transnational threats.  International coo peration is therefore crucial for the effective prevention of  and response to cybercrimes.  In addition to the signing of multilateral or bilateral cooperation  instruments, the exchange of strategic information and the exchange of human resources between  agencies are important steps for coordinated work between agencies from different countries.   The ultimate goal should be to improve the relative position of the country in international indicators  related to cybersecurity and to demonstrate that the Brazilia n State is prepared to face the challenge  of defending its sovereignty and enforcing law in the digital environment.   Strategic Actions   • To d evelop a national cybersecurity policy, including  the definition of a specialized body at  federal level responsible for the articulation of a national cybersecurity system and for the  relationship with the private sector.   • To c onsolidate the legal framework related to cybersecurity, harmonizing the existing legal  provisions and providing for new investigative instruments  related to the digital world.   • To e stablish national and subnational plans for prevention, incident response and mitigation  of cyber threats, including in the context of critical infrastructures.   • To e stablish cooperation mechanisms between governmental ent ities, federated entities and  the private sector with a view to the adoption of best practices, information sharing, adoption  of appropriate standards of safety, incident response coordination and  critical infrastructure  protection.   • To provide training for  public agents in security and cyber risks mitigation and develop  partnerships for training of human resources in the private sector.   • To implement broad educational campaigns to raise the awareness of the population on the  theme of information security.   • To provide specialized training of human resources and invest in research and development in  the area of cyber defense and cybersecurity, with a view to promoting national technological  autonomy in terms of skills and products.  
      46  • To str engthen international co operation instruments between authorities and between access  and content providers operating in different countries, in order to ensure the application of  the law in the digital environment, especially in cases where the transnational character of  the crim es and cyber threats force the involvement of more than one jurisdiction.    Indicators   • ITU Cybersecurity Global Index56.  • Public -private cooperation for the construction of reliable indicators on the number, nature  and cost of cyberattacks and cyber incidents, focusing on national indicators (CETIC and  CERT.br) and seeking international comparability between countries.                                                                    56 Available on https://www.itu.int/en/ITU -D/Cybersecurity/Pages/GCI -2017.aspx   Accessed on 12/07/2017.  
      47  D. Education and professional qualification   Qualifying society for the digital world, with new skills and advanced  technologies, and preparing people for the labor market of the future.     Digital education be increasingly become an important step for the exercise of citizenship and a  precondition for successful professional activities.  Citizens’ capacity for self -determination and critic al  judgement in the digital world – at work, in virtual communities, as consumers and as citizens – will  depend on a critical and well oriented digital education.   The provision of high -quality education is vital for socioeconomic development and for the pr osperity  and competitiveness of Brazil in regards to other countries.  The importance of education in the digital  age requires a proactive and decisive attitude of the Government, the private sector and society on  the subject.   Several countries worldwide ha ve faced large educational challenges in a strategic manner, and now  reap the benefits of having elevated education to a national priority.  Currently, digital technologies  have a dual role in the subject of education: they provide new ways to educate and l earn, and they are  an essential component for the leap in quality that the country requires, if employed in a coordinated  manner, exploring  all the potential they have to offer.   For Brazil to reach international levels of quality of education and to enter the circle of the world's  most dynamic economies, exploring its social and economic potential, two priorities should be  established for the field of education and professional training:   • Improve the quality of education through broad access to digital conte nt and technologies,  with ongoing training and support to teachers and students;  and  • Facilitate employability, the insertion in the labor market, the opening of new job  opportunities and entrepreneurial abilities in the digital age.   The education of the fu ture will occur throughout life (lifelong learning ) and continuing education will  play a central role in the life of an increasing number of people.  Educational policies for the digital  environment will play a relevant role in reducing inequalities related  to the access and use of digital  technologies.    Access to jobs, the exercise of citizenship and entrepreneurship will increasingly depend on  appropriate digital skills, ranging from basic digital literacy to the acquisition of specific skills for the  most  dynamic technological sectors.  Furthermore, many of the jobs and careers in the next ten years  will depend on knowledge and skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM Skills),  and virtually all professions will require ICT literacy.    Principles for an effective Educational Technology Policy  
      48  National and international studies highlight that, for the use of ICT to have a positive effect on  education, the implementation of programs and policies must observe and keep in balance four  dimen sions of the use of technologies.  This approach is based on a theory called "Four in Balance"  developed by Kennisnet Studies Center of Holland57.    Source: CIEB58  These studies also highlight that effective policies regarding the use of ICT in education must comply  with certain lessons learned from national and international experiences:   • The policy must be clear, with definition of short, medium and long term goals,  covering all  levels of Government (National, State and municipal).   • The policy should be updated periodically, including the strategies and goals.   • The policy must be coordinated with the various actors involved, providing for cooperation  between the federa tive entities.   • Each actor responsible for implementing the policy must have a clear vision about its role and  the goals to be met.   Managers, professionals and policymakers should also keep in mind that technology should not be  employed in education in the hope of short -term results in students' learning through standardized  tests.  Technology may contribute to the improvement of learning.  It may also produce impact s on                                                              57 Further information : https://en.wikipedia.org/w iki/Kennisnet  and https://www.kennisnet.nl/about -us/, accessed on  30/06/2017.   58 Available on: www.cieb.net.br/wp -content/uploads/2016/12/CIEB -Estudos -4-Politicas -de-Tecnologia -na-Educacao Brasileira.pdf , accessed on 30/06/2017.   
      49  other  important factors, such as:   • Improving the efficiency of school management.   • Better preparation of students for the labor market.   • Facilitating access to content and professionals of high quality, especially in isolated areas or  areas with low population density.   • Offering better opportunities to students with physical disabilities, such as  limitations in vision,  hearing or mobility.   However, the use of technology in the educational environment should occur gradually, in a negotiated  manner and according to certain levels of maturity, in order to avoid adverse effects, contrary to the  desire d goals: for example, worsening of results of traditional teaching methods, dispersion of  students, increase in the level of conflict or of school evasion rates.   Diagnosis   As mentioned, Brazil has historical experience in innovation and educational technol ogy.  However, the  policy currently in place is still the 2007 reformulation of the ProInfo Program, drawn up originally in  1997.  Twenty years after the publication of the first version of this policy, it is necessary to devise new  initiatives adapted to th e current reality.   A diagnosis as to the Brazilian educational technology policy, however, requires a broader look at  education in general in the country.  It is well known that Brazil undertook many efforts over the past  20 years to foster the broad dissem ination of basic (including primary and secondary education),  technical and higher education in the country.   With regard to basic education, largely universalized, the challenge is now the improvement of its  quality.  In international comparison, the countr y does not occupy a position that reflects its economic  and social importance.  In the International Student Assessment (PISA), promoted by the Organization  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) relating to the year 2015, Brazil held the 63rd  position in Science, the 59th in Reading and the 66th  position in Mathematics, in a total of 70 countries  that participated in the evaluation.   Such results, to some extent, reflect the effort of universalization of education conducted in recent  years, as evide nced by stagnation and the existence of a certain period of decreased results identified  by the System of Basic Education Evaluation (SAEB) promoted  by the National Institute for Educational  Research and Studies (INEP):  
      50  FIGURE 14: AVERAGE SCORE IN MATH  (MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL )    Source: INEP59  Connectivity has been highlighted among experts as an important means for improving educational  policies60. Connectivity plays a role on four pillars of an adequately formulated educational policy: (i)  it enables improved school management, as it allows the formulation of more reliable indicators and  the improved flow of information between managers, directors and teachers, (ii) it enables new  manners of  continuing training of tea chers, (iii) it increases access to information by students, and (iv)  it enables better monitoring of students by parents and guardians, facilitating and strengthening the  involvement of parents in the education of their children.   Currently Brazil has appr oximately 150,000 elementary public schools, many of which are small rural  schools (38% of the total number of schools) with only 8% of the total students.  The vast majority of  students (86% of the total) are in urban schools, with more than half (53% of t otal students)  concentrated in large and urban schools.   The network of private schools in Brazil, on the other hand, has minor problems regarding connectivity,  encompassing 40,500 schools with approximately 9 million students, representing 20% of the total                                                               59 Extracted from MENEZES FILHO, Naercio A . “Como melhorar a educação no Brasil?” , published at http://www.brasil economia -governo.org.br/2015/11/09/como -melhorar -a-educacao -no-brasil/ , 2015 (in Portuguese).

      51  students.   As for Internet access, 59% of basic education public schools have Internet access, although there is  inequality between rural and urban schools: only 24% of the total rural schools have access to the  Internet, while 85% of urban schools are con nected.  This access profile largely reflects the  telecommunications business model, in which infrastructure is usually concentrated in densely  populated regions with a larger income profile.   Regarding the incorporation of technology in teaching, only 3% of  public schools for basic education  have computers in all classrooms, and in only 19% of schools is there sufficient bandwidth to allow  students simultaneously to access  videos and games.  In addition, 67% of teachers did not participate  in training courses  on the use of technological resources for education, or participated only in courses  on the use of basic tools61.  Professional Training   One of the most prominent aspects related to the incorporation of new technologies such as IoT in  production processes, or to the growth and development of  startups,  is the shortage of professionals  with  adequate training in the area of information technologies.   This shortage of skilled professionals is a  reflection of a widespread deficiency in IT  skills throughout the population. The  reversion of this trend requires not onl y the  introduction of computing skills into basic  education, but also the existence of  continuous professional training programs.   One of the ways to make up for the absence  of qualified labor is through the attraction of  foreign professionals, a practice a dopted by  many countries.  Brazil has not promoted  policies to this end, and has attracted skilled  labor only in specific periods due to high  rates of economic growth.   Another alternative is the implementation of job qualification policies.  In the Brazilian  case, it should  be noted that in 2008 to 2015 the number of enrollments in technical high school62, including all  administrative spheres and the private sector, grew from 933,000 registrations in 2008 to  1,694,000  in 2015.  Of these, in 2015, 215,000 enroll ments corresponded to courses in ICT related areas                                                              61 Other statistics on the use of technology in public and private schools in Brazil can be found on Cetic.br publications,  available on http://cetic.br/pesquisa/educacao/  (in Portuguese).   62 Includes courses that are coursed simultaneously with or subsequently to high school.   Brazil Mais TI Program   The Brasil Mais TI program was designed to  facilitate vocational discerning and trainin g for  young people ages 16 to 25, and to contribute to  new information technology (IT) professionals for  a growing, strategic market in the country. For  these ends, the programs offers basic,  intermediate and advanced IT courses, as well as  professional in formation in the IT job market.  Today, Brasil Mais TI offers over 600.000 single  courses.  
      52  (computing, communication networks and others)63.  Another important highlight  is the offer ing of  free online technical courses.  The school census of 2015  registers more than 144,000 enrollments in online technical courses.  It should be noted, however, that  the qualification of medium -level technicians is just one of the paths towards vocational training, which  must associated to the needs of industry and of the productive sectors64.  On the other hand, higher education technological courses reached 1,029,000 enrollments in 2014,  133,000 of which in mathematical and information sciences.   Open Educational Resources   UNESCO defines Open Educational Resources (OER) as " any type of educational materials that are in  the public domain or introduced with an open license. The nature of these open materials means that  anyone can legally and freely copy, use, adapt and re -shar e them. OERs range from textbooks to  curricula, syllabi, lecture notes, assignments, tests, projects, audio, video and animation. "65   A common misconception is to assume that, if the content is made available for free, it can be considered  "open content".  Many contents available for free on the Internet are not open, since they do not allow  the user to save, modify or share them.  In many cases, the resources are available for a given time or  with access barriers, for example, by requiring the sharing of pers onal data.  The amount of open  educational resources in the world is growing66. Research on the topic in Portuguese -language countries  is increasing67, and there are several portals and repositories with REA in Brazilian  Portuguese68. International declaration s seek to encourage governments to promote REA, as is the case  of the 2012 Paris OER Declaration on open educational resources69. The priority of open resources is  also recognized in the current National Education Plan (goals #5 and #7), as well as in Resol ution  CNE/CES nº 1, 11/03/201670.  REA may promote greater access to quality education, fostering new educational practices, driven by  digital culture.  They go beyond traditional closed educational products, by introducing the possibility  of adaptation to local context, and creation and authorship practices by teachers and students,  translating in a more adequate manner the innovative environment expected for education in the digital                                                              63 Data available at SCHWARTZMAN, Simon.

      53  culture of the 21st Century.  They create opportunities for new models of a cquisition and distribution of  publicly funded educational resources and create conditions for new business models71.  Other technological trends related to education are72:           Open Education.  Often confused with free education, open education is repli cable, combinable  and has no barriers to access and interaction.            Open and free courses.  With the popularization of Massive Open Online Courses  - MOOCS,  online, open and free courses become a strong alternative to traditional study, especially for  those  who are out of school.            Real -world skills.  The job market increasingly demands skills that are most frequently acquired  in informal learning situations, such as problem -solving, resilience and other emotional skills.  Schools are still not ready  to meet such demands.            Customization and new sources of evaluation.  Online activities analysis tools can be used as  evaluation tools and also to create learning tracks according to the student's profile.   Vision   With regard to the strategic vision for the use of technology in Brazilian education, it is worth noting  that two reference documents point out priorities in this regard.  The National Education Plan (Plano  Nacional de Educação – PNE) stipulates the following strategies:   • Strategy 5.3: "Select, certify and promote educational technology for child literacy (...)"   • Strategy 5.4: "Encourage the development of educational technologies and innovative  pedagogical practices that ensure literacy (...)"   • Strategy 5.6: "Promote and stimulate the ini tial and continued training of teachers for child  literacy, building capacities related to new educational technologies and innovative  pedagogical practices (...)"   • Strategy 7.12:  "Encourage the development, select, certify and promote educational  technolog ies for early childhood, elementary and high school education, and encourage  innovative pedagogical practices (...)"                                                               71 For more information, see http://www.cieb.net.br/cieb -estudos -inovacao -aberta -em-educacao -conceitos -e-modelos -denegocios/  (in Portuguese), accessed on 30/06/2017.   72 Extra cted from "CIEB Estudos #2", Inovação Aberta em Educação, 2016, pg. 11, available on http://www.cieb.net.br/cieb estudos/ , accessed on 30/06/2017.  
      54  • Strategy 7.15: "Universalize, until the fifth year of the duration of this National Education Plan,  access to the worldwide network of comp uters in high speed broadband and, by the end of  the Decade, triple the computer/student ratio in basic education public schools (...)"   On the other hand, the National Common Curricular Base ( BNCC)73 stipulates that one of the ten  general skills to be developed by all Brazilian students is to "understand, use and create digital  information and communication technologies in a critical, significant, reflective and ethical manner, in  diverse social practices (including within schools)", aiming at the commu nication, access and  dissemination of information, as well as the production of knowledge and  solution of  problems.  Technology is also pointed out as a strategy to achieve the other competencies provided for  in the BNCC, and is mentioned several times thro ughout the document.   In this manner, having in view the diagnosis outlined above and the guidelines already provided for in  the PNE and the BNCC, the Brazilian Strategy for Digital Transformation must seek to  promote wide  access to students and teachers to  high -quality teaching resources and innovative pedagogical  practices, through the universalization of high -speed internet access in public schools of basic  education;  ensuring sustainable funding in time, in conjunction with States and  Municipalities;  stimulating the autonomy of students and teachers regarding the adoption of  technology for education;  and periodically evaluating  the implementation and the impact of such  policies,  the use of these technologies and their contribution to the Brazilian educati on.  Strategic Actions   • To p rioritize the implementation of competencies related to Computational Thinking in middle  school, as defined in the National Common Curriculum Base.   • To formulate a new national policy of educational technology to replace PROINFO, articulating  the strategic dimensions of infrastructure, competencies, content and digital educational  resources.   • To ex pand broadband connectivity in urban and rural schools, combining connectivity  solutions through fiber optic cabling, radio and satellite networks, increasing the speed of  access in schools that are already served by terrestrial telecommunications networks, and  structuring a new funding model for high speed Internet for the public education system.   • To i mprove initial and continuing training of teachers of basic education, considering  technological transformations and providing practical guidance as to the use of technology in  the classroom.   • To en courage the production and dissemination of digital content created by teachers and  students, as w ell as encourage the open sharing of publicly -funded resources, with and                                                              73 Available on http://basenacionalcomum.mec.gov.br/images/BNCC_20dez_site.pdf , accessed on 21/12/2017.  
      55  between public and private educational networks, giving preference to open educational  resources.   • To review traditional policies, such as the National Textbook Plan (PNLD) and the min istry of  Education’s Technology Guide, for a planned transition from analog educational resources to  digital mediums.   • To p rioritize, in the New High School model, the strengthening of STEM subjects (mathematics,  science, technology and engineering) and tec hnical qualification tracks for sectors of the digital  economy, taking into account the importance of stimulating girls and women to seek careers  in ICT -related fields.   • To p romote greater interaction between the private sector and educational institutions  (universities, research institutes and professional and technical training institutes), in order to  incorporate the demands and needs of digital companies of the future, applying concepts such  as lifelong learning  and vocational education.   • To f acilitate th e obtaining of certificates and the formal recognition of skills acquired in  vocational training, either through partnerships with vocational education institutions or  through partnerships with companies or other  entities.   Indicators   The monitoring of the following indicators is suggested:   • Program for International Student Assessment (PISA), promoted by the Organization for  Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).   • Number of schools with access to the Internet and actual speed, measured by appropriate  devices, such as SIMET developed by NIC.br, in possible partnership with the MEC.   • The average internet speed in Brazilian public schools.     
      56  E. International Dimension   Strengthen ing Brazilian leadership in global forums rela ted to digital  issues, stimulating  competitiveness and the presence of Brazilian  companies abroad, and promot ing regional integration in the digital  economy.      The digitization of the economy occurs globally, across borders and eliminating distances.  Therefore,  it is crucial to deal with t his phenomenon from a global perspective, with international involvement in  global and multistakeholder forums, and devoting special attention to cross -border issues related to  data, goods and services.   Digital economy also provides excellent opportunities  for greater regional economic integration,  particularly in Latin America, with the expansion of trade, finance, people and communications flows,  which allows lower costs, higher income and  development gains.  New business models enabled by  digitalization r equire a proactive stance in international trade negotiations, such as those held before  the World Trade Organization (WTO), where topics such as e -commerce are being discussed.  Other  key issues for the country to enjoy the benefits of digitalization inclu de international data flows,  location of companies and datacenters, modes of provision of services in other countries, technological  standards, and taxation.  Economic relations in the digital world also involve issues related to the legal  and regulatory en vironment, such as personal data protection and privacy, copyright and the  regulation of digital platforms.   There are increasing possibilities to enlarge the presence of Brazilian companies abroad, including  initiatives that range from sending technology -based  startups  to major centers of innovation and  entrepreneurship, to participation in  global digital platforms, with increased exportation of goods and  services.   It is also essential to contribute to the global decision -making processes related to the Int ernet, such  as the management of critical Internet resources.  Brazil has for many years held a role of leadership in  these issues, and this role should be maintained, in support of multistakeholder representation in  global forums, given the complexity of t he Internet ecosystem and the persistence of the digital divide .     1. INTERNET GOVERNANCE   Diagnosis   The Brazilian approach towards Internet Governance has become an internationally consolidated 
      57  reference.  Among Brazilian landmarks in this field, it is important to mention the Marco Civil da  Internet  (Law n. 12.965/2014), which establishes Civil rights and obligations in the use of the Internet  and sets out principles such as network neutrality, privacy, freedom of expression, as well as  mechanisms  to promote greater legal certainty in those  issues.  The multistakeholder model of the  Brazil Internet Steering Committee (CGI.br) has also been presented internationally as a positive  example since its creation in 1995.   On the topic of Internet Governance, Brazil has traditionally emphasized certain positions in view of  the international debate:   • Complexity of the Internet ecosystem, with diverse actors assuming different roles;   • Multistakeholder approach  and the definition of distinct and compleme ntary roles and  responsibilities for each sector – pillars of the WSIS framework in the Tunis Agenda of 2005,  reaffirmed by the WSIS+10 process carried out by the United Nations General Assembly in  2015;   • Persistence of the digital divide;   • Structural proble ms that contribute to the digital divide, such as the difficulty in access to  technology;   • The asymmetry of representativeness among countries in international forums, given the  human and financial resource constraints for engagement on all negotiation fron ts.  The current Internet Governance system faces many challenges.  The issues of cyber security,  management of Internet critical resources, jurisdiction and taxation are examples of critical points for  the global governance of the network.   Vision   It is impo rtant to maintain Brazil's leadership in Internet governance based on the principles set out  during the World Summit on the Information Society74. As explained in the Tunis Agenda, “…the  international management of the Internet should be multilateral, trans parent and democratic, with  the full involvement of governments, the private sector, civil society and international organizations".   It is also important  to promote  the principles of access expansion adopted in Brazil: investment in  infrastructure, dissemi nation of high quality  access , lower price and the rights  protection . This  approach should be taken in a balanced multisector environment of multisector, with proportional  representation in all debate forums . The net is global , therefore its challenges should be handled in a  global framework , with global cooperation.  The focus of this approach is benefit ing people  with a                                                              74 See the Tunis Agenda for the World Summit on the Information Society at  https://www.itu.int/net/wsis/docs2/tunis/off/6rev1.html .  
      58  development  goal .  Brazil will also continue to strive for conditions of full participation of the different sectors, in their  varied ro les and responsibilities, in fora, processes and Internet governance bodies, including the  exercise of leadership  by Governments, where applicable.  In the case of ICANN ( Internet Corporation  on Assigned Names and Numbers , the global authority for governanc e network resources), decision making about the critical network resources management must be democratic and transparent.   It is necessary  a realistic approach to the theme of governance, making sure that no agent has alone  the total dominance of the resou rces, and striving to ensure rights and ensure duties.  It should also,  within the framework of the United Nations , progress in discussions on cyber weapons.   Strategic Actions   • Act in international fora in order to defend the principles consistent with the W orld Summit  on the information society, with the understanding of the respective roles and responsibilities  of Governments, intergovernmental and international organizations, as well  as the private  sector and civil society, from both developed and developi ng.  • Boost Internet governance topics in forums, negotiations, mechanisms and joints to treat this  agenda, using partnerships in different areas (European Union, Mercosur, IBAS, BRICS, G20,  UN, among others).   • Expand multilateral trading spaces of public pol icies, especially in the subjects of jurisdiction,  cyber security and taxation.   • Act for implementation of new mechanisms of peaceful conflict resolution in the cyber  environment, such as the initiative of the  Group of Governmental Experts  (GGE) of the Unit ed  Nations75.     2. COORDINATION AND INTE GRATION PROCESSES IN  THE DIGITAL ECONOMY   The rapid digital transformation on a global scale, with impacts on economy, politics and society, has  been the subject of intense joint in various international fora in which Brazil is engaged.  The country  has been active participant of discussions in multilateral processes of coordination and integration in  the digital environment   Moreover, with the growth of trade in the digital environment, especially trade in digital conten t, it  becomes necessary to adapt concepts, practices, and regulations to an increasingly digital economy.  In  this sense, the digital economy has gained prominence in negotiations in international fora.                                                               75 For more information on GGE activities, see https://dig.watch/processes/ungge . Accessed on 20/09/2017.  
      59  Highlights the activities that occurred throughout 201 7 in the following forums:   • G20: first meeting of Ministers, Düsseldorf – Germany, 6 and 7 April 2017.  The representatives  of the G20 member countries signed the document " G20 Ministerial Declaration: Digital  Economy Shaping Digitalisation for an Interconnected World "76, whose annexes detail  the public policies and priorities for implementation.  In the second semester of 2017 the  Argentina assumed the rotating Presidency of the G20 and, in close coordination with the  Brazil, aims to bring focus to t he region's priorities in digital themes.   • OECD : Brazil presented letter with formal request to join the Organization for economic  cooperation and development (OECD), on 30 may 2017.  The brazilian request follows the  successful implementation of the program me of work that resulted from the cooperation  agreement signed between Brazil and the OECD in 2015.  The Brazilian elections is under review  by the Council of the OECD.   • BRICS : third Meeting of Communications Ministers of the BRICS – Hangzhou, China, from 26   to 28 July 2017, with follow -up and implementation of the initiatives agreed upon by this Court  in your 2nd meeting (India, 2016), and consolidated in the document " BRICS  ICT Development  Agenda and Action Plan "77. In addition, during the seventh meeting of  Ministers of Trade of  the BRICS, commerce was one of the highlights, which led to the creation of a specific working  group for discussion of the topic.   • MERCOSUR : in this year of 2017, Brazil assumed the Presidency Pro Tempore of the regional  bloc, having led the process that resulted in the establishment of the “Digital Agenda Group”  (GAD – Grupo Agenda Digital), an auxiliary working group to the Common Market Group (GMC  – Grupo Mercado Comum), with an aim to promote the development of a Digital Mercosul.   • eLAC 2018 : preparatory meeting of the 6th Ministerial Conference on the information society  of Latin America and the Caribbean, Santiago -Chile, held from 7 to 9 August 201778. The  Colombia will host, in April of 2018, the next Ministerial Conference on the information society  of Latin America and the Caribbean (eLAC).   Deserves special mention the creation of a Digital single market in Latin America, inspired by similar  process underway in the European Union.  This is a new initiative that is gaining momentum among the  processes of coordination and economic integration of our region.  She can be in exceptional economic  opportunity for the Country, opening markets for Brazilian products with projection through digital  platforms and  marketplaces , summed the compar ative advantages in delivery logistics in the  region.  Private sector engagement in the processes of coordination and integration is a key factor in                                                              76 Available on: unctad.org/meetings/en/Contribution/dtl_eWeek2017c02 -G20_en.pdf , accessed on 06/07/2017.   77 Available on: www.ranepa.ru/images/media/brics/indianpresidency2/11 -112016%20BRICS%20ICT%20Development%20Agenda%20&%20Action% 20plan.pdf , accessed on 06/07/2017.   78 The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ELAC) provides technical support to eLAC,  a coordination mechanism for digital agendas of Latin American countries. The current work cycle of eLAC 2018, backed by  the Ministerial Declaration eLAC 2015 and approved in the last Ministers Conference hosted in Mexico, focuses on the  region’s digital integration.  
      60  the country's insertion into global markets.   One of the focuses of this strategy is the digital platforms an d marketplaces , as explained in the  chapters ahead.  The Brazil is responsible for 50% of the volume of Commerce in the whole Latin  America79. The importance of this market segment of digital platforms for electronic commerce tends  to grow with the process of integration and consolidation of the value chain in Latin America.   Strategic action   • Expand the active engagement of the country in the negotiations of the instances of  coordination and integration in the Digital economy, ensuring representation and part icipation  in the discussions and deliberations on this topic.     3.  THE INTERNATIONALIZAT ION OF BRAZILIAN COMPANIES I N THE DIGITAL  ECONOMY   The promotion of exports of Brazilian products and services, as well as the attraction of foreign  investments for strateg ic sectors of the Brazilian  economy, relies on the efforts of various private and  public actors, especially the Brazilian Agency  of Promotion of exports and investments (Apex -Brazil).   Apex -Brazil's actions aimed at facilitating the access of Brazilian comp anies to international markets,  diversify the destinations of Brazilian exports and improve international perceptions about companies,  products and services.   In addition, other specific public policy initiatives can also support the process of internationa lization  of small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs).  Actions of promotion and capacity building of SMEs,  especially those who engage in a highly competitive market segment, such as international commerce,  are critical to your success.  In addition, SMEs h ave an important role in the generation of jobs, which  in the digital economy are typically more skilled.   Diagnosis   The international e -commerce scenario, dominated by a limited universe of  marketplaces , is identified  as covering two large segments: commer ce B2B ( business to business ) and B2C (business -to-Commerce  consumer  ).  In both segments are identified opportunities for Brazilian companies, including cost reduction of  prospecting for customers, product visibility and multiplication of direct sales chan nels.  However, at                                                              79 Data from UNCTAD, available on http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/ier2015_en.pdf . 
      61  the same time also challenges arise, such as the management of digital platforms, security sales,  payment and logistics, to name a few.   The process of internationalization of Brazilian companies via e -commerce should be in stages,  involvi ng initially the establishment and management of own Internet site, followed by a second phase  of internationalization of digital platform.   The central role of SMEs in the economy, as well as your growth potential with international  commerce, is widely rec ognized.  Several countries and regional blocs make explicit in their digital  strategies initiatives80 to promote the global operations of SMEs in the digital environment.   For a broader discussion of e -commerce in Brazil, and the role of e -commerce platforms in this context,  see the chapter "New business models" of this document.   Vision   In this year of 2017, Apex -Brazil is developing an initiative called Brazil e-Xport Program81, which aims  to raise awareness, qualification and business promotion of Brazilian companies in the  international  market, through the tools of  e-commerce . The profile of participating companies should be selected as  the platform and features of the  target market.   Have been identified as target markets, as a first step, the US, China and Argentina.  In a second step  should be added to Europe.  The goals include the partnership with  marketplaces , the training and the  inclusion of companies in  marketplac es.  Other actions of public policies and partnerships with associations and private entities82 can provide a  wide support network for the advocates and the empowerment of Smes in the digital environment,  with a focus on opportunities  International e -commerc e.  Strategic actions   • To e stablish agreements and partnerships with international  marketplaces  , supporting  exports via e -commerce for small and medium -sized enterprises (SMEs) in Brazil, and Apex Brazil program Brazil Xport.                                                               80 An interesting set of initiatives in this field within the European Union is described in a review by the Ministry of Industr y,  Foreign Trade and Services. The review is available on  https://www.slideshare.net/mdicgovbr/estudo -comparativo -sobre comrcio -eletrnico -nas-pequenas -e-mdias -empresas -no-brasil -e-unio -europeia  (in Portuguese), accessed on 20/10/2017.   81 More details of the program can be found online at www.e -xportbrasil.com  (in Portuguese).   82 For example, the Brazilian Micro and Sma ll Enterprises Support Service – SEBRAE ( www.sebrae.com.br ) and the Brazilian  e-Commerce Chamber ( www.camara -e.net ). 
      62  • To p romote the expansion of electronic trade exports of goods and services, mapping  opportunities and barriers, and supporting the insertion of Brazilian companies in this market  segment.   • To d evelop partnerships with international digital  marketplaces  , aiming at the promotion and  export of Brazilian products and services on the Internet.   • To implement partnerships with associations and entities to support small and medium -sized  enterprises (SMEs), to promote and to training activities in international commerce.   • To host e vents, busines s rounds and conferences, having as target group businesses and  entities interested in export expansion via e -commerce.   • To d evelop a quality stamp for exports via e -commerce (for example, by Apex -Brazil or the  Standards and Measures Institute – Inmetro).  
      63  THEMATIC LINES – DIGITAL  TRANSFORMATION     F. Digital Transformation in the Economy   Stimulating an increasingly digital, dynamic, productive and competitive  economy in Brazil, aiming the global economy frontier.       1. DATA-DRIVEN ECONOMY   A new industrial revolution based on data, computing technologies and automation stems from the  transformations in the digital era. A number of human activities and industrial processes is now  enhanced, created and re -created, based on data volume that had never existed be fore83. In the digital  economy, data is presented as a new production factor,  like material goods and human capital. It thus creates a  global market, in which value is created from generated  content, shared by people, sensors and machines, and  also multipli ed by countless data -crossing possibilities in  a gigantic repository of information and references84.   The elements of cyberspace generate an environment of  not only massive data production, but also of substantial   information registry, when combined with different  factors, such as:   • Lowering of data gatheri ng, storage, processing,  identification and analysis costs ;  • Worldwide adoption of public policies aiming to  expand the Internet access infrastructure, with a tendency to a gradual increase in the number  of digital technology users;                                                               83 UK Digital Strategy , 2017.   84 This results in an increasi ngly data record environment in the digital world, which creates a “digital exhaust” of not only  “native” digital data, but also originally analogic information, such as voice, typing patterns, cardiac pulse and breathing (as  in medical records), rainfall,  soil and industrial production records. On this subject, see also: “ White House Report. Big data:  seizing opportunities, preserving values ”. Executive Office of the President, May 2014.

      64  • Increasing density of connection of people and countless devices, sensors and machines to the  Internet, due to the Internet of Things (IoT) phenomenon.   Data can be treated as “raw material” , serving as  input to many processes with different purposes,  and whose  value depends on context and  complementary factors related to one’s capacity of  extracting information. It is an interesting fact that  the economic scarcity problem does not affect  data: it actually multiplies its value by reuse and it  can be indefinitely  reused without decrease on  reliability. The use of data may generate  aggregated value with crescent returns.   Thus, a high volume of input is generated to  improve traditional business models, create new  products and services and develop brand -new  technolog ies, like artificial intelligence, use of  algorithms, machine learning, data -mining,  augmented reality, cloud computing and big data.  Such technologies have high potential to transform social relations.   Access to such input affects data -based innovation it self, which is characterized by the utilization of  data and data -analytics to enhance and promote products, processes, organizational methods and  markets85.   New business models and market structures demand the formulation of new public policy and  regulatio n, which can foster a robust data economy, protect consumer rights, free competition and  privacy for citizens and businesses.   Diagnosis   We are now heading to a knowledge -driven world, both socially and economically, where the data  volume grows progressivel y. Estimates are that the total volume of useful data will sum up to 16  zetabytes (16 trillion gigabytes) by 2020, a projected yearly growth of 236% between 2013 and 202086.  Many countries identify the necessity of stimulate data economy as one of the pillars for the digital                                                              85 OECD, Data -Driven Innovation .

Artificial Intelligence is a set of  statistical tools  and algorithms which  generate intelligent software, especially  designed for a specific activity. It is a  useful technology for data classification,  pattern identification and forecasting. A  few examples of artificial intelligence  include translation tools , voice and image  recognition services, and search engines  with ranking features, capable of  relevance scoring according to the user’s  preferences.

Moreover, the top five companies  currently listed among the largest companies in  the world are from the data business, and together  profited over 25 billion dollars on the first  trimester of 2017 alone88.  The OECD estimates that comp anies which base  their businesses on data analytics increase their  productivity by 5% to 10%, when compared with  those who don’t. Such productivity gains depend  not only on data use and analysis, but also other  factors such as data managing skills, innovat ive  processes and specific characteristics of the  correspondent business sector89. Also according to  OECD, invest ment in intangible capital  (knowledge -based capital) is growing in  proportion to tangible (physical) capital, for  instance, reaching 15% of Unit ed States GDP in  201190.  Moreover, some of the major companies fusions and acquisitions in the technology sector may  represent a great potential to increase data access.   The data market value chain is composed by a number of activities, which include data g athering91,  different types of treatment92 and use in primary (when the exploration of data capabilities is linked  to its source activity, for instance, the analysis of mobile traffic data by a telecom company for billing  purposes) or secondary (when data is used for an objective unrelated to its source) applications93.                                                              87 The United Kingdom government estimates that the data economy shall grow up to £241 billion between 2015 and 2020.  See UK Digital St rategy 2017 .  88 Article on The Economist : Regulating the Internet Giants: The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data ,  May 6, 2017. In fact, the world market for big data technologies and related services was expected to reach 16.9 billion   dollars in 2015, increasing at a composed growth rate of 40% -- seven times higher than the overall ICT market.

Supporting Investment in Knowledge Capital, Growth and Innovation , 2013.   91 There are many sources for data collection, including personal data, which may involve social media, online activity,  public or commercial da tabases, location services, payments, triangulation by cell towers, digitalized physical records; and  also non -personal data, originated from sensors, transportation systems, intelligent energy and utilities networks, wireless  network mapping, etc. This ma rket also allows the presence of specialized data -gathering agents, known as “data brokers”,  who aggregate information from different sources, with or without organizational intelligence. Such agents are often  advertised as data collectors and sellers, as informational organizers, or even as players capable of creating value from  inferences made upon collected information.   92 Data treatment includes activities such as production, reception, classification, reproduction, storage, modification,  extraction, pro filing, mining, database crossing, evaluation and analysis, transmission, elimination and distribution, with the  adoption of data analytics methods and tools.   93 IDC, European Data Market SMART 2013/0063, D8 – Second Interim Report , 2016. Available on link:    http://www.datalandscape.eu/study -reports    Big Data Analytics   Data treatment based on big data is sharply  different from any other technic in this field,  given the immense volume, variety and  velocity (the so -called "3V"). The big data  treatment generates the "mosaic effect",  based on integration between an infinitude  of data and information, even when the  correspondent data is no longer connected  to the original sources. This effect allows the  "perfect personalization" on service  providing, products buying and selling, job  hunting or simple information search.  Personalized decisions, however, create the  possibility to different forms of  discrimination and may present biased  results, known as "fil ter bubbles".  
      66  In the field of research and development in data analysis and treatment, the National Laboratory of  Scientific Computing (LNCC) is the main research center in Brazil w ith initiatives in this subject.  Equipped with high -performance computing (HPC) installations, LNCC implements research projects  for big data, such as the INCT -CID, in cooperation with many research institutions both domestic and  international94.  It is impo rtant to consider that there are many types of data, including personal data (linked to  identified or identifiable persons), entrepreneurial (linked to the development of different business  models), industrial or production (machine operations, production control, etc.), nature (climate, relief  and elevation, soil, livestock, plants, seeds, etc.), government and public services (transport, utilities,  etc.), among others.   Bearing this in mind, when planning public policies for the data market, it is necessar y to consider the  vertical quality of each specialized subject, as well as its transversal effect on different economy  sectors, contemplating the needs and specificities of each sector95.   International data transfer   The global data flow generated by data m arkets was incipient 15 years ago, but it causes an impact on  GDP growth today considerably larger than other commercial flows which exist for centuries96.   The flow volume is originated by information exchange in digital environment, whose intrinsic  charac teristic is the free data circulation, including the flow between borders. In fact, the digital data  market is a global market from the beginning, with its biggest players simultaneously present in  different countries, due to the ubiquity of digital techno logy, unconstrained by national borders.                                                                94 For a deeper insight in R&D initiatives on digital technologies, see section “B. Research, Development and Innovation” in  this document.   95 The need for data protection is an important example in this subject. It is a fact that some businesses seize this type of  information as input for their activities, making use of health, housing, office, and vehicle data, sometimes covering entire   urban areas. However, there are market niches, for instance, heavy industry, transportation and logistics, whose data usage  is remarkably distinct from this type of specific information. Considering such distance in data inputs, it is crucial to def ine  such a re gulation proportional to the specificities of economic activity, avoiding the risk of hindering innovation.   96 McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).

      67  FIGURE 15: GLOBAL FLO W OF DATA AND TELECO MMUNICATION   Cross -border bandwidth use between regions in thousands of gigabits per second     Source : TeleGeography, McKinsey Global Institute analysis   Such increase , in one hand, allows companies to reach international markets using less capital intensive business models, an alternative already essential to several business areas, such as financial  services and information technology. In other hand, it presents new r isks and challenges for public  policy, prompting States to cooperate and harmonize legislation. Nevertheless, the international flow  of information is inherent to data market and a vital element to foster the growth and deve lopment in  a knowledge economy.     Datacenters: the data infrastructure   The datacenter is one of the basic infrastructure elements for the new digital economy. Datacenters are  centralized repositories, integrated to a telecommunication network, with the purpose to keep, manage  and dissemin ate data and information.   Datacenters are associated to the development of a competitive and vibrant data economy. Their  presence in a given region may spill -over to the establishment of technology -based businesses and  strongly IT depended services (such a s software and digital content production). Datacenters are  fundamental pieces for the cloud computing segment in the data economy value chain.   Brazil represents 2.5% of the world’s Internet traffic, 40% of IP traffic in Latin America97, and is the  Latin -American country with the biggest concentration of installed submarine cables. However, it is  home of only 0.9% of all datacenters in the world98. There are 0.022 datacenters in Brazil for each USD                                                              97 Cisco Visual Network Index (VNI) 2017, available on: www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/solutions/service -provider/vni -forecast highlights.html#   98 Datacenter Map, 2017, available on: www.datacentermap.com/datacenters.html   
      68  1 billion of the country’s GDP. This ratio may be nin e times bigger in places with extensive investment in  that infrastructure, such as Romania and Hong Kong99.   A study publishe d in a report by the Brazilian F ederal Court of Audit indicates the elevated investment  costs for datacenters in the country. It sug gests important competitive challenges in this market for  Brazil, despite country’s potential to become a data hub in the continent100.  The excessive dependency on datacenters located abroad has disadvantages which can be summarized  in four dimensions, as fo llows:    Internet service providers (ISPs): given that datacenters are the ground level for this type of service,  their presence in other countries crowds out such businesses to the international market.    Final users: rights and protections for data and infor mation of Brazilians abroad, acknowledged by  the Civil Rights Framework for Internet (Law 12.965/2014), are not easily enforced.    Information industry: services provided from other countries do not generate revenue for domestic  businesses, and technical inf rastructure tends to be drained out of the country.    Globalization: fundamental elements for building modern society and creating value in the digital  economy remain established abroad.   Considering that datacenters are frequently associated to Internet Exch ange Points (IXP), a policy   supporting datacenter investments would promote competition and growth in the entire Internet  ecosystem, with positive impacts throughout the value chain, including telecom operators, content  providers, content delivery networks  and ISPs.   In this scena rio, attraction mechanisms for datacenters is strategic for Brazil. Such initiative would  improve Internet access quality due to geographic closeness between user and content provider, thus  reducing latency. In the same way, the presence of content in Brazil reduces bandwidth consumption on  national backbones and submarine cables, allowing greater economy of network resources. Lastly, more  datacenters hosted in Brazil mean higher governance over content and data and, consequently,  stronger  security for business and individuals information.   Additionally, it is important that the Brazilian government widens its open data policy as means to  stimulate new businesses and technology solutions for citizens. Brazil ranked 8th at the Globa l Open  Data Index in 2017, which measures government data openness in several countries101.

      70  2. A WORLD OF CONNECTED DEVICES     Internet of Things (IoT) is no longer a technological promise . Connected devices ar e everywhere: inside  homes and cars, embedded in cities infrastructure, monitoring the productive process in industry and  farms, tracking logistic transportation chains, facilitating service providing, and even over peoples  bodies – wearable technology – connecting watches, shoes and other pieces of clothing. Large scale  machine to machine connections (M2M) is already the reality in developed economies in the world,  and they are expanding rapidly. Estimates indicate that the worldwide number of devices conn ected  to the Internet may reach 30 billion by 2020103 and the IoT impact o n global economy may amount  USD 11.1 trillion in 2025, which represents 11% of the world economy104.  FIGURE 16: DIMENSIONS OF INTERNET OF THINGS     The Internet of Things will have a massive impact in all economic sectors and on people’s lives,  generating a large quantity of data. A study of the telecom company Telefonica estimates that the  global capacity for data storage and processing will reach 80 0 exabytes in 2020. As comparison, the  same capacity was of 80 exabytes in 2015. A considerable amount of this data will come from                                                              103 European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies.

      71  connected devices.   IoT is the basis of the digitalization process, which has been transforming traditional production  methods . Such methods become gradually based on digital applications, on intensive use of  information and communication technologies, and on devices interconnection. The main vector of the  digital transformation is the growing links between IT systems and subsyst ems, processes, objects and  applications, and it impacts on all three fundamental economic sectors (agriculture, industry, services),  in a phenomenon now known as the Fourth Industrial Revolution.   In addition to social transformation, w e may expect that di gital technology and IoT applications may  bring about productivity gains and competitiveness for many countries. This is particularly relevant for  Brazil, since the country has been facing losses in manufactured value added (MVA) capacity  for the  past deca des when compared with other developing econ omies. Unido105 estimates XX that Brazilian  MVA participation in developing economies decreased from 12.2% to 4.4% between 1990 and 2014,  while China’s share, for instance, raised from 15.8% to 51.3% in the same pe riod. Besides, Brazil’s  ranked lower in the emerging countries industrial competitiveness index in the past few years, going  from 33rd to 35th position between 2010 and 2013. As comparison, China ranked 8th in 2010 and 5th in  2013.   This data calls for pres sing actions to stimulate the development of new technology which may bring  greater productivity and competitiveness in basic economy sectors: manufacture, agriculture and  services. In this sense, it is important to bring together companies, the scientific  community and the  public sector, establishing initiatives aiming the following core goals: development and adoption of IoT  and new digital technologies ; establishment of standards for digital applications; data safety and  security; modernization of the legal framework; professional capacity -building; improvement of  infrastructure and business environment.   A few steps were taken to achieve such goals:   • The creation, in 2014, of the IoT Chamber, a multistakeholder forum which gathers  universities, research centers, companies and the government, with a mission to define  governance models and a regulation for IoT development, including actions to stimulate  innovation and infrastructure building. Such actions include the elaboration of the IoT National  Plan.   • Joint actions by the ministries of Industry and Commerce, and of Science, Technology,  Innovation and Communications, including a public consultation involvi ng over 300 experts,  which will result on the National Strategy for Advanced Manufacture.                                                               105 United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).

      72  • A public call106 by EMBRAPII – Brazilian Industrial Research and Innovation Association – to  support initiatives in robotics, mechatronics and advanced manufacture.   • The establishment of a specific credit line for intelligent systems and advanced manufacture  by the National Bank for Economic and Social Development (BNDES).   • The Brazilian Agricultural Research Company  (Embrapa) 2014 -2034 Strategic Plan107. It sets  priorities in agricultural digitalization, with initiatives in automation, precision agriculture,  informational systems, scientific computing, geological technologies and nanotechnology.     The National Internet of Things Plan   Since 2014, the Ministry of Science, T echnology, Innovation and Communication s (MCTIC)  has been  opening a dialogue with the private sector, academia and public organizations in an effort to build public  policy for the Internet of Things.  The forum for  this dialogue is the IoT Chamber, a multistakeholder  body created by the Decree nº 8.234 in May 2, 2014.   The final output of this dialogue is the National Internet of Things Plan, with the objective to “foster the  implementation of IoT as a  sustainable development instrument for the Brazilian society, capable of  increasing competitiveness, strengthen national production chains and promote higher quality of life.”   Several meetings promoted by the IoT Chamber between 2014 and 2015 resulted in an initial analysis of   the IoT ecosystem in Brazil. This process was strongly supported by all involved stakeholders and  motivated the elaboration of a national IoT plan.   Also, the MCTIC signed a cooperation agreement with the National Economic and Social  Development  Bank (BNDES), in order to conduct a study on IoT.   All agents involved in conceiving the IoT plan share the aspiration  that IoT will generate a positive,  relevant impact on economy and on people’s lives. For that reason, the National IoT Plan c omprehends  different dimensions, key directives and concrete proposals.   Impact s on Secondary Industry : Industry 4.0   Industry 4.0, or advanced manufacture, consists i n a complete digitalization of production processes,  in which physical and digital compone nts are associated in the same productive plant. This concept  describes the organization of production processes based on digital technology and connected devices,  which communicate autonomously to each other throughout the value chain. It is the “intellig ent  factory” model, where physical processes are monitored by computer -controlled systems, which  create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions based on self -organizing                                                              106 Available on http://embrapii.org.br/chamada -publica -01-2016/  (in Portuguese), accessed on 10/07/2017.   107 Available in Portuguese at https://www.embrapa.br/busca -de-publicacoes/ -/publicacao/1025506/vi -plano -diretor -daembrapa -2014 -2034 , accessed on 10/07/2017.  
      73  mechanisms108.  Such manufacture digitalization processes in clude use of embedded sensors in almost all factory parts  and components, cyber -physical systems, security systems, energy consumption systems, and analysis  and monitoring systems for relevant data of a given production set.   New IoT applications can bring substantial improvements to industrial processes  through the adoption  of autonomous systems, which allow higher productivity in manufacturing and greater precision on  production processes. The use of sensors capturing real -time data may prevent eventual problems and  ensure safety. Digital applications can be used on predictive maintenance and anticipate the wearing  process in machines and the need for parts replacement. Use of IoT on industrial processes may reduce  costs by 10% to 20% on energy resources , by 10% to 40% on equipment maintenance,  and by 10% to  25% on workforce efficiency109.    Some elements can be generally considered as pre -requisites for the advanced manufacture  development: standards for systems, platforms and protocols; changes on labor pa tterns which reflect  new business models; digital safety; availability of specialized workforce; investments on research and  development.   In Germany, the digital strategy initiative estimates that the use of IoT in industry (Industry 4.0) may  promote a 30%  increase in industrial productivity, 3.3% increase in efficiency, and a 2.6% reduction of  annual costs. The sectors with higher potential of harnessing the benefits of Industry 4.0 include  automotive, mechanic engineering, industrial processes, electronic s, and ICT.    Besides establishing new management and engineering methods which will impact the entire  productive chain, Industry 4.0 will change the fundaments of industrial competition and reconfigure  the competitiveness differential among nations. Indust rial competitiveness will be based on a  country’s domain over the production of digital components and associated technologies applied to  industry.   Adapting industrial production to digital manufacture will require incentive policies for businesses to  adapt to new techniques and to redesign the manufacturing structure110.   Some economically developed nations are already facing this challenge in traditional industries or  sectors with low  adoption of digital applications. The German Digital Strategy estimat es that six out of  ten business in that country are capable to adopt Industry 4.0 technologies. Germany , in its High Tech  Strategy 2020 , had also established the Industrie 4.0 initiative aiming to build a base ground launch  German industries into world lea dership on digital manufacture solutions, industrial automation,                                                              108 European Parliament, Directorate General for Internal Policies, ibid.  109 McKinsey Global Institute, ibid.   110 In th is sense, an Industry 4.0 initiative present at Germany’s Digital Strategy establishes specific financing funds for RD&I  in microelectronics: “We will introduce a funding program for microelectronics. The sensor and actuator technology found  in machines an d robots that is essential for Industry 4.0 is unthinkable without microelectronics, and is also key to  maintaining our digital independence”. Also, that Strategy stipulates 1 billion euros in subsidies by the German government  to the microelectronics indu stry from 2017 to 2019.

Also, the United States had created, in 2013, the  National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI), the first technology hub entirely dedic ated to  IoT: a public -private partnership interaction platform involving national laboratories and research  institutions dedicated to undertake strategic challenges in industry.   In this sense, it is important that Brazil reaches preparedness for the IoT a nd digital adaptation  challenges in all industrial segments, including mining , oil and gas (and other extraction industries) ,  heavy industry, and construction.   A survey111 carried on by the Ministry of Industry, Foreign Trade and Services (MDIC) and the Ministry  of Science, Technology, Innovation and Communications (MCTIC), involving over 300 experts,  identified the necessity to concentrate efforts to promote the developmen t of strategic technologies  in order to further the establishment of Industry 4.0 in Brazil. Such technologies include collaborative  robotics, artificial intelligence, big data, IoT, additive manufacture, nanotechnology and new materials.   The survey  also highlighted  the importance of new Open Laboratories, dedicated to develop digital  industry technologies, considering that the combination of such technologies generate unprecedented  opportunities for competitive manufacturing.   Furthermore, MDIC and MCTIC co nducted an initiative, launched in 2015, involving a number of public  and private institutions to collect expertise and information from hundreds of industrial innovation  specialists, which will serve as input for an advanced manufacture public policy. Suc h initiative resulted  in a report entitled “Perspectives on advanced manufacture by Brazilian experts”112.  Impacts on Primary Industry: Agriculture   Brazil is a global leader on agriculture and animal husbandry, and the world’s largest (or second largest)  producer and exporter of seven agricultural products: orange juice, sugar, coffee, soy, corn and meat  (beef and poultry).   This industry represents approximately 22% of national GDP and is having a continuous growth in  productivity (around 3% each year) in the  past few decades. Such performance is attributable to the  country’s comparative advantages and a robust environment for research, development and  innovation, conducive to the adoption of new technologies.   The preservation of such leadership will increasin gly depend on the capacity to drive the digital  transformation in economy. The impact on agriculture will occur through the use, in agriculture,  husbandry and silviculture, of technologies such as mapping and remote sensors, machine  digitalization, IoT dev ices and sensors, and embedded software.                                                               111 112 MDIC, MCTIC. “Perspectives on advanced manufacture by Brazilian experts”, November 2016.

      75  However, it is important to stress the fact that the adoption of TICs in agriculture strongly depends on  the availability of a capable workforce, sufficiently trained to handle this type of technology at the  farms. Also, a broader coverage of Internet infrastructure in rural areas – particularly by mobile and  satellite networks – is essential to provide access to digital applications, allowing the dissemination of  information, training, and real -time market and datab ase integration.   In this context, one of the key institutions on research, development, technological diffusion and  capacity building in the agriculture industry is the Brazilian Agricultural Research Company – Embrapa  – which has been the core actor of Br azil’s agricultural modernization for the past 40 years.   Besides the aforementioned Embrapa’s Strategic Plan for 2014 -2034, an important action line assumed  by the company is the insertion of agricultural assets in the digital market, which will increase t he  potential of the company’s databases and its technolo gical knowledge open to public. An Embrapa’s  evaluation identified over 40 digital products in several business segments, such as agriculture,  agrometeorology , automation, use of land, experimental data, genomics and proteomics, SciTech  information, animal husbandry, agricultural planning, and simulation.   The company also develops projects in robotics and Internet of Things, particularly those applied on  precision agriculture, with the digitalization  of sensors and machinery. Embrapa also conducts an  entrepreneurship program called “Startup Challenge”, aiming to engage startups and early -stage  businesses on the agriculture industry. A 2016 study carried on by the University of São Paulo113 shows  the gre at potential of startups for agribusiness.   There is currently a fruitful and dynamic environment for digital entrepreneurship in agribusiness. The  federal government created a few programs to help to identify and promote startups, such as the  Startup Brasi l Program (MCTIC) and the InovAtiva Brasil (MDIC). A survey by the Association For  Promoting Brazilian Software Excellence (Softex) in 2016 had identified at least 75 digital startups  focused on agriculture and over 150 businesses offering software product s and services for  agribusiness.   Impact on Tertiary Industry: Digitalization in Services   The services sector represents  over two thirds of Brazilian GDP and its share on national value added  economy is increasing. Between 2003 and 2016, the services sector  share  amounted from 65.8% to  73.3% of the total value added to GDP, according to the national economy indicators by the Brazilian  Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).   The connection between devices and other digital technologies will also impact this relevant sector.  Many services are expected to have increasingly productivity gains, including health services, logistics,  infrastructure and finance. An evidence for the great impact of the economy’s digitalization on the  services sector is the fact that most innovative, technology -based businesses in Brazil are in this                                                              113 Data available on  http://www.startagro.agr.br/confira -o-infografico -completo -do-1o-censo -agtech -startups -brasil -emprimeira -mao/ , accessed on 28/09/2017.  
      76  sector114.  Despite the services sector relevance in comparison to other industries in Brazil, it is worth mentioning  that the gap between services and other economic activities has being  bridged by digital technology.  In fact, intersection between manufacture and services sectors is gradually widening to a point that a  clear distinction between the two is becoming impossible. Professions and job tasks are increasingly  susceptible to autom ation due to digital technology , which allow a sharp decrease on information and  transaction costs, as well as the developing of innovative business models in service providing.   A few examples of digital transformation in services are the digital platforms  that combine social  media, online collaboration and service providing. There are also applications for device  interoperability for smart cities, health, retail, home appliances, offices, logistics, among others.   In the case of smart cities, IoT applicatio ns in urban mobility, security systems, energy, water, gas and  other services focused on environmental and social sustainability in densely populated urban centers  are more and more utilized. There are estimates indicating that the global market for smart cities  technology solutions may reach US$ 408 billion in 2020115 116.    Urban transportation applications for smart cities may have a calculated impact of over US$ 800 billion  in towns and cities all around the world. For water and air quality monitoring, IoT applications may  represent an impact of US$ 700 billion per year. The use of smart sensors applied to energy and water  distribution efficiency may represent an impact of over US$ 69 billion a year worldwide117.  In the health industry, connected devices and I oT applications may optimize medical treatment and  hospital management. Some examples include digital medical records, management of pharmaceutical  supplies and clinical equipment, digital medical records, and wearable technologies, which may offer  real-time remote monitoring of a patient’s health conditions and provide assistance in long -distance  medical procedures . IoT applications to health services are expect to impact the world market by US$  1.6 trillion by 2025118.  Logistics and transportation can also be greatly benefici ated by IoT. System interoperability is the most  promising segment in logistics IoT for the industry of the future, and includes applications for transport  by railroads, aerial, river and terrestrial . Some examples are the remote monitor ing of containers and  logistic routes, interconnected navigation, and autonomous cargo vehicles. The global impact of IoT  technology in logistics and transportation may reach US$ 850 billion in 2025119.   Considering the expected impact and potential applicat ions of digitally connected devices, it is                                                              114 Brazilian Micro and Small Business Support Service (Sebrae) startup survey: “ Pesquisa Lado/A , Lado/B Startups 2015” .

      77  fundamental that the B razilian strategy focus es on the development of competitive IoT solutions,  professional capacity -building and incentives to the adoption of IoT devices, without overlooking the  need for an at tractive and safe normative and business environment, with confidence building for the  final users.   Security and privacy in the world of connected devices   In the Internet of Things future, it is paramount that the widespread of connected devices does not bring  with it a decline on people’s safety and privacy.    Expansion of IoT bring us to a path leading to a near future when traffic, electricity grids, health facilities  and other vital resources of modern society will all be conn ected by networks. In this scenario , cyber  attacks and data leaks will have enormous impact. It is important that both the government and the  private sector make massive investments on cyber security as an absolute priority.   There is also a great challenge on granting individual pri vacy in a hyper -connected society. A  considerable amount of the immense data volume collected and treated by connected devices is personal  data, whose monetization and use in new business models is increasingly recurrent. The lawful  commercial use of perso nal data presupposes observance of users’ rights. A deeper insight in this theme  can be found in the chapter “Building Trust and Confidence in the Digital Environment”.   Vision   To reach the full potential of IoT applications, digital devices and related technologies must evolve  continuously, reducing production costs and building robust data analysis. For these ends , it is essential  to establish training and research  funding initiatives to develop new technologies, as well as build  a  favorable business env ironment to attract new investments. Furthermore, the use of IoT systems may  raise issues on how to foster a safe, propitious environment for labor relations,  user rights and data  privacy.   Considering the undeniable digitalization process and its impacts, it is important to focus on:   • Development of technology  and broadband infrastructure, as to allow the application of  technology in agriculture , in digital manufacturing plants , and in high value -added services  based on digital applications. In fact,  in order to  strengthen these sectors, is essential to  develop broadband infrastructure, 5G  mobile networks, design houses for microelectronics,  and a sensors  market .  • Professional training in required skills for new digital technologies.  Articulated action s among  government, industry, academia and the civil society are important to define new educational  tracks aimed to this new professional profile.   • Coordinated policies in public and private sectors,  which provide responsive and updated  regulatory framewor ks (adaptable to swift advances in the digital sector ), equalize  incentives  to technological investment, and provide  appropriate legal protection to consumers and  workers.  
      78  Strategic actions   The strategic actions directed to the development and adoption of IoT and digital technologies must  include:   • The approval of National IoT Plan  and the implementation of testing platforms for IoT suppliers  in each the chain of value related to the cross -cutting themes, defined as priorities by the IoT  Chamber : health, agriculture, industry and smart cities.   • The improvement of the science, technology and innovation legal framework, intensifying the  interaction between public research centers and businesses , and articulating national research  infrastructures and research funds , as described in the actions highlighted at the "Research,  Development and Innovation" section . The goal is to promote scalable gains and coordinate  RD&I investments in Brazil.   • Assess the impact  of new technologies in society, in particular the conse quences of their use  on labor relations and labor market, related to robotics and industrial automation.   • Implement actions aimed at developing a dynamic and competitive environment in the market  segment for devices, sensors, machines and equipment of IoT.   • Promote a business and regulatory environment that fosters the attraction of new investments  in connected devices, while ensuring trust  and confidence in cyberspace and preserving users'  rights.   • Encourage the ado ption of IoT solutions through g overnment technological demands.   Indicators   In this Strategy, suggested indicators  include those defined at the National IoT Plan, the National  Strategy for Advanced Manufacture, and Embrapa’s Strategic Plan (2014 -2034).   
      79  3. NEW BUSINESS MODELS   The digital environment, particularly that made feasible by the Internet , reduces entry barriers to  markets, open new business possibilities and allows the bringing about of disruptive business models.  Transformations come fast and demands from regulation experts and policy makers  great agility and  flexibility on creating a favorable environment to the development of the digital economy.     Digital Platforms   There is not a unique, consensual d efinition for “digital platform”. It is a term related to services and  functionalities avail able online in great variety,  which include search engines, social media, e commerce, online shops and price comparison websites. Generically, platforms can be defined by  some characteristics they have in common120, such as:   • Features which facilitate transac tions between users, as a way to generate revenue to platform  owners.   • Ability to collect, use and process large volume of personal and non -personal data, with the  purpose of user experience optimization ;  • Capacity for building networks where each additional  user enhances the overall user  experience – known as the “network effect” 121;  • Ability to create and shape new markets in more efficient arrangements, with greater benefits  to all users, generating strong and disruptive competition to traditional markets;   • Ability to organize new ways of social participation based on information gathering,  processing, altering and editing; and   • Dependence on information technologies as mean to develop the mentioned capacities.   In order to manage such high volume of traffic and data, digital platform companies invest  considerable amount of resources on hardware, software and staff. A 2015 OECD study, for instance,  estimates that each one of the main online sales platforms holds 2 8 datacenters around the world,  each containing between 50,000 and 80,000 servers. The largest businesses in this sector owned                                                              120 European Union Report, Commission Staff Working Document on Online Platforms – Communication on Online  Platforms and the Digital Single Market  COM(2016) 288, available on  https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1 -2016 -288-EN-F1-1.PDF    121 The “network effect” may represent an entry barrier to new digital platform supplies, since it raises opportunity costs for  the users to migrate information, relationships, activity history, etc. to a new platform.  
      80  together over 1 million servers in datacenters in 2013122.  FIGURE  17: PLAYERS  OF THE DIGITAL PLATFORMS ECOSYSTEM       An European Union  report123 on the subject classifies platforms in five different business models:   1. Online marketplaces , where transactions between buyers and sellers (of both services and  goods) are mediated124;  2. Mobile ecosystems and application distribution pla tforms (“app stores”),  as smartphones  became the focus for a new software and digital content market, allowing app stores to  become online markets;   3. Internet search engines : the fundamental role of a s earch engine is to facilitate information                                                              122 Data extracted from New Form s of Work in The Digital Economy .

Social media and content platforms : these services allow connections, content sharing,  business, communication and idea expression for individuals and organizations. Their main  revenue source is advertising and monetization of aggregated data from users; and   5. Online advertising platforms , which buy and sell advertising spaces on Internet pages.   With the advent of many market opportunities and strong incentives for innov ation in technology and  business models, digital platforms became a drive for economic growth, innovation, efficiency and  competitiveness, bolstering investment in digital technology, e -commerce and online services.   Platforms financial returns vary, and ma y include direct payments from users, advertising, fees over  particular transactions, donations, etc. Platforms can combine supply and demand of different markets  simultaneously, explore network effects in and through markets, and shape the rules and condi tions  of such markets. A typical example of platform business model is the association of online information  search and social contacts with targeted advertising, based upon users input and its correlation to the  online advertising market. In order to supp ly such services, this business model monetize data  aggregates, both personal and non -personal, which touches a light on the privacy subject discussed in depth in the “Building Trust and Confidence in the Digital Economy” thematic axis.   Diagnosis   Online ma rketplaces   The main purpose of online marketplace is to be an online space dedicated to intermediate  transactions, aiming cost reduction and the interests convergence between buyers and sellers. This  environment is improved by trust building mechanisms, su ch as certificates, ranking of platform users,  restriction of certain payment modalities to avoid fraud, establishment of codes of conduct and good  practices, among others125.   On one hand, s ome platforms create economies of scale, transition and efficiency costs reduction, and  also opportunities for job openings and extra income for individuals and small and medium  enterprises.  Business include “physical” (accommodation, transport, repairs, personal services, etc.)  and digital services (data input and treatm ent, graphic design, legal and business consulting, etc.).   On the other hand, some common particularities of online platforms – such as transnationality and  susceptibility to the network effect, the lock -in effect and the first player advantage – may prese nt  regulatory and competition challenges.                                                               125 126 EU, Commission Staff Working Document on Online Platforms , ibid . 
      82  Revenue of marketplace platforms usually comes from commissions charged by intermediation  services in trusted online spaces and by advertising on platform’s website126.     Mobile ecosystems and applications platforms   The widespread of mobile devices was accompanied by full -time connectivity, not only of users but  also of real -world everyday objects, such as cars, accessories, home appliances, machines, and others.  Mobile devices also evolved to currently produced smart phones: complex tools whose functionality  goes way beyond voice communication and includes access to diversified content, services and  products from anywhere, anytime. This situation demands new and specific software applications to  meet users preferences and a new access  environment to digital content127.   Mobile access to digital technology has becoming a dominant source of income for service providers,  as the time dedicated to the mobile devices increased from 12.7% in 2008 to 54.6% in 2015128, and the  software download volume is estimated in 270 billion apps in 2017129. Furthermore, the app market  expands quickly as from 2008, when the first app stores were launched, with a total generated revenue  around 30 billion euros for developers in 2015130. Jobs created by the app industry in Brazil in January  2017 are estimated at 146,000. 131  In th is scenario , applications digital platforms for both mobile and desktop devices (known as app  stores or app marketplaces) are key agents of digital economy by their influence on diversity of  functions and features of the digital environment, especially if one considers  the prospective diffusion  of Internet of Things, which will connect the web a vast number of devices.   Such platforms present good conditions to developers to offer products and services in a variety of  applications, while acting as a hub for different fea tures for mobile functionalities according to users’  preferences. In this way, transaction costs are reduced with lower expenditure in payment tools,  accountability, definition of rules and terms of use, etc. It is a context which facilitates the network  effect: the more applications are available on the app store, the more users will search for  specific  apps in that platform132.  It is a fruitful environment for providing services and products, with wide room for innovation and  development possibilities for s mall and medium enterprises. However, this same structure may also  amalgamate access to apps into one or a few platforms, whose competitive advantages should be                                                                127 EU, Commission Staff Working Document on Online Platforms , ibid.   128 TechCrunch, “Consumers Spend 85% Of Time On Smartphones In Apps, But Only 5 Apps See Heavy Use” , published on  June 22, 2015 .

      83  monitored for eventual risk of market concentration.   Internet search engines   This type of platf orm aims to facilitate the search for  information by the end user, in a digital environment  where a massive volume of data is generated  everyday – approximately 4.51 billion webpages are  indexed daily133. In terms of revenue, growth  expectations in 2016 were amounted to 95.5 billion  euros, which represe nted 53% of that year’s total  revenue in advertising134. In Brazil, online advertising  revenue was estimated to reach 5.7 billion reais in  2016. 135  The Internet search market is highly concentrated:  only one service performs over 90% of all web  searches world wide, with a similar proportion in  web searches in Brazil136.   The most common search services are often grouped  into different specifications: general search method,  based on queries with words and expressions ; image  search, analyzing titles, size and/or image  characteristics; map search, with addresses,  locations or GPS coordinates; and the vertical model,  specialized in specific online content, such as travel,  health or academic information.   Due to the exponential increase  of both available  information a nd users of the digital environment  facilities, search engines face the challenge of  filtering and personalizing content access, a  challenge that may become intensified by broader  digitalization of entire economic sectors and other  aspects of social life. As important tools for finding  and accessing digital content, search engines are  becoming true mediators to access to information.   Search activities are carried on by algorithms and automated decisions by computers, which may rise                                                              133 Statistics available on http://www.worldwidewebsize.com/ , accessed on 11/07/2017.   134 Brazil – European Union Sector Dialogue.

Accessed on 21/02/2018.   Challenges to traditional regulation  methods   The steep growth of digital platforms and  their dissemination among the general  public in the past few years have  brought  an intense debate over  the platforms  disruptive effect on their  respective markets.   The traditional methods for market  regulation are put into question,  demanding  efforts to evaluate and  update rules and regulations  facing  new  challenges in the digital environment,  namely to competition, taxes, protection  of fundamental rights, among others.   In this sense, economic regulation by  anti-trust authorities may  become  a  key mechanism if barriers to competition,  resulted from market domain by the large  digital platforms,  are to  be confirmed.   A regulatory policy in this subject should  avoid excessive dependency on digital  platforms that generate intense network  effect, and guarantee a leveled playing  field for competition to different agents  and businesses  offering  innovative  services to end users.  
      84  questions about the adopt ed criteria for the resulting output.   Content and social media platforms   Social media and digital content platforms usually do not charge directly their users, since their main  source of revenue is advertising and monetization of aggregated de -personalized  data. In 2016, the  global social media market generated approximately 30 billion euros and is expected to grow to 45.5  billion euros until 2020137.  Such applications offer interaction through virtual social networks and also reassure the freedom of  expression, as they allow social interactions efficiently, with no necessity of meeting others in person.   By the same reasons, these platforms may influence individual behavior or even the business  environment. Consequently, digital agents in social and co ntent online platforms may be used in  political or publicity campaigns , which raises the need for further ponderations about the market  dimension and the protection of civil rights in such a scenario.   Platforms of online advertising   In an increasingly digi talized economy, advertising agencies have been using digital platforms  dedicated to sell advertising space online. In the digital world, every access can be used as means for  publicity and advertising, which can be improved through service personalization  available on the web,  as describe on the “Data -driven Economy” section of this document.   These platforms allow the reduction of under -utilized resources, as often happens in generalized  advertising, with greater efficiency in content monetization and more  focus on niche markets with  lesser consumers. Such efficiency draws an expansion of advertising platforms, with considerable  impact on the advertisement market. In 2015, some estimates pointed out that online advertising  amounted US$170.17 billion, or 29. 9% of the global revenue in the advertisement market138.   Vision   • Recognition of  the role played by digital platforms on innovation and economic development,  considering their diversity on access to content, goods and services, as well as reduction of  transa ction costs and of market access for small and medium enterprises.   • Analysis and evaluation of the activities carried out by some players in the platform ecosystem,  due to their mediation role on the access to information. Such role has positive effects in  service personalization, though it may present a risk for freedom of expression and access to  information.                                                               137 Brazil – European Union Sector Dialogue.

      85  • Evaluation on the economic power concentration risk in the digital platform market, which  demands an update in regulation and anti -trust authorities  and norms.   • Fostering the development of national companies in the digital platform market, with respect  to the legal certainty principle.   Strategic Actions   • To create a legal benchmark on the digital environment aiming its modernization, as to create  incen tives to innovation and investments, prevent excessive market power by some economic  agents, and to make feasible the informational autonomy of consumers, considering the  specificities of online markets.   • To stimulate compliance of digital platforms regardi ng fundamental rights, including the  discussion on the use of algorithms for automated decision.   • To incentive digital technology businesses to adopt high -quality transparency standards for  the criteria used in algorithms, as a way to maximize access to inf ormation by end users,  granted the protection of trade secrets and respecting technical limitations.   • To improve competition conditions between online platforms and intermediaries which offer  innovative services to final consumes, identifying mechanisms abl e to mitigate network and  lock-in effects generated by the scale -up of digital platforms.     E-Commerce Platforms   One of the main engines of digital economy is the e -commerce pulled up by digital platforms dedicated  to the transaction of goods and services.   Diagnosis   The global revenue of e -commerce platforms is rapidly expanding. Total sales in traditional retail  markets were estimated at US$ 22 trillion in 2016, and total sales in e -commerce reached US$ 1.9  trillion, with a 23% growth in comparison to the p revious year. 139  Brazil ranked 51st in the 2016 B2C E -commerce Index, published yearly by the United Nations  Commission on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)140, having dropped from the 47th position in 2015.                                                               139 eMarketer Report: Worldwide Retail Ecommerce Sal es: The eMarketer Forecast for 2016 .  140 Available on http://unctad.org/en/PublicationsLibrary/tn_unctad_ict4d07_en.pdf , accessed on 10/10/2017.  
      86  The index considers the proportion of Internet users, the number of safe data servers, the diffusion of  credit card use, and the trust index by the Universal Postal Union (UPU).   Brazil ranks 10th in world’s largest e -commerce markets141. Transactions in e -commerce reached 44  billion reais in 2016, with a nomina l increase of 7.4% compared to 2015. The average ticket – the  average price of a single sale – reached 418 reais, an 8% increase in relation to 2015142, pulled by the  sales of products with higher added value.   The amount of Brazilian online consumers in 2016 increased 22% when compared to 2015, reaching  48 million people. Of those, 21.2 million s pent US$2.4 in shopping from international websites, with a  US$ 35.69 average ticket143. The device most often used for shopping was the mobile device, in 21.5%  of buys. Over 50% of the total financial volume in those transactions was spent on home appliance s,  electronics and smartphones.   In this scenario, Brazil’s strengths lie on  the large dimensions of consumer’s  market, the existence of advanced  electronic payment services and  modern e -commerce platforms  able to  handle high demand levels, and the  existen ce of sophisticated logistical  services in large urban areas. Some  issues that may hinder further  developments in e -commerce, such as  safe transactions, protection in buying  and selling agreements, conflict  resolution mechanisms, and protection  of consumer s rights with no  unnecessary obstacles for private  initiative and competition, still remain in  both Brazil and abroad.   National e -commerce platforms are focused on domestic market. The large size of Brazilian do mestic  market draws attention from internatio nal players in e -commerce; the internationalization of Brazilian  e-commerce platforms, however, is incipient. The participation of Brazilian businesses on international  e-commerce is well below its potential, which reflects on the commercial balance: Brazi lian buys  abroad sum up to 2.4 billion reais per year, while the sells adds up to 1 billion reais a year144.                                                              141 142 143 144 Ebit.

In some cases, international e -commerce pla tforms hinder Brazilian businesses from using their  websites to sell to other countries (through geographic restrictions or similar rules) and, at the same  time, allow foreign businesses to sell in Brazil. The lack of reciprocity show the necessity to eval uate  the regulatory framework for international platforms.   Vision   • The following points must be improved for the e -commerce development:   • Strengthening of international presence of Brazilian e -commerce platforms, in alignment with  the e -Xport Brazil Program,  as detailed in the “International Dimension” axis.   • Capacity -building of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) managers for the digital world.   • Facilitated access to credit by business, especially small business dedicated to e -commerce.   • Simpler and digitalize d fiscal and legal systems.   • Culture of business internationalization in the digital environment.   • Offering of information and training to the online exporter.     
      88  Strategic Actions   • To promote actions, such as the creation of logistics programs and opening of s pecific funds,  to support small and medium enterprises (SMEs) dedicated to e -commerce.   • To integrate automatic,  online and offline  systems dedicated to payment charging, as well as  e-commerce exports issuing procedures and side operations , including processes for logistics  and taxation.   • To stimulate the adoption of alternative, friendly conflict resolution mechanisms for e commerce consumer issues.   • To include articles and clauses concerning the international presence of e -commerce platforms  in recent bilateral and multilateral commercial agreements negotiated by Brazil.   • To support the implementation of safety and security mechanisms for online shopping.   • To support initiatives for the development and use of digital payment.

Among all value  chains involved in digital transformation, music and audiovisual industries were the first to face swift   and radical change in the way that their services and products reach the general public. A few years  back, distribution was made in great part by selling physical copies of records and films, which involved  copy production in different media, storage, distribution and merchandise space  in physical stores.  Today, the elements in this process were mostly substituted by streaming technologies, because of  wide dissemination of smartphones and broadband Internet access. Control from artists and musicians  over their own work is increasingly d iffuse and weakened.   The impact is substantial in all sectors related to creative economy, presenting new regulatory  challenges for the music and audiovisual industries.  
      89  Diagnosis   In the new scenario of digitalization and digital commerce, digital transformation greatly impacts on  production, distribution and consumption of cultural goods and services, changing the existing  business models, creating new businesses and widely modifying productive chains, with the  emergence of new players.   Music   Brazi l is currently the 11th largest musical market in the world145 and the source of renowned creativity  in the international music scene.  Transition to streaming technology, however, lead to a decrease in  revenue generated by the use of musical work. One of the  most visible impacts of technological  advancements and the new ways to enjoy music is the diminishing of royalties to artists in the new  platforms, when compared with the average that existed  before.146  This results from a phenomenon known as “value gap”, b y which the raise in music consumption is not  followed by a proportional increase in revenue. Between 2014 and 2015, the volume of music accessed  online increased 132%, while its revenue to copyright owners raised only 11%.147   According to the Global Music Report 2017  by the  International Federation of the Phonographic  Industry (IFPI),148 there are over 100 million paying users of music streaming services today. Between  2015 and 2016, revenue generated by digital music formats increased 17.7%, reaching a total  of US$7.8  billion, and the streaming services revenue increased 60%, while the sales of physical formats dropped  7.6% and falling. The digital services revenue in the music industry are more than half of total revenue  for the first time.   The same report states that the Brazilian records industry shrank 2.6% in 2016, due mainly to drops in  CDs and DVDs sales. Conversely, digital sales increased 23% and the streaming segment increased  52.4%. Digital music market revenue reached 45% of total revenue and kept  with the world trend.   Regarding the protection of copyright, concerns were raised by artist and composers around the world  about the low paying rate from music commercially available in online platforms, in particular  streaming services. There are issues of transparency, access facilities and the full understanding of  platform rules, which require leverage for negotiation of payment terms in music platforms149.  Despite the regulation recently approved by the Brazilian government on some aspects of digital                                                              145 Pró Música Brasil – Produtores Fonográficos Associados.

      90  platform legislation150, the transnational character of such services sets the agenda on international  level. For this reason, Brazil together with other Latin American countries presented a discussion paper  on the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIP O) in 2016, as a debate proposal about this and  other aspects concerning the use of musical work in the digital environment.151  Audiovisual   The National Cinema Agency (ANCINE) developed a study with data from the audiovisual industry,  showing that b etween 2007 and 2013, this industry ’s share in the Brazilian economy increased 66%,  from 0.38% to 0.54% of GDP , with a total value of 24.5 billion reais in 2014 . The paid TV segment,  favored by the regulatory effect brought by Law 12.485, increased its par ticipation in the sector’s  added value by 21.4% between 2007 and 2014 .152  The online transmission of digital video on-demand  – known as VOD153 – may be classified into two  categories: 1) VOD offered by cable TV companies as stand alone programs; and 2) over the top  services (OTT), based on platforms installed over the broadband infrastructure which offer audiovisual  services to end users.   The e stimated proportion of people who accessed video on -demand by OTT platforms at least once a  day increased from 30% to 50% of all the broadband Internet users, from 2010 to 2015. The average  time spent weekly watching movies and TV series in OTT doubled bet ween 2011 and 2015. In Brazil,  the penetration of such services is estimated in 49% of Internet users, similar to the US A and greater  then those of Canada and Mexico. 154  Traditional TV cable operators struggle to extend their services and create alternative s to OTT, adding  value and online content to their services with no extra cost to subscribers. At the same time, TV cable  operators are also starting to explore their own OTT services independently, establishing their own  OTT platforms for streaming.   A stu dy conducted by ANCINE and the National Telecommunication Agency (ANATEL)  in March 2016  indicates that streaming platforms are focused on market niches, offering content that compete  against premium channel combos of cable TV, with lower prices. Furthermore, such streaming services                                                              150 Instruction published on May 4, 2016 by the Ministry of Culture establishes “complementary procedures to entitle  copyright collective supervision organizations t he ability to charge fees, as set by article 5 of Law n. 12,965/2014”.   151 OMPI. “Proposal for Analysis of Copyright Related to the Digital Environment” , Standing Committee on Copyright and  Related Rights.

      93  Digital Entrepreneurship   Diagnosis   The changes caused by the digital transformation have been altering the way to generate wealth in  the economy. The United Nations investment report157 reveals that, between 2010 and 2015, assets in  technology businesses grew 11% while those in other industries increased only 1% in average. In the  same way, the gap between companies able to develop new technologies an d those remaining in  traditional business models is increasing progressively. In this context, it is reasonable to conclude is  that the capacity of adding economic value is increasingly related to the ability of developing goods  and services intensive in i ntangible capital, which is made possible mainly by digital technologies.   Another transformation triggered by the digital economy is the significant alteration in work relations.  The tendency to segregate activities with task automation and the necessity t o aggregate value to  human activity are conducive to a scenario where the future worker will have grater responsibility to  manage  risk, strategy and operations instead of performing physical, repeated tasks.  The vertical  hierarchy line between boss and emp loyee tends to be substituted by a multitude of horizontal  relations, with a increasing number of people with greater autonomy in work and value creation.   In this scenario, the existence of emerging technology -based businesses, usually known as startups, i s  of great importance, as they provide digital services with high added value. Startups are agile  businesses which can swiftly appropriate new ways and methods of work and production, and are  responsible to insert entrepreneurial dynamism and innovation in  different economic sectors. Startups  have flourished and competed in the most diverse market activities, overcoming entry barriers even  in oligopoli stic sectors. All those elements are an indication that digital technologies have promoted  new ways of prod ucing and new economic relations, valuing self -employment and entrepreneurship,  and indicating the need for a culture change for employers and employees.   The Brazilian information technology sector, contrary to tendencies in other economy sectors in the  country, have been growing in the past few years. According to some statistical databases, Brazilian  GDP decreased 3.8% between 2014 and 2015158, while the national tech industry increased 20%159.  In Latin America, venture capital investments are growing consid erably, corresponding to US$ 594  million in 2015, a 53% increase when compared to 2012. Even with the 2015 economic stagnation, the                                                              157 UNCTAD, “Trends in assets, operating revenues and employees of the 2015 top 100 MNEs” , in World Investment Report ,  Chapter 4,  p. 162.

      94  startup accelerators, angel investors networks160  and venture capital funds in Brazil financed at least  195 startups during t he first semester that year161.  The startup and entrepreneurial investment market is growing in Brazil. Between 2011 and 2015, Brazil  housed 63% of all startup investment in Latin America162. There are over 150 private equity and venture  capital companies in the country, investing on over 1,500 nascent companies163. The early stage   segment is also advancing quickly164, with over 4,500 startups165, 300 incubators and 25 acceleration  programs in Brazil , along with 40 accelerators which invested R$ 51 million in 865 st artups166.   The following figure represents the startup financing cycle:   FIGURE 19: STARTUP FINANCING CYCLE      Source : NOVOA, Jaime.

Usually, such investors create  network associations to mitigate risk and make investment analysis more accurate.   161 Privacap. Spotlight on Brazil , 2016.

      95  In Brazil, some initiatives from the government and from private entities to promote  entrepreneurship  and startups are well succeeded. Some examples of such initiatives, carried on by the federal  government, include the InovAtiva Brasil Program168, the Startup Brazil Program, the National Business  Incubator and Technological Parks Support P rogram (PNI)169, and the Industry Startup Connection  Program. 170  Such initiatives are generally focused on innovative businesses in all sectors (such as ICT, industry,  services, agribusiness), anywhere in the nation. They give assistance to novice entrepreneu rs to  transform promising technologies in fast -growing businesses, or facilitating their integration into the  value chain of large corporations.     Digital Games   The digital games market generated US$ 1,27 billion in Brazil in 2016, which made the country rank 12th  worldwide. However, most Brazilian game factories – 74.4% – have revenues up to R$ 240,000 a year;  24% are within the R$ 240,000 and R$ 240 million revenue range; and the remaining 4% earn between  R$ 2.4 million and R$ 16 million. All earnings co mbined represent a very small participation in the world  game market revenue. The Brazilian gaming industry is mostly composed by new, small businesses, in  great part internationalized from day one. The industry is estimated to have doubled since the last  assessment  in 2014, which numbered 133 game companies.   Most entrepreneurs create games for mobile (80%) and online platforms (63%), and entertainment games  are predominant (97%). Half of business es are also dedicated to professional games. Final products a re  distributed on app platforms (67%), direct download platforms (39%) , businesses own websites (38%) and  social media (35%). Financing sources include own resources (64%), incubators (26%) and non -refundable  funds (18 %). The relationship between businesses and universities is of great importance to financing and  game production.   Global data on the digital games industry demonstrate that Brazil has a relevant  participation in the  economic circuit, though without necessarily creating virtuous circle s on domestic demand and supply.  The Brazilian digital games industry is yet in the initial development phase and needs to be consolidated  by sector expansion and greater professionalization of businesses and entrepreneurs.   Brazil, however, faces some rel evant obstacles to the full development of a digital entrepreneurship  of international magnitude. The most important obstacles include: (i) deficit of programmers and other  qualified workforce estimated in 92 thousand professionals171; (ii) lack of motivatio n for students into                                                              volumes.

      96  an entrepreneurial culture; (iii) long time and bureaucracy required to open and close businesses; (iv)  labor laws do not allow wages agreements usually adopted by startups in other countries; and (v) high  cost on money, time and staff dedicated to pay taxes.   Human capital is the fundamental input for nascent businesses, as it is impossible to develop products  intensive on intangible capital without appropriate, competent workforce. In the short run, one  solution to this problem may be t o simplify and facilitate procedures required by the Immigration Law  for recruiting foreign professionals 172. In the long run, initiatives of professional training in digital  technologies and of multidisciplinary studies in related fields must be adapted to  meet the market  needs, as detailed in the axis “Education and Professional Qualification” in this document.   One of the main challenges in financing digital entrepreneurship is to increase venture capital offer,  which is essential to leverage startups grow th. For this end, it is necessary to stimulate financing offer  for the early stages of the startup life cycle, including the “death valley”, aiming to provide easier, safer  access to funds and financial support for digital entrepreneurship and risk investm ents. An example of  such initiatives is the cooperated investment fund launched in November 2017 by the National Bank  for Economic and Social Development (BNDES) , which complements angel investors funds with the  necessary resources for the startup to run.   Another great challenge faced by startups is global competition. The Internet allows a massive supply  of services by foreign businesses and accelerates the emerging of new competitors and new products  and services. For this reason, it is necessary to inten sify actions aiming the internationalization of  Brazilian startups and contribute to the development of national digital entrepreneurship – one  example of such actions is the federal government program StartOut Brazil. It is essential to encourage  a global  mentality in new entrepreneurs from the beginning, and to set the conditions for international  competitiveness of startups, including the reconsideration of some obligations (such as tax or labor  obligations) that may imply extra costs.   Government support  may also be an important catalyzer for entrepreneurial environment.  Government programs demand closer coordination as they reach maturation, as a way to optimize  resource allocation and the management of public instruments which can support startups in th eir  different stages. This includes efforts to appropriately identify and improve roles and responsibilities  of governments, private sector, academic institutions and the civil society, all contributing to the  national startup ecosystem.   There are several difficulties to hire startups in public agencies, which is verified in many countries.  The public administration runs on tighter rules for purchases and contracts, such as experience,  referral and financial sustainability requirements, which may be prohibi tive to startups and greatly  differ from the way they operate. Startups, however, offer great potential of innovative solutions for  the public sector, and countries such as Australia, United Kingdom, India and the US are considering  this issue, assessing d ifferent ways to make public contracts with startups more flexible and feasible.173                                                               172 Law n. 13,455/2017.   173 Startup Daily. “Government launches ICT Procurement Taskforce to explore how to better do business with startups ” 
      97  This is a good opportunity for Brazil to formulate similar assessments. One proposal of public policy  that may seize opportunities in the digital economy is to use digital s olutions created by startups , with  low implementation costs,  for public services. Also, IT solutions based in open government data may  be good alternatives for improving quality and efficiency in public services.   Fintechs – Digital financial technologies   In 2016, the Brazilian Central Bank created an inter -departmental workgroup to assess and evaluate  technology innovations that impact the financial and payments systems. One of the evaluated  technologies is the Distributed Ledger Technology – DLT, also know n as blockchain . A number of public  consultations in this subject  were made in 2017.   Possible regulations will define the future of new digital technology applied to the financial sector.  Regulation is increasingly considered as a push for innovation, as it may open ground for innovative  solutions while preserving legal security and the rule of law.   Financial technologies and their related businesses (generally known as fintechs ) may present benefits  to the sector, such as allowing a highly resilient finan cial infrastructure, quick and efficient  liquidity, and  new ways to codify , share and analyze financial data. Also, there are possibilities for shorter and faster  transaction chains and greater capital efficiency. For consumers, advantages include wider ch oice range  for financial services, better financial advice and competitive prices.   Fintechs may also have a positive impact for society at large, offering a more inclusive financial system,  with tailored and cheaper financial solutions, and better risk share and capital allocation. Furthermore,  they are able to produce better credit scoring with a more precise credit and risk assessment.   Vision   Some initiatives may be enlarged or strengthened to make Brazil a more friendly environment for  digital entrep reneurship. Such initiatives include incentives for business ideation and modelling,  capacity -building for entrepreneurs, combined use of physical space (co -working and networking) at  lower cost for early stage startups, incubation and acceleration program s, fund raising and insertion  at the entrepreneurial ecosystem, incentives for initial investments, mentorship and building of market  connections.   It is necessary to reformulate legal and tax mechanisms with the objective to facilitate startup financing  and reduce costs and investment risk associated to bureaucracy and legal security. It is also necessary  to facilitate the creation of more complex corporate forms (for instance, the transition from private  limited company to corporation), which diversifies t he available financing mechanisms for digital                                                               http://www.startupdaily.net/2016/11/government -ict-procurement -taskforce -start ups/ ; Code for America. “ Procurement  101”. https://www.codeforamerica.org/how -tos/procurement -101; The Economic Times. “ All startups are now eligible for  exemption from any prior experi ence in public procurement ”:  http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/articleshow/53515664.cms?utm_source=contentofinterest&utm_medium=text&ut m_campaign=cppst ; The Guardian. “ Startups get less than 3% of government spend, this must change ”.  https://www.theguardian.com/small -business -network/2015/aug/19/three -percent -government -contracts -startups change -growth , accessed on 25/07/2017.  
      98  businesses.   Another relevant aspect of digital entrepreneurship is the fostering of an entrepreneurial culture which  may simplify businesses life cycle. Thus, it is important to strengthen actions that encourag e a “failure start -over cycle” mindset, modernize corporate law and forms, simplify rules to open and close a  business, reduce bureaucracy, raise competitiveness, simplify license acquirement, and structure a  regulatory environment which does not hinder in novative business models.   It is essential to seek a higher Brazilian rank in the international entrepreneurship indexes, particularly  in digital entrepreneurship, as a way to insert Brazil in the global venture capital and investments chain.  The developmen t of a digital entrepreneurship culture is also desirable, with improvement in  workforce and closer interaction between professional education institutions and the private sector.   Strategic Actions   • To support at least 200 digital startups each year  through coordinated initiatives in the federal  government.   • To improve legal framework related to workforce and labor relations in startups, including  actions to simplify and facilitate procedures required for recruiting foreign professionals.   • To stimulate  capacity -building in order to create a workforce specialized in digital technology,  increasing the offer of expert professionals with adequate competences and abilities for the  digital economy.   • To reformulate legal and tax mechanisms to reduce costs and i nvestment risk, and to facilitate  the creation of more complex corporate forms, which diversifies the available financing  mechanisms for digital businesses.   • To stimulate financial offer to early stage digital startups, creating an internationally  competiti ve environment which attracts venture capital investments.   • To stimulate an entrepreneurial culture with a “failure -start -over cycle” mindset, which may  include actions to revise rules and procedures regarding bankruptcy, as well as opening and  closing busi nesses.   • To s trengthen initiatives to mitigate bureaucracy for stronger competitiveness, such as  modernizing societal and corporate models, simplify license acquirement, and structure a  regulatory environment which does not hinder innovative business models .  • To p romote actions to internationalize Brazilian startups.   • To improve and articulate government initiatives which support digital startups, including  startup acceleration, fund raising, mentorship and networking with potential investors,  universities and  businesses.  
      99  • To improve regulation to facilitate startup hiring by the government, creating opportunities to  adopt solutions which addresses public interest issues in healthcare, education, public safety,  and in other areas.   • To develop flexible regulatory environments (“regulatory sandboxes”) for testing of innovative  business models.   Indicators   Suggested indicators include those developed by the S tartup Brasil and Inovativa Bras il programs, as  well as statistics compiled by the  Brazilian Agency  of Promotio n of exports and investments (Apex Brazil).         
      100  G. Digital Transformation in the Government   Making the government more dynamic, efficient, problem -solving and  closer to the society, as to make citizens lives easier.     The Brazilian State has a fundamental role in digital transformation in economy and society, namely  by its ability to foster its own digit al transformation. The d igitalization of public and government  services is relevant not only to increase efficiency of  government activities, in terms of costs and  rationalization, but also to achieve greater effectiveness in social participation and in citizen’s  satisfaction regarding services provided. The state is a particularly significant protagonist in issues such  as education and health services.   As an entity which organizes and represents society, the state concentrates increasing aspirations and  expectations, intensified by the velocity of social, economic and technological transformations. In such  scenario, there  is no room for indifference by the state.   Digital technology holds a double -sided role regarding the state activities: creates potential for  efficiency gains and service improvement, and presents challenges to social coordination by the state,  directing t owards it many different social demands.   There are at least three main guidelines for public policy on citizenship and digital government. Digital  technology must be used to i) increase transparency and social accountability, ii) enlarge social  participati on in policy making, and iii) provide more and better digital public services.   By formulating and implementing policy within those three guidelines, the state is expected to meet  the needs of society, preserving and strengthening its role as a coordinator of social transformation.   Thus, it is important to increase efforts for an intensive use of ICT, aiming to redesign state structures,  procedures and processes, and tighten the relationship with other social players, in order to make  public institutions mor e responsive and aligned with the needs of society at large. Data transparency  and offering must be guaranteed, with the implementation of better digital interaction and  collaboration channels between state and society, swifter and modern models for public  service  providing, and allowing greater convenience for the citizens.   ICT applications in public sector must be under a new paradigm. Introducing technology for punctual  improvements in processes and services is no longer sufficient: there must be a redes ign of a digital  ecosystem which makes interactions between the state and society more simple and feasible. The  fundament of the digital government is to create public value to society by utilizing  ICT. In other words,  it means to apply the transforming p otential of ICT to benefit the society, as in:   • Goods and services more adequate to citizens’ needs;   • Simple access to services ; 
      101  • Offering of p ublic service offering which meet the needs for justice, equality, efficiency and  effectiveness;   • Distributing p ublic  benefits efficiently and proportionally; and   • Creating value from open government data.   The state must be conceived as an entity inserted in the digital environment where public policy is  designed as digital solutions. It is necessary to make a transition from the simple technology  consumption to the full digital immersion  in generating and providing services. There must be a leap  from the “e -government” to the digital government.   Diagnosis   In 2016, Brazil ranked 51st among 193 countries in the United Natio ns E -Government Development  Index (UN EGDI)  174, going up 10 positions since 2010, which indicates that the digitalization policy is in  a right track, despite the need for adjustments. Brazil still ranks below other American countries, like  the United States  (12th position), Canada (14th), Uruguay (34th), Argentina (41st) and Chile (42nd). One  of the main dimensions in this indicator is the online services index (OSI), in which Brazil ranked 38th in  2016 (data from 2015) among 193 countries, with a total of 0 .7319 points.   FIGURE  20: BRAZIL ’S EGDI  PERFORMANCE IN COMPA RISON WITH THE WORLD  LEADER                                                                 174 UN EGDI is a United Nations research carried out every two years. It consists in a weighted average of three normalized  scores on three important digital government dimensions: online services covering and quality (Online Service Index – OSI),  telecom infrastructure developme nt level (Telecommunication Infrastructure Index – TII) and human capital (Human Capital  Index – HCI). The index value is normalized between 0 and 1 as a derivation from the arithmetic average of the three scores.

According to Cetic.br estimates, 61%  of the 107.9 million Internet users in Brazil have sought government information or services online in  2016. The most demanded public services and informatio n were work and social security (28%),  education (26%), taxes (24%), personal documentation (21%), health (16%), police and security (10%)  and transportation (10%)175. Such data demonstrate the great significance of online public service  demand.   However, while the amount of Brazilians with  Internet access is increasing in the past years, the  proportion of Internet users effectively benefiting  from online public services remains constant. This  is an indication that service supply must be  expanded, with greater efficacy and efficiency, so  more citizens may request and follow up to public  services without the need to visit a physical service  center.   The main advantages of public process and service digitalization could include:    • Meeting a growing soci al demand:  citizens are increasingly adapting to social media  experience and private services provided in digital environment. Population in general,                                                              175 CETIC.br.

      103  especially younger people, are less and less tolerant with long lines and time consuming  procedures for bu reaucracy and paper work.   • Economy:  online transactions tend to be significantly cheaper to citizens, businesses and the  government. Not only time and money are saved, but also workforce, business processes and  even rental space for personal service and doc ument storage.   • Integration and convergence:  digital interactions allow service centralization and,  consequently, less fragmentation of di fferent government services for citizens.  Service  convergence into a few contact points bring greater efficiency and co nvenience to people.   • Security and privacy:  digital public services allow greater trust and confidence in personal data  protection.   • Service quality:  digitalization allows service standardization, which is a relevant trust factor in  government.   Financial sav ings are an important incentive to service digitalization. The cost of an online service is  often substantially inferior to a similar service provided in person, which represents a great economy  in public resources. According to an international benchmark (see figure 22 below), the average cost  of online services may reach 2.73% of an in -person service. Estimates by the Ministry of Planning and  Budget point out that the average cost of a personal service is R$43.68, while the online version of the  same serv ice may cost R$1.20 – an economy of over 97% in public funds per transaction.

The results  were revealing, showing that digitalization indeed allows great savings in taxpayer money: the online  service channel costed R$ 0.07 per t ransaction, the telephone service costed R$ 5.72 and the  automated totem transaction costed R$ 0.35. Brazil advanced ten positions in the United Nations E 
      104  Government Development Index between 2010 and 2016, but still ranks 51 among 193 countries.   The Feder al government implemented a number of initiatives to achieve greater efficiency and  intelligence in public services using digital technology for both internal and external activities. The most  recent initiative is the Digital Governance Strategy (EGD)176, instituted by the Executive Decree no.  8,638 in January 2016 and revised in May 2018.   The purpose of EGD is to combine and integrate initiatives for digital transformation in federal  government bodies and institutions, which will contribute to increase effec tiveness and benefits for  the Brazilian society through wider access to government information, digital public services and  deeper social participation.   The EGD framework is represented by the diagram below:     FIGUR E 23: DIGITAL GOVERNANCE STRATEGY FRAMEWORK   Source : Ministry of Planning, Development and Budget.   The economy of the future is strongly based on data use and treatment. A highly significant portion of  this data is maintained or stored by the government. In this sense, the Ministry of Plan ning had  structured three initiatives to upgrade government data use and handling: the Federal Government                                                              176 The Digital Governance Strategy website is www.planejamento.gov.br/EGD  (in Port uguese).   
      105  Data Analysis Platform, the Interoperability Platform177, and the Citizen Digital A uthentication   solutions.   The Federal Government Data Analysis Platfo rm is a tech platform for government data analysis,  trusteeship, mining and integration, which converges the main government databases in one place. It  is composed by data crossing and analysis tools for decision making, with fraud and project failure  iden tification features. Its goal is to reduce costs and simplify government data access in an integrated  mechanism.   The Data and System Interoperability Platform is a interoperability bus system aimed to facilitate data  reuse and integration for public servic e. One example of modernized service using this platform is the  passport emission procedure, now based on electronic information exchange for some documental  pre-requisites (such as regular electoral and military service records), which dispenses the  prese ntation of the actual documents that the government already owns.   The Data Analysis Platform will be complete with a authentication solution for the citizen, which will  propitiate public records integration between public offices. Its goal is to build and maintain a “golden  record” of each citizen with public records and data quality. Such process will allow digital  identification, offering a common, failure -free reference point with interoperability capacity among  the main government databases.   Another important front of EGD is the open data  policy. An effective open data policy is crucial for  the construction of experimental spaces in which  innovative solutions for society challenges may  be tested by citizens and enterprises in  interaction with public agents, with transparency  and accountability. It is possible to create value  from data by its treatment, deriving new services  and information from it. For that reason, it is  important to develop an environment conducive  to new business models built  on open data,  which will foster value generation and greater  market dynamics in this sector, with positive social impact.   A study by the OECD178 points out that open data policies in different countries target greater  transparency, government social control , creation of public value, cost reduction for both public and  private sectors, and new, more effective solutions for challenges in society.                                                               177 The Government Data Analysis and the System Interoperability platforms were created according to the Executive Decree  n. 8.789, de 29 de junho de 2016.   178 OECD. 2013 Survey on Open Government Data , in “Government at a Glance 2013” .  Digital transformation in the  government allows better services to  the citizens. Besides, government  online transactions may save up to  97% of in -person services costs.  
      106  FIGURE 24:  MAIN REASONS FOR GOVERNMEN T OPEN DATA STRATEGI ES    Fonte: OCDE, 2017 Survey on Open Government Data, in “Government at a Glance 2017”.   In Brazil, open data policy is implemented by the Brazilian Open Data Portal179, a centralized platform  for accessing government open data. It allows anyone to find and use public data and information.  This policy aims to improve public management and effic iency, data crossing, early fraud detection  and improved analysis and data int elligence within the government. The Portal also makes feasible  the creation of new business models based on government open data.   Apparently, public administration bodies in different levels in Brazil still consider the Inter net as merely  a broadcasting medium for legislation, norms, decrees, contracts, procurement and reports.  Therefore, it is necessary to change the “online publishing” paradigm within the government in order  to create value from public data: the Internet is not only a powerful instrument for transparency and  social participation, but also for improving public services, including those not originally digital.   For such ends, government data must be complete, accessible, machine legible and available in simple  and readable formats. There must be a public commitment by the government body to create value  from its public data180.                                                              179 Available on dados.gov.br .  180 A collection of principles for government open data policies can be found at http://opendefinition.org/  and  https://opengovdata.org/ .  43% 9% 9% 9% 6% 6% 6% 6% 3% 3% 3%Aumentar a transparência Criar valor econômico para o setor privado Aumentar a abertura Facilitar a criação de novos negócios Otimizar operações e colaboração internas Permitir serviços do setor privado por meio da reutilização de dados Incrementar o desempenho do setor público com maior accountability Permitir a participação cidadã no processo de tomada de decisão Facilitar a participação do cidadão no debate público Criar valor econômico para o setor público OutrosIncrease transparency   Create value for the private sector   Increase openness   Facilitate the creation of new businesses   Optimize internal operations and collaboration   Allow private sector services by data re -use  Improve public sector performance with greater accountability   Allow citizen participation on deci sion-making process   Facilitate citizen participation on public debate   Create economic value for the public sector   Other

      109  Digitalization and Health   In the context of national digital strategies, e -Health has become a priority due to its significant impact  and wide benefits in different countries. In this relevant subject, the International Te lecommunication  Union and the World Health Organization edited together the ITU -WHO National eHealth Strategy  Toolkit183.  E-Health  consists in the use of information and  communication t echnologies to improve healthcare services  in general. ICT may be used to develop and increase  efficiency of healthcare management, on patient attention  and monitoring, information handling, in decision making  for clinical procedures, public healthcare mod elling,  epidemics detection and control, and in many other  occasions.   E-Health is changing the way of organize and offer health  services worldwide, including Brazil. Healthcare is  increasingly linked to information and communication, and  now depends on kn owledge and technology for newer and  more efficient mechanisms which improve the extent,  quality and humane care of health services.   It is fundamental to adopt principles and strategies to  integrate and promote interoperability of lifelong health  registri es, in order to promote better healthcare with a  humane and civil treatment to patients.   Health technology also contribute to speed up healthcare  processes, build capacities and abilities in medical teams,  and make the health information flow more efficient  to  better support both medical and policy decisions. Efficient  use of e -health must contemplate qualification of human  resources, adequate information and communication  services and systems, specific technology, standards for medical information and inter operability,  governance, legislation and financing. It is also essential a wide, reliable broadband infrastructure which  allows quality connection between health centers, including mobile devices, with agile communication  between patients and professionals .  Many e -health initiatives have been developed in Brazil during the past two decades, some with very  positive results. However, a structured E -Health Strategy184 was only recently structured, based on  guidelines and principles by the Single Health System an d aligned with the Brazilian Digital  Transformation Strategy.   Some of the highlighted initiatives in the E -Health Strategy are the “e -SUS” online medical appointment  for basic healthcare, which is part of a national strategy for technology upgrade in the Health Information  System and the Electronic Medical Record System. There is also the DigiSUS , a mobile web access  platform for treatment monitoring in consultations, walk -in, and hospital care; and the DigiSus Gestor   version of the same platform, which provides online health indicators from e -health systems to assist the  health service manager or the policy maker with management information.     
      110  Vision   Considering the diagnosis described above, E -Digital establishes the  following objectives for digital  government:   • Digital governance   o Establishing policies for digital governance with full integration between Federal, state  and municipal levels of government.   o Establishing of a governance system with cross -cutting, continuou s processes and  uniform methodology, aiming to modernize the state.   o Sharing of service capacity: different public bodies should share infrastructure,  services and systems in order to avoid redundancy, waste and extra cost, as well as  the enclosure of infor mation in silos.   o Data sharing between public bodies in the Federal level whenever the opportunity of  simpler processes and services arise.   • Digital public services   o Consolidation of the Digital Citizenship Platform185.  o All services accessible through a unique , centralized channel.   o All federal public services available online, at least at the request or scheduling stage.   o Priority for public services offered in digital environments whenever possible, in the  largest variety of devices and platforms available.   o Service evaluation and feedback.   o Fully operational service monitoring panel.   o Single authentication system available for both natural people and organizations,  aggregating the main security levels in only one tool.   o Integration of services in all three level s of government (federal, state and municipal)  aiming unified solutions for the citizen.   • Digitalization of Documents and Administrative Processes                                                               183 Available on: http://www.itu.int/pub/D -STR-E_HEALTH.05 -2012 , accessed on 30/06/2017.   184 Available on: http://portalsaude.saude.gov.br/estrategiaesaude  , accessed on 30/06/2017.   185 Available on www.planejamento.gov.br/cidadaniadigital , accessed on 20/09/2017.

      113  • To maintain and improve a digital social participation platform as a place of excellence for  dialogue between government and civil society.    
      114  Indicators   Measuring of digital citizenship and digital public services may include the following international  indicators:   •  United Nations E -Government Development Index, particularly in the online services and  electronic participation dimensions.   • Open Data Barometer  – ODB,  developed by the World Wide Web Foundation to assess  the  prevalence and impact of open data initiatives worldwide in aspects such as readiness,  implementation and effectiveness.   The Digital Governance Strategy has also developed a set of indicators related to each one of its  initiatives, establishing goals for the next two yearly cycles.   Further contributions to measure the implementation of E -Digital strategic actions may include the  results of TIC Domicílios and TIC Governo Eletrônico researches, assessed by the Information Society  Development Study Center  – Cetic.br186.                                                                  186 All researches and indicators by Cetic.br are available online at http://cetic.br/pesquisas/  (in Portuguese).
