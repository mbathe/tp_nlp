Reliability and safety         How might the system function well for people across different use conditions and contexts, including ones it was not originally intended for?                     Privacy and security         How might the system be designed to support privacy and security?                     Inclusiveness         How might the system be designed to be inclusive of people of all abilities?                     Transparency         How might people misunderstand, misuse, or incorrectly estimate the capabilities of the system?                     Accountability         How can we create oversight so that humans can be accountable and in control?
