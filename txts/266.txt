 Cost of n on-Europe reports analyse possibilities for gains and realisation of a public common good  through action at EU level. They attempt to identify areas that are expected to benefit from deepest  EU integration and for which the EU 's added value is potentially significant.   Artificial intelligence (AI) deployment in road transport is one of the most mature  examples of AI  in   the various economic sectors and o ne of the most promising in terms of potential added value that  could be brought to the EU economy and society.   This report tries to establish what would be the  lost economic benefit in terms of gross domestic  product ( GDP ) and jobs not generated if no action were undertaken at EU level to address the  existing gaps relating to liability and protection of users of AI systems in road transport. For these  two aspects  alone , the cost of non -Europe ranges between € 231 097 and €275 287 million . Th is   migh t have be en even higher , however,  had the scope of the quantitative analysis been broader.     AUTHORS   Dr Tatjana Evas and  Aleksandra Heflich, European Added Value U nit.

Artificial intelligence in road transport  - Cost of non -Europe report     I Executive summary   Transport is one of the sectors in which a rtificial intelligence (AI) technologies are seeing rapid  uptake. AI systems can detect patterns in a large volume of data and model complex solutions that  enable increased efficiency in decision making and better resource allocation. The biggest  transformation in the sector, yet to come, would be the deployment and uptake of highl y  autonomous vehicles and enhanced traffic management systems.   Many estimations show that the application of AI systems in the transport sector can bring some  important benefits to the econo my and create jobs, which could help balance out the negative  effects that automation brings , such as  loss of low -skilled jobs (Chapter 1).   For several years now, the European Parliament has been indicating that the transport sector i s key  for AI and has b een advocating the harmonisation of rules to enhance the cross -border  development of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). This could fully exploit their economic  potential and enable the EU to benefit from the positive effects of technological trends.  In 2021, the  European Commission is planning to address the current legal vacuum and will make a number of  horizontal legislati ve proposals  addressing AI (Chapter 1.2).   Against this backdrop this report analyses enablers for the development and deployment  of AI in   road transport. The se are: (i)  infrastructure, (ii)  technology, (iii)  investment, (iv)  ethics, (v)  the legal  and policy framework and (vi)  social acceptance. Next it identifies the gaps and barriers that s t ill  persist and hamper the potentially b eneficial development of AI (Chapter 2).   Finally, the report estimate s the cost of non -Europe (CoNE) – the cost of not acting at EU level – for  AI in road transport (Chapter 3). This calculation is based on the study that underpins this report (see  Annex  1). For this purpose,  the report analys es in detail only selected AI enablers (EU policies and  legislation , and how they could increase social acceptance of AI with regulatory rules). The report  presents three sets of EU policy actions ranging from least ambitious – no additional interventi on at  EU level – to most ambitious, which addresses current weaknesses in the liability regime and  strengthens the trust and safety of AI users in road transport.

Artificial intelligence in road transport  – Cost of non -Europe report       5 1. Introduction   1.1. Cost of non -Europe reports   The European Added Value unit of the European Parliamentary Research Service analyses the  potential impacts of further action at European Union (EU) level. One  of the unit 's main publication  series are the c ost of non-Europe reports  that are designed to study the possibilities for gai ns  and/or the realisation of a public common good through action at EU level. They attempt to identi fy  areas that are expected to benefit from deeper EU integration and for which the EU 's added value is  potentially significant.   In 1983 Michel Albert and James Ball introduced the notion of the ' cost of non -Europe ' as an  impediment to an economic growth in a report commissioned by the  European Parliament .1 The  1988 Cecchini report further developed and applied the concept of non -Europe to single market  policies. In 2014, the concept was re -visited and developed in a report on the c ost of non -Eu rope in   the single market .2 The concept of  non- Europe has been applied and quantified in a number of  policy areas .3  In the 2016 Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law -Making4 it is agreed that analysis of the  potential 'European added value ' of any proposed Union action, as well as an assessme nt of the cost  of non -Europe in the absence of action at Union level, should be taken fully into account when  setting the legislative agenda.   1.2. Background   Transport is one of the economic sectors where a rtificial intelligence (AI) technologies are seeing  rapid uptake. The growth trends are clear: ' In the future, the transport system will accommodate  vehicles with ever growing computing power, high speed connectivity, deep learning algorithms  for artificial intelligence, fast processing and decentralised data handling '.5  AI systems applied in the transport sector can already now detect patterns in a large volume of data  and model complex solutions that enable increased efficiency in decision making and better  resource allocation. For example, AI technologies are used for ' real-time or predictive ma tching of  supply and demand for rides or goods, predicting traffic speeds or dangerous road segments and  behaviours, and managing supply chains '.6 The biggest AI -driven transformation and most                                                                1  M.

EPRS | European Parliamentary Research  Service        6 promising AI applications that expected in the sector , however,  are yet to come : the deployment  and uptake of highly autonomous vehicles and enhanced traffic management systems.   Considering the speed of development of AI technologies and their potentially significant impact  on the economy and society EU  policy debates  have focused intensively on AI applications in the  transport sector .7 EU actions contribut ing to the development and uptake of AI in the transport  sector are two -fold. First, the EU facilitates development of AI technologies  through researc h  funding and i nvestment.8 Second, building on its competencies related to the internal market,  consumer protection, fundamental rights and safety legislation, the EU is in the process of  developing a legislative framework for AI in general and AI in transport specifically.   1.2.1.  Position of the European Parliament on AI in road transport   The European Parliament was the first EU institution to draw attention to the enormous  potenti al of  AI technologies for the economy, society and environment but also to the risks that deployment of  those technologies could bring. In 2017 , Parliament  adopted a resolution with recommendations  to the Commission on c ivil law rules on r obotics .9 This was the first EU-level policy document to  map out the regulatory challenges related to AI technologies and robotics  comprehensively.  It   recommended that the European Commission take legislative action to address the  challenges . The 2017 Parliament resolution identified a number of horizontal issues requiring EU  legislative attention in relation to the development and deployment of AI technologies in the EU.  Those horizontal issues included: liability, ethics, intellectual property, flow of data, stand ardisation,  investment in research and development and facilitation of an institutional framework to enhanc e  cooperation between the Member States and the European Commission. The resolution also  identified a number of economic sectors that , in the context  of developments in AI technologi es ,  require particular attention from the EU legislators. A utonomous means of transport , including  autonomous vehicles and drones,  were identified as one of the five sectors most urgent ly  requiring  EU policy consideration .  More s pecifically, in relation to AI in transport, the 2017 Parliament resolution stated that ' the  automotive sector is in most urgent need of efficient Union and global rules to ensure the cross border development of automated and autonomous vehicles so a s to fully exploit their economic  potential and benefit from the positive effects of technological trends '.10 The resolution further  emphasised that ' fragmented regulatory approaches would hinder implementation of autonomous  transport systems and jeopardise  European competitiveness '.11  The urgent need to provide a regulatory framework in relation to AI transport applications and , more   specifically , autonomous vehicles, was  also underlined by the respondents to the 2017 European  Parliament public consultation on robotics and AI .12 In response to the question ' In your opinion,                                                                7  For analysis see European Commission, Joint Research Council, The Future of Road Transport – Implications of  automated, connected, low -carbon and shared mobility, 2019.   8  Under the Horizon Europe programme the EU is planning to establish a European Cooperative and Automated  Mobility (CCAM)  partnership in order to establish a strategic cooperative framework for a broad spectrum of  stakeholders, maximise the benefits of  public funding , and leverage private investments .   9   European Parliament resolution of 16 February 2017 with recommendations to the Commission on civil law rules on   robotics  (2015/2103 (INL)).   10  European Parliament resolution of 16 February 2017 , op.cit., para 25.  11  European Parliament resolution of 16 February 2017 , op.cit., para 25.  12  In 2017, at the request of the European Parliament Committee on Legal Affairs, EPRS conducted an o pen, on -line  public consultation, translated into all EU languages on civil law rules on robotics and AI. This was one of the first EU -
Artificial intelligence in road transport  – Cost of non -Europe report       7 in which areas is EU regulatory action most urgent? ', 87 % of all respondents indicated that ac ti on  in the area of autonomous vehicles was the most urgent. A utonomous vehicles, were the top  area  for EU -level policy intervention.   The European added value assessment (EAVA) 'A common approach to liability rules and  insurance for connected and autonomous vehicles ' accompanying the 2017 Parliament  resolution , focused on the cost of ' fragmented r egulatory approaches ' to liability for connected and  autonomous vehicles ( CAVs ).13 The EAVA on CAVs provided an analysis of the need to revis e the EU  legislation and estimated the European added value that could be generated as a result of the  expedited rol l-out of autonomous vehicles. The results of the legal analysis on the existing EU  product and traffic liability rules, as well as the comparative analysis of national law in six EU Member  States, provided as part of the EAVA on CAVs, included strong evide nce in support of the need to  revise the existing EU liability legislation . The analysis indicated that if not addressed, the  application of the current legislative framework on liability to CAVs will likely result in a number of  gaps (i.e.  certain risks not covered) and ' grey areas ' (i.e. lack of clarity on how current rules s hould  appl y). Thus, if not revised the current legislative framework would result in effect in diminish ed  consumer protection and a high degree of legal and administra tive uncertainty for both business  and pubic administrations. The results of the EAVA on CAVs also suggested that acceleration of the  adoption curve of CAVs by revising the EU liability framework has the potential to generate  European added value worth app roximately €148 billion .    Since the adoption of the 2017 resolution, the European Parliament has continued to work on the  specific issues related to AI technologies identified in the resolution. Thus, in 2019 Parliament   adopted a  resolution specifically addressing the challenges of the transport sector –  'Autonomous driving in European transport '.14 In relation to the development of AI in transport,  this resolution stressed that ' appropriate regulatory frameworks, ensuring their safe operation and  providing  for a clear regime governing liability, need ed to be in place as soon as possible in order to  address the resulting changes, including interaction between autonomous vehicles and  infrastructure and other users '.15 The resolution further stressed the concerns Parliament had   expressed in its 2017 resolution in relation to the regulation of liability and the need for  corresponding legislative action. Accordingly, Parliament  repeated its call on the Commission to  revis e current legislation on liability, insurance, registration and the protection of personal data ,  because those rules would  'no longer be sufficient or adequate when faced with the new risks  emerging from increasing vehicle automation, connectivity and comp lexity '.16  Parliament  has also continued its work on the horizontal issues related to the development and  uptake of AI technologies, and in 2020 adopted two legislative resolutions : on the  ethical  aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics and related tec hnologies17 and on a civil liability                                                                wide consultations on the topic of AI. An overview of the results of the public consultation and summary report is  available on the European Parliament website .  13  T.

EPRS | European Parliamentary Research  Service        8 regime.18 The 2020 resolution on an ethical framework (the 2020 resolution) has a specific section  on AI applications in the transport sector .19 When it comes  to AI applications in the transport sec tor,  Parliament first highlights the socio -economic and environmental potential of AI technologi es.  Second, it underlines that the Union must take action to promote more investment and strengthen  the economic competitiveness of European business . Third, it stresses that ' the Unio n's transport  sector needs an update of the regulatory framework concerning such emerging technologies  and their use in the transport sector and a clear ethical framework for achieving trustworthy  AI, including safety, security, the respect of human autono my, oversight and liability aspects '. The  EU regulatory framework must provide a balanced solution between support for innovation and  protection of safety and consumer rights .20 The 2020 resolution also highlights the importance of  develop ing modern infrastructure ( i.e. intelligent transport systems and a 5G network) and  development of 'Union -wide trustworthy AI standards for all modes of transport, including the  automotive industry, and for testing of AI -enabled vehicles and related products and services '.21  The European a dded value assessment on the  European framework on ethical aspects of artificial  intelligence, robotics and related technologies put forward evidence that EU joint legislative action  on ethical standards for AI systems could ' boost the internal market and establish an  important strategic advantage' . An EU common framework on ethics has the potential to bri ng  the European Union €294.9 billion  in additional GDP and 4.6 million additional jobs  by 2030.22  1.2.2.  Position of the European Commission on AI in road transport and EU  strategy on AI   European Commission policy initiatives relating to AI technologies in the road transport sector foc us  on three interlinked areas: (1) revision of existing and discussion on possible future initiatives r elated  to road transport infrastructure; (2) initiatives related to AI applications in road transport, e.g.   autonomous vehicles , and (3) horizontal initiatives related to AI technologies in general .23  The Commission's  infrastructure -related policy and research initiatives  focus both on  developing the physical and ' data ' infrastructure necessary for the deployment of CAVs and on the  use of AI systems as a supporting decision -making tool for infrastructure asset management .24  Initiatives relating to the development of a physical road infrastructure for CAVs, for example, focus  on updat ing and developing c ooperative intelligent transport systems (C -ITS), including digital  traffic management systems .25                                                                18  European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with rec ommendations to the Commission on a civil liability  regime for artificial intelligence ( 2020/2014(INL) ).  19  European Parliament resolution  of 20 October 2020 , op.cit., 2020/2012(INL), paras 103 -108.   20   European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 , op.cit., 2020/2012(INL), paras 103 -105.   21  European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 , op.cit., 2020/2012(INL), paras 106 -107.   22  T.

Artificial intelligence in road transport  – Cost of non -Europe report       9 Policy initiatives related to connected and auton omous vehicles  focus primarily on analysi s of  new risks that can be trigger ed by higher level s of autonomy. One of the first analyses in this r espect   is a recently published report of the European Commission Expert Group entitled 'Ethics of  Connected and A utomated Vehicles  – Recommendations on road safety, privacy, fairness,  explainability and responsibility '.26 This report makes  20 specific ethical recommendations  concerning the future development and deployment of CAVs.   The sector -specific focus related t o AI systems in road transport is only one element of EU AI polic y  and research initiatives. EU AI-related policy developments  have so far been mainly horizontal ,  and focused on develop ing policy by setting  out a  strategic vision ,27 and analysing ethical  implications and risks specific to AI .28 No specific horizontal legislation related to AI technologies  has been adopted so far at EU level, but  according to the 2020 Commission w ork program me, the  Commission intends to propose a number of legislative acts in 2021.29 Overall the vision and  approach to AI  supported by the EU is that the development of AI systems must be ' human centri c ',  secure and trustworthy. The EU 's approach must build on the ecosystems of excellence and trust,  and provide a future -oriented, 'risk based ' and balanced approach to innovation .30  In line with its Green Deal agenda, the EU also aims to benefit from the positive environmental  impacts that AI (and digitalisation in general) could bring to the economy. Regarding the transport  sector, in December 2020 the European Commission published a strategy for sustainable and smart  mobility31 (previously in 2018 the Commission  had presented a strategy that focused pr im a rily  on  automated mobility – On the road to automated mobility: a n EU strategy for  mobility of the future )32.  Among many objectives related to limiting and achieving zero -emissions of different transport  modes, the  recent strategy envisages that by 2030 automated mobility will be deployed on a large  scale. Therefore, t wo areas of action related to smart mobility are emphasised in the document : (i)  making connected and automated multimodal mobility a reality and (ii) boosting innovation  and  the use of data and AI  for smarter mobility .

Position of EU Member States on AI i n road transport   Most recently on 7 October 2020, EU Member States have expressed their opinion on connected  and automated driving in the conclusions of the fourth High Level Meeting on Connected and  Automated Driving , which were  also endorsed by three Dir ectorates -General of the European  Commission and 13 international organisations .33 In these conclusions, t he EU Member States  underlined three main building blocks on the basis of which the development of AI systems in road  transport should be based. First,  AI systems should be deployed in road transport in a 'human centric ' manner. In this context the Member States call ed on the Commission to put into practi c e  an action plan on the ethical development and deployment of automated driving systems .34  Second, to  enable an uptake of AI systems, the EU should enhance framework for data sharing .35  Third, the current regulatory framework should be reformed  and coordination at  regulatory level  among the EU Member States should be enhanced. The Member States ' conclusion s stress that the  regulation 'should be enabling, risk -based, goal -based and performance -based as well as  technology -neutral in order to be future -proof '.36 In relation to cooperation between Member  States , the  conclusions underline that '(...) synchronisation is needed also between the EU Member  States. In order to avoid putting up barriers to the single market in CAD, we must achieve more  coordination at the regulatory level among the EU Member States, for technical rules but also with  regard t o traffic rules and the digitalisation of such rules, while fully respecting different legal  traditions and frameworks and the principle of subsidiarity '.37  1.3. Cost of n on-Europe: Artificial intelligence in road transport –  Objective, scope and methodology   The overall objective  of establishing the cost of non -Europe in this area is to identify how  addressing, at EU level, certain key gaps and barriers to the deployment and use of AI in the transport  sector could benefit the EU in achieving its ambition in the f ield. There is an EU -level consensus that  the EU needs to reap the economic benefits of these technologies, limit their potential negative  effects, become a global leader  in the development of secure, trustworthy and ethical AI (AI the  'EU way ') and ensure  its digital sovereignty .38                                                                33  Conclusions from the 4th High -Level Meeting on Connected and Automated Driving , Helsinki, 7 October 202 0,  Ministry of Transport and Communications of Finland.   34  Further conclusions and actions endorsed by the Member States are as follows: (i) ' Member States recognise the need  to clearly define the roles of the various stakeholders relating to the developme nt and use of ADS as well as the  responsibilities and rights attached to these roles '; (ii) 'The Member States recognise the need to develop the  vehicle/system behaviour transparency of the algorithms '; (iii) ' The Member States conclude that the companies  should be supported by the necessary regulatory framework and industry -led open standards as well as by creating  concrete tools to help the practical implementation of a culture of responsibility and trust '.  35  Specifically endorsed actions are as follows:  (i) 'The Member States conclude that the EU plays an absolutely pivotal  role in developing a common governance model for data sharing and supportive structures '; (ii) t he European  Commission should continue the development of an EU -level framework that en sures interoperability, identifies  specific roles in the data governance model and consolidates the development of the data economy, such as in the  context of the revision of the ITS Directive and its delegated regulations;  (iii) ' The Member States, togeth er with the  industry and possibly the European Commission, will start a voluntary public -private task force to discuss and develop  a framework that will support (statistical) data sharing to gain insights into the potential and impact of different ADAS  systems and automated systems and to develop methods to describe the safe performance of such systems '.  36 Conclusions from the four th High -Level Meeting on Connected and Automated Driving , op.cit.  37  Idem.   38  European Council, Conclusions – 1 and 2 October 2020 , EUCO 13/20.  
Artificial intelligence in road transport  – Cost of non -Europe report       11 The scope  of this research project (see Chapter 2 in Annex 1 for more detail )39 was narrowed dow n  to means of road transport . It therefore covers personal, public and freight road transportati on  together with related infrastructur e and operations. This leaves aside warehousing and logistics specific issues (such as package optimisation). AI technologies and AI are understood as defined by  the European Commission High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence.40  Transport has bee n chosen as a sector to study on account of  the adoption and maturity of AI  systems  as well as the potential added value that could be brought by AI (Table 1) (see more on  impacts in Chapter  2 below). Transport is also an area with  an important level of European regulation  despite , remaining a shared competence with national level.   Table 2 – Prioritisation based on industry attractiveness, artificial intelligence (AI)  adoption/maturity, and value at stake   Source: McKinsey&Company,  Artificial intelligence: The  time to act is now , Exhibit 3, 2018 .  Four key megatrends  were  identified by the study underpi nning this CoNE report (see Chapter 2.2  in Annex 1) but automation  and digitalisation  were pointed to as the most relevant to AI  applications in transport (Figure 1). Only some aspects of sustainability  and the sharing economy   were identified as key to boo sting AI in transport.                                                                 39  O.

The study underpinning this CoNE  report has also identified key enablers  that , if properly  addresse d, could have an important impact on the uptake of AI in transport, boosting the estimated  added value in its connection,  and more general ly help the EU achieve its strategic objectives in this   field (see Chapter 2.2.2 and Table 1 in Annex 1 ). The key enablers are:    infrastructure,    technology,    investment,    ethics,    the legal and policy framework , and    social acceptance.   The analysis focuses mainly on the enabler that is an EU-level legal and policy framework and on  social acceptance (especially  increase d AI user trust) . It further identifies the gaps and barriers in  this field and , by developing potential EU -level policy options , proposes a way to address them. The  cost of non -Europe is es timated on the basis of a quantitative analysis of these policy options i n  comparison to a baseline option.       
Artificial intelligence in road transport  – Cost of non -Europe report       13 2. Why act at EU level?   2.1. Importance of AI for the transport sector –  Potential impact on  the economy, society and the environment   A variety of research has confirmed the major economic, societal and environmental potential that  could be realised by means of the extensive adoption of AI in the transport sector. It is believed that  'society will gain countless hours of productivity with just the in troduction of autonomous  transportation and AI influencing our traffic congestion issues, not to mention the other ways it wil l  improve on -the-job productivity. Freed up from stressful commutes, humans will be able to spend  their time in a variety of other  ways '.41  Various analyses as well as market developments show that robotics and AI have enormous  economic potential worldwide and specifically for the European Union. The latest 2019 -2024 edition  of 'Mapping of the Cost of Non -Europe ' estimates a potential  efficiency gain  within the European  economy of €206 billion per year  by 2025 if appropriate EU policies to promote and regulate AI  technologies are introduced .42 The latest report by the McKinsey Global Institute for the European  Commission ,43 estimates that the net  economic impact in the EU by 2030  of all sorts of high impact technologies that will shape the European economy and society could be worth €2.2 trillion  in cumulative additional GDP or 14.1  % in growth compared with 2017. Many of th ese high -im pact   technologies are crucial to AI and robotics in the transport sector . Examples of  technologies and  infrastructure  include  artificial intelligence, big data analytics, the i nternet of t hings and NextGen  internet and infrastructure ( such as 5G  and beyond) , while examples of high -impact applied  technologies  include  autonomous mobility and smart cities .44  Another analysis relating specifically to transport predicts great economic potential in particular for   autonomous vehicles , which could cumulat ively increase the EU 's GDP by 5.3  % by 2050 compared  with 2016 and bring as much as € 17 trillion  to the European economy by 2050 .45 A PWC study  from 2018 expects  Europe's transportation and logistics sector to increase GDP by 10 % on average  by 2030 (see Table 2). This gain will come mainly from improvements to internal processes , the  sector 's companies , and its overall functioning. T he European Commission meanwhile estimates  that by 2030 intelligent transport systems could reduce fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions by  1.2 % annually .46 AI will also enable hours spent in traffic  to be cut and, by way of example, it is  estimated this will bring  approximately €23 billion (£20 billion) in savings to United Kingdom  GDP                                                                 41  Bernard Marr, What Is The Impact Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) On Society?  2019.   42  A.

This preliminary estimation on the EU potential effi ciency gain focussed on three dimensions -  (i) automation of  knowledge work, (ii) robots, and (iii) autonomous vehicles  and was an extrapolation -  based on European Commissio n   data on the potential global impacts of AI by 2025 and EU share of the global ma rket.   43  European Commission, ' Shaping the digital transformation in Europe ', study by McKinsey & Company, September  2020.   44  In the context of high -impact technologies that will shape European economy and society the McKinsey & Company  Shaping the digital transformation in Eu rope  report for the European Commission points to eight enabling  technologies and infrastructure and eight high -impact applied technologies.   45  Policy Network, Freeing  the Road: Shaping the future for autonomous vehicles , 2016.   46  European Commission, Europe on the move, Mobility package factsheet . 
EPRS | European Parliamentary Research  Service        14 alone .47 Optimisation of the transportation grid  could bring  savings of  approximately €100 billion  annually on costs incurred in the EU due to traffic congestion , especially in and around urban  areas .48,49   Among the main wider societal benefits of the use of AI in transport is the reduction in road traffic  accidents  (reducing the human factor that is responsible for 90  % of fatal crashes )50 and the  improvement of quality of life especially of people with disabilities , for whom traditional driving  otherwi se constitute s a barrier. Effects on employment  might be twofold. On the one hand , lowskilled jobs are expected to be lost because of AI . On the other , more qualified workers will be in  higher demand.51  Along with  economic and societal benefits, AI systems  in transport may also pose a number of risks,   related , for instance,  to: respect for fundamental rights  (such as data security and privacy),  difficulties attributing liability , or the environmental effects  of increase d of trave l u s ing   autonomous and connected vehicles.52  Table 3 – Impacts : EU costs and benefits of AI in road transport*   Economy  Society  Environment   Benefits:   Issue  Quantitative  estimate  Issue  Quantitative  estimate  Issue  Quantitative  estimate   Transport ation and  logistics  sector  + 9.9  %  southern  Europe GDP in  203053  + 11.5 %  northern  Europe GDP in  2030  Compensation  for driver  shortage  N.A.

Effects of AI on transport.   * The effects are not cumulative as they might overlap.   2.2. Existing gaps and barriers to developing and deploying AI in  road transport   As previously mentioned, key enablers (identified in the research underpinning this report – see  Annex 1) for achieving the benefits from AI in transport and ensuring EU 's leadership in it are:  infrastructure, investment, technology, ethics, reg ulatory and policy framework and social  acceptance.   Many EU-level policies, program mes and funds have been having a direct impact on and support ing  these enablers for many years. Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement , especially  regarding infra structure , investment  and technology  in which development the EU is lagging  behind.56 Moreover, big differences exist between Member States , for instance  in the quality of road  infrastructure or connectivity , and this fragmentation is a barrier in itself. F urthermore, there is still  an investment gap in AI in the EU. In response, the new multiannual EU budget for the y ears 2021   to 2027 provides for further funding and supporting investment for the necessary infrastructure and  connectivity that will be vital for AI in transport.   Gaps and barriers also exist in the EU's legal and policy framework , although it is constantl y  growing as new laws at EU level were recently adopted and others will soon be proposed (first  quarter of 2021) by the European Commission.57 The research undertaken for this CoNE report  identified EU legislation relevant to AI in transport and in particular to autonomous vehicl es – AV                                                                55  Due to electrification and vehicle sharing.   56  For further details see Chapter 4.1., Annex 1 – Study by O.

Artificial intelligence in road transport  – Cost of non -Europe report       17 (see Annex 1 – Chapter 4.1.3). It further establishes that the po tential gaps and barriers of the EU 's  regulatory framework revolve around liability , empowering users  (both business and consumer s),  cybersecurity, and data privacy (see Table 3 below and for details see Chapter 4.2 in Annex 1). On  a similar note,  the Euro pean Commission states that the current EU legal framework applicable to  the use of AI (related not only to transport) does not provide for effective enforcement of EU rules  designed to protect fundamental rights, or  the application of EU rules on safety a nd the rules  regarding the attribution of liability.58                                                               58  European Commission, Inception impact assessment on a proposal for a legal act of th e European Parliament and the  Council laying down requirements for artificial intelligence , July 2020.

Artificial intelligence in road transport  – Cost of non -Europe report       21 2.3. Estimating the benefits  of addressing the gaps and barriers  identified   Addressing gaps and barriers related to infrastructure, investment and technology will continue to  create a level playing field  for businesses in the EU single market , especially in the single transport  area. Moreover, solving certain  digital challenges at  EU level , especially when a large critical mass  is required , could be most effective.59   Addressing gaps and barriers relating to liability, empowering users, cybersecurity, and data privacy  could benefit  the adoption of all AI -based products and services , and not only AV s. The European  Commission argues that continuation of a status quo could negatively impact  enforcement of  existing law s protecting fundamental rights , would create legal uncertainty for business , creates  challenges for market surveillance and supervisory authoritie s and poses the risk that victims  of AI could have difficulties in obtaining compensation .60 The Commission also claims that the  objective for AI to be  safe  and  trustworthy and respect EU values cannot be reached effectively by  Mem ber States alone and that EU action could limit the risk of the proliferation of divergent national  frameworks .61 This would thus avoid fragmentation of the digital single market .  Against this backdrop , the research underpinning the  report (see Annex 1), concludes that the two   most necessary policy options that should be considered at EU level should address the issues of  liability  and  explicability  and security  and  safety  of AI applications in transport (see Chapter 5.1.2  of Annex 1 ). If properly addressed these could help to address the second identified set of gaps and  barriers in the EU 's legal and regulatory framework (relating to liability, empowering users,  cybersecurity, and data privacy).                                                                     59  European Commission, ' Shaping the digital tra nsformation in Europe ', study by McKinsey & Company,  September  2020.   60  Idem.   61  European Commission, Inception impact assessment on a proposal for a legal act of the European Parliament and the  Council laying down requirements for artificial intelligence , July 2020.

It presents the results of research conducted for this report (see  Annex  1, Chapter s 5 and 6). The time line  analysed for these EU -level policy actions is the coming  decade , 2020 to 2030. It is assumed that the actions described would be fully effective from the  start year of the analysis (2020). Quantitative results come from modelling with a computabl e  general equilibrium (CGE) model that does not account for the impact of the coronavir us  pandemic  on the economy.   3.1. EU policy action to address existing gaps and their impacts   The report identifies: infrastructure, investment, technology, ethics, regulatory and policy  framework and social acceptance as key enablers for further development and  deployment of AI in  road transport. Gaps and barriers are further analysed but only for aspects relating to the regulatory  and policy framework and social acceptance (see Chapter 2). The last part of the analysis below  presents quantifications of what ben efits (avoided costs) could be achieved if the gaps were  addressed by EU -level action.   This does not however mean that gaps and barriers that exist in the fields of infrastruc ture,  investment and technology are less important or should not be further addre ssed at EU  level.  Although these areas are not analyse d nor quantified, they could potentially be addressed in a  possible further extension of the report .  3.1.1.  EU policy action 1 – No additional intervention at EU  level   The f irst policy action analysed is the c ontinuation of the current situation , which comprises a  (recently adopted) fully effective regulatory framework applicable to AI in road transport .62 This   action constitutes the baseline for this analysis. As it envisages no additional intervention at EU le vel,  it does not address any of the gaps or barriers identified relating to ethics, the r egula t or y a n d po licy   framework or social acceptance.   Nevertheless, this scenario will allow for a certain degree of AI development and innovation as it will  ensure new safety procedures. This will be possible because it provides for  full effectiveness of two  recently adopted transport sector -specific EU regulations that were revised to take the challenges  of autonomous vehicles ( AVs) into consideration: Regulation 2018/858 on the approval and market  surveillance of motor vehicles (AMSVR) , and the General Safety Regulation 2019/2144 on type approval requirements for motor vehicles (GVSR).                                                                 62  For example, two EU regulations are sector- specific: the Regulation (EU) 2018/858 of the European Parliament and of  the Council of 30 May 2018 on the approval and market surveillance of motor vehicles and their trailers, and of  systems, components and separate technical unit s intended for such vehicles , applicable since 1 September 2020 and  the Regulation (EU) 2019/2144 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 November 2019 on type -approval   requirements  for motor vehicles and their trailers, and systems, components and separate technical units intended  for such vehicles, as regards their general safety and the protection of vehicle occupants and vulnerable road users ,  which will apply from 6 July 2022.

Regarding  the gaps in  liability and the  empowerment of users, this scenario would have a positive impact but it would be limited, as the  recently adopted legislation , if effectively implemented , could increase transparency with regard to  software, algorithms and automated decisions.   Regarding quantitative impacts, the research conducted  for this report finds that if this scenari o  were realised, the EU economy would have an annual GDP growth rate between 2020  and 2030 of  slightly above 3  % with the same level of growth in private consumption. Capital stock would grow  at almost 5  % per yea r on average during the period analysed and employment would be slightly  above 0.2 %. Employment in traditionally labour -intensive sectors such as agriculture and  construction is expected to decline, while transportation is the only area where any substant ial  increases in employment would be seen.

Batura et al. (2020), Cost of Non -Europe Report on Artificial Intelligence: Transport, EPRS .  The f easibility of implementing this policy action , as well as its proportionality and subsidiarity , were  analysed as high (on a scale from low – medium – high) because it is based on legislation that has  already been adopted at EU level.   3.1.2.  Policy action 2 – A harmonised liability regime for AI in road trans port   This EU -level action proposes a solution to the existing gap s and barrier s related to the liability a nd  insurance  of connected and automated vehicles. It addresses several risks that connected and  automated vehicles generate.  The box below presents some key chara cteristics.   By improving the liability rules the EU would not only create a level playing field for AI developers  and manufacturers , it would also increase EU citizens ' trust in this technology. It may also lead to  development of new insurance products that could apply to different levels of cybersecurity  assurance from AV manufacturers. This could ultimately influence and lead to an improvement in  Main characteristics  of Policy action 2:    In the Product Liability Directive 85/374 , the notion of product is expanded  to  include AI software and algorithms.    The burden of proof is reversed : the AV user does not need to prove how or why  AV software or services failed.    The manufacturer  (AI developer), as the person most in control of all aspects of AV  assumes no-fault liability ; the victim  is entitled to compensation for damages  prima facie.    To ensure compensation, manufacturers (AI developers) are obliged to take out  liability insurance  (similarly to the current motor insurance).   Source: O. Batura et al.

Removing the burden of proof from AI users and giving v ict ims   the right to be compensated reinforce users ' rights.   The research conducted for this report finds that if this scenario is realised there will be a positive  effect on the EU econ omy with an increase in GDP and employment, as well as in private  consumption and a small increase in capital stock (Table 5).

Clear and harmonised EU rules on who is liable for which potential failure in a connected and  automated vehicle could result in an increase in consumer trust as well as  in legal certainty for  business users. This scenario does not however offer new protection in terms of security and  cybersecurity.   This scenario is assessed as having a high level of proportionality and subsidiarity. This is due to the  fact that it could remedy the existing fragmentation of single market where AI liability rules for CAV s  are not harmonised. This would be difficult to achieve by separate action of Member States at  national level.   3.1.3.  Policy action 3 – Stronger trust and protection of AI users i n road  transport   This EU -level action builds on the previous one (harmonisation of the liability regime for AI in road  transport) and further extends it. It adds even  more security for AI users , enhances the  transparency requirements for producers and developers and ensures personal data protection  even if the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)63 does not apply. Thus, this scenari o  addresses all key regulatory gaps and barriers (previously identified in the research on the cost of  non- Europe) rela ting to: liability, empowering users, cybersecurity and data privacy. It proposes a  legal framework to address challenges relating to data protection and privacy challenges r elat ing to  CAVs.                                                                 63  Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament a nd of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing  Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) (Text with EEA relevance) . 
Artificial intelligence in road transport  – Cost of non -Europe report       25 The k ey characteristics of this policy action are presented in the box below.   If pursued, this scenario would result in the highest economic gains compared with the scenario of  no additional intervention at EU level  and  the scenario introducing a harmonised EU liability regime  for AI in road transport (see Table 7 comparing the three policy actions  considered ).

This action would also guarantee the highest level of consumer protection  as well as of cybersecurity  for a vehicle. Its disadvantage would be however that it would not be as easy to implement as Policy  action 2. This could be due to a lack of consensus as to what exactly explicability of algorithms and  of AI is and how to impl ement it. Some stakeholders believe that the GDPR requirements ma y s u ffice   to protect data. Moreover, some evidence exists that heavy data protection and privacy rules can   have a negative impact on the research and development of AI.  Main characteristics  of Policy action 3:    An obligation of expl ainability of algorithms  and AI applications used by AVs     An obligation of local data processing  at least when sensitive data under the GDPR  are involved ; this should include, whenever technically possible, an obligation of  local data processing/storage re lating to personal data relating to the uses  and  habits of the driver/owner of (automated) vehicles , as these  can reveal life habits    Whenever technically possible, an obligation of  live processing of personal data  (or a very short storage period , such as f or eCall/driver monitoring and the data  event recorder/black box)    An obligation to obtain consent for processing of biometric data  (as per Recital  10  of the General Safety Regulation 2019/2144 on type -approval requirements f or  motor vehicles (GVSR) ), even if no unique identification purpose is pursued  (this   obligation is suggested because  Article 9 of the GDPR seems to apply only if  biometric data are processed for the purpose of unique identification ); th e a im  of  this obligation is to ensure that people know that sensitive data is being used and  processed, even locally ; the obligation of prior consent could include an explanati on  about the nature of data processed in the vehicle   Mandatory cybersecurity certification  for AVs in the EU market   Source: O.

If the EU does not undertake additional action on AI in road transport to address the identified gaps  and barriers that do not allow optimal development and deployment of AI in transport  a cost of non Europe will occur . This  cost will be borne by EU citizens, public organisations and the private sector.   The lost benefit of acting at EU level is identified as a lower benefit based on Policy action 2 and as  an upper benefit based on Policy action 3, compared to no further intervention at EU level , as in  Policy action 1 (Table 8).

Artificial intelligence in road transport  – Cost of non -Europe report       27 4. Conclusions   Transport is one of the key economic sectors of the EU. The ongoing transformation of the transport  sector triggered by AI technologies is both a promising opportunity and also the reason for  legislative attention at  EU level. AI systems are already used in transport -related decision making.  However, the biggest transformation in the sector would come with the widespread uptake of CAVs.  The CoNE report suggests that joint EU regulatory action to accelerate deployment and uptake of  AI systems in the transport sector could generate significant benefits. Those benefits would be lost  if EU did not take active measures. In order to reap the full benefits of applying  AI systems in the  road transport sector the EU should focus on measure s to establish t he infrastructure necessary f or  AI systems to operate ( i.e., data, connectivity, interoperability and C -ITS); intensify investments , and   address gaps and grey areas in the current legislative framework.   An analysis of the current regulatory framework indic ates that the current legislation is not fully fit  for the purpose of the deployment of AI systems in AV transport. The main gaps and risks identified  are the legal framework relating to liability, and the framework relating to ethics and consumer trust,  cybersecurity and data privacy. The cumulative effect or cost of the gaps or risks identified is the  slower development and uptake of AI technologies in road transport in the EU. This would lead to  the los s of benefits that AI systems promise in the sector in terms of economic efficiency and  effectiveness, and social and environmental benefits. I f not address ed the gaps and risks also will  impact negatively on the competitiveness of the EU 's transport sector.

     Cost of n on-Europe reports analyse possibilities for  gains and realisation of a public common good through  action at EU level. They attempt to identify areas that are  expected to benefit from deeper  EU integration and  for   which the EU 's added value is potentially significant.   Road transport is one of the economic sectors where  deployment of artificial intelligence is most advanced  and most promising in terms of the potential added  value that could be brought to the EU 's economy and  society.   This report aims to establish what would be the  economic loss in terms of GDP and jobs not generated  were no action to be taken at EU level to address the  existing gaps relating to liability and protection of users  of AI systems in road transport. For  these two aspects   alone , the cost of non -Europe ranges between € 231 097  and € 275 287 million but the figures could  have been  even higher were  the scope of the quantitative anal ysi s  broader.
