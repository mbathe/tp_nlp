What are the biggest risks  that new technologies can pose? How will we seek to  control the way it affects our daily lives? Are we preparing  ourselves sufficiently?   The rapid development and evolution of AI technologies,  while unleashing opportunities for business and  communities across the world,  have prompted a number  of important overarching questions that go beyond the  walls of academia and high -tech research centres in the  Silicon Valley. Governments, business and the public  alike are demanding more accountability in the way AI  technologies are used, trying to  find a solution to the legal  and ethical issues that will derive from the growing  integration of AI in people’s daily lives.   In business ethics in particular, the rise of artificial  intelligence has brought about considerations including  the level of co ntrol organisations can retain over their  machines’ decision -making processes and how to  ensure that the AI systems they adopt always act in a  way that is in line with the organisation’s core values. If it  is true that with great power comes great responsi bility,  AI has become increasingly powerful and its applications  to business are only starting to reveal its potential.   Some business leaders have indicated that responsible  organisations need to redefine how they interact with  technology to be able to b e seen as trustworthy in the  age of artificial intelligence.1 People tend to trust those  individuals or institutions that operate with openness and  take account of the public interest. Working with  regulators and policy makers, businesses have the  opportun ity to make a significant contribution to agree on  a framework of ethics and norms in which AI can thrive  and innovate safely.    Box 1 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a term generally used to  describe the simulation of elements of human  intelligence processes by machines and computer  systems. It is characterised by three main features:   1.Learning  – the ability to acquire relevant infor mation and the rules for using it   2.Reasoning  – the ability to apply the rules acquired and use them to reach approximate or definite conclusions  3.Iterative  – the ability to change the process on the basis of new information acquired.   Particular appli cations of AI include speech and face  recognition and ‘driver -less’ vehicles.   Science fiction often portrays AI machines as human -like  robots that look, think and feel like a human – Blade  Runner 2049 is the most recent example of this type of  narrative.  The robots of the Hollywood movies are often  evil, vindictive and try to take over the world. Despite the  fact that they do not provide an accurate depiction of the  state of artificial intelligence, this has an impact on how  people perceive AI, which is o ften feared and seen as a  danger or a threat.   Futuristic visions of AI can catch media attention, whilst  true immediate risks of AI are sometimes overlooked.   These include:   - Ethics risk : certain applications of the AI systems  adopted might lead to eth ical lapses;   - Workforce risk : automation of jobs can lead to a  deskilled labour force;   - Technology risk : black box algorithms can make it  difficult to identify tampering and cyber -attacks;  Business E thics and Artificial  Intelligence   This briefing sets forth a framework of fundamental values  and principles  for the use of Artificial Intelligence  (AI) in business. Its  primary goal is to encourage  organisations to engage in a multi -stakeholder dialogue  that  always considers commitmen t to values in the application and impact of AI developments.                                                                                                                    1 Forbes  (11/09/2017) Artificial Intelligence Is Here To Stay, But Consumer Trust Is A Must for AI in Busin ess

This softw are is used in  sentencing and parole hearings across the country.  ProPublica argued that the system misrepresented the  recidivism risks of different convicts. They suggest that  there is a systematic racial bias in the risk estimation.4  It is critical that  the machine learning algorithms that drive  AI decision -making are trained on diverse sets of data in  order to prevent similar biases. It is also important that  organisations set appropriate accuracy levels to  determine clearly their expectations and what an  acceptable standard is for them.   It is worth noting that in some instances, because AI can  learn from data gathered from humans, it might be that  some human biases are reflected in the machine’s  decision -making. Microsoft had to delete an AI chatbot  that it had introduced on Twitter with the aim to improve  its communications skills by interacting with the users of  the social media platform. After only a day in a human  community, the chatbot transformed into an  evil Hitler loving, incestual sex -promotin g, 'Bush did 9/11' proclaiming robot.5 This indicates how, even in the era of  artificial intelligence, influencing human behaviour to  embed ethical values should remain at the forefront of  every conversation about business ethics.   Respect of privacy   The r ise of AI has been described by some as the death  of privacy,6 while others have compared it to an Orwellian  Big Brother ready to scoop on everyone’s private life.  Certainly, machine learning technologies have brought  about new ethical issues related to th e respect of privacy.  On this topic, the European Commission has recently  reinforced the principle that everyone has the right to the  protection of personal data by proposing  a  comprehensive reform of data protection rules  (General  Data Protection Regulati on - GDPR ).7  Article 8 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights states  that “ Everyone has the right to the protection of personal  data concerning him or her. Such data must be  processed fairly for specified purposes and on the basis  of the consent of the person concerned or some other - Legal risk : data privacy issues, including compliance  with GDPR ;  - Algorithmic risk:  biased algorithms can lead to a  discriminatory impact.   In the workplace, people often see AI not as a tool they  can use to make their job easier or more effective, but  rather as something that is done to them and sometimes  competes with them to take their jobs. In this context,  companies have the responsibility to address the risks  that stem from AI and to bring the focus back on the  people that are the users of AI, explaining how they  would actually benefit from these technologies a nd why  they shouldn’t fear them.   Understanding  human values to  design value s-led systems    Winston Churchill once said that “we shape our buildings  and afterwards our buildings shape us.”2 This, mutatis  mutandis , applies to artificial intelligence too. AI  technologies are not ethical or unethical per se. The real  issue is around the use that business makes of AI, which  should never undermine human ethical values.   The IBE has engaged with organisations and techn ology  experts to identify the founding values that form the  cornerstone for the ethical framework of ARTIFICIAL   Intelligence in business (see the IBE interactive  framework).    Accuracy3  Companies need to ensure that the AI systems they use  produce correct , precise and reliable results. To do so  algorithms need to be free from  biases and systematic  errors deriving, for example, from  an unfair sampling of a  population, or from an estimation process that does not  give accurate results.   The ethical implicatio ns of machine learning algorithms  are significant. An example is given by the US criminal  justice system, which is increasingly resorting to the use  of artificial agents to ease the burden of managing such  a large system. Any systematic bias in these tools  would  have a high risk of errors, as the New York based non profit organisation ProPublica illustrated with regards to     2 In October 1943, following the destruction of the Commons Chamber by incendiary bombs during the Blitz, the  Commons debated the question of rebuilding the chamber .  3 In this briefing, the term ‘accuracy’ is used to describe the ability of algorithms to pr oduce unbiased outcomes in terms  of algorithmic fairness.   4 ProPublica (23/05/2016) Machine Bias   5 The Telegraph (24/03/2016) Microsoft deletes 'teen girl' AI after it became a Hitler -loving sex robot within 24 hours   6 The Guardian (03/08/2014) The death of privacy   7 http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data -protection/

Everyone has the right  of access to data which has been collected concerning  him or her, and the right to have it rectified .”8   The GDPR will apply from 25 May 2018. It is important  that organisations have prepared appropriately for it and  plan their approach to GDPR compliance in advance, to  gain buy in from key people and to ensure that they have  communicated the appropriate changes to their staff.   Transparency and openness   Professor Lu ciano Floridi, professor of philosophy and  ethics of information at the University of Oxford,  compares AI to a dark room: “Suppose you enter a dark  room in an unknown building. You might panic about  monsters that could be lurking in the dark. Or you could  just turn on the light, to avoid bumping into furniture. ”9  More openness in the use of AI algorithms and systems  can help to shed some light into the dark.   Traditionally, many organisations that have developed  and now use AI algorithms do not allow publi c scrutiny  as the underlying programming (the source code) is  proprietary, kept from public view. Opening sourcing  material in computer science, when appropriate, is an  important step. It helps the development community to  understand better how AI works an d therefore be able to  explain it more accurately to the public and the media.  This is particularly important as better information within  the general public improves trust and prevents unjustified  fears. Moreover, the more people have access to the  code, the more likely it is that bugs and long -term  opportunities and risks can be worked out.   Microsoft, Google, Facebook and Amazon have been  making remarkable progress developing artificial  intelligence systems. Recently they have released much  of their wor k to the public for free use, exploration,  adaptation and perhaps improvement. Box 2 illustrates  some examples. .   Box 2  Open technology   Among the technologies that major tech companies have  opened recently are:  - Google’s TensorFlow, the heart of its im age search  technology, open -sourced in November 2015; 10   - The custom hardware designs that run Facebook’s M  personal assistant open -sourced in December 2015; 11   - Microsoft’s answer to these machine learning systems,  the prosaically named Computation Network Tool Kit,  was made public in January 2016. 12  Interpretability   As AI algorithms increase in complexity, it becomes more  difficult to make sense of how they work. In some cases,  AI applications have been referred to as a ‘black box’  where not even engineers can decipher why the machine  made a certain decision. This can  significantly hinder  their effectiveness, and cause concern. The use of ‘black  box’ algorithms makes it difficult not only to identify when  things go wrong, but also to determine who is responsible  in the event on any damage or ethical lapse.   Interpreta ble and explainable AI will be essential for  business and the public to understand, trust and  effectively manage ‘intelligent’ machines. Organisations  that design and use algorithms need to take care in  producing models that are as simple as possible, to  explain how complex machines work.   There are some trends that are emerging to make AI  more interpretable. As an example, the Defense  Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has  launched the Explainable AI (XAI) programme, aimed at  creating “a suite of m achine learning techniques that:   Produce more explainable models, while maintaining a high level of learning performance (prediction accuracy); Enable human users to understand, appropriately trust, and manage effectively the emerging generation of artifi cially intelligent partners.”13 According to DARPA, the “new machine -learning  systems will have the ability to explain their rationale,  characteris e their strengths and weaknesses, and  convey an understanding of how they will behave in the  future.”14  8 http://fra.europa.eu/en/charterpedia/article/8 -protection -personal -data   9 Aeon (09/05/2016) Should we be afraid of AI?   10 Wired (09/11/2015) Google Ju st Open Sourced TensorFlow, Its Artificial Intelligence Engine   11 Wired (10/12/2015) Facebook Open Sources Its AI Hardware as It Races Google   12 Wired (26/01/2016) Microsoft Open Sources Its Artificial Brain to One -Up Google   13 https://www.darpa.mil/program/explainable -artificial -intelligence   14 Ibid fn[13]

Fairness to all  stakeholders, and to society as a whole, requires  businesses to consider the wider impact of AI de sign and  developments. As AI systems are able to perform tasks,  previously undertaken by humans, in a more efficient and  reliable way, the workplace is going to change and it is  therefore important that companies pay attention to how  this will affect its e mployees and customers.     One widely held belief that is certain to be challenged is  the assumption that automation will primarily challenge  workers who have little education and lower -skill levels.  The reality is different. While lower -skill occupation wi ll  continue to be affected, a great many university  educated, white collar workers are going to discover that  parts of their job, too, can increasingly be challenged as  software automation and predictive algorithms advance  rapidly in capability. Current di scussions examine the  best approaches that will minimise potential disruptions,  making sure that the fruits of AI advances are widely  shared and competition and innovation are encouraged  and not stifled.15     Technology, of course, will not shape the future  in  isolation. Other major societal challenges will also impact  (e.g. ageing population, development of different  professional figures). However, companies have a role to  play in ensuring that this transition will be smooth. This  means tackling issues such  as long term unemployment,  social inequality and lack of trust from customers in the  way AI is utilised.     Integrity   As the saying has it, integrity is doing the right thing even  when nobody’s watching. In the context of AI, we should  ensure that it is use d only for its intended purpose, even  when there is no means to enforce this. When designing  or selling an AI system, it is important to ensure –  whenever possible – that the use of AI solutions by third  parties is restricted to the intended purpose and th e end  user will respect the agreed uses of the technology.                                          Binding clauses that define the use for which the  technology is intended are helpful, however it is also  necessary to conduct appropriate due diligence on the  clients as well to minimise the risk of a potentially  dangerous misuse. From the conversations that the IBE  had in preparation for this briefing, it emerged that this  is becoming increasingly common.     The danger of AI comes primarily from the way it is  used. The use of drones harnessed with A I systems is  a good example of this. If on the one hand they can  significantly enhance some rescue and health   operations – drones used to spot sharks along the  Australian coasts or drones used to deliver blood and  other vital supplies to remote areas of Rw anda, often  unreachable during the rainy season are just two  examples,16 on the other hand the same technology  can be used in conflict areas posing a completely  different set of ethical issues.17     Control   Much of the public scepticism  around the future of  AI is  fuelled by the fear that humans might lose control over  the machines, which would then prevail and possibly  wipe out humanity altogether. Recently, it was reported  in headlines that Facebook abandoned an experiment  after two AI programs appeared to be chatting to each  other in a strange language that made it easier for them  to work but only they could understand.18 The extensive  coverage of this story, which appears to be largely  exaggerated by the media and only partially grounded  on facts, is just an example of public concern on this  and suggest that it is an issue that needs to be  addressed.19    To have full control over AI systems, it is important that  both companies and algorithm designers only work with  technology that they fully understand. Bein g able to  explain the functionalities of a technology of which they  appear to be in control of is essential to build trust with  employees, customers and all stakeholders. In  addition, it minimises the risk that it is misused or that  other parties might tak e advantage of it for personal  gains.   15 Ford (2015) Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future   16 Fox News (28/08/2017) Drones are using artificial intelligence to protect Australian beachgoers from sharks  and The  Verge (13/10/17) Drones begin delivering blood in Rwanda   17 The Guardian (18/02/2017) Has a rampaging AI algorithm really killed thousands in Pakistan?   18 The independent (31/07/2017) Facebook’s Artificial Intelligence shut down after they start talking to each other in their  own language    19 Gizmondo (31/07/17) No, Facebook Did Not Panic and Shut Down an AI Program That Was Getting Dangerously  Smart

Impact   Artificial Intelligence has become a buzzword in  today’s business world. In an environment where new  machine learning technologies are created and  developed at a fast pace, companies might be tempted  to adopt them because they want to be ahead of the  game and on top of the latest technological  advancement, rather than because they really need  them or because they benefit their business. Just  because a company can use a certain AI technology,  it doesn’t necessarily mean that it should. As the CBI  suggested, measuring the impact of AI is important to  help companies to avoid unnecessary costs and  potential risks deriving from the use of inadequate or  inappropriate technologies.20    Further, measuring the potential impact that a new  technology can have before adopting it, can identify  undesired side -effects and consequent ethical risks.  Therefore, it is important to test the algorithms and AI  implementations in difficult situations to gauge a clear  idea of unwanted outcomes.     Through such tests, companies need to identify what  are the ethical risks involved, who is going to be  impacted – positively and negatively, who is going to  bear the costs, and whether there is a valuable and  less risky alternative.     Box 3 provides some examples of issues to consider  when assessing the impact and risks of AI.     Box 3 AI control and testing procedures .    Given the rapid adoption of AI in business, there is the  risk that the governance systems required to mitigate  the potential risks of its deployment are overlooked.  Data scien ce teams should have structured controls  and testing around their development process, which  are overseen centrally by the business. Because AI  tools are often self -learning, control and testing  procedures should be dynamic and constant.     This includes:     - Bias detection and correction;   - Risk assessment and impact analysis of each AI tool, and  approval by management   - Involvement of ethics team to ensure that the AI systems  in place are in line with the organisation’s values   - Involvement of legal and co mpliance teams to ensure  compliance with data protection and privacy regulations   - Robust cybersecurity and controls, including access  control.      Accountability   Accountability is central to the definition of good practice in  corporate governance. It implie s that there should always  be a line of responsibility for business actions to establish  who has to answer for the consequences. AI systems  introduce an additional strand of complexity: who is  responsible for the outcome of the decision -making process  of a n artificial agent? This is compounded by AI  development being largely outsourced by companies rather  than developed in -house.     Machines,  as such,  are not moral  agents  and therefore   they cannot  be held responsible  for their actions.21 Who  should be account able, then, when an AI system violates  ethical values? Should it be the designer of the algorithm,  the company that adopts it or the final user? It is difficult to  provide a univocal answer and a rich debate has flourished  on this topic. Although the quest ion of responsibility  remains largely unanswered, a valuable approach would  be for each of the parties involved to behave as if they  were ultimately responsible.   In practical terms, it is advisable to include in contracts a  clause to define each party’s r esponsibilities and their  limitations. Although it is not always practicable or  comprehensive and it can’t substitute for individual  empowerment, this can help to prevent a situation where all  parties have shared responsibility and therefore it becomes  difficult to attribute accountability appropriately.      Learning   To maximise the potential of AI, people need to learn how it  works and what are the most efficient and effective ways to  use it. Employees and other stakeholders need to be  empowered to take personal responsibility for the  consequences of their use of AI a nd they need to be  provided with the skills to do so. Not only the technical skills  20 The Guardian (20/10/2017) Artificial intelligence commission needed to predict impact, says CBI   21 D. G.

It is  important that companies improve their  communications around AI, so that people feel that  they are part of its development and not its passive  recipients, or even victims.   Ensuring business leaders are informed about these  technologies and how they work is essential to  prevent that they are unintentionally misused.   However, it is important that businesses engage with  external stakeholders as well, including media  reporters and the general public, to improve their  understanding of the technologies in use and ensure  that they can assess more accurately the impact of A I  on their lives.   The role of business   Business decision -makers, employees, customers  and the public need to be able to understand and talk  about the implications of business and AI to be at the  forefront in the use of it. It is essential that companies  know the impact and side effects that new  technologies might have on their business and  stakeholders.   The topic of AI and its applications and ethical  implications for business is broad and requires a  complex multi -stakeholder approach to be tackled.  Howe ver, there are some measures that  organisations can adopt to minimise the risk of ethical  lapses due to an improper use of AI technologies.   Design new and more detailed decision -making tools for meta -decisions , to help those that design algorithms and construct AI systems to ensure that they ‘do the right thing’ and act in line with the company’s ethical values. This can come in the form of dedicated company policies that ensure proper testing and appropriate sign off from relevant stakeholders, both in ternally and externally. Engage with third parties for the design of AI algorithms only if they commit to similar ethical standards : the design of these systems might be outsourced and it is important to conduct ethical due diligence on business partners.  A similar principle applies to clients and customers towhom AI technologies are sold. Testing a third  party algorithm in a specific situation  is also  important to ensure accuracy.   Establish a multi -disciplinary Ethics Research Unit to examine the implic ations of AI research and potential applications ; and be proactive in publishing the working papers from such a Unit to internal and external stakeholders. Introduce ‘ethics tests’ for AI machines, where they are presented with an ethical dilemma . It is important to measure how they respond in such situations in order to predict likely outcomes in a real-life dilemma, and therefore assume responsibility for what the machines will do.22 Empower people through specific training courses and communication ca mpaigns in order to enable them to use AI systems efficiently, effectively and ethically . These training courses should be directed not only at the technical personnel building the tool, but also at senior business stakeholders who should understand the as sumptions, limitations and inner workings of AI technology. Box 4 Questions to ask yourself   Many organisations include in their code of ethics (or  similar document) guidance to support individual  decision -making through a decision -making model or  guide. This often takes the form of ‘questions to ask  yourself’. This could be applied in a similar manner  before adopting or using AI:   What is the purpose of our job and what AI do we  need to achieve it?   Do we understand how these systems work? Are we  in control of this technology?   Who benefits and who carries the risks related to the  adoption of the new technology?   Who bears the costs for it? Would it be considered fair  if it became widely known?   What are the ethical dimensions and what values are  at stak e?  What might be the unexpected consequences?   Do we have other options that are less risky?   What is the governance process for introducing AI?   Who is responsible for AI?   How is the impact of AI to be monitored?   Have the risks of its usage been considered?   22 Bias detection methodologies have widely been studied. As an example, see The Guardian (19/12/16) Discrimination  by algorithm .
