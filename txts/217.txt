  4    1. Overview   1. One of the tasks of the European Banking Authority (EBA), the European  Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and  Occupational Pensions Authority (EIOPA), collectively referred to  as the  European Supervisory Authoritie s (ESAs), is to monitor any emerging risks  for consumers and financial institutions as well as new and existing financial  activities and to adopt measures, where needed, with a view to promoting  consumer protection and the safety and soundness of markets a nd  convergence in regulatory practices. The coordination of the ESAs’ actions in  these areas takes  place within the Joint Committee.   2. In monitoring consumer protection developments and financial innovations,  the ESAs have noted the continued increase in th e use of Big Data, albeit to  varying extents, across the banking, insurance and securities sectors and  across different EU Member States.   3. As a consequence, t he 2016 Work Programme of Joint Committee of the  European Supervisory Authorities 1 mandated its Su b-Committee on  Consumer Protection and Financial Innovation to work on the opportunities  and challenges of the use of Big Data by financial institutions.   4. On 19 December 2016, the Joint Committee issued a Discussion Paper on  the use of Big Data by financial  institutions 2.  5. Stakeholders were asked to respond to the questions raised in the Discussion  Paper by 17 March 2017.   6. A total of 68 responses were received. Public responses are published on the  ESMA’s website .3  2. Contents   7. Section 3 of this Final Report cont ains an executive summary summarising  the key aspects  of the various s ections of the Final Report .   8. Section 4 contains a detailed feedback statement which summarises , through  the angle of 1 2 key topics , the feedback received from stakeholders and the  ESAs’ reaction in response to some of the issues raised by respondents.   9. Most of the comments made  by the ESAs in Section 4 (ESAs’ reaction) are  further developed in Section 5 which sets out the ESAs conclusions  including  a reference to some existing requiremen ts deriving from European financial                                                              1 2016 Work Programme of Joint Committee of the European Supervisory Authorities - Available here.    2 Joint Committee Discussion Paper on the use of Big Data for Financial Institutions – Available here.   3 Available here. 
  5    and non -financial legislation which are relevant to the use of Big Data  techniques by financial institutions as well as a list of items that could be  used by financial institutions to develop good practices in relation t o the use  of Big Data.   
  6    3. Executive summary   10. The responses received from stakeholders generally coincided with the  content of the Discussion Paper , particularly with regard s to the challenges  and opportunities identified . Yet, the feedback received enabled  to nuance  some of the statements contained in the Discussion Paper and to better  inform the ESAs assessment of the use of Big Data across the three sectors  and its impact on the financial sector  as a whole .   11. The respondents generally agreed with the tenta tive definition and  description of the Big Data phenomenon provided in the Discussion Paper,  while highlighting that any definition of a fast evolving phenomenon such as  Big Data should remain flexible to accommodate inevitable adjustments.   12. The respondents  noted that the accuracy of the data used in Big Data  analyses is of utmost importance and expressed concerns regarding practices  that do not guarantee the accuracy of the data collected (such as the  gathering of data from social media) , which could lead t o erroneous decisions  based on this inaccurate data or on spurious correlations arising from it .  There was however a quite wide agreement on the fact that the entry into  application of  new legislation including  the GDPR 4 (General Data Protection  Regulation) will help mitigate risks in this field.   13. Many respondents raised concerns regarding the potential consequences of  the increasing level of segmentation of customers enabled by Big Data on  the comparability availability, a ffordability and pricing practices of products  and services, although to date there is limited evidence of such risks  materialising . Some respondents  pointed out  the overarching obligation of  financial institutions to treat customers fairly and the  need to  ensure that  sensitive data are only used based on the consumers’ informed consent  and  only for limited purposes. Some stakeholders also warned that consumers  may not be fully aware of Big Data tools being used and stressed the need  to increase transparenc y for consumers to enable them to better understand  and control the use of their data.   14. A number of  respondents also highlighted that the growing  use of Big Data  could  increas e the breadth of the consequences of cyber risks attacks . On  this issue, the ESAs clarify that a number of requirements have been enacted  in recent years at the European level aiming at the prevention of cyber risks.   This Final Report also highlights the existence of European Union legislation  specifically aiming  at tackling information and systems risks.   15. Respondents also highlighted the numerous benefits arising from Big Data .  A large number of respondents (across the three sectors) agreed that the                                                              4 The GDPR will enter into application from 25 May 2018.  
  7    use of Big Data techniques could help financial institutions to develop  products better tailored to the needs of their target market and support the  implementation of product governance  and foster the development,  distribution and monitoring of products, as well as the broader supervision  of  product governance requirements.  Other benefits arising from Big Data  highlighted by respondents included enhancing the efficiency of the internal  procedures inside the organisations, improving the fight against fraud, or  enabling better customer -client interactions.    16. The feedback recei ved from respondents confirms and reinforces the need  for regulators and supervisors to continue monitoring closely the  development of Big Data techniques and their use by financial institutions.  This monitoring should focus on the aspects that have been i dentified as  bearing the strongest risks.   17. In this  Final Report, t he ESAs highlight the relevance of a number of existing  requirements in the sectorial financial legislation a s well as  in other relevant  areas (such as data protection, cyber security and consumer protection ). The  ESAs believe that the legislative requirements existing in these areas  constitute an already quite solid framework  to mitigate the risks identified i n  the context of this work . The ESAs also note that this framework will be  further strengthen ed with the entry into application of several key pieces of  legislation in the financial sector (e.g. IDD, MIFID II, PSD2) as well as in the  data protection sector ( notably,  GDPR).  The ESAs will monitor how and to  which extent these additional requirements  will contribute to mitigate further  the risks identified in the context of this work.   18. The ESAs consequently consider that a legislative intervention at this point  would be premature , given that some key pieces of legislation are yet to be  implemented or have just entered into application. However, the ESAs  believe that it is very important for supervisors across various policy areas  to coordinate better to ensure that these requirements are effectively  complied with.   19. The ESAs also invite fina ncial institutions to develop and implement good  practices on the use of Big Data  in order to promot e a fair, transparent and  non-discriminatory treatment of consumers and to ensure  that Big Data  strategies are designed in a responsible way  and are fully a ligned with the  interests of consumers.  To this end, the ESAs suggest an indicative a list of  arrangements and behavio urs that could be followed by financial institutions  to develop good practices  on the use of Big Data . The ESAs propose  items in  three keys area, namely (i) “Robust Big Data processes and algori thm”, (ii)  “Consumer Protection” and (iii) “Disclosure on the use of Big Data”.   
  8    4. Feedback statement   A. Description of the Big Data  phenomenon   i. Description of the phenomenon and state of  implementation across financial institutions   20. Most respondents (across  sectors) agreed with the description of Big Data  suggested in the Discussion Paper ,5 which notably referred to the 3 “Vs”,  standing for “Volume”, “V ariety” and “Velocity” 6. Some stakeholders however  also su ggested a definition following a 4 or 5 V approach (for “Veracity ”  and/or “Value ”). It was also pointed out that Big Data refers to processing of  data sets so large and complex that they cannot be handled by traditional  data pro cessing software . Several respondents also commented that any  definition of a fast evolving phenomenon such as Big Data should remain  flexible to accommodate the inevitable need for future adjustments.   21. For some stakeholders, the Big Data phenomenon is not new and Big Data  tools have already been used for several years. For others, it is a new  phenomenon with applications in the financial sector still at an early stage .   22. Most respondents across the three sectors agree that Big Data may have  an  impact on almost all financial institutions and on their products and services.  Certain respondents stated that the impact of Big Data would be specifically  strong for Fintechs or financial institutions that can affo rd the initial costs as  well as big consulting/technology companies that can offer analytic al  services. From a broader perspective, respondents generally agreed that Big  Data may be an important factor of economic competitiveness.   23. For certain  respondent s the main areas of application of Big Data  observed  so far concern the  improve ment of  the understanding of consumers’  preferences. Based on improved information (for instance from personal  devices /online data, etc .) product/service providers strengthen the  feedback  loop between them and consumers . This may lead to increased  personalisation of products and services as well as more accurate consumer  profile /risk assessments. Several respondents  mentioned  further examples  of the use of Big Data : increasing  sales of pay as you drive or pay as you live  insurance  (also known a s “usage -based insurance”) ; increased  personalisation of risk assessment; credit scoring using broad range s of data;  fraud management; increase d use  of robo -advice. Certain respondents also                                                              5 Joint Committee Discussion Paper on the use of Big Data by Financial Institutions  (Page 7)  – Available here.   6 The first “V”, “Volume”, refers a large volume of data. The second “V” stands for “Variety” refers to the  variety of  data as the result of the combination of different datasets and sources. The third “V” “Velocity” refers  notably to the speed of data processing.  
  9    saw potential in the areas of claims handling, fraud detection, pricing, risk  selection and underwriting .  ii. Type and sources of data and IT tools   24. A few banking and  insurance respondents mentioned that most data stems  from internal sources and, in comparison, data from external sources would  play a minor role. Some insurance respondents noted that by nature the  industry requires the processing of large amounts  of dat a; a few also noted  the recent increase of the use of external data sources or of climate data.  Other stakeholders provided examples of different types of data they use:  credit history, behavioural data, consumer habit data, statistical data and  data found  in broader networks, individual data as well as aggregated data.  However, the collection of data, such as on online behaviour and geolocation,  going beyond the range of data required to provide usual financial  services  was also pointed out.    25. Respondents a cross sectors stated that they use Big Data applications  developed both internally and externally. Several securities markets  stakeholders stated that they get exte rnal software support, but already have  or are going to develop their algorithms and analyti cs internally.   B. Level playing field and fair competition   26. For some respondents, the use of Big Data could contribute to ensuring a  level playing field (e .g. by allowing smaller companies to compete with larger  financial players or to exploit their data resources  currently unused ) or could  lead to intere sting cooperation arrangements  (e.g. between financial  institutions  and Fintech  companies ).  27. On the contrary, a number o f respondents , particularly from the banking  sector, were critical with respect to what they perceived a s possible  regulatory arbitrage or an  unlevel  playing field between regulated financial  institutions and Fintech  start-ups and other technology firms. For instance,  some of these respondents  pointed out that some Fintech start -ups and other  large technology firms fall outside the remit of financial legislation rules and  therefore do not need to comply  for example with restrictions concerning  the  use of cloud solutions , prudential requirements or remuneration rules.    28. A number of responde nts consequently  noted that in order to maintain a fair  competition among various players, it is important to ensure that the  principle of “same business, same rules” is respected, and that any potential  regulat ory or supervis ory measures should remain technology neutral in  order to foster inn ovation and level playing field. S ome were also critical  towards regulatory sandboxes  developed by certain NCAs , for similar  reasons .  
  10    29. From a different perspective, other stakeholders mentioned the existence of  obstacles to fair competition between market players result ing from  the  creation of data oligopolies  by some categories of s takeholders and the  difficulties to access data by others . These stakeholders expressed the view  that data is becoming a key competitive  factor that could undermine  competition in the markets if not all actors have the same opportunities to  access certain types of data. They illustrated their point referring to   information on driving behaviours, vehicle condition or geolocation collected  by car manufactures through the increasing penetration of connected  vehicles and telematics  and potentially not accessible to insurance companies   and other interested stakeholders .  30. Some respondents noted that  beyond the regulatory arbitrage issues  mentioned above, some other non -regulatory factors (e.g. distortions by  important data providers through unfair pricing, availability of qualified staff,  tackling legacy issues, technological and reputational risks) could  also  interfere with the fair  competition among market participants using Big Data  technologies.  Some respondents accordingly suggested to include references  to competition rules in the section on th e relevant regulatory framework.   ESAs’ reactions   31. The ESAs acknowledge the concerns expressed by respondents and intend  to continue monitoring the development of the market, notably with a view  to encouraging and, when within their remit, ensuring a level playing field   among players in the market.   32. However, the ESAs would like to highlight that several existing pieces of  legislation address , to some extent, the concerns raised by respondents  regarding the lack of a level playing field . The GDPR , which among other  provisions includes the principle of data portability,  notably will apply to all  service providers processing personal data of European Union individuals,  irrespective of whether they are financial institutions or non -regulated  entities. The GDPR also recognises the principle of data portabil ity which  should help mitigate ‘lock -in’ effects for consumers . Also, the PSD 2 will bring  into its scope new providers that were previously unregulated by European  financial legislation, such as account information service providers. Such  providers will b e subject to new and harmonised rules at EU level, which  should mitigate some of the concerns on consumer protection, security and  competition that respondents mentioned.   33. On these issues, the ESAs will continue engaging with the other regulators  and super visors, both at European and national levels.  
  11    C. Impact of Big Data on financial inclusion ,  comparability  and p ricing practices   34. Respondents across sectors provided examples of products and services that  would be impacted by Big Data. These examples confirmed that the granular  segmentations  of consumers  enabled by Big Data have a number of impacts  on aspects such as marketing campai gns, pricing practices, contextual offers  (e.g. cross -selling), individuali sed products and services , credit and risk  scoring / segmentation, fraud prevention , etc.  i. Impact on financial inclusion    35. An important number of respondents agreed that Big Data is likely to have  positive implications on the availability and affordability of financial products  and services for some consumers. For example, some stakeholders pointed  out that Big Data may enhance a ccess to financial services for clients with  limited financial/ credit history. Respondents  mentioned the example of the  use of wearable telematics devices to improve how chronic conditions, such  as diabetes, are managed and used to reduce the risk of disa bility, thus  improving the access to insurance for such consumers.  Also, a majority of  respondents agreed that Big Data techniques allowed a better understanding  of customer behaviour, which could help firms to better adapt to needs of  specific clients gro ups, such as millennials .   36. On the other hand, some respondents (representing consumer organisations  but also professional associations) considered that, in competitive markets,  Big Data could have significant negative effects on the availability and  afford ability of financial products and services for some consumers with  higher risk profiles or about whom only little data is available due to their  limited digital/online activities. Furthermore, a marketing segmentation that  is too granular may limit the choice  of products and services  offered to some  consumers . Consumers  mentioned that assessing risks more granularly could  result in changes to terms and conditions offered to consumers , especially  when risks cannot be easily avoided . These stake holders gave the example  of owners or tenants located in geographical areas exposed to a high risk  of  flooding  that may face difficulties to obtain a  house insurance cover age.  37. For some stakeholders, certain conditions have to be fulfilled to achieve  progress on affordability and availability of financial services u sing Big Data.  These conditions include potential supervisory and regulatory actions, such  as monitoring of algorithms and improving the standardisation of data to  facilitate its use for onl ine (e.g. aggregators/comparative) tools.  A few  respondents also highlighted that personal advice by intermediaries would  be necessary to make the benefits materialise.  
  12    ii. Impact on the capacit y to compare financial services  and products   38. A significant number of industry stakeholders were of the view that Big Data  could allow consumers to benefit from effective comparison websites or robo advice that would help them understand/select across various  products/services. Moreover, legislation such as MiFID, IDD, PRIIPs, MCD  and PAD will contribute to facilitating comparison/ switching of products and  services for consumers.   39. Some other respondents (including consumer representatives) expressed the  view that the increasing individualisation of products and services would  reduce the capacity to compare between products/services. These  respondents also considered that  risks will be heightened with the further   development of AI/machine learning and the opacity of algorithms (making  it more and more difficult for firms t o explain the logic of decisions/services  or products offered to clients). The capacity to compare products/services  could be further diminished also in cases of firms apply ing different Big Data  tools to similar offers, thereby increasing information asym metry to the  detriment of consumers.   40. Some respondents consider that it is the task of the market to solve potential  issues of incomparability, as more experience with the use of Big Data is   gathered, but that in case the market will not be able to solve these  comparability issues, guidelines or standardisation mechanisms for  data/comparison tools may become necessary to mitigate these issues.   41. A consumer organisation noted that f rom a broade r perspective, an  European -wide framework for simple, transparent and cost effective  financial   products c ould limit the potential negative impact of Big Data through  enhanci ng transparency and competition.   iii. The impact on pricing practices   42. Some respondents c onsider that Big Data may support more adequate risk  pricing or cheaper premium  for car insurance  for certain drivers, which could  benefit consumers.  By contrast, other respondents consider that Big Data  increases the risk of treating consumers  unfairly, f or example, by offering  the same service with different prices depending on clients’ behaviours  (“price optimisation”). This may be detrimental for consumers, especially if  behavioural biases (such as limited time, resources or financial capabilities  of consumers ) are exploited.   43. Some respondents also highlighted the emergence of new moral hazard risks  related  to the use of Big Data. In particular, they saw a risk, against the  backdrop of increased segm entation and price optimisation  that some 
  13    consumers may potentially  seek to artificially improve their ratings either by  paying online reputation management companies or by tampering with data  generated about them, and tailor their profiles with data that is “helpful” to  them.   44. In the view of some respondents, the development of aggregators and  comparators could mitigate these risks by empowering investors to compare  prices. Some stakeholders believed that existing rules are sufficient to  address these concerns . In comparison,  others considered that competition  and innovation would bring solutions, notably by developing services to help  clients feel more empowered or compare products and prices applied.  Conversely, consumer representatives (but also some industry associatio ns)  had more reserved views and consider ed that there may be a need to further  monitor developments on this point.   45. In this context, some respondents see a need for regulation which tackles  especially discrimination and inappropriate price optimisation, and believe  that the use of Big Data techn iques to adjust marketing and pricing for similar  clients should be monitored.   46. Also, several respondents suggested that supervisory authorities should  make use of Big Data tools to their advantage (to monitor behaviours in the  market and risks) .   ESAs’ rea ctions   47. In light of the above feedback, as well as gathered evidence, the ESAs will  further assess, in each of their respective sectors, whether there is a need to   further monitor the impact of highly granular segmentations on access and  availability of certain financial services and products , as well as  whethe r there  is merit in monitoring the development of tools able to mitigate potential  negative effects.   48. The ESAs will also assess , where relevant , in each of their respective sectors,  whether there is merit in further monitor ing how firms’ pricing practices and  rating factors are designed  and operate in practice, as well as the drivers,  types of syst ems and data that fi rms use to set the final price to consumers.   49. In addition to compliance with applicabl e legal requirements  (in particular  the requirement to treat customers fairly) , the recommendations set out in  Section 5 below aim to incentivise financial institutions to take into account  the interests of  consumer s when developing products based on Big Data and   tackle , or at least mitigate , the potential negative impacts of a highly  granular segmentation of customers enabled by the use of Big Data  techniques.  
  14    D. Potential shortcomings in the transparency of  Big Data  tools  50. A few respondents were of the view that the Discussion Paper failed to  acknowledge that predictions based on Big Data can be flawed. It was also  noted that machine learning and the development of artificial intelligence  could render the decision -making proces s less transparent and, in general,  the intensity of the risks listed in the Discussion Paper could increase as a  direct consequence of such new tools.   ESAs’ reactio ns  51. The ESAs acknowledge that these issues deserve closer monitoring going  forward, and that it is important for both ESAs/ NCAs and fi nancial institutions   to develop capacities to be able to test methodologies of Big Data processes  in order to prevent biases a nd flaws.   E. Accuracy of data  - Fair and transparent use of  data collected   52. Beyond  issues linked to Big Data algorithms as such, a significant number of  stakeholders highlighted that the performance of Big Data tools depends  heavily on the reliability of the data used. These respondents cautioned that  errors or biases in algorithms  remain possible and can impact customers.  For  example , large amounts of data may lead to new correlations between  different things, but correlation does no t mean  causation and may lead to  incorrect decisions based on them.   53. In addition, some stakeholders pointed out the need to ensure that sensitive  data are used only based on the consumers’ informed consent, and only for  limited purposes. Some stakeholders also warned that consumers may not  be fully aware of Big Data tools being used (e.g. in case of use of box ticking  agreements) and stressed the need to increase transparency for consumers  to enable them to better understand and control the use of their data .   54. Some respondents also suggested that a broader discussion should take  place in order to determine which types of data should be allowed to be used  from an ethical point of view and on whether there may be types of data that  are allowed by existing regul ation but are against the consumers’ interest or  need clearer approval from the consumer.   55. On the other hand, several respondents were of the view that data protection  requirements (especially GDPR) will provide  a sufficient framework for Big  Data, because  these requirements are  sector neutral and address most of  the risks identified. While stakeholders acknowledged that data protection is 
  15    not within the remit of the ESAs, some respondents believed that further  guidance on the implementation of the GDPR is needed to take into account  the needs of the financial industry and consumers, enhance legal certainty  and foster security and trust of market participants in Big Data based  products and services. Also, some respondents expressed the view that  cooperation on the use of data in financial services between banking  supervisors, data protection authorities and financial intelligence units should  be improved.    ESAs’ reactions   56. The ESAs note that the GDPR sets sector neutral requirements which apply  to any person processing personal data of individuals in the E uropean Union 7.  In addition, as pointed out by a number of respondents, the GDPR does not  fall in the remit of the ESAs. This means that the ESAs are not positioned to  issue opinion on the way the GDPR should  be interpreted, applied or  enforced. Nevertheless, the ESAs acknowledge the need to further engage  with data protection supervisors to explore ways to provide further guidance  to both consumers and financial institutions.   57. The ESAs note that the entry into  application of the GDPR, as of May 2018 ,  will increase the requirements currently applicable in relation to data  accuracy 8 and enhance data protection and that this may potentially mitigate  the risks identified in relation to data protection  including dat a accuracy .  F. Cyber risks   58. A large number of respondents agreed that cyber risks in general should be  regarded as a primary source of concern for consumers and market players,  since the processed data can be highly sensitive and the impact of  cybersecurity br eaches can have major  consequences . An important number  of respondents were of the view that Big Data increase s exposure to cyber  risks, with detrimental consequences for both consumers and financial  institutions.  Some respondents noted that this was due to the reception of  data from different sources, the use of IT arrangements (including storage   and outsourcing  in the cloud).   59. Respondents  agreed with this view and considered that  cyber risks are the  same regardless of whether a regular database or a Big Data base  is being  used, although a few respondents stressed that Big Data could increase the  impact of cyber risk related events (and not only the exposure to such cyber  risks).                                                               7 GDPR, Article 2 .  8 GDPR, Article 5(1)(c).  
  16    60. Some respondents mentioned that many institutions were already active in  mitigating these risks  by developing comprehensive cyber insurance  strategies  and regularly invest ing in IT systems aiming at the highest  possible security levels and have put in place robust data governance  processes.   61. Several respondents across all three se ctors stated that cross -sectoral  guidance/best practices would be helpful to facilitate the implementation of  recently adopted regulations  as well as  information sharing and other cyber  security measures . Respondents also  stressed the need to foster  collaboration and convergence on data standards, frameworks and  methodologies within Europe and at the international level, considering that  cyber risk s are in essence cross border.  Some respondents also highlighted  that existing legislation (such as the  NIS and GDPR) already address es cyber  risk management .  ESAs’ reactions   62. The ESAs stress that financial institutions, to the extent that they are subject  to sectorial legislation , are required to have in place measures to ensure  continuity and regularity of their services and activities .9 Therefore, financial  institutions  are expected to consider cyber risks, including cyber risks  associated with the use of Big Data, when setting -up and up -dating their  internal policies.   63. The ESAs acknowledge that cybersecuri ty risks is a n important area of  growing concern , notably in the financial sector . The ESAs also  note that   several initiatives, both at  European and national levels, have been taken in  recent years to tackle this issue. In particular, within the framework of the  EU Cybersecurity Strategy, the adoption of the NIS Directive 10 establishes  that operators of essential services (including credit institutions and financial  market infrastructures) should be required to (i) take appropriate security  measures to manag e the risks posed to the security of network and  information systems that they use in their operations and (ii) notify serious  incidents to the relevant national authority 11. The provisions of the NIS  Directive also extend to key digital service providers o utside the financial  sector, such as search engines, cloud computing services and online  marketplaces , which will be required to comply with the security and incident  notification requirements under the NIS Directive.                                                               9 Article 16(4) of MiFID II, Article 5(1) of PSD  2, Article 41 of Solvency II.   10 The NIS Directive will enter into force as from 10 May 2018 (Article 25(1) of the NIS Directive).   11 See also EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Assessment under the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP):  Available here. 
  17    64. In addition to the NIS Directive, cyber security and security risks are also  addressed under the sectorial legislation  as well as GDPR , as further detailed  in Section 5 below.   G. Potential  systemic risks   65. Some stakeholders expressed concerns in relation to potential systemic risks ,  notably due to asset price volatility spirals  generated by the use of Big Data  techniques.   66. More generally, a number of respondents noted the significant reputational  risks associated with the application of Big Data tools (especially in case of  misuse of consumers p ersonal data, in case of security leaks, erosion of  consumers’ trust in financial services providers, etc…).   ESAs’ reactions   67. The ESAs will further assess, in each of their respective sectors, whether  there is a need to consider the possible role of Big Da ta in the emergence of  systemic risks as well as the way Big Data could be used to monitor systemic  risks.   68. The ESAs will also consider whether and how to account appropriately for Big  Data related systemic risks in their risk  assessment s.  H. Role of regulators/ supervisory authorities   69. The majority of respondents across the three sectors are of the view that the  existing regulatory and supervisory framework is sufficient and that  additional regulation regarding the use of Big Data by financial institutions is  not needed. However, some respondents also noted that the implementation  of Big Data technologies could benefit from further convergence and  guidance in how these requirements are interpreted acros s Member States  (for example, in relation to outsourcing rules)  or how they apply in practice  in the financial sector .   70. One stakeholder explicitly stated that in case certain risks materialise, the  ESAs and European Institutions should not exclude regulato ry or intervention  measures. If additional regulatory measures were required, a wide group of  stakeholders across the three sectors stated that they would prefer that such  regulatory measures are technologically neutral and apply to all sectors  equally.   71. Some respondents emphasised that Big Data was an opportunity for the  financial sector and highlighted the importance of collaboration and support 
  18    from regulators and supervisors in order to help data drive innovations under  a level playing field across the S ingle Market.   72. A few respondents also stated that the need for regulation should be treated  cautiously, since Big Data is still in an incipient phase, and that the impact of  differences in regulatory standards between the EU and the US should be  taken into  account, since Big Data is a global issue.   73. Respondents from the consumer side together with representatives from  academia and the industry stated , however , that supervisory authorities  should be able to detect and monitor emerging risks from the use of B ig Data,  including ESA/NCAs investigations on whether the use of certain types of  data may act against the interests of consumers and whether the use of Big  Data would require enhanced disclosures.   74. Some respondents also proposed that regulators need to ha ve their own  resources for Big Data supervision. The ability to review Big Data  methodologies is required in order to limit consumer and competition  detriment. A cross -sectoral range of respondents noted that Big Data would  itself enable regulators to test  other Big Data tools for shortcomings or the  assessment of return and performance of certain investment products.  Likewise, Big Data analysis tools could support Regtech and financial  institutions in the provision of information to regulators .  ESAs’ react ions  75. As already indicated, the ESAs will continue to closely monitor the use of Big  Data across the three sectors and take further actions if and when  required.   I. General comments  on potential benefits and  risks   76. The broad majority of respondents agreed with the ESAs description of  potential benefits and risks for consumers and respectively financial  institutions. Some specific comments were raised and are summarised below.   77. Some stakeholders provided examples of b enefits observed in practice  referring to inter alia  faster responses to enquiries of customers and  regulators or more efficient achievement of data storage obligations. A cross sectoral range of respondents noted that some other benefits should be  include d, such as the potential of Big Data to test other Big Data tools for  shortcomings, and, in the investment sector, the assessment of return and  performance of long -term investment products.   78. Some stakeholders noted that consumer interaction would be improv ed only  if financial institutions would share the data/algorithms with  consumers and 
  19    if consumers have access to such Big Data tools, which is not typically the  case.   79. Several respondents also noted that in order to pass on Big Data related cost efficienc y gains to consumers, effective competition, which is currently often  lacking, would be required. Likewise, new costs, such as for comparison and  guidance services or related to cyber security, data maintenance and HR,  could offset potential cost -efficienc y gains. In the same way, issues around  appropriate access to data as well as new conflicts of interests, could hamper  positive effects.   80. Some respondents however commented that some of the risks described in  the Discussion Paper are neither caused nor exclusively linked to Big Data or  only to the financial sector. Likewise, these risks could also stem from e.g.  IT systems or the complexity of the financial system. Violations of   requirements to  act in the clients’ best interests were rather conduct relat ed,  instead of being linked to the use of data driven technologies. Some  respondents stated that the potential risks described in the Discussion Paper  would only materialise if  the existing regulatory framework (consumer  protection, competition rules and f inancial rules) would not be applied and  enforced properly. The majority of respondents stated that there is  insufficient evidence on detrimental impact to justify additional regulatory  intervention at the moment.   i. Potential impact on the implementation of  product  governance   81. A wide group of respondents (across the three sectors) agreed that Big Data  could support the implementation of product governance, and oversight  measures by  helping manufacturers to better understand customer’s need s  and characteristics and to provide them with more targeted products  adapted  to consumers’ needs  and demands . Moreover, Big Data could support  manufacturers in monitoring whether their products  continue to  be well  suited to  the consumers’ interests, object ives and characteristics , as well as  in the broader supervision of product governance requirements.  This in turn  could contribute to mitigate potential consumer detriment and conflicts of  interest.   82. A few respondents , particularly from the banking sector,  however believed  that the applications of Big Data are in their infancy and therefore it is too  early to tell how Big Data would impact product governance rules.   ii. Potential impact on the provision of advice on  financial products to consumers   83. A majority of respondents believed that Big Data impacted positively the  provision of advice to consumers, since it allowed for a more accurate and 
  20    consistent analysis of consumers` needs, at potentially more affordable  prices.   84. However, other stakeholders ha d a different view, and pointed out the  potential negative impact of Big Data on financial advice. Some respondents  stated that Big Data based services/communications could raise risks for  clients to consider and treat as advice other types of services or receiving  advice without realising it is advice. The difference between targeted  sales/guidance and provision of advice should be effectively enforced and  disclosed to consumers. Some noted that advice at reduced price will be  limited since Big Data applic ations require significant investments in IT and  HR.   85. Moreover, certain respondents commented that the role of technology should  be to support the provision of advice but that technology could not replace  all human intervention/ face -to-face advisory servi ces. Others stressed that  the extent and quality of information provided by consumers would be  important for the results of Big Data analytics. Therefore, regulatory  guidance on techniques and methodologies on the risk -based models  underlying the provision  of advice would be welcomed.   86. However, several respondents noted that the GDPR rules on the use of  personal data in the context of automated decision -making, or the MiFID II  rules on advice and suitability statements , should adequately mitigate the  risks.   iii. Potential impact on KYC processes   87. The majority of respondents across the three sectors agreed that Big Data  has the potential of improving know -your-customer (KYC) processes and  contribute to the detection of high -risk customers, money laundering risks  and fraud more accurately. Respondents were also of the view that Big Data  could reduce the costs of KYC checks.   88. However, the risk that financial service providers might collect consumer data  with a commercial objective, using the AMLD requirements as  a  “smokescreen ”, was also mentioned.   iv. Potential impact on risk mitigation and prevention   89. Some respondents, particularly from the insurance sector, highlighted the  beneficial impact of Big Data tools in the prevention and mitigation of risks.  For example, the i ncipient use of telematics devices in insurance can help  consumers be more aware of their exposure to certain risks and prevent such  risks from materialising.  
  21    90. While acknowledging some of these benefits, some respondents from  consumer organisations consider ed that the use of Big Data analytics in  finance could be very intrusive in people’s personal li ves and start dictating  not only where  they drive but also how they eat , how many daily steps they  need to take or even how they brush their teeth .  ESAs’ reactions   91. The ESAs welcome the improvement that  the use of Big Data techniques  could bring on KYC processes  and would like to remind that the AMLD  strictly  prohibit s the processing of data collected in the context of this Directive for  any other purposes, including commercial purposes. 12  92. The ESAs also acknowledge the benefits of Big Data analytics in risk  mitigation and prevention when it is done in compliance with the applicable  legislations in place.    93. In addition , the ESAs will further assess, in each of t heir respective sectors,  whether there is a need to monitor the impact of Big Data technologies on  risk mitigation and prevention.   J. Potential non -regulatory barriers to the use of  Big Data   94. A majority of respondents believes that certain non -regulatory barriers may  interfere with the development and provision of Big Data tools. This includes  the difficulty in changing the legacy IT technology of financial institutions,  high investment costs ( for example, to hire skilled IT staff or to  manage/monitor the quality of data), or, third, the reputational risks  associated with the use of Big Data, especially if based on processing  consumer data or in case of security leaks.   95. In addition to the above barriers, respondents referred to other obstacles for  the development and application of Big Data, such as poor quality of data,  different standards for data formats , or consumers’ attitude/willingness to  have their data used.   K. Potential Additional existing  legal requirements   96. Respondents across all three sectors generally agreed with the requirements  listed in the section of the DP on the relevant regulatory framework.                                                               12 Article 41(2) of AMLD . 
  22    97. Some respondents suggested , however a couple of further references to be  added, for example in relation to copyright law, to Directive (EU) 2016/943  on the protection of undisclosed know -how and business information (trade  secrets) against their unlawful acquisition, or to national professional secrecy  rules, and the International Securities Services Associations Financial Crime  Compliance Principles.   L. Potential development of Artificial Intelligence  (AI) and Big Data   98. A number of respondents, especially in the securities sector, note d that the  current level of development of AI technology is not mature enough to clearly  predict how it could develop. However, a few stakeholders (including tech  providers/Fintechs) believed that this technology has a lot of potential to  instigate change,  such as through the ability of analysing big volumes of  unstructured and different data.   99. A majority of respondents saw AI as an additional layer of Big Data analytics  and a key tool to improve discovering patterns on captured data,  classification, evalua tion and prediction. Certain stakeholders however also  emphasized that AI would add to the complexity of Big Data tools, which  could be more difficult to understand for financial institutions, users and  supervisors.     
  23    5. Preliminary conclusions  of the ESAs   A. Overview   100. The ESAs welcome the numerous and detailed  comments  received. The  number of responses received 13 demonstrates the strong interest of  stakeholders for this phenomenon.    101. The use of Big Data by financial institutions, like many technology related  topics, represent s an area where it is difficult to predict future developments  accurately . Nevertheless , the responses received from stakeholders enable  the ESAs to better understand the key expected benefits and risks of this  innovation, as perceived by th e market. It appears that most stakeholders  agree that the use of Big Data has the potential to create numerous   opportunities to offer consumers a better quality of products and services as  well as benefits for financial institutions, provided that the key  risks are  adequately addressed.   102. As regards the need to address the risks identified in relation to this work,  the ESAs note that some facets of the risks posed by the use of Big Data  techniques are beyond the mandate of the ESAs even when such techniques  are used by financial institutions. It actually seems that specific legislation in  the field of data protection, cyberse curity and consumer protection is better  positioned to address some of the risks identified in the context of this work.   103. As part of their ongoing monitoring of the use of Big Data in the financial  sector, the ESAs will continue to engage on a regular basi s with the data  protection authorities and stand ready to support any initiatives by the data  protection supervisors to provide guidance to the market on the applicability  of the data protection requirements to Big Data applications in the financial  sector .   104. The ESAs consequently decided to highlight in this Final Report some of the  key responses brought by data protection, cybersecurity and consumer  legislation to the challenges posed by the use of Big Data.   105. Nevertheless, the ESAs consider that for the tim e being the current sectoral  financial legislation sets requirements that are capable to address a number  of risks specific to the use of Big Data techniques by financial institutions.  Indeed a number of existing far reaching requirements, while not design ed  with the risks posed by the use of Big Data in mind, are applicable  irrespective of the technological context. The ESAs will continue monitor ing  the compliance with these existing legislative requirements and assess  whether they effectively mitigate the  risks identified. A selection of the key                                                              13 68 Responses (public and confidential) were re ceived in response to the Discussion Paper.  
  24    requirements deriving from financial sectorial requirements relevant in the  context of the use of Big Data is laid down below . Furthermore, the ESAs  consider that a legislative intervention at this point would be p remature given  that some key pieces of legislation, such as the GDPR or the new  requirements under the PSD2, MIFID II or IDD, are still to be implemented  or just entered into application.   106. The ESAs also consider  it to be in the interest of financial institutions  (notably  taking in to consideration the importance for them to build a long -term good  reputation  and trustful relationships ) to develop and implement good  practices promoting a fair, transparent and non -discriminatory treatment of  consumers and ensuring that Big Data strategies remain fully aligned with  the interests  of consumers.   107. An indicative list of items that could be used by financial institutions to  develop good practices in relation to the use of Big D ata can be found below.   B. Requirements  in the European data protection ,  cybersecurity  and consumer protection  legislation   108. As mentioned above, the ESAs consider that there are already a considerable  number of legal requirements under the cross -sectoral legislation in the field  of data protection 14, cybersecurity  and consumer protection  that aim to  mitigate many of the risks identified in the context of this work and with  which financial institutions must comply.   109. The ESAs believe  it is relevant to highligh t some of the key requirements in  these areas relevant for financial institutions using Big Dat a techniques. For  the avoidance of doubt, the ESAs wish to stress that the aim of this Report  is not to  provid e an exhaustive overview of the applicable rules. The fact that  certain other requirements are not highlighted in this Report  does not  mean  that such requirements are not applicable for financial institutions using Big  Data.                                                                  14 Sectorial financial legislations requires compliance with applicable data protection legislation. See Article 78  MiFID II, Article 104a UCITS, Article 37 IDD, Article 94 PSD2, Article 62 CRDIV.  
  25    i. Requirements  in the field of Data Protection     General Data P rotection Regulation (GDPR) 15  Purpose limitation   110. This criterion require s financial institutions  to be able to justify the use of  certain data categories as well as ensure the data is accurate and updated over  time. This is done by defining a purpose for the collection of personal data and  ensuring that any further processing is compatible with the original purpose.   Data accuracy  and data minimisation   111. According to Article 5(1) of GDPR, data must be accurate and up -to date,  adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they  are processed. Further to th ese requirements  financial institutions should be  able to justify the use of certain data categories as well a s ensure the data is  accurate and updated over time.  This consent must be freely given, specific,  informed and unambiguous, and given a clear , affirmative action that shows  the data -subject has given his/her consent.   Meaningful consent   112. According to Articl e 6(1) of GDPR, the processing of personal data must be  carried out with the unambiguous consent 16 of the individual whose data is  being used (the “data subject”  or, for the purpose of this report,  the  consumer) 17.   113. While subject to a number of exceptions and exemptions, Article 9(2) of GDPR  provides that this consent must be an explicit consent when the processing  concerns personal data  revealing for instance racial or ethnic origin, political  opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or data concerning  health or sex life ).  According to Article 22 (c) of GDPR explicit consent may also be needed for  automated decision making 18.  114. It must however be mentioned that consent is not necessarily the only ground  available for processing. Indeed, other processing  grounds mentioned in Article  6(1) of GDPR include legitimate interest (article 6(1)(f) of GDPR), the necessity  of the processing to comply with a legal obligation (article 6(1)(c) of GDPR) or  the necessity for the performance of a contract concluded with the consumer  (article 6(1)(b) of GDPR).                                                               15 GDPR will enter into application on 25 May 2018 .  16 Article 4(11) of GDPR.   17 Some exceptions are foreseen in GDPR .  18 For further information  on profiling , please refer to “Guidelines on Automated individual decision -making and  Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679” of 3 October 2017  (17/EN, WP 251 ) issued by the Article 29  Data Protection Working Party.  
  26     Right to Access to Data   115. According to Article 15 of GDPR, c onsumers have a right  (i) to exercise the  right of access to their data, in order to verify the accuracy of the data and the  lawfulness of the processing, (ii) to request modifications  or even (iii) to object  to processing in certain circumstances.   116. According to Article 15 of GDPR , consumers should be informed in advance , if  data about them is to be used in an automated decision making  process ,  including profilin g, and should be given information about the consequences of  such processing.   Other Rights of Consumers   117. According to  Article 22  of GDPR, consumers  will also be able to  (i) ask  financial institution s that a human intervene in the profiling , to (ii) express   their point of view  and (iii) contest a decision based on profiling .  118. Consumers should also be given access to their “profiles”  and to the logic of  the decision -making that led to the development of the ir “profile ” (this may  imply for example the need for firms to explain how an algorithm  reached a  certain decision ).   119. Also, GDPR gives consumers the right to request and receive  the personal  data that they have provided to a data controller and to transmit th at data  to another controller 19 (data portability).   Organisational and governance requirements    120. The protection of consumers’ rights with regard to the processin g of personal  data also require s that appropriate technical and organisational measures  are  taken, both at the time of the design of the processing system and at the  time of the processing itself, particularly in order to maintain security and to  prevent any unauthorised access and  processing.   121. Financial institutions are also expected under the G DPR to be able to  demonstrate that they have taken the necessary steps to ensure compliance  with the GDPR 20. Among the measures that many firms may be required to  take under the GDPR are the adoption of internal policies and measures that  meet the principle s of privacy by design and by default 21, the appoint ment of                                                               19 Article 20 of GDPR .  20 E.g. Article 5 of  GDPR .  21 Article 25 and Recital 78 of GDPR . 
  27    a data protection officer (DPO) 22 and the carrying out of data protection  impact assessments 23.    E-Privacy Directive 24  122. The E-privacy Directive sets out rules to (i) ensure security in the processing  of personal data, (ii) require  notific ation of personal data breaches  and (iii)  guarantee confidentiality of communication s25. The E -Privacy Directive 26 also  provide s that the use of electronic communications networks to store  information or to gain access to information stored in the terminal equipment  of a subscriber or user (e.g. cookies) is only allowed on condition that the  subscriber or user concerned is provided with clear and comprehensive  information, inter alia about the purposes of the processing, and is offered  the right to refuse such processing by the data controller.   123. Article 13 of the E -Privacy Directive  bans unsolicited communications where  the consumer  has n ot given its consent.   ii. Requirements under the Network and Information  Systems Directive  (NIS) 27  124. According to Article 14 of the NIS Directi ve operators of essential services  (e.g. credit institutions, financial market infrastructures) have to take  appropriate security measures to manage the risks posed to the security of  network s and information systems which they use in their operations and to   notify serious incidents to the relevant national authority 28.  iii. Requirements  in the field of Consumer Protection    Unfair commercial practices Directive (U CPD)29  125. Article 5 of the UCPD  prohibits unfair commercial practices which are contrary  to the requirements of professional diligence and are likely to distort the  economic behaviour  of the consumer.   126. According to Article 5(4) of the UCPD, (i) m isleading actions or (ii) omissions   as we ll as (iii) aggressive practice , including making persistent and unwanted                                                              22 Articles 37 – 39 of GDPR .  23 Article 35 of GDPR .  24 Directive (EC) 2002/58/EC concerning the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the  electronic communications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications)   25 The rules may provide various protections concerning the use of cookies or similar technologies to store  information or access stored information on a user’s device.   26 Article 5(3) of E -Privacy Directive .  27 Directive 2016/1148 on Security of Network and Information Systems .  28 See also EBA Guidelines on ICT Risk Asse ssment under the Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process (SREP):  Available here.   29 Directive 2005/29/EC of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business -to-consumer commercial practices.  
  28    solicitations by telephone, e -mail or other media constitutes unfair   commercial practices.    Directive on Distance Marketing of Financial Services 30  127. Articles 9 and 10 of the Directive o n Distance Marketing of Financial Services   ban abusive marketing practices seeking to oblige consumers to buy a service  they have not solicited.   C. Requirements  under the sectorial f inancial  legislation    128. Sectoral financial legislation aims at remaining  technology neutral 31. The  European legislator s intend to ensure that financial institutions undertaking  the same activity are subject to the same set of requirements  irrespective of  the mean s through which the service is delivered. This approach aims at  preserving a level playing field among financial institutions while enabling  technological innovation.   129. This neutrality towards the technology used by financial institutions to service  customers does not mean that financial legislation is not intend ed to apply  to the use of technological tools such as Big Data techniques by financial  institutions. Sectoral financial legislation applies to the use of Big Data by  financial institutions.   130. Furthermore, t he ESAs consider that some  of the provisions containe d in the  sectoral financial legislation  are particularly relevant to tackle some of the  risks identified in relation to the use of Big Data techniques by financial  institutions . This sub -section lists these requirements . The list below is  no t   intended to be an exhaustive list of requirements 32.   i. Organisational  and prudential  requirements   131. The ESAs stress the relevance in the Big Data context of the provisions  requiring fi nancial institutions  to:  a. Establish and operate  sound internal control mechanisms, effective  procedures for risk assessment and effective control and safeguard  arrangements for information processing systems 33.                                                               30 Directive 2002/65/EC on distance marketing of consumer financial services.   31 See European Commission Consultation Paper, “Fintech: a more competitiv e and innovative European financial  sector” 23 Mars 2017 .  32 This list refers mostly to legislative acts that already entered into force in the EU, although some of them are  yet to be implemented by Member States at the date of publication of this report.   33 See Article 16(5) MiFID II, Article 18 AIFMD and Article 12 UCITS, Articles 5 and 95 of PSD2. See also Article s  41, 44 and 46 of Solvency II requiring all insurance and reinsurance undertakings to have in place an effective 
  29    These requirements are of utmost importance  for business processes using  Big Data technologi es. They notably require financial institutions using Big  Data technologies to allocate  appropriate capital, human and IT resources to  the implementation of Big Data from an operational standpoint .  b. Ensure  continuity and regularity in the performance of the ir  activities  (and employing appropriate and proportionate systems,  resources and procedures to this end) 34.   Complying with these provisions is important in order to mitigate any  challenges  or risks  resulting from the implementation of Big Data processes .  These  provisions also require financial institutions to factor the possible  threats that may impact the continuity and the regularity of the performance  of the f inancial institutions’ activity.   c. Monitor  markets activity, mitigating against counterparty or  syste mic risk or disorderly trading 35.  Investment firms and trading venues are subjected to such provisions  in order  to ensure that robust  measures are in place to avoid that algorithmic trading  or high -frequency trading disrupt the market s.   d. Ensure  that any reliance on a third party  (i.e. outsourcing)  does not  impair the quality and the continuous performance of services 36.   132. The ESAs note that the use of Big Data technologies and applications is an  area where financial institutions are particularly likely to consider outsourcing  to third -party providers , such as data -vendors or cloud computing service  providers . In this respect, the ESAs wish to stress that sectorial legislation  requirements applicable to the outsourcing of important functions of fin ancial  institutions do apply when an external provider is performing all or part of  the outsourced functions through the use of Big Data technologies .   In this respect, the ESAs stress  that (i) finan cial institutions are required to  take appropriate arrang ements to mitigate the risks related to the use of  third-party service provider s in accordance with a pplicable sectoral  legislation , (ii) that the outsourcing should not impair the quality of financial  institutions’  internal control and the ability of the competent authorities to                                                              system of governance which prov ides for sound and prudent management of the business. Article 88 of CRD IV  also establishes general obligations related to governance arrangements, adequate internal control mechanisms  that are consistent with and promote sound and effective risk manageme nt. In addition to this, in the payments  field, the PSD2 and the level -two legislation that the EBA has been mandated to develop in support of the PSD2  provide a number of requirements regarding the management of operational and security risks, that will a pply  to all credit institutions, payment institutions and e -money institutions.   34 See Article 16(4) and 17 of MiFID II, Articles 5 and 95 of PSD 2, Article 41 Solvency II .  35 See Article 17 of MiFID II, Article 79 of CRD.   36 See Article 16 of MiFID II, Artic le 13 of UCITS, Article 19(6) of PSD II, Article s 38 and 49 of  Solvency II . 
  30    monitor the financial institution’s compliance with all its obligations, and (iii)  that financial institutions remain fully responsible for discharging all their  obligations under relevant sectorial legislation (even when several t hird-party  providers are involved).   e. Comply with record -keeping requirement s37  The ESAs also want to stress the importance of compliance with applicable  sectoral requirements in the field of record -keeping and any other regulatory  audit trail requirements of the decision -making of financial institutions and  confirm that these require ments apply when such decision making process is  performed  totally or partially using Big Data techniques or applications. As  mandated in sectoral legislation, this information should be made available to  the competent authorities upon request .  The ESAs consider these requirements to be key in the Big Data context as  they enable to reconstruct efficiently and evaluate the Big Data  strategies/tools employed and ascertain compliance of financial institutions  with all applicable regulatory requireme nts when providing services to  consumers .  f. Take steps to identify, prevent and manage conflicts of interests 38   The use of Big Data can generate new contexts involving conflicts of interests ,  for instance from embedded biases or flaws in Big Data tools favoring firm’s  interests or certain clients over other clients .   ii. Conduct of business  requi rements   133. The ESAs stress the relevance in the Big Data context of the conduct of  business principles requiring financial institutions to :  a. Act honestly, fairly and professionally 39.   Financial institutions, to the extent that they are subjected to sectoral  legislation requiring them to act honestly, fairly and professionally , should  carefully consider these far reaching principles when setting -up procedures  and metho dologies using Big Data technologies. Financial ins titutions should  notably set -up procedures aiming at promoting fair and non -discriminatory                                                              37 See Articles 13(6) and 17 MiFID I; see also new Article 17 MiFID II concerning algorithmic strategies.

  31    practices.  The requirement  to act fairly is of particular importance when the  procedure or methodology being set -up or up -dated consists  in the profiling  of consumers through means enabled by Big Data.   b. Manufacture and distribute products and services which meet  the needs of identif ied target clients  and monitor such  products 40;   Financial institutions should factor and monitor the potential impact of the  use of Big Data tools and techniques  in the context  of the application of their  product oversight and governance processes. Notably , they should ensure  that the use of Big Data tools to (i) identify target markets or (ii) assign a  customer to a target market , is compliant with applicable legal  requirements . Financial institutions should specifically scrutinize  that the  services and pr oducts distributed are compatible with the needs and  characteristics of the identified target market  and, when applicable, monitor  such products.   c. Ensure that all information, including marketing  communications, addressed by financial institutions to  customers are fair, clear and not misleading 41.  These requirements  apply when financial institutions use Big Data  technology to launch targeted market ing and communication campaigns.   d. Assess  certain minimum, accurate and up -to-date, information  about clients  and products/services before providing certain  services  (e.g. suitability or appropriateness tests or creditworthiness  assessments) 42.   e. Preserve the interests of consumers when purchasing bundled  or tied packages of products  (in particular, client mobility  and ability  to make informed choices at the right time in the sales process) 43.  These provisions should prevent firms from using Big Data in order to   promote  bundled or tied packages of products which are not in the  interest s of clients.   f. Establish fair and  efficient claims and complaints handling  processes 44.                                                               40 Articles 16(3) and 24(2) MiFID II, Art icle 25 IDD, EBA Guidelines on product oversight and governance  requirements for manufactures and distributors of retail banking products, July 2015.   41 See Article 16 of MiFID II, Article 13 of UCITS, Article 19(6) of PSD II.   42 See Article 25 of MiFID II, Article 30 of IDD, Articles 18 and 20 of MCD.   43 See Article 24(11) MiFID II, Article 24 IDD, Article 12 MCD, Article 9 PAD, Articles 66 and 67 of PSD2   44 See for instance Article 14 IDD; Article 26 in the MiFID II Delegated Regulation requires firms to esta blish,  implement and maintain effective and transparent procedures for the prompt handling of complaints , and article  101 PSD2 , under which payment service providers should put in place and apply adequate and effective complaint 
  32    This requirement is relevant to ensuring that Big Data analytics ( e.g.  tools enabling to predict  more accurately whether a given consumer is  likely or not  to lodge a claim/complaint) do not lead to con sumer  detriment.   D. Good practices for financial institutions  using Big  Data  134. As mentioned above, the ESAs acknowledge that the use of Big Data  technologies can be beneficial for financial institutions and consumers alike,  as well  as for the market of financial services and products as a whole.  However,  the use of Big Data also poses a number of significant risks which  have the potential to prevent such benefits from materialising and could  damag e the trust of consumers in financial i nstitutions.   135. The use of  Big Data technologies is, like any technology -based phenomenon,  expected to evolve in the years to come in a number of possible, yet  unpredictable , ways. This continuous  evolution is an additional layer of  difficulty to the role of legislators and supervisors .   136. In order t o address such a fast -evolving phenomenon, t he ESAs believe it is  relevant to  promote  not only the strict c ompliance  with applicable  requirements  but als o the development and adherence by financial  institutions to good practices promoting a fair, transparent and non discriminatory treatment of consumers , when using Big Data -based  technologies.   137. The adherence to such good practices, combined with the compliance with  applicable data protection, consumer protection and financial legislation  requirements, could contribute to ensuring that Big Data strategies are  design ed in a responsible way and take into account  consumers ’ interests .   138. The ESAs suggest below an indicative a list of arrangements and behavio urs  that could be followed by financial institutions to develop good practices  on  the use of Big Data   Robust Big D ata processes and algorithms   a. The periodical monitoring of the functioning of Big Data procedures and  metho dologies a s well as  Big Data tools to adapt to technological  developments and newly emerg ing risks.                                                                  resolution procedures for t he settlement of complaints of payment service users. See also the Joint Committee  Final Report on guidelines for complaints -handling for the securities (ESMA) and banking (EBA) sectors  (available  here).  
  33    Consumer protection   b. The periodical assessment whether Big Data based products and  services are aligned with consumers’ interests and w here relevant, the  review and adjustment of the Big Data tools .   c. The setting -up of procedures aim ed at taking appropriate remedial  action s when issues that may lead to consumer detriment materialise or  are anticipated (notably in relation to the segmentation of consumer s,  e.g. impact on pric ing or access of consumers to service s due to  increased segmentation of the target market ).   d. Factor the potential risks associated with the use of Big Data together  with the content of  the financial institution’s Big Data transparency  policy when designing and enforcing the financial institution ’s compla int  handling framework .   e. The adherence to and strict compliance with industry -specific codes of  conduct under the GDPR 45.  f. Pay s pecial attention to their policy in terms of processing of data  gathered from social media platforms considering the varied level of  understanding by consumers  of privacy settings on social media  accounts 46 and the risks of inaccuracies in such data.   g. Strive  to maintain a balance between automated decision -making tools   and human interventions .  Disclosure on the use of Big Data  h. Ensur e a high level of transparency towards customer s concerning the  use of Big Data technologies to process their data.   i. Contribute to  the promotion  of public awareness, consumer education  on the phenomenon of big data and of consumers rights related to the  use of Big Data by financial in stitutions.                                                               45 Pursuant to GDPR, financial institutions may choose to voluntarily join and adhere to approved codes of conduct  or approved certification mechanisms, as an eleme nt to demonstrate compliance with GDPR (see Articles 24(3),  28(5) and 40 -43 of the GDPR) .  46 Data protection bodies have explicitly referred to these risks and advised financial institutions to consider  whether they have legitimate grounds to use data that may have been gathered from social media platforms or  other online sources for insurance purposes, rather than merely relying on the fact that some content is  accessible. e.g. UK Information Commissioner’s response to the Financial Conduct Authority’s call  for inputs on  big data in retail general insurance (8 January 2016) .
