Declaration on Ethics and Data Protection in Artificial Intelligence   2 | Page      The 40th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners:   Considering the initial discussion at the 38th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy  Commissioners in Marrakesh on Artificial intelligence, Robotics, Privacy and Dat a Protection;   Recognizing that artificial intelligence systems may bring significant benefits for users and society, including  by: increas ing the rapidity of processes and support ing decision -making; creating new ways to par ticipate in  democratic process es; improving  efficiency in  public sector and industry ; achieving more equitable  distribution of resources and opportunities; offering new methods  and solutions  in various fields such as  public health, medical care, security, sustainable  development,  agric ulture and transport; bringing new  opportunities in scien tific research and education  and; providing individuals with more personalized services;   Taking into account the significant progress in certain areas of artificial intelligence, in particular regarding  the processing of large amount s of information, the analysis and prediction of human behavior and  charact eristics, and in related fields  such as robotics, computer vision and autonomous systems, likely to  make significant progress in the near fut ure;  Highlighting the rapid advancement of  big data and  artificial intelligence , notably machine learning, in  particular with the development of deep learning technologies , allow ing algorithms to  solve complex   operations leading to potential decisions , making  however such  process es more  opaque ;  Affirming  that the respect of the rights to  privacy and data protection are  increasingly challenged  by the  development of artificial intelligence and  that this development  should be complemented by ethical  and  human rights  considerations;   Considering that machine learning technologies in particular, and artificial intelligence system s in general,  may  rely on the processing of large sets of personal data for their development,  potentially   impacting data  protection and privacy; also taking into account the potential risks induced by the current trend of market  concentration in the field of artificial intelligence;   Recognizing the link between collections, uses and disclosures of personal information –  the traditional  sphere of privacy and data protection – on the one hand, and the direct impacts on human rights more  broadly, most notably regarding discrimination  and freedom of expression and information , and thus  acknowledging the need for data protection and privacy authorities to think about human rights more  broadly, and for data protection and privacy authorities to work with other authorities addressing human  rights;   Pointing out that some data sets used to train  machine learning -based and artificial intelligence  systems have  been found to contain inherent bias resulting in decisions which can unfairly discriminate against certain  individuals or groups, potentially restrict ing the availability of certain services or content , and thus interfering  with  individuals’ rights such as  freedom of expression and information  or resulting in the exclusion of  people  from certain aspects of personal, social, professio nal life ;  Stressing that artificial intelligence  powered systems whose decisions cannot be explained raise fundamental  questions  of accountability not only for privacy and data protection law but also liability in the event of errors  and harm;   Noting that many  stakeholders in the field of  artificial intelligence have expressed their concerns about the  risks o f malicious use of artificial intelligence , as well as the risks relat ed to privacy, data protection and 
Declaration on Ethics and Data Protection in Artificial Intelligence   3 | Page    human  dignity , pointing out for example that the development of artificial intelligence in combination with  mass surveillance raises concerns about their possible use to curtail fundamental rights and freedoms;   Highlighting that those  risks and challenges may affect  individuals and society,  and that the extent and nature  of potential consequences  are currently uncertain ;  Emphasising the importance of trust, since strong data protection and privacy safeguards help to build  individuals’ trust in how their data is processed, which encourages data sharing and thereby promotes  innovation;   Taking the view  that the current challenges triggered by the development of artificial intelligence and  machine learning systems reinforce the need for the adoption of an international approach and standards,   in order to ensure  the promotion and protection of human rights in all digital developments at in ternational  level;    Reaffirming  the commitment of data protection authorities and the Conference of Data Protection and  Privacy Commissioners  to uphold data protection and privacy principles  in adapting to this evolving  environment , notably by engaging resources and developing new skills in order to be prepared for future  changes.       The 40th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners  considers that any  creation, development and use of artificial intelligence systems shall fully  respect human  rights , particularly  the right s to the protection of personal data and  to privacy , as well as human  dignity , non -discrimination  and  fundamental  values , and shall provide solutions to allow individuals to maintain control and understanding  of artificial intelligence systems.       The Conference  therefore  endorses the following guiding principles , as its core values to preserve human  rights in the development of  artificial intelligence:   1. Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies  should  be designed, developed and used in  respect of fundamental human rights  and in accordance with the fairness principle , in particular by:   a. Considering individuals ’ reasonable expectations by ensuring that the use of artificial intelligence  systems remains consistent with their  original purpose s, and that the data  are used in a way that is  not in compatible  with  the original purpose of their collection,   b. taking into consideration not only the  impact that the use of artificial intelligence may have on the   individual , but also the collective impact on groups  and on society at large ,   c. ensuring that artificial intelligence systems are developed in a way that facilitate s human  development and does not obstruct or endanger it, thus recognizing the need for delineation and  boundaries on certain uses,          
Declaration on Ethics and Data Protection in Artificial Intelligence   4 | Page      2. Continued a ttention and vigilance , as well as accountability, for the potential effects and consequences  of, artificial intelligence systems  should be ensured , in particular by :  a. promoting accountabilit y of all relevant stakeholders  to individuals, supervisory authorities and  other third parties as appropriate , including through the realization of  audit , continuous monitoring   and impact assessm ent of artificial intelligence systems, and periodic review of oversight  mechanisms ;   b. foster ing collective  and joint  responsibility , involving the whole chain of  actors and  stakeholders,  for  example with the development of co llaborative  standards  and the sharing of best practices ,   c. invest ing in awareness raising , education , research  and training  in order to ensure a good level of  information on and understanding of artificial intelligence and its potential effects in society , and  d. establishing demonstrable  governance  processes  for all relevant actors , such as relying on  trusted  third parties or the setting up of  independent  ethics committees ,     3. Artificial intelligence systems transparency and intelligibility  should be improved, with the objective of  effective  implementation , in particular by:   a. investing in public and private scientific research on explainable artificial intelligence ,  b. promoting transparency , intelligibility  and reachability , for instance  through the development of  innovative ways of communication , taking into account the different levels of transparency and  information required for each relevant audience,   c. making organizations ’ practices more transparent , notably by promoting algorithmic transparency  and the auditability of systems , while  ensuring meaningfulness of the information provided , and   d. guaranteeing the right to  informational self- determination, notably by ensuring that individual s are   always  informed  appropriately  when they are interacting directly with  an artificial intelligence system  or when they provide personal data to be processed by such systems ,  e.  providing adequate information on the purpose and effects of artificial intelligence systems in order  to verify continu ous alignment with expectation of individuals and to enable overall human control  on such systems .    4. As part of an overall “ethics by design” approach, artificial intelligence systems should be designed and  developed responsibly , by applying the principles of privacy by default and privacy by design , in particular  by:  a. implementing technical and organizational measures and procedures  – proportional  to the type of  system  that is developed  – to ensure that data subjects ’ privacy  and personal data are  respected,  both when determining the means of the processing and at the moment of data processing,  b. assessing and documenting the expected impacts on individuals and society at the beginning of an  artificial intelligence  project and for relevant developmen ts during its entire life cycle,  and  c. identifying specific requirements for ethical and fair use of the systems and for respecting human   rights as part of the development and operations of any artificial intelligence  system,      
Declaration on Ethics and Data Protection in Artificial Intelligence   5 | Page        5. Empowerment of every individual  should be promoted, and  the exercise of individuals’ rights should be  encouraged, as well as the creation of opportunities for public  engagement , in particular by:   a. respecting data protection  and privacy rights, including where applicable the right to information,   the right to access , the right to object  to processing and the right to erasure , and promoting those  rights through education  and awareness campaign s,  b. respecting related rights including freedom of expression and information, as well as  nondiscrimination,   c. recognizing that  the right to object or appeal  applies  to technologies that influence pe rsonal  development  or opinions and  guaranteeing , where applicable , individuals’ right not to be subject to  a decision based solely on automated processing i f it significantly affects them  and, where not  applicable , guaranteeing individuals’ right to challenge such decision,   d. using the capabilities of artificial intelligence  systems to  foster an equal empowerment  and enhance  public engagement , for example through adaptable interfaces and accessible tools .      6. Unlawful biases or  discriminations  that may result from the use of data  in artificial intelligence  should be  reduced and mitigated , including by :  a. ensuring the respect of i nternational legal instruments on human rights and no n-discrimination ,  b. investing in research into technical ways to identify , address  and mitigate  biases,   c. taking  reasonable steps to ensure the personal data and information  used  in automated decision  making is accurate, up-to-date and as complete as possible, and   d. elaborating  specific guidance and principles in addressing biases and discrimination , and promoting   individual s’ and stakeholders’ awareness.       Taking into consideration the principles above, t he 40th International Conference of Data Protection and  Privacy Commissioners calls for common governance principles  on artificial intelligence  to be established ,  fostering  concerted  international efforts in this field,  in order to ensure  that its development and use take  place in accordance with ethics and human values, and respect human dignity. These common governance principles  must be able to tackle the challenges raised by the rapid evolutions of artificial intellig ence  technologies , on the basis of a multi -stakeholder approach in order to address all cross -sectoral issues at  stake. They  must take place at an international level since the development of artificial intelligence is a trans border phenomenon and may affect all humanity . The Conference shou ld be involved in this international  effort, working with and supporting general and sectoral authorities  in other fields such as  competition,  market  and consumer  regulation.     The 40th International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners therefore establishes , as a  contribution to  a future  common  governance  at the international level, and in order to further elaborate  guidance to accompany  the principles  on Ethics and Data Protection in Artificial Intelligence , a permanent  working group addressing the challenges o f artificial intelligence development. This working group  on Ethics  and Data Protection in Artificial Intelligence  will be in charge  of promoting understanding of and respect for 
Declaration on Ethics and Data Protection in Artificial Intelligence   6 | Page    the principles  of the present resolution , by all relevant parties involved  in the development of artificial  intelligence systems , including governments and public authorities, standardization bodies, artificial  intelligence  systems designers, providers and researchers, companies, citizens and end users of artificial  intelligence  systems . The working group on Ethics and Data Protection in Artificial Intelligence shall take into  account the work carried out by other working gr oups  of the Conference and shall report regularly on its  activities to the Conference. The Conference  thus  endeavor s to proactively  support  an active  public debate  on digital ethics aiming at the creation of a strong ethic al culture and personal awareness  in this field .     - The present declaration will be open for public consultation -
