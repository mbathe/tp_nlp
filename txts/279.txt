IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        6  PE 626.074    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   Background   Artificial Intelligence (A I) is gradually emerging as a general -purpose technology that could have farreaching effects in several sectors and cause disruptive changes  in value chains and business models.  As AI systems act increasingly more autonomously and become more widely used  across different  sectors, AI safety, transparency, and accountability concerns, including those related to poor decisionmaking, discriminati on biases, job losses and malevolent uses of AI (e.g. in weaponry and  cyberconflicts) become more and more relevant . Against this backdrop, AI global governance is  gradually being discussed by national governments and international organisations   Amid conce rns that Europe is losing ground to the US and China, i n October 2017, the European  Council asked the European Commission  (EC)  to develop a European approach to AI . In April 2018, i n  its Communication "Artificial intelligence for Europe", the EC laid down the European approach to AI,  which is based on three pillars:  i) being ahead of technological developments and encouraging uptake  by the public and private sectors ; ii) p repar ing for socio- economic changes brought about by AI ; and  iii) e nsur ing an appropriate ethical and legal framework .  Aim   This analysis looks at the current state of development of AI technologies and at the policy mix and  industrial policy tools that Europe and its Member States have to put in place to ensure that Europe is  in the most advanced position in terms of develop ing applications of AI  in industry . By gathering on  the existing evidence, this analysis seeks to provide policy advice to the ITRE Committee of the  European Parliament (EP) on how European citizens and businesses could benefit from th e digital   revolution and opportunities brought about by AI in accordance with European core ethical and social  values .  Findings   A market in rapid evolution . AI is not a new technology, having existed since the 1950s. While some  markets, sectors and individual businesses are more advanced than others, AI is still at a relatively early  stage of development, so that the range of potential applications, and the quality of most existing  applications, have ample margins left for further  development and improvement. The US, followed by  China and Israel, has the most developed and vibrant AI landscape. However, contrary to common  belief, Europe, as a whole, is not lagging behind in developing AI technologies  and is particularly strong  in A I fundamental research.   A limited number of strong AI global players . The development of AI in Europe can rely on a number  of significant drivers (e.g. a highly educated labour force and excellent research institutions). But it has  been less successful in  developing globally scalable business models. As a result, the EU AI ecosystem  is still too much reliant upon technologies developed in non- EU countries.  A combination of political, legal and technical factors can both hinder or accelerate the uptake of A I  in Europe . While developing AI capacity, European industry and SMEs face three types of barriers: i)  those related to the internal technical capacity, ii) those concerned with AI policy and regulatory risks,  and iii) those related to the early stage of d evelopment of AI applications in business and social  acceptance of AI.  The creation of the Digital Single Market, including the free flow of data across  borders, is a key driver for the uptake of AI.  
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  7   AI benefits from strong political support worldwide . An AI race for leadership has just started and sees  the US, China and Europe (mostly the UK) as the largest players. Israel and Canada, have smaller AI  public funded programmes, but a vibrant AI landscape in specific technology niche s.  The amount of resources  required to keep up with the latest AI developments cannot be met by a  single Member State, creating a clear rationale for EU intervention . The characteristic feature of the  approach laid down by the EC in April 2018 is that it is based on addressing the ri sk-benefit duality of  AI technologies. This implies developing an approach that does not merely focus on the potential  impact of AI on competitiveness but also on the social and ethical implications of an increased  deployment of AI systems.     The deploy ment of AI creates several pressing policy challenges at the global and European level .  Thus far, the response to the legal, societal and ethical challenges posed by AI development has not  been able to keep up with AI scientific progress. There are too many disparate initiatives that try to  mitigate existing risks instead of anticipating them.  Malevolent use of AI may have dreadful  effects for  humanity. No government or international organisation has yet taken leadership for developing a  general guidance an d framework for the deployment of AI along universal human values.   There is not yet robust evidence of AI applications used for addressing significant real -life problems  or societal challenges . As a matter of fact, the pace and direction of technological progress in AI are   difficult to predict, even in the short -term and it is rather difficult to separate the “marketing story” from  the “implementation story”.   In Europe, AI research resources are abundant but scattered and skewed in academia and public  research organisations , while technology transfer and commercialisation of AI applications in  business take up more slowly than in the US. This implies that strong European AI ecosystems are yet  to e merge.  A competition for attracting talented data scientists has already started and the countries  with the most vibrant AI landscape are better positioned. This virtuous cycle of capital and human  resources accumulation in AI R&D and innovation activitie s reinforce the existing advantages.   Recommendations   In order to maximi se AI benefits , while addressing risks related to the diffusion of AI technologies in  products and services, and promoting an informed and open debate about AI, the EP could consider  the following actions.   Promote genuine progress in AI global governance  and discussions about the societal risks of these  technologies . Gathering upon its founding social and ethical values, the EP could launch a process that  would start a discussion about a common, internationally recognised ethical and legal framework for  the design, production and use of AI, robotics, and their increasingly autonomous systems. This  framework should provide a roadmap for promoting and protecting human values and welfare by   responsible uses of these technologies.   Promote the development of a general ethical framework governing AI technolog ies’  design  in  Europe . This implies creating  a coherent and trusted regulatory framework  by regulating broad AI  principles . This general ethical framework should be inspired by the principle of human- centric AI (i.e.  AI tightly developed under human oversight and control), embed the principles of fairness and justice  in algorithms, applied in all phases of AI systems’ design, implementation  and testing, while following  through bias complaints and other undesired effects reporting. In relation to this dimension , the E P  should e nsure that the development of AI based products and services developed in Europe integrate  core European values.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        8  PE 626.074    Prioritise AI applications that effectively  address societal challenges. The use of AI in critical industrial  applications is a relatively untested field . The literature shows that the potential of AI, as compared to  other technologies, might be presently over -estimated and might be driven by unrealistic expectations  about what these technologies can effectively achieve in terms of generating economic and social  value. As a matter of fact, even the business community has recently started to take a more caut ious  approach. While substantial investment in AI research should be tested against alternatives, the  combination of AI with other technologies and megatrends should be better explored and based upon  empirical evidence.   Ensure consistency in regulations and policies that are linked to AI, such as those affecting the  access, use and storage of data. This goes in the direction of removing barriers to the cross -border  access, use and storage of data.  Since many new AI applications are developed by start -ups,  regulatory  impact assessments should also consider to what extent new or revised regulations disproportionally   affect these companies. The possibility of introducing regulatory sandboxes should be carefully  considered to test the use of AI in heavily regu lated sectors, such as finance and healthcare. These could  be introduced at the European level to facilitate collaborative projects and avoid a further  fragmentation of the Digital Single Market.   Ensure that EU support for AI leverages and complements actions undertaken in Member States .  As  the European countries develop their national policy responses to promote the uptake of AI and  mitigate its risks, European institutions should play a key role in coordinating such efforts, filling in  policy gaps that cannot be addressed solely at the national level and support the widespread  development of competitive AI ecosystems throughout Europe. This also requires seizing  synergies  between the EU framework research programme, the newly established Digital European  Programme  and the European Structural and Investment Fund  (ESIF ).   Finally, engage with Member States to prepare business and society for the upcoming  transformations . Although statistics on the impact of AI on the labour market need to be taken with  caut ions , policy makers have to be aware of the possible different outlooks and become prepared to  address short -term or even long -term effects of technological unemployment which AI developments  may significantly contribute to bring about. Adaptation of welfare and education systems will be  necessary to protect the people whose skills become obsolete  and to mitigate the amplification of  power asymmetries and inequalities  generated by increased automation.           
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  9   1. INTRODUCTION   1.1. Background   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science referring to “ the ability of a digital computer or  computer -controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings ”. The term is  frequently applied to the project of develo ping systems endowed with the intellectual processes  characteristic of humans, such as the ability to reason, discover meaning, generalize, or learn from past  experience ” (Encyclopaedia Britannica) . AI started in the late 1950s a s a multifaceted computer s cience  research programme, but the main underlying ideas and proof -of-concept computer programs had  been developed already in the late 1940s by Alan Turing and other pioneers of computer science and  computer engineering on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.  However, only in recent years AI has made  rapid advances in a wide range of application areas , such as voice and image recognition, machine  translation, control of assisted driving and autonomous vehicle navigation.  This progress has been  made possible by advances in computing capacity and data availability, as well as by the development  of new machine learning methods, and especially by neuro -inspired learning algorithms , notably deep  learning algorithms  (Tegmark, 2017).   Due to the flexibility and wide  range of AI -based applications , AI is gradually emerging as a general purpose technology that could have far reaching effects in several sectors  and cause disruptive change  in value chains and business models ( McKinsey Global Institute, 2017) . Currently, AI is properly  described as narrow  AI, which is concerned with systems that perform specific and specialized  intelligent tasks, while the possibility of developing general  AI (i.e. computing and robotic systems  achieving wide- ranging, flexible and integrated cognitive abilities such as those possessed by humans)  is still uncertain. While the general AI take- over scenario is ruled out or regarded as a remote possibility  by most AI scientists, the uptake of narrow AI in business and society is bri nging about significant social  and ethical implications. As AI systems are set to act increasingly more autonomously and to become  more widely used, AI safety, transparency, and accountability concerns, including those related to poor  decision -making, disc rimination biases, job losses and malevolent uses of AI (e.g. in weaponry and  cyberconflicts) become more and more relevant in the AI policy agenda (European Group on Ethics in  Science and New Technologies, 2017 ).   AI is expected to trigger a “Fourth Indus trial Revolution” , and, as such, AI breakthrough developments  rank  high in the international policy agenda . Policy makers around the globe are increasingly  considering that the country that achieves the lead in AI is set for having a technological, economi c  and security advantage. To this end, China and US are competing to dominate Big Data, which is the  raw material t hat makes AI work.   Amid concerns that Europe is losing ground to US and China , in October 2017, the European Council  asked the E C to develop  a European approach to AI. In April 2018, i n its Communication "Artificial  intelligence for Europe", the E C laid down the European approach to AI , which is based on three pillars:   i) being ahead of technological developments and encouraging uptake by the public and private  sectors; ii) p repare for socio -economic changes brought about by AI ; and iii) ensure an appropriate  ethical and legal framework  (EC, 2018a). At the 2018 EU Digital Day, EU Member States signed a  declaration to support an  EU approach to f oster the development of AI in Europe that is based on the  following key principles: i) access to public sector data; ii) mitigation of the socio -economic challenges  brought about by progressing AI -based technologies; and iii) development of a  legal and et hical  framework  for AI that is built upon EU fundamental rights and values, including privacy , protection of  personal data and the principles of transparency and accountability (EU Member States, 2018 ). 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        10  PE 626.074    EU Members States, led by the example of France  and t he UK, a re also  preparing AI development  strategies and investment plans to facilitate transition to AI technologies in industry and society.   Against this background, the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) requested a  study  on  the current state of play of European AI  leadership to nurture the general debate on how Europe should  embrace the digital revolution and open up digital opportunities for people and businesses.    1.2. Objectives and research questions   This analysis looks a t the policy mix and industrial policy tools that Europe and its Member States have  to put in place to ensure that Europe does not lag behind in  the development and  applications of AI .  This entails developing a policy response that support European industr y and SMEs  (Small and Medium  Enterprises) to fully seize the benefits of AI, while mitigating the social and ethical risks associated with  a diffusion of AI -based applications . In particular, the analysis address es the following issues.   • Which investments and regulatory conditions do the EU need to put in place to position Europe  at the vanguard of AI research, development and applications? Are the existing and planned  support measures sufficient?   • What are the bottlenecks that hold back a faster and more diffuse uptake of IA in Europe?   • How can the EU  harvest  the economic and societal potential of AI, while minimizing its negative  impact?    • What should be the role of EU institutions and how should Europe coordinate with Member  States in supp orting AI?   1.3. Methodology of the research   This report  is based on an extensive desk research drawing upon policy documents, position papers,  the most recently available published data on the deployment of AI in the European industry and on  foresight studies concerning the market potential of AI in Europe and  the related risks and benefits of  such increasing uses  of AI applications in business and society.  The analysis also benefited from the  contributions of AI experts in science, industry and public institutions (Annex I) that helped gain a  better insight i nto the policy challenges and opportunities for European Institutions in relation to the  develop ment of  a coordinated policy response for supporting the uptake of AI across Europe.  The  variety of information sources applied in this study contributes to mit igate  the high uncertainties  related to the future development of AI,  as well as controversial issues related to AI social and ethical  implications .    
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  11   2. AI MARKET DEVELOPMEN T AND MARKET POTENTIAL     1.4. The disruptive market potential  of AI   AI has developed as a field  of research but also as a technology that expands across a wide range of   applications . AI is not a well -defined technology and no universally agreed definition exists , depending  on whether AI technologies are classified from a research or a commercial per spective . AI is rather a  cover term for techniques associated with data analysis and pattern recognition.  What differentiates AI  from other digital technologies is that AI are set to learn from their environments  in order to take  autonomous decisions . AI, machine learning and deep learning are often used interchangeably, but  this is conceptually imprecise. A simplified illustration of major technologies and applications is  presented in the figure below.  KEY FINDINGS   AI is not a well- defined technology and no universally agreed definition exists. It is rather a cover  term for techniques associated with data analysis and pattern recognition.   AI is not a new technology, having existed since the 1950s. While some markets, sectors and  individual businesses are more advanced than others, AI is still at a rela tively early stage of  development, so that the range of potential applications, and the quality of most existing  applications, have ample margins left for further development and improvement.   The US, followed by China and Israel, has the most developed and vibrant AI landscape. However,  contrary to common belief, Europe, as a whole, is not lagging behind in developing AI  technologies. Europe ranks second worldwide in terms of number of AI start -ups and there are  several examples of European fast -growing AI  companies.   Europe is strong in core AI systems (e.g. fundamental research in AI not targeted at a specific  sector or activity), but it is underrepresented, with respect to its potential, in industrial  applications, such as those related to IoT, autonomou s vehicles and robotics.  The development of AI in Europe can rely on a number of significant drivers (e.g. a highly  educated labour force and excellent research institutions). But it has been less successful in  developing globally scalable business models.  As a result, the EU AI ecosystem is still too much  reliant upon technologies developed in non- EU countries.   The creation of the Digital Single Market, including the free flow of data across borders, is a key  driver for the uptake of AI. Most of the potent ial of deploying AI at the European level is linked to  progress made in digitalisation, data access and in deepening the Digital Single Market.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        12  PE 626.074    Figure 1: The AI scientific and technology landscape     Source: Grand View Research, Inc., USA   AI-based systems can be purely software -based, (e.g. conversational  assistants, image analysis  software, search engines, speech and face recognition systems) or can be integrated  in hardware  devices (e.g. autonomous cars, drones, medical  devices, advanced robots ). Although the AI revolution  is often depicted in terms of physical machine that can replace the work of humans, the largest AI  impact is expected to come from (big) data analytics , vision and language perception capabilities .   From business perspective, AI covers a number of enabling technologies delivering several  advantages that lead to increased productivity . The most commonly reported benefits of AI reside  in  forecasting, empirical decision -making, operations automation, personalised customer services,  enhanced user experiences , process and pro duct optimization, new business models, greater access to  services, and even improved environmental and public heal th. These benefits can be attributed to the  AI capacity to improve decision -making by expanding beyond human reach the number of empirical  observations on which a decision is taken.   From society perspective, AI is expected to bring about substantial benef its, including improved  disease diagnosis, better environmental resource management, better care for people with  disabilities and improved public services  (Accenture, 2018). In this respect, the EC Communication on  Artificial Intelligence for Europe compares AI to disruptive technologies such as electricity and steam  engine (EC, 2018a). Worldwide, g overnments are equally convinced that the uptake of AI will lead to  radical changes in business models and labour markets.    AI implementation tends to be strong  in sectors that are already prominent digital adopters  (e.g.  FinTech). According to McKinsey, industry sectors currently leading in AI deployment worldwide are  automotive, financial services, high tech, telecommunications, manufacturing, energy, aerospace,  travel and transportation and logistics (McKinsey Global Institute 2017d).  An exemplary list of  applications based on AI systems across different sectors is presented in the table below.           
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  13     Table 1: Example of AI use cases across different industries   Industry Use case  Description   Healthcare Medical imaging  diagnostic  A growing number of algorithms are learning how  to spot and diagnose  specific disease.  This is for  instance the case of the software program, called  IDx-DR, which was granted authorization from the  US Food and Drug Administration to detect a form  of eye disease by looking at photos of the retina .    Transport  Traffic management  operations  By converting traffic sensors into ‘intelligent’ agents  using cameras  AI can help predict and detect traffic  accidents and traffic conditions.   Energy  Autonomous grid  AI can help analys e massive amount of data on  energy supply and consumption, bringing stability  and efficiency in electricity grids fuelled by different  sources, such as wind, solar, and traditional carbon  fossil fuels. Companies involved in this domain  include Deep Mind (UK ) and Siemens (DE).   Banking  Real time fraud  detection  AI systems are used to spot divergence in client’s  financial behaviour patterns by using rule -based   learning to identify transactions that indicate  fraudulent  activit ies. These include for instance  attempt of money laundering, fraudulent use of  credit cards and on- line bank accounts and check  tampering .  Telecommunication  Intelligent network  deployments  AI technologies can be used to  self-diagnose, self heal, and self -orchestrate on- demand network  resources. They can enable faster decision making  by gathering and processing network data in real  time and automating network functions . In self healing networks, AI systems are trained to look for  patterns, detect, predict and localize anomalies or  other network issues, and take proactive steps to fix  the service before customers are impacted.   Retail  Shop ping  recommendations  Cognitive/AI natural  language tools search through  millions of social media  conversations, blogs,  forums, ratings and reviews, to learn user  preferences and come up with a list of  recommended items  that users are less likely to  discover by themselves . Customer personaliz ed  recommendation are already used by Amazon and  Netflix .  Source: authors’ elaboration from several sources .   According to Statista (2018), the AI m arket worldwide  in 2018 is worth approximately EUR 6,29  billion .  However, i t is difficult to quantify the exact size of the market for AI , as there are varying definitions of 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        14  PE 626.074    what constitute AI  and the market has been expanding rapidly . Market studies from different sources  unanimously depict a scenario of exponential growth for revenues generated by the deployment of  AI systems across different industrial sectors . An example of these foresight scenario exercises  is  illustrated in the table below.   Table 2:The potential value of AI (analytics techniques) by sectors   Impact level  Industry   High (at least approximately EUR  0.3 trillion dollar)  Retail, transport and logistics, travel, consumer packaged goods,  public and social sector, automotive   Medium (between EUR 0.25 and  EUR 0.17 trillion)  Health care systems, banking, advanced electronics, basic  materials, high tech, oil and gas, insurance, telecommunications,  media and entrainment, agriculture, chemicals,   Low (below EUR 0.17 trillion)  Pharmaceuticals, aerospace and defence   Source: McKinsey Global Institute analysis, 2018   AI technologies are set to drive changes across different sectors and business processes but are also  establishing a new AI -related value chain made of AI hardware suppliers, system integrators and end  users. Withi n this value chain new niche markets are opening up and progress in the upstream market  segment is set to fuel the development of AI applications in even more business cases (Box 1). In  addition to that, a more significant introduction of AI can potentiall y generat e a variety of impacts with  the potential to alter entire value chain  structure s across different industries . This can occur for instance  if the  application of an AI technology leads to shortening certain value chains, by removing individual  stages as long as these become unnecessary. AI can also help streamline and automate various   processes across multiple value chains. Machine -learning technologies could  optimize the delivery of  goods while balancing supply and demand and optimising warehou se management . AI in logistics and  shipping (e.g. the applications for autonomous vehicles) can reduce lead times, labour cost and  transportation expenses. These impacts are difficult to quantify, but are at the very heart of the  expected transformational and revolutionary power of AI technologies.   Box 1: AI impacts on the chipmaking industry   Source: The Economist, June 9th -15th 2018   Generally, countries that have been early digital adopters and that have a highly educated  workforce have a comparative advantage in terms of seizing the benefit of AI technologies . In terms  of AI impact on the European national economies, Finland is the EU country that is projected to gain  most out of the AI revolution. For Finland, the expected economic growth once the impact of AI has The semiconductor industry has been dominated for many years by the American Intel and the  British ARM. However, the semiconductor industry is being revived by increasing demand for  computing capacity generat ed by AI. AI is generating its own demand for application- specific  integrated circuits that cannot be met by the existing central processing units and it is thus  opening opportunities for newcomers, such as the start -ups Graphcore (UK) and Cerebras (US). It  is expected that the market for AI chips could hit EUR 25.7 billion by 2020, which is higher than  what Intel is currently making from selling processors for server computers.  
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  15   been absorbed into the economy , is predicted to  reach 4.1%  of GDP . The UK, Sweden and the  Netherlands follow (Accenture, 2018).   1.5. The uptake of AI in European business   According to a study carried out by Roland Berger and Asgard  (2017)  on the global AI ecosystem based  on data from  start- ups, the following trends emerge:    • the US is the global market leader for A I with a 40% market share;  • China and Israel follow with strong AI ecosystems;   • most other countries lack the needed combination of research, entrepreneurship, funding and  merger and acquisition to build a sustainable and competitive AI ecosystem ; and   • in Europe, the UK has the most developed AI ecosystem, which makes the UK the fourth largest  AI players worldwide.    According to a survey carried out by IDC (Figure  2), there is huge interest across European industry to  deploy AI solutions, although only 20% of European organizations have actually used these  technologies  and this figure in much lower in the case of SMEs . IDC estimates that the on -going largest  investments in AI  technologies in the European industry are directed to the following activities: sales  process  recommendation and automation systems, fraud analysis and investigation systems, quality   management investigation and recommendation systems, automated threat in telligence and  prevention systems, and IT automation systems. Banking, retail and manufacturing are the three  sectors where most investments by European industry focus.

Europe ranks second worldwide in terms of number of AI start- ups and there are several  examples of European fast -growing AI companies ( see for instance Box 2 ). The weakness of Europe  stems from the fact that the Digital Single Market has not been completed yet and that Member States  individually have little we igh in the international AI arena. There is also a large geographical divide in  the distribution of European AI start- ups. The UK (London), France (Paris) and Germany (Berlin) have

Box 2: AI-powered European scale ups   Source: based on material provided by interviewees   In terms of developing AI technologies, Europe is strong in core AI systems  (e.g. fundamental research  in AI not targeted at a specific sector or activity), but it is underrepresented, with respect to its  potential, in industrial applications , such as those related to IoT, autonomous vehicles and robotics  (Asgard and Roland Berger, 2018 ).  Europe has a world -leading AI research community, which accounts for 32% of AI research  institutions worldwide  (30% in t he US) . In the UK, the universities of Cambridge and Oxford lead the  development of AI technologies, having generated three start -ups that were later purchased by US KONUX is a Munich -based company offering industrial I oT solutions combining smart sensors,  data fusion and AI -based analytics to increase asset availability and optimize maintenance  planning in the railway industry .

In 2015, as a result of a government recommendation, five British universit ies (Cambridge,  Edinburgh, Oxford, UCL  and  Warwick ), together with the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences  Research Council , established the Alan Turing Institute.  The Institute’s researchers work across multiple  disciplines with the purpose of developing AI theoretical applications that can be applied to real world  problems.   In Germany, the German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (DFKI -  Deutsches  Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz) is one of the world’s largest AI research institut es. DFKI  is considered a centre of AI excellence in the international scientific community and, in terms of number  of employees and funding, it is one the largest research cent re worldwide in the area of A I theoretical  and industrial development worldwide.   1.6. Key drivers and barriers of AI adoption   The development of AI in Europe can rely on a number of significant drivers (e.g. a highly educated  labour force) but is also facing some obstacles (e.g.  transfer of AI R&D in globally scalable business  models).  According to an IDC survey carried out in 2018 amongst European industry and SMEs three  types of barriers can be identified: i) those related to the internal technical capacity, ii) those concerned  with AI policy and regulatory risks, and iii) those related to the early stage of development of AI  applications in business  and social acceptance of AI  (Figure 3).   Figure 3: Key barriers inhibiting faster deployment of AI systems in Europe (Total vs SMEs)     Source: IDC's Western Europe AI/Cognitive Solutions Survey, June 2018 (n = 350)                                                                         1  In 2014, Google in 2014 bought DeepMind  (neural networks) .

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        18  PE 626.074    2.3.1 Political drivers and barriers   AI research and industrial applications currently benefit from a strong and unprecedented political  support (see chapter 3). This support is however founded on potential industrial applications that  should come along with improvements and combination of existing AI technologies and systems with  a variety of other technologies. AI researchers are aware that this high political support could dry up if  AI systems cannot provide substantial evidence about their capacity to effectively address and solve a  wide variety of real -life problems and societal challenges. In the past, periods of sustained R&D progress  alternated with periods of stagnation (the so -called “AI winters”) which badly affected the AI job market  and the AI fertilization of business and industry alike.   The social acceptability  of AI is undermined by various factors. To begin with, there is a widespread  misconception concerning the term ‘intelligence’  as this is used in contemporary  AI. The intelligence  of the existing AI is restricted to  narrow tasks,  such as chess playing , but cannot presently compete with  human intelligence in many different ways, notably in contextual adaptivity, social interaction   intelligence and pondered reason- giving judgement. The misconception of AI as general intelligence  outperforming and dominating humans constitutes a major  acceptability barrier.  Other barriers to  social acceptability include the inability of many sophist icated AI systems to explain their processing  steps, decisions and actions to human users  and the widespread neglect for better integrating in the  design features of newly generated AI systems major ethical concerns. Additional ethical issues  concern malev olent uses of AI (e.g. drone  and cyber -attacks) , AI for massive and indiscriminate  surveillance, and the loss of human control on AI -enabled life- and -death decisions (e.g., by  autonomous weapons systems) (see chapter 4).   2.3.2 Technical issues   Data is the raw material on which many applications of Machine Learning (ML) and narrow  AI are based ,  as these technologies make it possible to identify regular patterns in available  data and to use these  patterns for a wide variety of analysis, decision -making, and prediction purposes. Thus far , successful  applications of AI technologies have taken advantage  of the availabi lity of human -generated data  and  the collection and exploitation of personal data is largely dominated by US big tech firms, such as  Google and Facebook . However, new potential s for further progress in AI will come by parallel  developments in the Internet of Things (IoT), which will feed AI algorithms with data generated by  networked sensors. In addition to that, the combination of AI with other key technologies, such as big  data analytics and blockchain, can unleash exponential growth of AI -powered applications. At the  same time, the ability to process large r and more complex datasets at greater speed offers new  opportunities to significantly increase both the speed and complexity of information processing.  Improved c omputing  combined with sensing, networking, and data generation can also expand the AI   application areas . One should be careful to note, however, that  more complex  AI applications may face  in the long term a technological barrier with regard to the inability to further reduce hardware  size and  processing speed, so as to allow for faster and more massive  processing on smaller devices. For SMEs,  barriers to entry also  refers to the costly process of acquiring and storing enormous set of data, along  with the need to dispose of facilities and technology tools for training deep learning algorithms . Finally,  the application of AI in robotics towards increasingly intelligen t control of robotic systems might be  slowed down by longer project development cycles, and the related inability of robots to act and  interact outside structured and highly predictable environments.      
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  19   2.3.3 Legal issues   Data policy and liability regulations are two major regulatory domains that can either facilitate or  hold back the uptake of AI in European businesses . Data have been defined as the “new oil” of the  data -driven economy. While large tech companies have access to large data from their own customers,  for SMEs and start- ups, it is more difficult and costlier  to build an AI system without having access to  huge streams of data.  Regulations that make collecting data harder and more expensive may hinder  the deploy ment of the most innovative AI applications that are usually developed by start -ups. A  number of EU existing and planned regulations have a quite significant impact on the use of AI  technologies. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that came into  effect on May 25, 2018   deals with individuals ’ freedom  to control their personal data.   It is a broad regulation that defines how companies can  legally collect and use individual personal data ,  along with EU citizens ’ rights concerning those data. The regulation has had important effects on  European businesses, but it has also been instrumental to lay down the foundation s for a more reliable  and trustable use of AI applications  (Box 3).    Box 3: Experts’ views about the impact of the GDPR  on the use of AI technologies   Source: interviews   The creation of a Digital Single Market, including the free flow of data across borders, is a key driver   for the uptake  of AI.  According to an EP study, the cost of non -Europe (i.e. the potential efficiency  gains) in the area of the Digital Single market a mounts to EUR 415 billion per year (EP, 2017). T he  geographical fragmentation of the Digital Single Market is a barrier for companies that plan to scale up  rapidly within the European market. As an example, too many barriers still hamper the free flow of  goods and online services across national borders. Under the existing rules, companies have to comply  with different national regulations (e.g. data localisation restrictions) and to deal with different  regulatory authorities. Although the economic impact o f data localisation restrictions applied in some  Member States is difficult to estimate, and can be overcome by specific solutions (e.g. use of on -line  platforms), it creates additional administrative burdens for SMEs and start -ups because of the lack of a   unified framework for regulating such restrictions . This does not compare well with the ambition of the  Digital Single Market Strategy to build a European data economy.  To accelerate progress in this area,  as foreseen in the mid -term review of the Digita l Single Market strategy, the EC is working on a  legislative proposal that is set to f acilitat e the re- use of different types of data and its free flow across “GDPR is a necessary and u seful law,  but it has generated additional administrative costs, which can  be significant in SMEs  “  “Some of the privacy and ethical issues related to the use of data could be better addressed by  developing products that embed these value s in their design features. “   “The ‘Right to an explanation’ for algorithmic -driven decisions  can be difficult to apply because of  current technological limitations (e.g. for a sophisticated AI system involving machine learning  techniques, the creators can’ t always explain fully why the AI system behaves as it does and how it  makes its decisions. ”  “GDPR created the foundations for a more responsible and transparent use of AI applications based  on personal data”.   “The usefulness of the GDPR has been shown ret rospectively by the Cambridge Analytica scandal”.    
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        20  PE 626.074    borders2. The revised directive has a substantial impact on the development of AI applications given  that it aims at reducing market entry barriers (e.g. the fees charged by public bodies for the re- use their  data) and increasing the availability of data by making available new types of public data, such as those  held by public undertakings in the utilities and transport sectors and research data resulting from  public funding.   Other l egislative proposals related to the implementation of the Digital Single Market (DS M) strategy   can also have an impact o n AI deployment  in Europe . This is specifically the case of the C opyright s  Directive3 and ePrivacy  Directive4 legislative proposals, whose implementation can limit the use of AI  in Europe. In particular, the existing pr oposal of the Copyrights Directive would limit and make more  expensive for business and public -private collaborations T ext and Data Mining (TDM) activities,  which  are a crucial building block for  machine learning applications in general and deep learning  applications  in particular (Open letter to the EC, 2018). TDM techniques are vital for SME s and start- ups because they  allow them to access to large quantities of data  to train AI algorithms , by applying, for instance,  web  crawling  techniques .    Addressing liability issues and developing related legal rules is becoming more and more important  as AI applications become part of our lives  (e.g. as applications embedded into assisted driving and  fully autonomous cars or unmanned ships).  For SMEs and start- ups, l egal certainty with respect to  liabilities issues is instrumental for access to finance, because AI projects have to pass a due diligence  process by private financers that includes a control on regulatory compliance with respect to  contingent liabilities. However, establishing liability rules for existing and prospective AI algorithms is  a difficult problem to address and solve. One has to take in due account the wide variety of stakeholders  that are involved and the lack of interpretability of many kinds o f AI learning systems.  Another related  and widely debated issue is whether or not AI systems  can be deemed to be subjects of law  (Čerkaa,  2017 and Nevejans, 2016) .   The EC has recently conducted evaluations of the Product Liability Directive5 and the Machinery  Directive6 that concluded that both regulations are “ fit for purpose and conducive to innovation ”.  However, some experts highlight that the legal framework related to AI-enabled decision- making   might require the development of specific regulations, because of the difficulty of predicting exactly  the future behaviours of many complex AI systems and the emerging behaviours of interacting AI  systems. In particular, it is often difficult to recognise the biases embedded into systems that are  developed by means of machine learning techniques and the resulting decision- making errors. To this                                                                      2  Proposal for a revision of the Directive 2003/98/EC on the reuse of public sector information   3  COM(2016) 593 final.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        22  PE 626.074      THE POLICY RESPONSE IN THE EU , MEMBER STATES AND  OTHER INTERNATIONAL AI PL AYE R S   Since the beginning of  2017, AI technologies have benefited from a large political support which is  based on the high expectations of the transformative power of AI  (Figure 4). Some countries ha ve laid  down AI specific and comprehensive AI strategies (e.g. China, the UK, France), some are integrating AI  technologies within national technology or digital roadmaps (e.g. Denmark, Australia), while others  have focused on developing a national AI R&D strategy (US). Regardless of the approach pursued , it  emerges that countries are eng aged in a sort of AI race that aims at achieving AI  leadership.   Figure 4. Countries’ support to AI  (2017 and 2018)     Source: Tim Dutton , 2018   KEY FINDINGS   Starting from 2017, AI research has benefited from strong political support which is based on the  transformational power of these technologies for businesses and societies.    An AI race for leadership has just started and sees the US, China and Europe (mos tly the UK) as  the largest players. Israel and Canada, have smaller AI public funded programmes, but a vibrant  AI landscape in specific technology niche.   The amount of resources required to stay abreast of the latest AI developments cannot be met  by a sing le Member State, creating a clear rationale for EU intervention. China and US, which both  aims at the global AI leadership, have started leveraging public and private investments  exploiting large amounts of data and sophisticated computing capacity.   The characteristic feature of the approach presented in the EC Communication Artificial  Intelligence for Europe in April 2018 is that it is based on addressing the risk -benefit duality of AI  technologies. This implies developing an approach that does not m erely focus on the potential  impact of AI on competitiveness but also on the social and ethical implications of an increased  deployment of AI systems.    
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  23   2.1. The EU plan for AI   Despite being home to strong AI basic research, Europe has thus far been slow in responding to the  many industrial and societal challenges that progress in AI are bringing about. A number of initiatives  and measures have already been launched under Horizon 2020 - Work Programme 2018- 2020  Information and Communication Technologies,  which allocates EUR 1.5 billion to AI, and the work  programme of Horizon Public -Private Partnerships on Big Data and Robotics that allocate additional  EUR 2.5 billion to technolog ies relevant to AI.   Increasing global competition from the US and China, along with increased calls for action coming from  industry, academia and European policy makers has prompted the EU to develop a framework to guide  and coordinate future European investments and legislative proposals.  In April 2018, the EC adopt ed a  Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe which lays down a proposal for an EU AI strategy  and investment plan to be developed and implemented under the next multi -annual financia l  framework 2021- 2027 (Figure 5) . Support for AI research and innovation will be provided by Horizon  Europe, the next EU research and innovation framework programme with an overall budget of EUR  97.6 billion , under pillar II “Global Challenges and Industri al Competitiveness” (cluster digital and  industry). Additional funding for AI will be available under the newly established Digital Europe  Programme (DEP) which aims at reinforcing Europe’s digital capabilities in four key areas including AI,  cybersecurity , high performance computing and advanced digital skills. DEP sets aside EUR 2.5 billion  to establish AI capacity and infrastructure in the EU that will be used to support the creation of AI  testing and experimentation facilities along with open libraries and platforms for AI algorithms and  data .   Figure 5: The timescale o f the approach laid down in the EC Communication on AI     Source: EC Communication Artificial Intelligence for Europe , 2018   The AI plan proposed by the EC concerns three separate, but interconnected policy domains and  deploys a diversified set of industrial policy measures.  Through this approach the EC aims at creating a  framework for coordinating and building upon national AI strateg ies and at becoming the world  champion of an AI approach that truly benefit society as a whole.   Preparing EU industry to embrace and benefit from AI technologies . The primary focus of this policy  area is to support AI fundamental research, develop AI spec ific industrial applications and upgrad e AI  research infrastructure.

These measures aim at developing AI products and services in  Europe and to avoid putting European consumer and industry in the condition of having to import  these technologies from other countries. SMEs are a focal point in the a pproach proposed by the EC. In  particular, the setting up of testing,  and experimenting infrastructure and the development of an “AI on-demand platform” , will make available relevant AI resources for companies, inc luding non -tech  companies, willing to test AI technologies. It is also foreseen to build on the existing Digital Innovation  Hubs to set up AI specialised hubs across Europe for the purpose of assisting companies to take  advantages of the opportunities offered by AI systems. Efforts geared towards facilitating access to  large data sets are also foreseen to boost the creation of diversified European AI ecosystems. To this  end, the EC intends to build upon the successful experience of the Galileo and Copernicus  programmes, which have established open ly accessible space -generated  data platforms. Examples of  such efforts include an updated Directive on the Re -Use of Public Sector Information8, Guidance on  sharing private sector data; an updated Recommendation on Access to and Preservation of Scientific  Data9; and a Communication on the digital transformation of health and care10.  Preparing for socio -economic challenges . This policy domain is concerned with addressing socioeconomic evolutions induced by AI progress and is set to prepare for changes in the labour market. It  builds upon the New Skills Agenda for Europe, which encompasses ten actions to improve the quality  and relevance of training and other ways of acquiring skills, make skills more visible and comparable,  and improve information and understanding of trends and patterns in demands for skills and jobs. With  respect to AI, upskilling and training for the acquisition of digital competence will be given major  prominence in national and regional programmes (co -funded by the European Social Fund). Promoting  diversity (e.g. women participation in AI related training) and interdisciplinarity is also a focal point in  this policy area.   Ensuring that AI are developed within an appropriate ethical and legal framework . The  Communication underlines t he EU’s imperative to protect personal data, safety and product liability.   To do so, the EU has used its regulatory power to tackle issues related to citizen’s privacy and product  liability (see section 2.3) and to build trust in the online world (Cybersec urity Act11). Building upon the  work of the European Group on Ethics in Science and Technology, the EC undertakes to draft AI ethics  guidelines by the end of 2018 , for whose preparation an ad hoc high -level  expert group has been set                                                                      7  Pan-European venture capital Funds of Funds jointly established by the European Investment Fund and the European  Commission to boost investments in innovative start -ups and scale ups.   8   Directive 2013/37/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 amending Directive 2003/98/EC on the re use of public sector information   9  Commi ssion Recommendation (EU) 2018/790 of 25 April 2018 on access to and preservation of scientific information   10  EC Communication on enabling the digital transformation of health and care in the Digital Single Market; empowering citizens  and building a healt hier society COM(2018) 233 final.

Box 5: Supporting the development of AI applications in European industry and SMEs   Source: based on documentation provided by EIT Digital   2.2. AI strategies and investment plans in Member States   The implementation of national policies and regional programmes is vital to complement European  coordinated actions. After years of a slow trickle, the first months of 2018 saw  an explosion of  government -backed AI programmes announced all over Europe that were propelled by a general  feeling that Europe is falling behind in the race for AI  leadership. These plans were driven by a sense of  urgency to establish a coherent framework for the deployment of AI in industries and in public services  to further productivity gains, identify applications of AI that can deliver societal benefits and tap  into  the national talent pool of AI researchers to limit the migration  of scientists from Europe  to the US .   In January 2018, DG CONNECT ( Directorate ‑General for Communications Networks, Content and  Technology ), in collaboration with EurAI, the European Artificial Intelligence Association, organised a  workshop, with the purpose of gathering evidence about academic, industry, and governmental  initiatives that are shaping the AI landscape across Europe (EC, 2018c ). This was the first attempt by the  EC to survey ongoing AI -related initiatives in Member States. It showed that policy responses in  member States reflect the level of advancement and readiness of countries’ AI research and industry  ecosystems, and their specific comparative advantages (e.g. deep learning in the UK, robotics in  Germany, AI in public services in Finland). Four countries (France, the UK, Finland  and Germany)  emerged as being more advanced in elaborating national policy  responses to support A I deployment   (Figure 6).   In March 2018, France unveiled its national strategy in the field of AI and pledged to invest EUR 1.5  billion until 2022 to support research and innovation in the field . The French strategy established a  quite comprehensive set of policies that are targeted to address obstacles to the uptake of AI in French  businesses, to boost investments in a limited number of sectors, where the societal impact of AI use is  higher, mitigate the impact of AI in rising inequality. France already boa sts one of the top European AI permeates many of EIT (European Institute of Innovation and Technology) entrepreneurial ,  education , innovation and entrepreneurship activities. EIT work address different dimensions of  the AI landscape.   1) Entrepreneurial Education . At the EIT Digital Master School, two programmes are  specifically related to AI : the Data Science programme (data science, innovation and  entrepreneurship) and the Autonomous S ystems programme (a c ombination of  computer science and electronic engineering).   2) Innovation & Entrepreneurship . AI is relevant to all EIT five action lines . A total of 19  Innovation Activities related to AI are supported in the EIT Digital Business Plan 2018 (out  of a total o f 54 Activities supported).

Figure 6:  Member State s’ AI strategies at glance     Source: A uthor’s elaboration from different sources  (see Appendix 2 )  AI and data economy are one of the four grand challenges identified by Britain’s Industrial Strategy  White Paper , (UK government, 2017).  The AI sector deal aims at ensur ing that the UK remains among  the leaders in AI  by providing the necessary investment and enabling conditions. It pursues the  following objectives: i) make the UK a global centre for AI and data -driven innovation by investing in  R&D, skills an d regulatory innovation; ii) support sectors to boost their productivity through artificial  intelligence and data analytics technologies; iii) lead the world in the safe and ethical use of AI; and  help people develop the skills needed for the jobs of the f uture. The AI -specific sector deal outlin es a  package of approximately EUR 1.08  billion of public and private funding for AI. This support is to be  further complemented by some of the EUR 1.9 billion that are to be made available under the crosssectoral I ndustrial Strategy Challenge Fund  for challenges having AI components . A peculiarity of the  UK plan is that it based on a definition of roles and responsibilities between the public and the private  sector and it is built upon co -financing.    Market studies  identified Finland as one of the most promising market for the uptake of AI -based  products and services . This is due to a combination of factors, including the advanced digitalisation of  the Finnish society and public administration and the high level of education generally attained by  Finland’s population (McKinsey, 2017a). A vision for Finland in the short period is that of a society where  AI are well integrated in  every Finn's daily life  and where these technologies are used ethically and  openly. To ach ieve these objectives, specific measures are envisaged to ensure that Finland invests  enough in the development and application of AI technolog ies, along to strengthen its capacity to  adapt  to the upcoming transformations . 1) Keep UK leading position in AI and diversify  2) Cross -sectoral approach 3) Public private partnership 4)  EUR 1.08 billion of announced public investment 1) Improve attractivness of  the French AI landscape 2) Sectoral priority (helthcare, mobility, energy, environment, defense  & security 3) Governmental -led, 4) EUR. 1.5 billion of announced public investment 1) National AI strategy expected in fall 2018 2) Presentky, focus on Industry 4.0, Smart Data, Smart Services and other digital trends linked  to AI in Germany's Hightech Strategy 3) Planned joint French -German AI research centre 1) Key role of the public sector as a trendsetter in the application of AI 2) Tap on  favourable ecosystem condistions while addressing problems of small scale of  Finnish economy 
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  27   Since 2006, the German government  has been pursuing a ‘High -Tech Strategy’ to focus its efforts in  research and innovation and industrial policy , but t he strategy does not explicitly address AI . A  masterplan for AI to channel investments in this area was first proposed by chancellor Angel a Merkel  in September 2017. It is expected that the government will follow up on that with an actual strategy to  be formally adopted in fall 2018. One focus will likely be on helping SMEs use AI and for Germany to be  a world leader in the area of AI. The s trategy is also expected to address the issue of favourable  conditions for AI scientists in Germany to stop the present brain drain to more vibrant AI ecosystems.  Improving the environment for start -ups and linking research and business more closely will l ikely be  another pillar of the strategy. The German Research Centre for AI (DFKI) is a major actor in the German  AI landscape and has been assigned the mission of pursuing  and provid ing funding for AI application  oriented basic research.   Other Member States have also started a discussion about how to support AI technologies and  mitigate societal risks .  Estonia, focused on designing a regulatory framework that would create an AI friendly regulatory environment in order to attract foreign investment in the country (see Box 3 in the  previous chapter). In 2017, Denmark set up the Danish Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence  within  the Alexandra Institute, a research and technology organisation focusing on ICT. The Centre is meant  to be a key player of the emerging Danish AI ecosystem. Its purpose is to support the implementation  of AI technologies in business, share data platform and expertise on specific AI technologies and foster  collaboration between companies and between companies and researc h organisations.  Italy’s Digital  Agency has published a white book  that delivered guidelines and recommendations for a responsible  use of A I in the p ublic administration . To this end, the government has committed EUR 5 million for  pilot projects of AI dep loyment in the delivery of public services  (Agenzia per lo Sviluppo Digitale,  2018) .   2.3. AI support policies in third countries   In the US , AI investments are driven by the private sector while AI governance  issues are discussed  within universities and think tanks . Towards the end of the Obama’s presidency in 2016, the US  developed two key documents that highlighted the key focus of a government strategy  (The National  Artificial Intelligence Research and Development Strategic Plan and Preparing for the Future of Artificial  Intelligence). These reports were followed by a third report (Artificial Intelligence, Automation, and the  Economy ), which examined the impact of automation and identified what policies are needed to  increase the benefits of AI while mitigat ing its social costs .  However, no specific funding was included and the Trump administration did not pursue that vision   but rather followed a free market -oriented  approach .  At present, the US Government has n o central AI  policy  and investment plan, but individual projects are funded by military and paramilitary  departments like DARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency) and IARPA  (Intelligence Advanced  Research Projects Activity ). Discussions about AI deplo yment, automation, the future of work and  privacy issues, are  taking place within the private sector, academia and think tanks  (e.g. the Future of  Life Institute) . The US AI landscape is diversified and based on strong digital eco -systems around the  hubs o f Silicon Valley, Seattle, Boston and New York, which bring together talent and research  capabilities from leading universities, private investment and cross -science and industry collaboration.  It can also rely on the US ICT tech giants, such as Microsoft,  Google, Amazon, Facebook and IBM, have  already transformed into world leading AI companies. However, c ontrary  to common perception the  role of public agenc ies in funding and developing AI technologies is prominent , especially with respect  to the most inno vative and apparently intractable AI technical challenges.  In the US there are several  separate agencies dealing directly or indirectly with AI technologies.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        28  PE 626.074    For instance, DARPA is now focusing on making AI more trustworthy  (Explainable AI programme), wit h  a view to apply more robust and reliable AI systems t o their existing work with robotics and unmanned  vehicles.   China  follows a top -down government -driven approach which is based on a comprehensive  national plan that has the ambition to make China the world leader in AI .  In 2017, the Chinese government published its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development  Plan12 to make China the global leader  in the development of AI and to make the country a leading AI  innovation hub by 2030.  An AI Plan Pro motion Office  was established within the Ministry of Science  and Technology  for managing the implementation of the plan, which is to be phased out in three steps:   • by 2020 China needs to have a world -leading rate of general development and application  while  the AI industry has to keep growing;   • by 2025 AI will be a key driver of industrial and economic reform through the extensive  deployment of AI indifferent industries, including healthcare and defence industry; and   • by 2030 China will be the world’s leading artificial intelligence innovation hub.   After the release of the Next Generation Plan, the Chinese government published a Three- Year Action  Plan to Promote the Development of New -Generation Artificial Intelligence Industry13, which focuses  on integrati ng AI across different manufacturing  industries . The plan is articulated in four key areas: i)  product developments  in healthcare, transportation, agriculture, finance, logistics, education and  culture ; ii) development of i ntelligent sensors and neural network semiconductors ; iii) development of  smart manufacturing, in particular, key technical equipment and new manufacturing models  incorporated with AI ; and  iv) establish a comprehensive AI support system, including setting up an   industry training data pool  and AI industry standards system  (e.g. AI product assessment system s, AI  patents and IPR protection platform s).  China has proposed the most comprehensive package of action to support its AI leadership objectives.  Besides promoting the development of specific  AI application within industry, the plan also seeks to  recruit globally the best data scientist talents and to give China a prominent role in discussing the  global governance of AI. China’s largest strength stems from the size of its population and its ci tizens’  willingness to make available their personal data to comply with state rules . The Chinese strategy is not  replicable in Europe because of its marked top -down approach and the controls exerted over business  and citizens.   Japan aims at integrating A I within sector roadmaps. In 2016, Japan launched a “Public -Private  Dialogue towards  Investment for the Future” and established  the “Artificial Intelligence Technology  Strategy Council” . The Council subsequently formulated  and “Artificial Intelligence Technology   Strategy”  (Strategic Council for AI Technology -Japan, 2017 ).                                                                      12 https://chinacopyrightandmedia.wordpress.com/2017/07/20/a -next -generation -artificial -intelligence-development plan/   13 http://www.usito.org/news/three-year -action -plan -focuses -next -generation -artificial -intelligence  
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  29   The plan is to be phased out in three separate steps  starting from the development of  data -driven AI   in various domains of Japan’s industrialisation  road map ( e.g. mobility, health, me dical care, welfare).  Similar to other countries, Japan AI strategy is to be implemented through a policy mix that includes   support to R&D, nurturing human resources, improving the regulatory environment for data and  experimentation and supporting start -ups. Japanese AI companies are hardware- oriented and their  strength lays on the country longstanding knowledge in robotics but, unlike the US, the main rationale  for developing robots is industrial and is not related to the military.  The support to start- ups is key to  build and reinforce Jap an’s  capacity to compete in the AI software components industry, where the  country lags behind in comparison with the US and China.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        30  PE 626.074      POLICY CHALLENGES  BROUGHT ABOUT BY AI  TECHNOLOGIES   3.1. Global policy challenges   AI gove rnance  has thus far been confined to the initiatives of think tanks and AI researchers . There  is a large consensus that AI is a disruptive set of technologies and that AI governance should be based  on a set of universally applicable principles and guidelines regarding the responsible use of these  technologies. With respect to the global threat that AI could potentially pose to humanity in the short  period, three global policy challenges stand out . These are related to the need to:   • track existing and future applications of AI in  cybersecurity and the military ;   • address the risks of an uncontrolled international AI races ; and   • keep AI research safe and beneficial  to humanity.   At the G7 held in Italy on 19th - 20th October 2017, the G7 ICT and industry ministers acknowledged the  potential benefits brought about by progress in AI technologies , but also warned about the need to  understand the broader potential effects of AI on society and to develop these technologies  with a  human -centric approach in harmony with the existing laws, policies and values. During the 71st session  of the United Nations General Assembly, on 29 September 2016, UNICRI (United Nations International  Crime and Justice research Institute) announced the opening of the first Centre on A I and Robotics KEY FINDINGS   There is not yet robust evidence of AI applications used for addressing  significant and wideranging real -life problems or societal challenges. As a matter of fact, the pace and direction of  technological progress in AI is difficult to predict, even in the short -term and it is rather difficult  to separate the “marketing story ” from the “implementation story”.   In Europe, AI research efforts are abundant but scattered and skewed in academia and public  research organisations, while technology transfer and commercialisation of AI applications in  business take up more slowly than i n the US. This implies that strong European AI ecosystems are  yet to emerge.  A competition for attracting talented data scientists has already started and the  countries with the most vibrant AI landscape are better positioned. This virtuous cycle of capit al  and human resources accumulation in AI R&D and innovation activities reinforce the existing  advantages.   Malevolent or ethically inattentive uses of AI may have dreadful effects for humanity. No  governmental or international organisation has yet taken the leadership for developing a general  guidance and framework for the development and deployment of AI in ac cordance with universal  human values. Reflective work and actions in this direction have been mostly undertaken by  groups of AI scientists, think tanks and industry, while some governments are trying to identify  possibile solutions to some AI challenges in dividually.   The safe and ethical use of AI research is a global challenge and there is still a significant policy  and regulatory gap to fill in this respect. The response to the legal, societal and ethical challenges  posed by AI development has not been a ble to keep up with AI scientific progress. As a result of  this, there are too many disparate initiatives that try to mitigate existing risks instead of  anticipating them.  
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  31   within the United Nations system. The centre’s mission is to enhance understanding of the risk -benefit  duality of A I and robotics for the purpose of identifying global solutions to such problems.   In spi te of the above- mentioned initiatives, there is still a significant policy gap in AI global governance  that has been emphasized in various ways by initiatives driven by AI scientists or prominent business   persons, such as Elon Musk (Tesla and Space X found er) and Bill Gates (Microsoft founder). At the same  time, the Facebook -Cambridge Analytica affair made it evident that individual firms, including big tech  ones, are often unable to address, in the absence of clear and comprehensive policies, the ethical a nd  social threats that AI technologies may give rise to. Institutions and not- for profit organisations have  been established to deal with AI ethics in research and society. These notably include the University of  Oxford’s Future of Humanity Institute (UK),  the Future of Life Institute (US) and Open AI (US). The  European scientists adhering to the CLAIRE initiative solicited EU institutions to develop an AI  manifesto – similar to the “Russell -Einstein manifesto” developed in 1955 to denounce the threats for  humanity posed by the nuclear arms race –  to ensure that AI research is responsibly developed by  anticipating and ethically guiding the consequences of deploying specialised, narrow AI systems while  limiting the creation of general, human- level or even sup er-human AI.   Box 6: The AI Code of Conduct developed by UK House of Lords Special Committee   Source: Artificial Intelligence Committee AI in the UK: ready, willing and able?    The larger diffusion of AI will be soon confronted with more ethical and moral issues  that may  jeopardise and hinder social acceptability of AI .  As AI system use spreads over different sectors,  critical decisions, such as identifying appropriate treatments for illness or granting a bank loan, will  increasingly be based on data analytics. Because the existing ML models are opaque,  non -intuitive, and   difficult for people to  understand , there are major research gaps to be fulfilled (Gunning, 2017). These  include the need to :   • develop explainable, transparent, validated and trustworthy AI systems to address the  unpredictable “black box” scenario, which is currently the norm in AI ;  • add values, ethics, privacy and security in the  core design of AI systems and application s; and  • ensure that AI are not used for malevolent purposes (e.g. promoting discrimination,  dissemination of fake news and “deepfakes”, attempts to use AI to establish hegemony, control  of people , undermine democratic processes  or even take down governments , to dece ive and  orient vulnerable categories of people by  AI agents which are misidentified with human  interlocutors, and so on).   Ensuring accountability and transparency in the use of data in AI systems has not been achieved yet.  The committee suggested a  cross -sector AI Code of conduct to be based on five key principles.   • AI should be developed for the common good and benefit of humanity.   • AI should operate on principles of intelligibility and fairness.   • AI should not be used to diminish the data rights or privacy of individuals, families or  communities.   • All citizens should have the right to be educated to enable them to flourish mentally,  emotionally and economically alongside AI .  • The autonomous power to hurt, dest roy or deceive human beings should never be vested in  AI.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        32  PE 626.074    There are technical rea sons behind that, which are linked to the level of sophistication achieved by  certain AI systems and limitations of the existing technologies. A new AI research area Explainable AI   (XAI)  is now developing to address the scientific and technological challenges raised by algorithm  transparency, interpretability and accountability demands. However, when privacy and transparency  are concerned, companies that benefited the most from the current free data availability tend to apply  double standards. They fiercely  advocate for open and free data access from individuals and  governments but are extremely protective of their own data and algorithms.   As AI systems become more autonomous and have a larger control over their physical or digital  environment s, the chances  of errors increase, along with the occurrence of unintended consequences .  This refers to accidents in AI technologies that can be unintentionally harmful, which generally occur  when the machine is not provided with appropriate objective functions and trai ning data (e.g. leading  to self -driving cars running into deadly car crash). In general, scientists are not in the position to control  completely these aspects of the AI learning processes and to predict exactly every single behaviour of  an AI learning sys tem. However, they are currently working to minimize such accidents  and improve  robustness, risk -sensitivity, and safe exploration  with the purpose of making AI use safer and more  reliable (Amodei et al., 2016).  Finally, there are many open questions about human moral responsibilit ies. These refer to how  responsibilities and liabilities are to be properly distributed among AI engineers, manufacturers, users  and other stakeholders in the case of adverse events that are brought about by an AI system . It has  been suggested that responsibilities might have to  be shared between humans and machines  (European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies, 2017). However, the idea of putting AI  machines along with human beings in the category of responsible and ac countable entities remains  highly controversial.   AI applications are at an early stage of development and the future development of AI  is highly  uncertain . Despite  AI are quickly becoming an integral part of our daily lives , there is general  agreement that  what we see today is just the tip of an iceberg of a would -be AI revolution. As a matter  of fact, t he pace and direction of technological progress in AI is difficult to predict, even in the shortterm  and it is rather difficult to separate the “marketing story” from the “implementation story” .  Presently, there is a considerable expectation on the potential of combining big data and AI for  economic applications  and for addressing societal challenges,  but these expectations do not match  well with the still too limited understanding on how to concretely apply AI -solutions in business  (McKinsey, 2017; PwC, 2018a).  Empirical data on the use of AI application s in business show that AI are  still disproportiona lly applied to chatbots, while too few  AI solutions  are applied to solving real problem s (Asgard and Roland Berger, 2018 ). Existing technologies used for speech and image  recognition still have many limitations in their effective use and there are ample ma rgins for  improvements. Empirical studies measuring aggregate productivity growth in relation to progress  made in transformative technologies, such as AI, show that, while the value of developing these  technologies has been generously reflected in the mark et value of the leading firms, the promised  productivity gains have not yet materialised (Brynjolfsson et al., 2017).   Businesses in different sectors  have recently become more sceptical about the large productivity which are supposed to be  connected with the deployment of the state -of-the-art AI technologies.  Some industry representatives  are also concerned that an excessive emphasis on AI could divert investments from other equally  important process and product innovations (Financial Time, 2018).  
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  33   Against this backdrop, AI experts are also concerned that there might be too much hype, as well as  inaccurate reporting about AI . This could both rise unrealistic expectations about the possibility of  applying AI in the short term to solve a number of societal challenges while nurtur ing fears about  science fiction scenario s where AI overtake humanity. Realizing the societal benefits of AI is not  automatic and will depend upon a combination of factors, including the improvement of the existing  AI systems to integra te concerns related to safety and ethics. The future evolution of AI systems is  thus   linked to the process of development and generalisation of A I technologies for concrete applications  (McKinsey Global Institute, 2017  and Strategic Council for AI Technolo gy, 2017) and the capacity of  society to adapt and restructure to participate in and benefit from the transformational processes  triggered by an uptake of AI across sectors and citizens’ life ( Brynjolfsson et al., 2017).  3.2. Policy challenges for Europe   AI research resources are abundant in Europe  but scattered . Collectively,  Europe has a strong  tradition of excellence in all areas of AI but does not have yet AI ecosystems that are comparable to  those established in the US. Fragmentation is highly visible in AI research activities and in national AI  development strategies that aim at gaining individually AI market leadership. The E C Communication  "Artificial intelligence for Europe", constitutes the first steps on whi ch the Commission envisages to  build a strong European AI community . It is widely acknowledged in European industry, science and  institutions that i t is only by joining forces that Europe can remain competitive.   The UK is currently the only leading country for AI that has succeeded, thanks to a favourable AI  ecosystem, to stand in international competition for AI funding, research, and talents. Brexit is going to  have a heavy impact on the EU AI landscape that will be deprived of its most vibrant player. A t the same  time, Brexit is likely to affect UK’s ability to attract and retain strong computer science  academics ,  especially from other EU countries. In this scenario, maintain ing a  collaboration between the UK and  the EU is vital to remain competitive wit h US and China.   Competition for digital talent is getting tougher . The development of AI applications requires a wide  variety of scientific and engineering competences and skills to cope with the increased complexity of  state -of-art algorithms and the related design, implementation, testing and revision challenges. Data  workers of the future will need to improve their knowledge of mathematics and statistics, along with  the ability to identify and collect data sets for machine learning, to track the sources of data biases, and  to foster fairness, non- discrimination and diversity . Since AI solutions are by nature multidisciplinary   the combination of t echnological, cognitive and new creative and interpersonal skills is also gaining  more prominence (McKinsey , 2017b).    As fierce demand for skilled AI researchers is already heavily outstripping supply14, the further uptake  of AI is likely to intensify global competition for talented data engineers and data scientists and  European companies are already looking o utside Europe for getting enough people with the right skills  mix. European universities are having several difficulties in keeping talented computer scientists.                                                                       14  According to an IDC high- growth scena rio in 2020 there will be over 2.8 million unfilled data worker positions.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        34  PE 626.074    Top British AI researchers are being lured from academia by US tech firms with the prospect o f much  higher salaries. This brain drain is hampering  research and disrupt ing computer science teaching in  leading universities , but it is also bringing academic and basic AI research in private laboratories .  Such  a level of competition for data scientists is disproportiona tely affect European SMEs by limiting their  growth perspectives.   In an attempt to stop the brain drain, European leading computer scientists have put forward a  proposal for establishing a large pan -European AI research institute. The initiative, which was named  ELLIS - Initiative to establish a European Lab for Learning & Intelligent Systems, was followed by another  initiative called CLAIRE - Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe-   that is set to  nurture the creation of a unified community of AI European researchers that puts human  values , such as fairness, truthfulness and privacy , upfront . Learning partially from the successful  experience of CERN, CLAIRE proposal is based on a polycentric model that foresees the creation of  several AI Centre of Excellences along with AI collaborative networks (CLAIRE, 2018).   AI will transform labour, with far- reaching implications for education, long -life learning and social  welfare . Concerns that technological innovation  may  lead to increased unemployment  and g reater  inequality  between and within countries are not new and AI is no exception  to this. The largest public  fear is that AI technologies can soon replace a wide variety of human jobs, resulting in mass scale  unemployment, ever increasing inequality and social unrest. In the past, countries have addressed  technology -led transformations by deploying a mix of policies that were geared towards mitigating  the adverse effects on the most vulnerable people and fostering reskilling and skills upgrade. (UN DESA,  2017). At present,  AI systems can replace humans in undertaking narrowly defined tasks , including both  physical and intellectual routine tasks, at a much lower cost per unit . In the future, automation is not  likely to be directed at entirely replacing occupations requiring capabilities such as human  adaptiveness to changing problem -solving environments, social intelligence, and cooperative  decision -making, unless general intelligence AI systems, contrary to most educated expectations, will  be soon developed (Tegmax, 2017 and  Eurofound 2017).   Statistics on the impact of AI on the labour market needs to be taken with cautions. A Gartner report  published in 2017 estimates that AI will create 500,000 additional jobs for medium and high skilled  workers over the next three years. A  McKinsey report predicts that half of today’s workplace activities  could be automated by 2055 , or even 20 years earlier , in the most extreme scenario (McKinsey, 2017c) .  As a matter of fact, these impacts are difficult to estimate and wi ll actually depend on effective progress  in AI application for real -life problems and on the combination of AI with other breakthrough  technologies.   Regardless of the actual number of jobs destructed and created, a key issue in more automated  workplaces will be the amplific ation of power asymmetries and inequalities . If, as foreseen by a  McKinsey Report (McKinsey, 2017b), half of the productivity gains in the future will likely come from  job losses, while the other half will be attributed to product and process innovation, automation  is likely  to lead societ ies towards a significant transfer of national income from wages to capital. Given that  these predictions reinforce existing trends that already see an uneven distribution of productivity  gains, a big area of concern for European policy makers is to understand how the gains of improved AI  technologies could be shared within and between countries. Adaptation of welfare and education  systems might be necessary to protect the people whose skills become obsolete.   Finally, t ransformation induced by the diffusion of AI technologies, along with other digital  technologies, will have far -reaching implications for training and education and a major shift in the  type of skills needed  is expected to occur in the medium term .  
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  35   The diff usion of AI applications stems from progress on general digitalisation  and a better  understanding of how application s of AI can be effectively used in public administrations  and in  supporting public decision -making .   The uptake of AI is enabled and leveraged by the ongoing digital transformation within the private and  public sectors. The state of digitisation across the EU varies considerably across sectors and countries.  According to the EU Digital Monitor Report 2017 , Denmark, Finland, Sweden and the Netherlands have  the most advanced digital economies followed by Luxembourg, Belgium, the UK and Ireland. Romania,  Bulgaria,  Greece and Italy have the lowest scores on the Digital Economy and Society Index15.  However,  the general perception is that European industries are not taking full advantage of digital technologies  and of the opportunities that these technolog ies offer.   A similar analysis applies to public administrations. P ublic sector digitisation (e.g. creating a  digital  public administration) in key to create a market for these technologies that can be applied to generate  public savings through a more efficient use of public resources (e.g.  using AI to assist public servants  in finding patterns, matching data, a nd automating manual processes ).  As an example, in Finland the  development of AI applications is linked to the objective of providing the best public services in the  world ( Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment, 2017 ). The Italian government has  launched a consultation with experts from multiple disciplines to assess to what extents and under  which conditions AI technologies can be applied in public administration to support the provision of  public services, along with overall progress in e- government  (Agenzia per lo Sviluppo Digitale, 2018 ).  However, the use of AI in public administration and public decision making is no risk free and has  several implications. Firstly, it has a non -negligible impact on the relationship between a state and its  citizens. Secondly, the use of AI algorithms risks to deliver oversimplified solutions and undesired social  outcomes. This is because algorithms do not nuance and are not good in dealing with trade off  and  with being inclusive by balancing diversified interests .   Finally, governments risk being  overconfident about AI being the easy and quick fix of complex  societal  challenges  that require longer process and arbitration capacities.  Actually, there is not yet sufficient  empirical evidence on the use of AI systems to support such a statement. Market studies hi ghlight that  AI are currently mostly employed in marketing and retail sectors , especially in relation to customer  profiling and service and product offers’ customisation.   In this context, the policy response risk s to be  too much driven by  the latest technology trends (e.g. AI, blockchain),  while t here could be several cases  in which other technologies, or alternative non- tech solutions, could deliver similar outcomes at lower  social costs.                                                                              15  This is a composite index that summarises relevant in dicators on Europe’s digital performance and tracks the progress of EU  Member States in digital competitiveness.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies        36  PE 626.074      RECOMMENDATIONS   In order to maximi se AI benefits , while addressing risks related to the diffusion of AI technologies in  products and services, and promoting an informed and open debate about AI, the EP could consider  the following actions.   Promote genuine progress in AI global governance  and discussion s about the societal risks of these  technologies . Gathering upon its founding social and ethical values, the EP could launch a process that  would start a discussion about a common, internationally recognised ethical and legal framework for  the design, prod uction and use of AI . This framework should provide a roadmap for promoting and  protecting human values and welfare by the responsible uses of these technologies. Suitable policies  for protecting human dignity, autonomy and responsibility from threats pose d by autonomous  decision -making and action by AI and robotic systems should also be actively promoted  at the global  level . This should also include an evidence -based discussion about the risks of adopting such  technologies in terms of their impacts on individual rights and freedom (e.g. what are the implications  of the systematic profiling of citizens? To what extent and how the use of these pieces of information  should be limited?).   Ensure that the development of AI based products and services developed i n Europe integrate core  European values  by mean of a general ethical framework . So far, the European Union and Member  State legislations had to respond to ethical and social risks of AI innovations imported from the US (e.g.  protection of citizens’ privacy  from abusive behaviours). The development of European AI product and  services will give to the AI applications developed in Europe a distinctive character and comparative  advantage.  In general, ethical issues raised by AI technologies and systems should be more extensively  analysed and appropriate ethical policies should be developed accordingly.  This implies creating  a  coherent and trusted regulatory framework . This can be achieved by regulating broad AI principles  rather than specific algorithms , which is deemed to be more effective and cost -efficient.  This general  ethical framework should be inspired by the principle of human- centric AI (i.e. AI tightly developed  under human oversight and control), embed the principles of fairness and justice in algorithms, applied  in all phases of AI systems’ design, i mplementation and testing, while following through bias  complaints and other undesired effects reporting.   Prioritise AI applications that effectively address societal challenges . The use of AI in critical industrial  applications is a relatively untested f ield . The literature shows that the potential of AI, as compared to  other technologies, might be presently over estimated and might be driven by unrealistic expectations  about what these technologies can effectively achieve in terms of generating economic and social  value. The business community has also recently started to take a more cautious approach. While  substantial investment in AI research should be tested against alternatives, the combination of AI with  other technologies and megatrends should be b etter explored and based upon empirical evidence.  The EP should e nsure that funds allocated to AI prioriti ses applications in which AI support s human  efforts with respect to taking better , informed and  unbiased decisions  to address societal challenges.  Investment in applications with large multiplier effects that leverage on the potential benefits of AI for  business and society  should be carefully identified and prioritised .   Ensure consistency in regulations and policies that are linked to AI, such as those affecting the  access, use and storage of data. This goes in the direction of removing barriers to the cross -border  access, use and storage of data.  Since many new AI applications are developed by start -ups, regulatory  impact assessments should also consider to what extent new or revised regulations disproportionally  affect these companies. The possibility of introducing regulatory sandboxes should be carefully  considered to test the use of AI in heavily regulated sectors, such as finance and healthcare.  
European Artificial Intelligence (AI) leadership, the path for an integrated vision     PE 626.074  37   These could be introduced at the European level to facilitate collaborative projects and avoid a further  fragmentation of the Digital Single Market.   Ensure that EU support for AI leverages and complements actions undertaken in Member States .  As  the European countries develop their national policy responses  to promote the uptake of AI and  mitigate its risks, European institutions should play a key role in coordinating such efforts, fill ing in  policy gaps that cannot be a ddressed solely at the national level and support the widespread  develop ment  of competitive AI ecosystem s throughout Europe. This also requires seizing  synergies  between the EU framework research programme, the newly established Digital European Programme  and the ESI  Funds .   Finally, engage with Member States to prepare business and society for the upcoming  transformations . Although statistics on the impact of AI on the labour marke t need to be taken with  caution , policy makers have to be aware of the  possi ble different outlooks and become prepared to  address short -term or even long -term effects of technological unemployment which AI developments  may significantly contribute to bring about.  Adaptation of welfare and education systems will be  necessary to protect the people whose skills become obsolete  and to mitigate the amplification of  power asymmetries and inequalities  generated by increased automation.
