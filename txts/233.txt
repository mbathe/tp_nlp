  6   INTRODUCTION   In its various communicati ons on arti ficial intelligence (AI)1 the European Commission has set out its vision  for AI, which is to be trustworthy and human -centric . Three pillars underpin the Commission’s vision: (i)  increasing public and private investments in AI to boost its uptak e, (ii) preparing for socio -economic  changes, and (iii) ensuring an appropriate ethical and legal framework to protect and strengthen European  values. To support the implementation of this vision, the Commission established the High -Level Expert  Group on A rtificial Intelligence (AI HLEG), an independent group mandated with the drafting of two  deliverables: a set of AI Ethics Guidelines and  a set of  Policy and Investment Recommendations.2   In our first deliverable, the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI3 published on 8 April 2019 (Ethics  Guidelines), we stated that AI systems need to be human -centric, with the goal of improving individual  and societal well-being, and worthy of our trust. In order to be deemed trustworthy, we put forward that  AI systems – including  all actors and processes involved therein – should  be lawful, ethical and robust .  Those Guidelines therefore  constituted a first important step  in identifying the type of AI that we want  and do not want for Europe, but that is  not enough to ensure that Europe can also materialise the  beneficial impact that Trustworthy AI can bring .  Taking the next step,  this document contains our proposed  Policy and Investment Recommendations for  Trustworthy AI, addressed to EU institutions and Member States . Buildi ng on our first deliverable, we put  forward 33 recommendations that can guide Trustworthy AI towards sustainability, growth and  competitiveness, as well as inclusion – while  empowering, benefiting and protecting human beings. We  believe that EU Institution s and Member States will play a key role in the achievement of these goals, as a  pivotal player in the data economy, a procurer of Trustworthy AI systems and as a standard -setter of  sound governance .  Our recommendations focus on four main areas where we be lieve Trustworthy AI can help achieving a  beneficial impact, starting with humans and society at large  (A), and continuing then to focus on the  private sector  (B), the public sector (C) and Europe’s research and academia  (D). In addition, we also  address  the main enablers needed to facilitate those impacts, focusing on  availability of data and  infrastructure  (E), skills and education  (F), appropriate governance and regulation  (G), as well as funding  and investment  (H).   These recommendations should not be r egarded as exhaustive, but attempt to tackle the most pressing  areas for action with the greatest potential. Europe can distinguish itself from others by developing,  deploying, using and scaling  Trustworthy AI , which we believe  should  become the only kind of AI in  Europe , in a manner that can enhance both individual and societal well -being.     Europe is well placed to seize AI’s opportunities   Europe is entering the third wave of digitalisation, but the adoption of AI technologies is still in  its infancy.  The first wave involved primarily connection and networking technology adoption, while the second wave                                                              1  European Commission communications published on 25 April 2018 (COM(2018) 237 final), 7 December 20 18 (COM(2018)  795 final) and 8 April 2019 (COM(2019) 168 final). For our definition of Artificial Intelligence (AI), please refer to our  document published on 8 April 2019: “A Definition of AI: Main Capabilities and Disciplines” which was prepared for the  purpose of our deliverables and can be found here:   https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=56341 .   2  For more information on the AI HLEG, see https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/high -level -expert -group -artificial intelligence .  3  These are available at: https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/ethics -guidelines -trustworthy -ai.   
  7   was driven by the age of big data. The third wave is char acterised by the adoption of AI  which, on average,  could boost growth in European economic activity by clo se to 20%  by 2030 .4 In turn, this will create a  foundation for a higher quality of life, new employment opportunities, better services, as well as new and  more sustainable business  models and opportunities.   However, as is the case with any  technolog y, AI can be deployed both in a manner that increases human  well-being and that may lead to potential harm. Therefore, while it creates a great opportunity for Europe,  it also implies certain risks of which policy -makers are increasingly aware . This may  necessitate spe cific  and targeted governance measures that  provide appropriate  safeguards to protect individuals  and society .  In this report , we make recommendations to position Europe so that it can maximise the extent to which  it can benefit from the oppor tunities presented by AI, while simultaneously ensuring that the se benefits  are felt throughout the entire European society , and that any risks are prevented or minimised.   When analysing the international landscape regarding key markets and investments for  AI, there are  significant differences in focus across the largest economies in the world, including t he U.S. , China and  Europe. The market for AI is much broader than  business -to-consumer (B2C). More specifically, it also  includes business -to-business (B2 B) platforms and markets, in which substantial  industrial value is  create d. In fact, studies indicate that one third of the value created by AI is contributable to the B2C  segment, and two -thirds to the B2B, where Europe has a traditionally strong footprin t.5  In addition, a third segment can be identified when considering  public -to-citizens (P2C) services  that are  increasingly  procuring and deploying  digital and AI -enabled solutions and where the trust of individuals is  an even more crucial  prerequisite. The P2C context or Digital Government is emerging very rapidly,  leading to a potential revolution in the role and structure of government and its relationship with  individuals and businesses .6  Within each of these three segments, an additional level of granu larity is needed to understand their  underlying logic. Therefore, we should disen tangle AI systems that consist  of a digital element only, from  AI systems that combine both digital and physical components. This leads to a more comprehensive  picture, compri sed of six different yet connected segments with their own specific logic for growth,  competitiveness and governance.   This more holistic vision lends  itself to the creation of a  European Single Market for  Trustworthy  AI, where  Europe  is in an exceptional p osition to put tailored policy and investment measures in place that can  enable it to seize the benefits and capture the value of AI , while minimising and preventing its risks .                                                                    4  See Notes from the AI Frontier: Tackling Europe’s Gap in Digital and AI, McKinsey Global Institute, 2019.   5  See Notes from the AI Frontier: Modelling the Impact of AI on the World Economy, McKinsey Global Institute, 2018.   6  See Deloitte Insights, How artificial intelligence could transform government (2017), available at:  https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/focus/artificial -intelligence -in-government.html .  
  8         CHAPTER I  USING TRUSTWORTHY AI TO BUILD A POSITIVE  IMPACT IN EUROPE              
  9   CHAPTER I: USING TRUSTWORTHY AI TO BUILD A POSITIVE IMPACT IN EUROPE   In this chapter, we focus on four major areas of impact that merit a specific focus: (A) Humans and  Society, (B) the Private Sector, (C) the Public Sector and (D) Research and Academia .  (A) As already stated in our Ethics Guidelines, in building a future with AI, our point of departure is  human -centricity . By placing the human at the centre of our thinking, we underscore the fact that AI is  not an end in itself, but a means to enhance h uman well -being and freedom. All policy recommendations  that we put forward in this document have this as their direct or indirect goal. Human -centricity , however ,  not only implies attention to individuals, but also to the well -being of society at large an d the environment  that humans live in. Europe should champion the use of AI towards sustainable development in line with  the Agenda 2030.   (B) For Europe to tackle the opportunities and challenges created by AI, it needs a thriving and vibrant   private secto r. The private sector is a key player in generating economic growth and creating relevant an d  growing employment opportunities  through its success. The uptake and scaling of AI solutions as well as  the stimulation of innovation and technology transfer can help achieving this. At the same time, a key  success factor for the private sector is the ability to understand the specific needs in different businesses  and sectors. Collaboration with the public sector and civil society, research and academia  as well as  with  policy -makers is essential for  gaining such understanding and generating AI -enabled solutions to the  benefit of all.   (C) Equally, the public sector has a crucial role to play at both  individual and societal level in the adoption  of Trustworthy AI. Th e current transformation of governments towards more efficient and digitised public  services might  represent a fundamental shift in the way in which the economy and, in particular, the  Single Market, is structured and organised. Harnessing the public secto r “as a platform” could lead to new  opportunities for researchers and entrepreneurs to gain access to data and infrastructure for developing  welfare -enhancing AI solutions through privacy -preserving means . The public sector can make strategic  use of public  procurement to foster responsible innovation, as well as steering it towards tackling societal  challenges and the development of trustworthy AI solutions. Moreover, by delivering higher quality, more  targeted and thus more effective services to individual s and groups  where appropriate , it can also act as a  catalyst for innovation and growth.   (D) The bedrock of any successful transition is the ability to understand the changes we are facing. The  role of  research  and academia is therefore  essential in creat ing the foundational layer for all actors and  activities needed for Europe to master these changes. Research , both academic and industry -based,   enables us to understand and address emerging challenges and can help turn the development of AI  towards the com mon good. It can also provide the interdisciplinary and multi disciplinary mix that is  needed to ensure AI’s trustworthiness, and foster our understanding on the impact of new and existing  policies. Research is also an engine of creativity, beneficial innovation and new venture s through  technology transfer, offering solutions that can be embedded into useful products. Finally, research and  academia are key  provider s of education and skills, which are essential  in a world where “intelligent”  systems perform an increasing number a nd variety  of tasks.   In what follows, we elaborate on each of those areas, indicating which impact we wish to achieve with AI  and providing a number of recommendations on how this can be accomplished.        
  10   A. Empowering and Protecting Humans and Society   AI pre sents a promising means to enhance individual and societal well -being and the  common good, as well as driving progress and responsible  innovation. Yet it also  carries risks for humans and societies, which  need to be identified and addressed.  Hence , we need to foster A I solutions that can empower human beings, and  monitor the impacts they create, ensuring that this happens in a way that protects  our rights and values. It is therefore  essential that individuals gain awareness, knowledge and  understanding of the capabilit ies, challenges and limitations of AI systems, and of their rights related  thereto.    The impact of AI systems on individuals and society at large needs to be better understood, so as to  enable actions to guide the technology’s development and use towards the vision we set out in our Ethics  Guidelines . This requires research, new monitoring and measuring mechanisms, as well as measures that  can protect individuals and society from potential adverse impact generated by the technology. Below, we  reflect on th e policies that should be put in place to achieve  this goal.    EMPOWER HUMANS BY INC REASING KNOWLEDGE AN D AWARENESS OF AI  1. In order to build a society supported by AI that we would like to live in , it is imperative that not only AI  experts, but also society  at large is aware of the possibilities and limitations of the application of AI  systems. The following actions are recommended in this respect:   1.1 Encourage Member States to increase digital literacy through courses (e.g. MOOCs) across Europe  providing eleme ntary AI training.  This includes fostering the understanding of AI systems more  generally (including a basic understanding of machine learning and reasoning), but also raising  awareness of data protection  rights , an understanding of how (personal) data can  be used, the  implications of digital tracking , and the importance of issues such as  fairness, explainability,  transparency, robustness of AI systems, and knowledge of  these topics . Efforts need to be made to  ensure that such courses are accessible to all,  taking due account of the digital divide and paying  particular attention to the lower skilled and disadvantaged. A universal design approach should be  inherent in all of these  programs. The outreach and popularity of national public broadcasters can  also be leveraged to develop educational programmes on AI, outlining its main opportunities,  possible risks and ways to mitigate them.   1.2 Encourage Member States to support and further develop basic education on AI and digital  literacy , particularly  in primary , secondary and tertiary education systems , as well as  beyond . This  includes supporting young people through EU youth policies and funds who are lead ing pro jects  aiming at educati ng and informing individuals on opportunities and challenges of new technologies .  However, it  also includes fostering AI knowledge amidst the less young, encompassing employees,  executives,  civil servants, policy -makers  and all other individuals.  The education and nurturing of  STEM and more specifically AI  experts not only as technolo gy drivers , but also as enablers for society  on all levels , needs to be emphasi sed, supported  and extended. Further recommendations on the  fostering of skills and education  can be found under Section F.  1.3 Create an AI competence framework for individuals, includin g a focus on the core skills required.   This includes directing the Digital Competence Framework for Citizens7 – as a tool to improve digital                                                              7  For more information, see https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur -scientific -and-technical -research -reports/digcomp 21-digital -competence -framework -citize ns-eight -proficiency -levels -and-examples -use.  
  11   competences.  All individuals should be empowered with the necessary skills to use AI technology,  beyond being recip ients of information on the technology. In addition, they should be able to make  use of tools to challe nge public governance through AI systems, as addressed under  Recommendation 12 .3 below.   1.4 Institutionalise a dialogue between policy -makers, developers and  users of AI technology, for  instance through the European AI Alliance , on the ethical and legal limits of AI and examine how the  policy and regulatory framework needs to be further developed in order to guarantee legal certainty  and foster beneficial inno vation while ensuring due respect for human rights, democracy and the  rule of law. A widespread mechanism of public consultation should be ensured  on the most ethically  sensitive issues revolving around AI systems with a significant impact on society or in dividuals.  Besides enabling a dialogue through the European AI Alliance, such mechanisms are also needed at  Member  State level to respect linguistic  and cultural diversity.    1.5 Inform the public at large about free available resources on AI that they can use  to learn  and  experiment ( e.g. algorithms  and data), to discuss ( e.g. via  blogs)  and to share best practices . This  could be done by creating a repository on the European AI Alliance platform.  Moreover, publicly  financed and subsidised program mes in the med ia and social networks as well as non -formal  education organisations that provide training and awareness -raising on data protection, coding,  robotics and data (including data protection), should be supported.   1.6 Establish a yearly European AI Awareness Day  (for instance, on the birthday of Alan Turing) with  awareness material to be used for the event.8 This should be accompanied by a European AI  Awareness website , which could also provide answers to common questions related to AI (in the  form of a “FAQ”) .   PROT ECT THE INTEGRITY OF  HUMANS , SOCIETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT  2. AI can provide tools to help safeguarding the integrity of our public institutions  and the private sector  (e.g.  by detecting and proving discrimination) , the privacy of individuals ( e.g. by detecting  and rooting ou t  privacy  infringing content) as well as the  environment ( e.g. by improving the detection of pollutants and  their sources) . However, i f not applied in a trustworthy manner, AI systems could cause adverse impacts  to individuals, society and t he environment, such as unjust discrimination or bias, privacy infringement,  social or economic exclusion or environmental decline. Adequate protection should be put in place to  counter such impacts.   2.1 Refrain from disproportionate and mass surveillance of individuals . While there may be a strong  temptation for governments to “secure society” by building a pervasive surveillance system  based  on AI systems , this would be extremely dangerous if pushed to extreme levels. Governments should  commit not to engage i n mass surveillance of individuals and to deploy and procure only  Trustworthy AI systems, designed to be respectful of the law  and fund amental rights , aligned with  ethical principles and socio -technically robust.   2.2 Commercial surveillance of individuals (particularly  consumers) and society should be countered ,  ensuring that it is strictly in line with fundamental rights such  as privacy – also when it concerns  “free” services  – taking  into consideration the effect s of alternative business models.   2.3 Consideration should be given to po wer asymmetries between institutions, businesses and  individuals arising from the growth of digital devices and systems and the rapid expansion of                                                              8  This could for instance include a “1 hour AI” initiative, similar to 1-hour  code initiatives (see e.g. https://hourofcode.com ). 
  12   digital data that they generate.  Where appropriate, for instance in situations of individual or  collective ha rm, consideration should be given to whether potential measures may be needed to  address this.   2.4 Introduce a mandatory self -identification of AI systems.  In situations where an interaction  takes  place between a human and an AI system, and w henever there is a  reasonable likelihood that end  users could be led to believe that they are interacting with a human, deployers of AI systems should  be attributed a general responsibility to disclose that in reality the system is non -human.  This goes  hand -in-hand with en suring  the transparency of AI systems.    2.5 Foster the development of AI solutions that address sustainability challenges , by launching  competitions and missions for AI solutions tackling specific environmental problems, strengthening  this component in the Hor izon Europe missions, and enact a circular economy plan for digital  technologies and AI in particular to incentivise companies to reduce the carbon footprint of data  centres and devices (including smartphones). Consideration must be also given to the susta inability  of big data -driven AI and modern computing and AI architectures to ensure that the process of  developing AI products and services also does not have an undue sustainability impact.    PROMOTE A HUMAN -CENTRIC APPROACH TO AI AT WORK  3. Over the past yea rs, an important debate has taken place on the impacts that the increased diffusion of AI  systems and, more generally, the digital transformation of the economy will have on the labour market .  The European Commission appointed a dedicated High Level Expert  Group9 on this issue, which released a  report10 in April 2019. A few months earlier, the EGE11 likewise dedicated a report12 on this topic. We refer  to that report for a more detailed analysis of existing trends and possible measures to ensure that digital  technologies do not negatively disrupt the workplace, and that adequate social protection, collective  representation and training are offered to European workers. Here below, we will limit ourselves to those  recommendations which we believe are crucial to a lso take up in this document, against the broader  context of the goals we set out to achieve, particularly focusing on the impact of the use of AI in the  workplace. We note that this section also covers the domestic working environment, covering those who  engage in domestic work, as well as situations where work is carried out on an unpaid basis.    3.1 Promote the research, development and deployment of human -centric AI systems in work  contexts  without stifling socially beneficial innovation.  A careful consider ation of challenges  associated with socio -technical work systems integration, be it issues of safet y and security, human  oversight  or deskilling , will allow the full exploitation of AI -driven automation.  Research funding,  technology transfer and deployment , tax policy and government demand -side policies should be  aimed at  creating collaborative AI -human work systems  without preventing innovation and aiming  to avoid menial jobs, especially in situations where automation is a cost -efficient alternative,  enabl ing governments to allocate funds for the  creation of more productive jobs  and improving the  social well -being of individuals.  This could also drive  the reshoring of jobs to  Europe.  Moreover,  human -empowering  AI applications could also create new job oppor tunities in  particular for those who – because  of natural restrictions such as disabilities or living circumstances                                                              9  For more information on this expert group, see: https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/high -level -expert -group impact -digital -transformation -eu-labour -markets .  10  Available at: https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm?doc_id=58412 .   11  The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) is an independent expe rt group established by the  European Commission and focusing on ethical aspects of science and technology relating to EU legislation and policies.   12  Available at: https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/info/files/research_and_innovation/ege/ege_future -ofwork_opinion_122018.pdf . 
  13   – were  initially bound to less qualified jobs.  Automation can also serve humans with natural  restrictions in making their lives more conveni ent and meaningful.   3.2 Encourage automation of dangerous tasks and when humans are put at risk , to ensure safe  working conditions at work. Special efforts should be made to find ways of automating tasks in  which workers are put in danger (e.g. facing accident s, harsh environmental conditions, or long -term  ailments of exposure to harmful substances) even if these are less cost -efficient than using a human  workforce. European institutions  should put efforts to increase awareness of the value of  automation in suc h situations and support organi sations through funding of special projects, aiming  to avoid menial jobs and dangerous working conditions.   3.3 Apply a process of representation, consultation and, where possible, co -creation , where workers  are involved in the di scussion around AI production, deployment or procurement process in order to  ensure that the systems are useable and that the worker still has sufficient autonomy and control,  fulfilment and job satisfaction. This implies informing and consulting workers w hen developing or  deploying AI, as set out in the existing texts adopted by the European institutions and the social  partners.13 Workers (not only employees but also independent contractors) should be involved in  discussions around the development, deployme nt or procurement of algorithmic scheduling and  work distribution systems, to ensure compliance with health and safety legislation, data policy,  working time legislation and work -life balance legislation. Social dialogue plays a key role to enable  this.   3.4 Map value chains in Europe and engage in horizon scanning to gain an understanding of which  skills will become less relevant, and which ones will be more in demand or at risk of shortage.  This  can enable a more targeted policy to help workers transition betw een jobs or acquire necessary new  skills , to incentivize organisations to conduct such mapping at organisational level, to anticipate the  new ski lls that their workers may need, and to foster the development of those skills in a timely  manner.   3.5 Establish a  full-fledged European transition fund to help managing the AI transformation in a  socially responsible way. This can be aligned with the process of reinforcing the European  Globalisation Adjustment Fund.    LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND  4. The benefits of AI should be s hared with all parts of society, leaving no one behind. This is also in line with  the Agenda 2030, and should be actively pursued by the EU and Member States.   4.1 Introduce a duty of care for developers of consumer -oriented AI systems to ensure that these can   be used by all intended users, fostering a universal design approach , and do not lead to the  exclusion of users with disabilities, particularly when used in public services. More generally, AI  developers should be incentivised to adopt a universal design approach to AI, which entails  considering the benefits and concerns relating to all societal groups, such as the elderly, children,                                                              13  See for instance Articles 151 and following of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, dealing with social p olicy.

  14   people with disabilities and other groups at risks of exclusion such as migrants, people living in  remote areas and people l iving in poverty.   4.2 Encourage the development of AI tools and applications that are specifically targeted to help  vulnerable demographics , for instance through the organisation of open challenges or competitions.  Resources should be devoted to yearly “AI fo r good” prizes, which reward the efforts to address key  societal challenges, thereby tackling inequalities and ensuring that AI is deployed also to tackle  problems which are experienced by a minority of the users, and are therefore seldom addressed by  the market. AI should be developed with due regard to all grounds that are protected from  discrimination in EU law, which also includes – as well as some of the grounds listed above – the  prohibition of discrimination on the ground of sex.14   4.3 Establish a Europe an Strategy for Better and Safer AI for Children , in line with the European  Strategy for a Better Internet for Children, designed to empower children, while also protecting  them from risks and potential harm. The integrity and agency of future generations should be  ensured by providing Europe’s children with a childhood where they can grow and learn untouched  by unsolicited monitoring, profiling and interest invested habitualisation and manipulation. Children  should be ensured a free and unmonitored space o f development and upon moving into adulthood  should be provided with a “clean slate” of any public or private storage of data related to them.15  Equally, children’s formal education should be free from commercial and other interests.    MEASURE AND MONITOR T HE SOCIETAL IMPACT OF AI 5. We need to understand the possibilities and limitations of AI systems as a means to build the future we  want, and the impact they have on individuals and society – not only in the short but also in the long term.    5.1 Encourage research  and development on the impact of AI on individuals and society , including the  impact on jobs and work, social systems and structures, equality, democracy, fundamental rights,  the rule of law, human intelligence, the development of (cognitive skills of) ch ildren. Encourage  conducting an evaluation of the societal impact of AI as a requirement in AI research and  development in parallel with funding for the  development of a particular AI system .  5.2 Support research and the development of tools to enable independ ent testing of AI systems by civil  society organisations and other independent parties to inform individuals  about the most  trustworthy AI solutions in the market or used by public service providers .  5.3 Establish monitoring mechanisms at national and EU level  to continuously analyse, measure and  score the societal impact of AI.  This can help us keep  track of the positive and negative impact of AI  on society and enable us to adapt or redirect strategies and policies on a continuous basis. A variety  of indices c an be considered to measure and score AI’s societal impact such as the UN Sustainable  Development Goals and the Social Scoreboard Indicators of the European Social Pillar. The EU  statistical program me of Eurostat, as well as other relevant EU Agencies, sho uld be included in this  mechanism to ensure that the information generated is trusted, of high and verifiable quality,  sustainable and continuously available. AI -based solutions can help the monitoring and measuring  its societal impact.                                                               14  See in this regard also Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union: Any discrimination based on  any ground such as sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic features, la nguage, religion or belief, political or any  other opinion, membership of a national minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation shall be prohibited.    15  This does  not exclude the possibility for approp riate  exceptions that are necessary in a democratic society and in full  complianc e with fundamental rights .  
  15   B. Transforming Euro pe's Private Sector    Despite the sizeable impact that European businesses expect from A I, only a small  fraction of them use AI actively in industrial and commercial operations. This is  particularly visible among small and medium enterprises  (SMEs)  that mak e up over  99% of Europe’s businesses .16 Furthermore, s ince SME s account for 56% of Europe's total turnover, it is  likewise  important that larger companies in Europe accelerate their transformation.17 In 2018 , three  quarters of European businesses did not ad opt AI in any shape or form, just under a single quarter were in  piloting and testing phases and reported difficulties of scaling, and only 2 -3% of companies incorporated  AI across their whole organisation.18 A multi -stakeholder approach, bringing all actor s around the table to  join forces, is crucial to  foster sectoral AI ecosystems where most of the transformative power of AI and  sustainable growth is expected.    BOOST THE UPTAKE OF AI TECHNOLOGY AND SERVI CES ACROSS SECTORS IN EUROPE  6. The adoption of AI is an  important part of the digitalisation wave that European industries need to  undertake in order to adapt themselves to the demands of the rapidly evolving digital economy. Policy makers should foster their transformation, with particular attention to SMEs  who form the  important   foundation  of European economy . The uptake and acceleration of AI should happen both on the supply  and demand side, through enabling policy and investment mechanisms.   6.1 Earmark significant resources in the InvestEU programme to support the transformation of  European enterprises towards AI -enabled solutions.  Such funding should be made available for  companies of all sizes and in all sectors, and should focus on  the uptake and incorporation of  Trustworthy AI solutions .   6.2 Create an easy ave nue for start -ups and SMEs to funding  and advice . InvestEU, the European  Innovation Council and other programmes, together with t he network of Digital Innovation Hubs,   should particularly help  SMEs to define their AI transition plan and needs, propose attr active loans  to finance their transformation, temporarily support the salaries of AI specialists to recruit, as well as  financially supporting the re - or up -skilling of the workforce that is at risk of losing jobs or in need of  a significant transformation  of their jobs due to AI. This should also include support and advice on  investment plans and intellectual property rights  management.   6.3 Foster the availability of legal and technical support to implement  Trustworthy AI solutions that  comply with the Ethics Guidelines . The network of Digital Innovation Hubs should be exploited in  this context , particularly to provide technical know -how to smaller companies who do not have the  availability of sufficient resources and expertise for this purpose.    6.4 Encourage com panies to form partnerships with training program mes addressing all levels of AI  training  (from data preparation technicians up to PhD level AI specialists), to ensure that the  content of the program mes combine state -of-the-art science and technology with practical aspects  of AI -enabler industrial systems (e.g. development and test methods, impleme ntation and scaling,  economics), to attract people with new skills , and to reskill their workforce  so as to  enable them to                                                              16  For more information, see the European Commission's latest annual report on SME's  (2017 -2018), accessible at  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/business -friendly -environment/performance -review_en .  17  See Eurostat statistics on small and m edium -sized enterprises' total turnover in the EU.    18  See for instance Artificial Intelligence in Europe, Outlook for 2019 and Beyond, EY (2018); PwC's Global Artificial Intelligence  Study: Exploiting the AI Revolution (2017) , and Artificial Intelligen ce Innovation Report, Deloitte (2018) .  
  16   work with AI systems. Incentivise priva te companies to invest in the re - and up -skilling of their  existing workforce, for instance through the above -mentioned partnerships.    FOSTER AND S CALE AI SOLUTIONS BY ENABLIN G INNOVATION  AND  PROMOTING TECHNOLOGY  TRANSFER  7. Next to university and institutio nal research, industrial research also plays a key role in fostering AI  innovation, especially with regard to the transfer of technology into the market economy to the benefit of  consumer s or business users. Such innovation should be incentivi sed, for inst ance by establishing  competitions,  creating recognised standards and encourage open access on FRAND terms  (fair, reasonable  and non -discriminatory)  to facilitate technology transfer.  This can be achieved by increasing support for  the emergence and growth o f companies that provide AI enablers and solutions, or that necessitate new  technology and skills to transform. This includes start -ups and scale -ups, SMEs and larger companies, as  well as sector -specific ecosystems.  The emergence and growth of AI companie s in Europe producing and  exporting high -tech products, and competing on a global scale  should be supported . Particular attention  should be given to Europe's strong position in the B2B segment, which contributes a significant part of  the  industrial value i n Europe .19   7.1. Boost the development and growth of AI technology firms in Europe through the InvestEU  programme.  Those companies can also help drive  the transformation of non -tech companies by  supplying AI -enabled goods and services enabling efficiency gains and growth. Such funding should  cover all stages of investments (from seed money for start -ups to larger scale A or B series  investment , including growth investment ) and enable Trustworthy AI solutions . In addition to  fostering purely software -developing A I companies, we should also encourage  SMEs that develop  and manufacture AI -enabled hardware.   7.2. Facilitate the transition of AI solutions from research  labs to testing environments and to  commercial market s. Spin -offs from AI research labs should be encourag ed in order to enable open  innovation and create a market of AI technology firms as well as create an attractive European AI  brand for talents outside academia . Guidance should be provided to ensure the participation of  industry in research collaborations and R&D -based innovation more generally without undermining  intellectual property rights, market competition and opportunities for global cooperation .   7.3. Create an EU -wide network of AI business incubators that connect academia and industry . This  could be co upled with the creation of EU -wide Open Innovation Labs, which could be built further  on the structure of the Digital Innovation Hub network.    7.4. Stimulate beneficial innovation by funding EU hackathons, competitions and industry challenge driven research mis sions in AI across various sectors. This component should be strengthened in  the Horizon Europe programme. Priority may be considered to research challenges, data and  applications in B2B and P2C markets where Europe has a competitive edge to scale Trustwor thy AI,  and where disruptive changes could be created through substantial research efforts. In B2C  segments, such competitions can also be steered towards applications ensuring a universal design  approach and accessibility, and the development of AI produc ts and services for creating social  good. Such initiatives may act as strong attractors of top talents from Europe and around the world,  and should be financed by substantial public funding (jointly by the European Commission and  Member States), also with significant support by the industry.                                                               19  See Notes from the AI Frontier: Modelling the Impact of AI on the World Economy, McKinsey Global Instit ute, 2018.  
  17     SET UP PUBLIC -PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS  TO FOSTER SECTORAL AI ECOSYSTEMS  8. Individual companies form the nucleus of the economy. However, the biggest macro -economic impact is  realised through economic networks or ecosystems. T hese ecosystems are comprised of different  stakeholders, including companies of different types and sizes (end -user facing and subcontracting  compa nies, start -ups, scale ups, SME s, large companies) but also research institutions bringing latest  innovation from lab to market, as well as the public sector (both as market actor and as policy -maker). We  recommend that the uptake and scaling of AI systems in Europe be analysed and encouraged within  the  context of “enabling AI ecosystems”.20 This needs to occur on  a sectoral basis to gain a sufficiently  granular understanding of the specific needs and challenges raised within the ecosystem.   8.1 In the short term, conduct a sectoral -based in-depth  analysis of several selected AI ecosystems.   Identify the opportunities a nd challenges in those sectors in terms of beneficial impact that can be  achieved with AI (for humans and society, private sector players, public sector players and in  research) and identify the requirements  to enable those opportunities in terms of data a nd  infrastructure, skills building, governance and regulation as well as funding and investment. We  propose to start this analysis in the second half of 2019 to better understand the specific needs of  these sectoral AI  eco-systems and to derive targeted re commendations both in terms of impacts to  be achieved and enablers to be put in place.    8.2 In the medium term, set up Sectoral Multi-Stakeholder Alliances (SMUHA s) for strategic sectors in  Europe to build their AI ecosystems with the relevant stakeholders.  These Alliances – similar  to the  concept of Public Private Partnerships or P PPs – should  bring together industry, research and  academia,  the public sector , civil society and user -focused organisations, as well as policy -makers to  conduct a sector -based analy sis of the challenges and opportunities generated by AI systems on a  continuous basis . They should  take concrete actions to meet the sector -specific needs in terms of  targeted policies and enablers to tackle those challenges and opportunities.      C. Europe's  Public Sector as a Catalyst of Sustainable Growth and Innovation    Europe has a strong public sector that can play a significant role when it comes to  the uptake and scaling of Trustworthy AI and establishing  a Single Market for  Trustworthy AI in Europe . The EU’s commitment towards the modernisation of  public administrations was already confirmed by the Ministerial Declaration on e Government adopted in Tallinn on 6 October 2017.21 Deploying AI systems can help  governments make better evidence -based policy -making decisions, deliver better  services to individuals, groups and organisations by reducing internal costs,                                                              20  Enabling AI ecosystems can be viewed as “ collaborative arrangements through which firms combine their individual  offerings into a coherent, customer -facing solutions ”. See R. Adner , Match Your Innovation Strategy to Your Innovation  Ecosystem,  Harvard Business Review 2006. Ecosystems function conceptually as a means to understand the relationships  between different organisations or parties that share a common motive, technology, platform or knowledge base. The AI  ecosystem members are likely to  have developed and deployed AI technology in different ways, to different extents and for  different purposes.   21  Ministers in charge of e -Government policy from 32 countries of the European Union (EU) and the European Free Trade  Area (EFTA) unanimously co mmitted to the vision laid out in the EU e -Government Action Plan 2016 -2020 and in the new  European Interoperability Framework that public administrations and public institutions in the EU should be open, efficient  and inclusive, providing borderless, inte roperable, personalised, user -friendly, end -to-end digital public services to all  citizens and businesses – at all levels of public administration. See https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single market/en/news/ministerial -declaration -egovernment -tallinn -declarati on. 
  18   increasing program me effectiveness, and enhance  quality.22 This should not lead to a lower quality of   human relationships within public services  or a reduction of such services ; the very purpose of the  contribution of AI systems in the public sector is to be human -centric, and lies in the facilitation of the  tasks of civil servants to ensure better services to individuals .   Public services are critic al to the relationship between the state and  citizens, groups and individuals.   AI  has the potential to play a significant role in improving the quality and efficiency of public services,  including empowering  public servants, for example, through improving  the accessibility and availability of  information  concerning public services.   Given the capacity  of AI  services  to operate at scale , at a highly  granular level that can infer highly intimate information about individuals, these systems must  be aligned  with the concept of Trustworthy AI. For instanc e, the develop ment  and deploy ment  of those systems  should occur  in a transparent and accountable manner , to ensure that they operate in ways that are  consistent with the principles of good administration, respec t for fundamental rights, democracy and the  rule of law . More generally, governments have the crucial task to safeguard individuals' fundamental  rights,  to protect them from harmful uses of AI, and to protect  the integrity of public institutions.   Today, t he most advanced governments are increasingly providing application programming interfaces  (APIs) to trusted intermediaries as a way to open up their infrastructure to private sector services and  entrepreneurs, taking the role of Government -as-a-Platform ( GaaP) .23 In this manner, the public sector  can act as a catalyser for AI development in Europe. Through its role as a procurer, the public sector can  also make use of public procurement strategies to not only incentivi se the development and responsible   innovation of AI  systems for the public good, but also to promote responsible innovation and ensure such  systems are trustworthy.    PROVIDE HUMAN -CENTRIC AI-BASED SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS  9. 9.1 Deliver on the Tallinn Declaration on e -Government24 and put mechanisms in place to  provide  borderless , interoperable, personalised, user -friendly, and end -to-end digital public services to all  individuals and businesses – at all levels of public administration . Consider adopting a proactive  model for the delivery of public services for par ticular contexts and services in which they might  enhance the effectiveness and quality of public services whilst ensuring due respect for fundamental  rights and the rule of law .25   9.2 Where an AI-based service does not run properly or when an individual so re quests,  he or she  should be able to interact with a human interlocutor , when there is a significant impact on the  individual .   9.3 Set up a single point of contact for individuals , for example  by d eploying natural user interfaces  that can redirect individuals to the sought after information or service  in an easily accessible                                                              22  A good example is the European interoperability framework 2016 -2020, but also the GOV.UK platform developed in the  United Kingdom, the “building blocks” model trialled by the European Commission by DG DIGIT and the Estonian X -Road  platform, which ev en moved in the direction of a decentralized architecture. In the US, for instance, Deloitte considers that  “automation could save 96.7 million federal hours annually, with potential savings of $3.3 billion; at the high end, this ris es  to 1.2 billion hours  and potential annual savings of $41.1 billion”. However,  the main objective is not to make savings by  cutting jobs in public services.    23  O’Reilly, 2010, available at: http://c himera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000000774/ch02.html .  24  See footnote 2 1 above.   25   In Finland, the Aurora project which aims to bring such proactive services to currently undergoing a piloting phase, and the  Finnish parliament has recently approved a la w about the secondary use of data that contains the collection and  combination of data for such purposes.  
  19   manner.26 Public services should invest in c onversational user interfaces that can meet the needs of  individuals 24/7, serving them in a more agile, accessible and faster way, from a single point of  contact . This could for instance be done through the use of chatbots or natural language interfaces   with multilingual support, that can help individuals by redirecting them to the information or service  that they seek , and that could also simplify  the filling in of forms in a conversational manner.  Feedback mechanisms that allow users to share their comments on the interface s and thus help   improv ing their AI models  should be developed. Moreover, it must  be ensured that such AI -enabled  services are  trustworthy, i.e.  legal, ethical and robust.   9.4 Develop tools to ensure that public services can be deployed for all, and  in a manner that  safeguards individuals’ fundamental rights , democracy and the rule of law . Access to public  services through natural in terfaces should be ensured for the entire population, regardless of  capability (bearing in mind for instance the potential hurdle for the elderly to interact with those  interfaces) or economic cla ss. This also implies ensuring easy access for all to the in ternet, which  today is still not a reality.27 Moreover, individuals should always  also be given the option to revert to  a human interlocutor  based on the principle of good administration .28 Given the fact that some  individuals may be unable to access or make  use of AI -based digital services , there should be an  option to revert to a human interlocutor.29 Finally, it should be ensured that those services are  provided without creating records of the request  at an individual -identifiable level , and in a manner  ensuring individuals'  privacy.    APPROACH THE GOVERNMENT AS A PLATFORM , CATALYSING AI DEVELOPMENT IN EUROPE  10. 10.1 Foster digitalisation by transforming public data into a digital format  and continue collecting data  that can be used to evaluate and improve public serv ices as well as to develop new AI -based  solutions. In case it concerns personal data, it should be ensured this happens in a manner that  complies  with privacy, data protection rules  and other fundamental rights .  10.2 Provide data literacy education to governmen t agencies . Public servants need to be educated on  what data to prioritise, how it should be handled by prioritising quality, how to process it in a  manner complying with relevant privacy and data protection rules, and how it can be used to boost  competiti veness with data across industries in Europe   10.3 Create European large annotated public non -personal databases for high quality AI  that are  reliable and trustworthy. These should be accessible by legitimate stakeholders, including  companies , civil society orga nisations  and research institutes  in Europe  to develop and train AI  solutions. Such non-personal data sets can not only help fostering AI development, but can also offer  a remedy against false news by helping to preserve access to correct information. Fost er the  development of standards for interoperability of public applications and public data reservoirs.30  10.4 For procurement contract s on public services  between a public sector organisation and a company,  consider introducing a requirement  that data produced in that context which does not infringe the                                                              26  The most commonly seen single point of contact for services is the information gateway eesti.ee of the Estonian  government and can serve as a best  practice example.   27  In this regard, it should be explored whether the role of public libraries could be exploited, turning them into as civil cen tres  providing Internet access and staff helping people to use public digital services.   28  Following also the  model of Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.   29  This is particularly important given that 44% of European citizens between 16 and 74 years do not have basic digital skills.  See the European Commission Factsheet of Octob er 2017 on Digital Skills, accessible at:  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/sites/beta -political/files/digital -skills -factsheet -tallinn_en.pdf .  30  In this regard, the X -road protocol of the Estonian government can be considered as a best practice.  
  20   private company ’s IP and which is of general public interest should be handed back to the public  sector  allowing its reuse  for beneficial innovation or build ing better services  in full compliance with   fundamental  rights, the rule of law and democracy .   MAKE STRATEGIC USE OF  PUBLIC PROCUREMENT T O FUND INNOVATION AN D ENSURE TRUSTWORTHY  AI 11. 11.1 Within public procurement processes, allocate substantive funding  to innovation -driven , AI-based   solutions. This could function as  a public sector  instrument to fund innovative solutions, including  AI-based  solutions , created by start -ups, SMEs, scale -ups and larger companies.   11.2 Within procurement processes, ensure that potential risks of the use of AI by the government are  identified,  assessed and appropriately addressed . In order to safeguard individuals from risks , such  as for instance  privacy and personal data  infringements , this could  be done by mandatorily  consulting the relevant  authorities  (including data protection authorities)  prior to the procurement  of AI systems , particularly  in those contexts where there can be a significant impact on individuals’  rights .  11.3 Introduce clear eligibility and selection criteria that in the procurement rules and processes of EU  institutions, agenc ies and Member States that require AI systems to be trustworthy  (lawful, ethical  and robust), ensuring that they effectively protect people’s personal data, privacy  and autonomy .  The Ethics Guidelines’ assessment list can provide a helpful means to operati onalise such  requirement.    SAFEGUARD FUNDAMENTAL  RIGHTS IN AI-BASED PUBLIC SERVICE S AND PROTECT SOCIET AL INFRASTRUCTURES  12. Methods should  be created to validate whether the government’s decisions that rely on data -driven  systems were biased against individua ls comp ared to other similar decisions, given that a ccess to one’s  own personal data is not enough to ensure the analysis of fair and just decisions that are in accordance  with legal standards.    12.1 Ensure the a pplication  of the Ethics Guidelines for Trustwor thy AI to AI systems deployed by the  public sector .   12.2 Make available to any individual who is subject to an AI -informed governmental decision that  produces legal effects or similarly significantly affects that individual, information on the logic of  the alg orithms and how data is used to inform such decisions, enabling the affected individual to  understand, evaluate and potentially challenge the decision.  Individuals should also receive an  explanation about how each specific decision about them was reached, regardless of whether or not  it was based on his or her personal data. Reference can also be made to the existing access to  documents and information obligations resting upon authorities at national and European level   12.3 Fund  and facilitate  the d evelop ment of  AI tools that can assist in detecting biases and undue  prejudice in governm ental decision -making . Those tools  could be made available to civil society  organisations, NGOs, individuals and other interested parties that are questioning the integrity of  public  governance or are searching for support and evidence  to challenge certain  policies.   12.4 Ban AI -enabled mass scale scoring  of individuals  as defined in our Ethics Guidelines , and set very  clear and strict rules for surveillance for national security purposes and other purp oses claimed to be  in the public or national interest in line with EU regulation and case law. Develop trustworthy ways  to do this where legal, necessary and proportionate, and ensure that this is not used in ways to  suppress or undermine (political) oppos ition or democratic processes.     
  21   D. Ensuring World -Class Research Capabilities    Europe must aim for scientific AI leadership, by focusing the power of its multi faceted and distributed research excellence with several worldwide renowned  Centres of Excellenc e to establish and demonstrate its intellectual and commercial  leadership in AI. B oth purpose -driven and fundamental research in all aspects of AI  must be secured in order to promote AI that is trustworthy and to address relevant  scientific,  ethical,  socio cultural and industrial challenges.  In particular,  research and innovation on AI that address  complementarity between AI systems and humans , that foster Trustworthy AI solutions  and that address  societal challenges  should be promoted. The overarching goal is to ensure world -class research that  contributes to Europe’s sustainability, growth and competitiveness, and inclusion, leading to individual  and societal well -being. This necessitates a European research community  that can  unite through strong   collabora tion, and that can join forces with industry and society at large to build on  European research  strengths  and enhance Europe's well -being .    DEVELOP A ND MAINTAIN  A EUROPEAN STRATEGIC RE SEARCH ROADMAP FOR AI 13. Based on its strong basic and applied research rec ord, Europe needs to develop a n ambitious  strategic  research roadmap for AI , including an action plan to implement it .   13.1 The roadmap should include major open disciplinary and interdisciplinary fundamental scientific  questions  and grand challenge s of global  relevance , as well as major industrial and societal  challenges where AI can be an enabler or a significant part of the solution . While basic research  has a more  general  focus , the research needed to address industrial and societal challenges is mainly  dom ain specific. Examples of important human -centric application domains especially beneficial to  European society are the future of health, work, mobility and industry.   13.2 The roadmap should focus on areas of  strategic value  and opportunities , including the  embodiment of AI into cyber -physical -systems and robotics,  designing AI algorithms for chips to be  deployed in the Internet of Things (I oT), the integration of reasoning and learning  (or hybrid AI) to  achieve learning systems that facilitate reas oning and explanation , resource aware learning even  from  small data sets, enabling digital twins  and continuous learning , as well as techniques  to enable  Trustworthy AI .  13.3 The roadmap should in particular foster research that can help ensuring AI solutions that meet t he  Trustworthy AI principles and requirements , enabling for instance requirements such as human  oversight, privacy -by-design, robustness, non -discrimination and transparency (including the  traceability and explainability of AI systems). The roadmap should identify potential breakthrough  findings and technologies that could come in the form of grand challenges of AI. Strategic  breakthroughs should subsequently be translated into practice , allowing  Europe to strengthen its  competitive capacities.   13.4 The roadmap should be developed and regularly updated  based on new developments in research  and technology  through a bottom -up process that complements the top -down policy -driven  approach of governments  and through stakeholder consultation . This roadmap also needs to  identify impact in industry and society, and should harmonise and complement AI research  roadmaps developed by Member States and other organisations.   13.5 While ensuring scientific independence, t he roadmap should ensure for the needs and concerns of  individua ls through engagement with civil society representatives.   
  22    INCREASE AND STREAMLI NE FUNDING FOR FUNDA MENTAL AND PURPOSE -DRIVEN RESEARCH  14. 14.1 Provide dedicated, significant and long -term research funding for both fundamental and purpose driven research  on AI to m aintain competitiveness of European research  and companies , and  to  address relevant societal and industrial challenges. The funding should be aligned with the European   AI research roadmap and should be independent of, and parallel to, any funding program me on ICT.  Significant investment in basic funding is required to achieve adequate research independence ,  which is  necessary for fundamental excellent research in AI.   14.2 Create incentives and support for interdisciplinary and multi -stakeholder research for example  through large -scale challenge -driven research missions.  While striving for technological leadership,  ensure the involvement of social scientists, humanities scholars, as well as other interdisciplinary  collaborations in European AI research projects. Increase perm eability between disciplinary silos at  universities and research institutions by easing admission to existing program mes and curricula from  other disciplines and by establishing inter -disciplinary AI curricula  and PhD programmes . Foster the  involve ment of civil society in AI research programme  design and in projects (e.g. through citizen  science) where appropriate.   14.3 Simplify and streamline the structure of research funding instruments . Reduce the overhead in  efforts and time to decisions of applying for grants, for example through early reviews from  abstract -sized submissions; improve the quality and consistency of proposal reviews, and increase  the predictability of funding instruments and their timing to support long -term planning, using the  Europea n AI research roadmap .  14.4 Establish mixed academic -industrial transfer labs, mainly funded by industry, providing specific  research for the companies while also providing funding for long -term open research and  collaboration in the broader research area. The bridge between fundamental research and the  application of its results in European organisations and on the market needs to be shortened.  Specifically f unded transfer projects are essential to achieve this objective.  European AI research  centres located in  industrial environments should also be strengthened to create sufficient traction  for building and growing the European AI start -ups ecosystem that c an help commercialising cutting edge research and technology.   14.5 Initiatives funded by the Horizon Europe and  Digital Europe programmes related to AI should build  in safeguards and conditions to ensure that public funding of these projects benefits the public  interest. The funding should in particular support  AI solutions that are in line with the Ethics  Guidelin es, and help fostering innovation in Trustworthy AI solutions. Funding of public research  should be fully transparent, also taking into account indirect funding by interested parties through  proxies.  Whilst safeguarding scientific independence, civil socie ty should be engaged in the  management of the programmes, both at agenda setting level and at implementing or monitoring  level. Enhanced trust in AI systems  can be fostered by systematically including societal needs and  concerns related to AI systems in th e design and implementation phase of the respective EU  research and funding programmes , such as Horizon Europe and Digital Europe , and the projects that  will be funded thereunder.    EXPAND AI RESEARCH CAPACITY IN  EUROPE BY DEVELOPING , RETAINI NG AND ACQU IRING AI RESEARCHERS  15. To facilitate world -class research, we need to create a stimulating and empowering research environment  in Europe which attracts and retains researchers in AI. Research career prospects should be rich in  opportunity and competitive to retain and attract international AI talent. Young researchers, in particular, 
  23   have to feel that Europe is where exciting, future -proof, sustainable, ethically aligned, and trustworthy AI  is developed, and where an inspiring and fulfilling public or private  research career is possible.   15.1 Acknowledge that a holistic strategy is needed to create the conditions for talents to find Europe  attractive as a research environment,  such as the availability of lively and vibrant research  environments, stable  and long -term funding, a critical mass of excellent researchers, competitive  salaries, world -class  infrastructure with unique data sets, competitive computing power and  dedicated engineering support .  15.2 The work environment should offer collaboration between researchers and start -ups, larger  companie s and organisations, as well as  society at large , encouraging researchers in academia to  collaborate with industry and the public sector (e.g. through consultancy arrangements or  secondments) , including the possibility of split -time position s.  15.3 Create an open innovation culture through a lively , interdisciplinary and multi disciplinary research  environment around world -class research centres . Enable and foster the creation of research focused start -ups that develop translate and commercialise  new AI products in Europe or can inject  AI technology into existing products and services.  Collaboration between research institutes and  such start -ups should be enabled.    BUILD  A WORLD -CLASS EUROPEAN RESEARCH CAPACITY  16. The European AI research community is based on distributed AI smaller research centres and laboratories  widely spread across Europe, each with respective strengths ranging from speciali sed research and  innovation domains up to large -scale and broad international regions. They engage in cu tting -edge basic  and applied research, connecting with local and international industrial and start -up partners and in  particular, they attract young talents to  the fiel d of AI very early  on. Europe is already home to a number  of large centres of critical mass and high re putation (also embedded in international industrial  ecosystems), which we refer to as Centres of Excellence (CoE s).  The full strength and diversity of Europe’s AI community must be working together to address major  grand challenges as well as scientific an d technical breakthroughs. This requires a series of major capacity  building initia tives. Such initiatives need to  involve multi - and interdisciplinary expertise , connect and  further develop existing Centres of Excellence, strengthen smaller research cent res and laboratories to  become Centres of Excellence, and provide specialised infrastructure for AI. This capacity should be  balanced between distributed, local research and large -scale pan -European initiatives.   16.1 Strengthen and create additional Centres of Excellence (CoEs) that address strategic research  topics and become a European level multiplier for a specific AI topic.  These CoEs should receive  specific funding in order to create a significant international impact in their areas of research,  technology t ransfer and innovation. Moreover, while being interdisciplinary, these CoEs should have  their own specific research focus.   16.2 Nurture and support Europe’s AI research centres and laboratories through research funding to  scale up to worldwide competition and h elp them strive to become Centres of Excellence.  Such  support includes specific fundamental and purpose -driven funding programmes, research professor  funding, access to mechanisms to grow and the possibility to attract researchers of world -class  quality an d reputation.   16.3 EU institutions together with Member States should also create and fund networks consisting of AI  Centres of Excellence, as well as smaller AI research centres and laboratories.  These networks  should form thematic focal points for AI research , attracting the top talents in their respective focus 
  24   areas with exciting research challenges and top infrastructure and support. Networks of centres with  critical mass have a high potential to not only produce significant research results but to also cre ate  impact well beyond academic research.   16.4 Develop close collaborations with industry, the innovation ecosystem (e.g. DIH for AI and others)  and other stakeholders that can provide feedback, pick up new results early  on, and provide  important additional fu nding. This collaboration must be based on an appropriate model for  intellectual property rights and sharing of data and ideas.   16.5 Create a dedicated Public -Private Partnership  (PPP)  in AI.  It is critically important that this PPP does  not com promise investme nt in local or Member S tates' initiatives in AI. The private and the public  sector should be equal partners.   16.6 Develop a cross -cutting network focused on Trustworthy AI across European universities and  research institutions. With the Ethics Guidelines publis hed on 8 April 2019, Europe has taken  a  strong initiative to lead  the global debate on the applied ethics of AI. Consideration should be given  to support the development of a Centre of Excellence in Trustworthy AI to maintain Europe's  intellectual leadersh ip. The political institutions and the AI industry urgently need such word -class  experts for newly emerging technology, legal, ethical and social issues, focusing in particular on the  framework for Trustworthy AI put forward in the Ethics Guidelines. A cro ss-cutting network will  provide a basis for research, teaching and dissemi nating  AI ethics and other disciplines necessary to  ensure Trustworthy AI across the whole European system.31 It will support the coordination of  activities relating to AI ethics and other  relevant disciplines, which involve offering continuously  updated curricula on these disciplines at all European universities . It also involves dissemination of  research result s to the wider public or organis ing public debates for civil society.  To cover the multi -  and interdisciplinary nature of AI research, the network should not become "siloed " but involve and  integrate the technical, practical, philosophical,  legal,  economic, social and humanistic aspects of AI  in various proportions depending on the ir specific research focus.                                                                  31  The European University Association (which represents more than 800 universities and national rectors’ conferences in 48  European countries) estima tes that 720 professorial chairs in applied ethics will be needed for the network.  
  25          CHAPTER II  LEVERAGING EUROPE ’S ENABLERS FOR  TRUSTWORTHY AI                     
  26   CHAPTER II. LEVERAGING EUROPE 'S ENABLERS FOR TRUSTWORTHY AI  To achieve the impacts defined for each of the areas highlighted in Chapter I, the right fo undation need s  to be in place. Our foundational layer is described in terms of four enable rs: (E) Data and Infrastructure,   (F) Education and Skills,  (G) a Gove rnance and Regulatory framework  and (H) Funding and Investment.   (E) Fostering the development and  uptake of Trustworthy AI requires the availability of  data and a sound  infrastructure. This includes intense -computing infrastructure to enable the scale -out of Europe’s AI  ambition, both concerning  digital AI segments and physical segments embedded with  digital components.  Edge computing provides a particularly interesting platform for scaling AI in a communications -efficient  manner , which has many privacy -preserving advantages. Moreover, given that d ata is an indispensable  raw material for developing AI , a safe, secure and high -quality infrastructure is needed that allows for the  use and exchange of industrial and public data in a lawful, ethical and robust manner . Data donor schemes  could be put in place to foster socially beneficial AI systems built on personal data, with the highest  attention to privacy and data protection rules. Besides ensuring the necessary physical infrastructures,  Europe should build a cloud infrastructure that can support the development and deployment of  Trustworthy AI, and a ppropriate cybersecurity policies and expertise.   (F) Europe must invest in the development of human capital for artificial intelligence, fostering the  necessary skills and education in an AI-enabled world. We must educate and develop the best scientific  minds in AI, which requires a significant increase in the uptake of science and technology subjects at every  level of the education system, and a substantial redesign of education systems from pre -school to higher  education.  Conscious and well -informed child ren and  other  individuals will create a solid foundation  for  responsible and positive use s of AI systems and digital technologie s more generally , and strengthen  their  personal skills on cognitive, social and cultural levels. A doubling -down of efforts is needed to increase the  number and proportion of women in science and technology . This will  not only increase the available  talent pool , but also foster the relevance and quality of research and innovation of AI systems for society  as a whole. Finally, initiatives mu st be supported for upskilling and reskilling significant parts of the  current workforce to provide them with the appropriate knowledge, skills, and attitudes in a transforming  employment environment.   (G) Europe takes pride in its sound regulatory environm ent that enables and stimulates competition and  innovation while safeguarding fundamental rights and protection from unacceptable risk or harm. Yet , the  new challenges raised by AI require reflection on an appropriate governance framework and a review of  the adequacy of the current regulatory regime , pursuant to a comprehensive mapping of relevant EU  regulations and potential legal gaps to both maximise AI’s benefits and prevent and minimise its risks.  Such a review should generally be based on a risk -based approach to AI policy -making, and take into  account both individual and societal risks. For unacceptable risks, the revision of existing rules or the  introduction of new regulation should be considered. Finally, to achieve the impacts put forward in these  recommendations , it is crucial to deliver on a European Single Market for AI.   (H) Europe an Institutions and  Member States, together with the private sector , must create a  lucrative  funding and investment climate for Trustworthy AI in Europe.  Europe currently underperfor ms in terms  of early stage  innovat ion funding , as well as in investments in digital technologies and AI more generally . A  concerted and integrated effort is needed to ensure that Europe can deliver on the benefits that AI can  bring to individuals and so ciety , requiring a full range of public funding mechanisms to be in place, and  openness towards global competition. Besides foreseeing funding for the recommendations set out in this  report, Europe  must build an environment of trust whereby the private sec tor, jointly with all  stakeholders, is motivated to invest in AI solutions and build the future that we want  to create .   
  27   E. Building Data and Infrastructure for AI    Europe needs infrastructure s capable of delivering secure, privacy -preserving data  collection and stora ge, intense analytics, next -generation networks and software to  support the development and delivery of AI systems at scale. This requires  investment in infrastructure, data, software and networks.    SUPPORT AI INFRASTRUCTURES ACROS S MEMBER STATES  17. 17.1 Invest in the necessary intense -computing AI architectures capable to scale -out the ambition for AI  in Europe, including distributed clusters (cloud) and edge computing, large RAM and fast  networks.  Such large infrastructures must be supported in DIH networks, inter connected through  high -speed  networks. A number of strategically -focused  infrastructures for simulation of physical  models (digital twin s) may be needed for some applications (manufacturing, automotive, etc.)  where little data is available or too costly to  produce ( e.g. High-Performance Computing ).32  Engineering skills needed to develop and maintain such infrastructures must be developed and  supported.   17.2 A network of testing facilities and sandboxes, with high -speed networks interconnecting them  must be organi sed with appropriate governance mechanisms to set legal and ethical standards.  AI  Centres of Excellence (CoEs) can enable AI applications to be deployed and tested in “sandboxes”  within well -defined conditions (see also Recommendation 29.2 ).  17.3 Invest in  fund amental and applied research, innovation and industrial capacity building within  edge -based intelligence, empowered by the interplay of hardware, software and AI capabilities.   The increasing demand for connecting “things” and physical infrastructures, powe red by next  generation communication networks (5G) and edge -based compute infrastructure, open up high  market potential for real -time, power efficient and privacy preserving AI where Europe can seize the  opportunity as early adopter and position itself as the global leader for edge intelligence, particularly  serving B2B and P2 C markets. To leverage that, a favourable  policy and investment environment for  5G roll -outs, large investment volumes in software toolchains for edge hardware design, compute  infrastr ucture and distributed AI (also beyond Machine Learning) are needed for creating new  unicorns in Europe, transforming large industries to digital locomotives and securing cutting -edge  research and competence at a global scale. More prospective infrastructu res will be needed in the  longer term, to extend the capabilities of existing infrastructures, such as optical or quantum  computing.   17.4 Liaise with EU actions and funding program mes based on the Electronic Leaders Group  recommendations regarding  dedicated AI co -processor s (edge computing), jointly with digital  microcontrollers initiatives , as well as optical and quantum computing.  Foster the development of  edge computing hardware with the European semiconductor industry. Support the disseminati on,  free of charge, of AI and  IoT hardware and associated software tools towards European universities,  engineering schools and the different start -ups and SMEs ecosystems. Edge computing is not an  alternative to cloud -based AI, but an additional route for AI where Europe can have a c ompetitive  advantage with significant business impact across Europe concerning  the proximity across Europe  with different stakeholders.                                                               32  It is important to keep in mind that the models of HPC and AI applications often are different: HPC is mainly batch -based  with very long run -times while AI applications o ften require interactive sessions with very many but relatively short runs.   
  28    DEVELOP LEGALLY COMPL IANT AND ETHICAL DAT A MANAGEMENT AND SHA RING INITIATIVES IN EUROPE  18. Data is an indispensabl e raw material for developing AI. With data volumes growing at 61% per annum33,  four times more data will be created until 2025 than that which e xists  today. Ensuring that individuals and  societies, industry, the public sector as well as  research and academia in Europ e can benefit from this  strategic resource is critical, as the overwhelming majority of recent advances in AI stem from deep  learning on big data. A safe, secure and high -quality data infrastructure would enable Europe to better   develop and train AI system s, which in turn can be steered towards  applications that can facilitate the  Sustainable Development Goals. A clear distinction must however be ensured  between personal and non personal data.34 A fundamental rights -based personal data infrastructure as put forward in the GDPR  should be fostered and its enforcement should be ensured. At the same time, the sharing of industrial  data  still poses a significant challenge, creating obstacles to collaboration between organisations and, in  some cases, stifling innov ation. Therefore, industrial and research solutions must be found for processing  and sharing data in a secure and privacy -respecting way, allowing everyone to reap its benefits to the  fullest.   18.1 Set up national and European data platforms for AI that includ e all necessary tools for data  governance, annotation, and storage, next -generation networks, analytics software and, most  importantly, dataset s35 through a structural and investment fund.  European public data is currently  found in silos across institutions  and Member States, and should be gathered through secure  platforms that comply with data protection rules. A structural and investment fund for a European  data infrastructure should be considered, and appropriate governance mechanisms should be  establishe d. The Commission should support the coordination of data sharing and access through  ecosystems, and thus leverage data as a competitiveness factor for European innovative and  sustainable companies. Areas of particular focus should be: opening public funde d data sources,  redirecting funding flows to foster collaboration between public and private sector and policies to  address regulatory barriers.   18.2 Consider European data -sharing infrastructures as  public utility infrastructures . Data -sharing  infrastructure s should be seen as the basic  building blocks of a society supported by AI technologies ,  creating trust and paving the way for companies to develop shared, trustworthy and interoperable  data sharing platforms, with due consideration for privacy -, inclusion - and accessibility - by design.   18.3 Support a n EU-wide data repository through common annotation and standardisation. This  requires investment in the development of methods and tools that render datasets comparable and  useable across EU borders. The development o f domain -specific data representation should be  considered, as well as standards specific to particular domains. Standardi sed data and machine  learning parameter schemes can help ensure a common data format tha t allows combining diverse  data sets in the pu blic domain. An EU system for ann otating data sets and standardi sation should be  specifically supported in high impact  domains with particular domain -specific content (such as  employment, manufacturing or health).   18.4 Support research on and development of in dustrial solutions for fast, secure and legally compliant  industry data sharing (e.g. encryption) and stimulate sharing of industry data.  Avoid data                                                              33  See for instance: https://www.networkworld.com/article/3325 397/idc -expect -175-zettabytes -of-data -worldwide -by2025.html .   34  As for instance initiated in Regulation (EU) 2018/1807 on the free flow of non -personal data , applicable since 28 May 2019.   35  This should build on the Directive on the re -use of public sect or information, also known as the ‘PSI Directive’ (Directive  2003/98/EC, which is currently under revision . 
  29   monopolies by supporting companies that contribute to a sustainable ecosystem . Incentives could  be provided  for creating consortia around verticals to share data in a legally compliant manner,  contributing to European infrastructures or datasets, or doing research for improving such  infrastructures. Data -sharing mechanisms should be ethical and in compliance wi th EU data  protection law.   18.5 Foster the creation of trusted data spaces36 for specific sectors  (e.g. healthcare, automotive  and  agri-food) where actors  in a given value chain accept to share data, yet the rights related to the data  rest with end users and/or the stages of the value chain where most of the value is being created.  Industrial policy can help specify sector specific openness and non -discrimination requirements for  access to trusted data spaces, and clarify the conditions under which inter -firm dat a-sharing  cooperation should respect competition rules, particularly  in terms of membership requirements,  type of data shared, and access conditions for third parties. It should also determine how intellectual  property frameworks impact the allocation of property rights within trusted data spaces.   18.6 Develop mechanisms for the protection of personal data, and individuals to control and be  empowered by their data, thereby addressing some aspects of the requirements of trustworthy AI.  Tools should be developed to provide a technological implementation of the GDPR and develop  privacy preserving/privacy by design technical methods to explain criteria, causality in personal data  processing of AI systems (such as federated machine learning). Support technological de velopment  of anonymisation and encryption techniques and develop standards for secure data exchange based  on personal data control. Promote the education of the general public in personal data  management, including individuals' awareness of and empowerment  in AI personal data -based  decision -making processes. Create technology solutions to provide  individuals with information and  control over  how their data is being used, for example  for research, on consent management and  transparency across European borders, as w ell as any improvements and outcomes that have come  from this, and develop standards for secure data exchange based on personal data control.   18.7 Create a data donor scheme, allowing individuals to donate data for specific purposes, surrounded  by clear govern ance and transparency, and safeguards for privacy protection.   18.8 Consider the introduction of a data access regime on FRAND terms , namely fair, reasonable, and  non-discriminatory. In addition, data interoperability amongst mar ket players should be incentivi sed  and required, where appropriate. In specific market circumstances, data accumulation by one or  more firms can raise barriers to entry. In such contexts, data portability rights may not be enough,  and more far -reaching interoperability requirements can he lp promote competition and innovation  by new entrants, while however respecting legal obligations and rights. In contemporary  competition law, interoperability requirements can only be applied on dominant firms upon proof  that data access is indispensable to compete. Yet there may be circumstances in which sector  specific regulatory frameworks should go further, by laying down horizontal interoperability                                                              36  See also Data Trusts: A New Tool for Data Governance, by Nesta and Element AI (2019), available at:  https://hello.elementai.com/rs/024 -OAQ-547/images/Data_Trusts_EN_201914.pdf. Recently, the Canadian government  recognized data trusts, a third party stewardship model, as an “emerging solution” that could provide a secure and privacy enhancing means of sharing data in order to spur the develo pment of AI innovations in a broad spectrum of the economy.  Canada considers that data trusts could allow for greater sharing and use of data for socio -economically beneficial purposes  within a framework that protects against abuses of that data. It consid ers that data trusts could benefit research  communities in areas such as health, clean technology or agri -business, among others. The United Kingdom is itself engaged  in data trust pilot projects. Europe should explore its own initiatives in this area to f acilitate data sharing for research  purposes and foster innovation.  
  30   obligation on both dominant and non -dominant firms to facilitate the emergence of competitive  market str uctures.    SUPPORT EUROPEAN LEADERSHIP I N THE DEVELOPMENT OF  AN AI INFRASTRUCTURE  19. Digital dependency on non -European providers and the lack of a well-performing  cloud infrastructure  respecting European norms and values may bear risks regarding macroeconomic,  economic and security  policy considerations, putting datasets and IP at risk, stifling innovation and commercial development of  hardware and compute infrastructure for connected devices (IoT)  in Europe . Without focusing on Europe  exclusively, we believe i t is important to foster the development of such infrastructure also in Europe.   19.1 Support the development of open source AI software libraries including the Trustworthy AI  guidelines and in line with the latest achievements in research.  By properly supportin g the  development of such AI libraries, building on strong European competence, companies and  researchers will be able to use up -to-date software, offered by software providers  operating in  Europe , providing support and training, which will also help incre asing competitiveness of European  companies in this field. Support dedicated training on such AI software through the AI Digital  Innovation Hub (DIH) network.   19.2 Support mechanisms for cutting -edge research, innovation and commercial development of  hardware a nd compute infrastructure for connected devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) in  Europe. A dedicated budget line in the Digital Europe programme for this purpose could be  considered. Consideration should be given to developing a European champion that c an provide  cloud services with the option to maintain its data sets within Europe. We envisage cases whereby,  for certain types of data, an option to guarantee that the data is stored in Europe might be  appropriate .   DEVELOP AND SUPPORT AI-SPECIFIC CYBER SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE S 20. The AI specific cybersecurity policy should be formulated to be user centric, systemic, and anchored in  open and pluralistic process. User centric cybersecurity policies must protect users’ rights online, by  design and by default. New  attacks appear which directly target the AI module in AI -based applications,  while AI can help fighting cyberattacks.   20.1 Develop an infrastructure for cybersecurity , building  on the Cybersecurity Act adopted by the EU in  spring 2019 to protect our networks, data, and users from risks.  Holistic digital security approaches  should address the risk of malware and vulnerabilities, social engineering, restrictions on the  functionality of network, efforts to weaken the integrity of communications systems, and threat s to  anonymity, privacy, and other human rights exercised online. Develop an ecosystem for producing  AI techniques allowing Member States t o deploy their defence against c yberattacks. We  acknowledge the important role that ENISA has to play in this context .  20.2 Develop user -centric AI cyber security policies to protect users’ rights online.  AI-specific  cybersecurity policy should be formulated to be user -centric, systemic, and anchored in open and  pluralistic process. Cybersecurity policies that focus excessivel y on state operations undermine  international human rights obligations, threaten the peaceful use of the internet, and inhibit the free  flow of and access to information. Fora where cybersecurity policies are formulated should involve  effective participati on of all stakeholders, granting equitable access to documents and decision makers as well as designated opportunities for input and reporting.  
  31   20.3 Adopt holistic digital security approaches to address the risk of malware and vulnerabilities ,  restrictions on t he functionality of network and other efforts to weaken the integrity of our societal  infrastructures.37 This could for instance be done by encouraging EU hackathons and competitions  that can help analysing the penetrability of IoT devices against cyberatta cks. Build inherently robust  systems and respective processes that on top of cyber hygiene requirements also implement  methods and techniques prepared for “unknown unknowns” by monitoring systems behaviour and  applying advanced analytics for better situati onal awareness and response. Close vulnerabilities such  as “paths of least resistance” by focusing on the overall system and on how the system level  security -by-design is implemented. Apply red-teaming, ensuring that the attacks are designed to be  represen tative of what an actual attacker would do, considering the domain specific and generic  features. In some cases, a responsible disclosure of weaknesses should be used to pressure  operators to abandon defective practices (e.g. vulnerabilities that expose co mputer systems).   20.4 Invest in AI -enabled cyber protection systems.  The time for implementing such systems in practice  should be shortened, allowing for efficient monitoring and triage of events, incidents and more  generally the behaviour of various control sy stems. AI techniques can  be used to filter false -positives  and the disruption of services, and provide predictive measures. The notion of zero -day type of  attacks should be extended from the cybersecurity field to the general field of AI -based systems,  with the specifics of intrinsic new types of vulnerabilities and potential target ed areas, such as  training data sets, knowledge bases, algorithms and reasoning mechanisms. Consider repositories for  sharing trusted info about vulnerabilities and exploits in A I systems, similar to those widely used and  supported in the cybersecurity field.   20.5 Beyond safeguarding public infrastructures, ensure that the entire data transmission system is  more secure. Since an increasing amount of data is transferred within IoT netw orks, security  concerns on transmitting sensitive business data across these networks are rising. Traditional IoT  settings, where data is stored and analysed in a centralised cloud or data centre, are also vulnerable  to well -coordinated cyberattacks and po wer outages. This requires a holistic approach towards  electricity and electronic networks that can be spurred by governments.     F. Generating appropriate Skills and Education for AI     The development of AI systems in Europe requires a massive input of human   intelligence. Europe needs more talents to lead ambitious fundamental word -class  research program mes and retain them with attractive research and working  conditions. Therefore, the attraction of talent into the fields of science and  technology is of paramou nt importance to ensure Europe’s innovativeness in the  long run. Furthermore, in the future, AI systems will augment and complement human capabilities in  hybrid work settings. Practitioners in all areas will need to be upskilled with digital competences to  be  enhanced in their roles. At the same time, the future workforce will have to be equipped with a new –  human centric – set of skills that empowers them on a cognitive and a socio -cultural level face the  challenges ahead.                                                               37  Two examples can be put forward in this regard. A first example concerns NotPetya, whereby an estimated $10 Billion of  damages occurred through a combination of “EternaBlue” (a leaked U S NSA penetration tool) and Mimikatz (a proof of  concept to demonstrate security fault by a French security researcher deployed from Russia to Ukraine that spread over the  world and even back to Russia). A second example concerns the life threatening attac k against Schneider’s Triconex  controllers in a petrochemical plant in Saudi Arabia. The attack was diverted, but it was found that instead of just shutting   down the plant or destroying data, it was aimed to trigger an explosion that would have cost lives.   
  32   This will require also a deep -reaching change in education systems. Although skills and education are  domains tha t fall to a large extent under Member States national and often even regional competences,  the European Commission should participate in this effort to trigger these fundament al changes in  national educational systems and support activities to share experiences and best practices and to seize  common opportunities. A wide -ranging and long -term action plan should be carried out, involving actors  at all levels. This calls for the adoption of a multi disciplinary approach that mobili ses various education  and training stakeholders including education institutions at all levels, social partners, trainin g providers,  community colleges  and companies, which will also have to shoulder pa rts of the AI upskilling and  reskilling requirements.    REDESIGN EDUCATION SY STEMS FROM PRE -SCHOOL TO HIGHER EDU CATION  21. As AI is deployed more extensively and more intensely, there will be a strong need to educate everyone,  starting from an early age, in digita l literacy, coding and STEM. Digital literacy is already being  implemented in formal education in various forms as well as in more informa l awareness initiatives across  Member States and in pan -European contexts. These needs to be further supported and dev eloped when  it comes  to AI development. I mportantly, complementary cognitive, socio -cultural and interdisciplinary  skills will empower individuals and enable  the mastery of sectoral knowledge in combination with new  technological solutions. Thus, education s ystems have to prepare people not only with digital skills but  also by strengthening people’s human -centric skills. Here, educators should receive specific attention,  since it is in their hands to prepare for the upcoming challenges. The DigCompEdu38 framework of the  European Commission already provides here a valuable reference frame.   21.1 Set up recommendations and incentives to adapt national education systems to strengthen  children in human -centric key skills : (i) cognitive competences like problem solvin g, process and  quality monitoring, critical thinking, judgement and creativity, etc. (ii) socio -cultural competences  like empathi sing, leading, persuading, envisioning, etc. (iii) entrepreneurial and innovation  competences.   21.2 Besides fostering the developme nt of skills in a holistic manner throughout different disciplines in  the education system, embed mandatory ICT and digital literacy classes  (i.e. responsible and  positive use of AI systems and digital technologies, including awareness for better -internet -for-kids)  in formal primary a nd secondary education. Emphasi se gender -sensitive real -life applications for  digital skills, incorporating project -based learning and hands -on experience.   21.3 Direct th e DigCompEdu Fra mework  towards educators at all levels of educ ation. This should  happen from early childhood to higher and adult education, including general and vocational  education and training, special needs education, and non -formal learning contexts and ensure  accessibility to learning resources and activities, and for all learners (based on universal design and  accessibility standards).   21.4 Recommend Member States to require gender competences for STEM educators in the hiring  process in formal education systems . More generally, set incentives to offer gender sensit ivity  trainings for STEM educators.                                                               38  The European Framework for the Digital Competence of Educators (DigCompEdu) is a scientifically sound framework  describing what it means for educators to be digitally competent. It provides a general reference frame to support the  development of educat or-specific digital competences in Europe. DigCompEdu is directed towards educators at all levels of  education, from early childhood to higher and adult education, including general and vocational education and training,  special needs education, and non -formal learning contexts. For more information, see:  https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/digcompedu . 
  33   21.5 Support dedicated initiatives that encourage young people to choose AI subjects and related fields  as a career.  Provide sustained substantial incentives and funds for initiatives that focus on closing  the “self -efficacy gender gap” in primary and secondary education systems. Target a proportion of  50 % of female talents enrolling subjects like natural science, STEM and ICT in secondary and higher  education by 2030.   21.6 Support the implementation of educational AI technologies  in primary and secondary education to  facilitate individual learning requirements  (e.g. cognitive, AI -based tutoring) 39. The use of AI  systems in education should strictly comply with fundamental rights, with due account for the  vulnerable position of chi ldren.   21.7 Develop and offer career guidance services (e.g. recommender systems) to support pe ople in  finding and choosing education offers based on their individual skills (gaps) .   DEVELOP AND RETAIN TA LENT IN EUROPEAN HIGHER EDUCA TION SYSTEMS  22. A lack of AI -related skills (including technical AI skills, skills for dealing with AI and managerial capabilities  to extend AI in business) has been identified as the most important barrier to AI adoption in Europe.40 AI  talents with expert knowledge are required who are  capable of driving, managing and conducting AI  activities in their institutions and organisations. The creation of an excellent innovation environment  necessitates not only on funding. Europe also needs to attract, develop and retain a comprehensive talen t  pool of AI -developers, entrepreneurs and data analysts, and to create a beacon for talent. This will require  dedicated efforts in establishing cross -disciplinary AI curricula in tertiary and post -graduate education  which integrate ethics, humanities and technical d isciplines, in mainstreaming AI -related skills in all  academic disciplines and professional fields, as well as in fostering cooperation spaces between AI experts  and professionals .  22.1 Develop and implement a European Curriculum in AI  in collaborati on with the European Excellence  Centre of Trustworthy AI as proposed under Recommendation 16, to incorporate applied ethics of AI  and to ensure a n in terdisciplinary and  multidisciplinary perspective through cooperation  across  technical, humanist, social sciences, legal and philo sophical approaches to AI.   22.2 Implement interdiscipl inary PhD schools and Post -PhD program mes in AI  (including humanities ,  social sciences  and ethics) in member state universities which closely collaborate with European AI  research hubs. Provide financial schol arships for students to participate in such dedicated PhD  program mes and post -PhD program mes and include these program mes in calls for AI Excellence  Centres . To assure a certain quality across Europe, those training courses and studies could be  certified.   22.3 Incre ase disciplinary mobility between AI associated curricula. This can be done through  streamlined admission policies of universities to allow for permeability between disciplinary silos   and enable hybrid qualification of talent and interdisciplinary research  and development. Implement  credit ac cumulation models to receive AI-related degrees.                                                               39  See Ritter, S., Anderson, J. R., Koedinger, K.

  34   22.4 Mainstream and include skills  related to data and AI  in all academic disciplines and professional  fields to increase the potential of areas where AI applications can be d eveloped. This includes the  development of a state -of-the-art MOOC (Massive Open Online Courses) for AI , including  elementary training on the basics as well as on relevant special topics , coupled  with decentrali sed  (regional) face -to-face training activiti es at universities. The Commission should consider the  creation  of an EU -wide MOOC on AI, accessible to all European citizens in all EU languages. All such  program mes should ensure the concept of accessibility and universal design to include all sectors of  society and to leave no one behind.   22.5 Foster cooperation spaces between AI researchers and professionals.  Encourage universities to  increase their activities in AI training for professionals and the creation networks of universities,  vocational  schools and c ompanies to build living lab infrastructures (e.g. pilot and IoT training  factories), in which universities, vocational schools and companies develop a common training  concept.   22.6 Support the implementation of postgraduate and supplement curricula on entrepre neurship and  innovation  with a focus on digital economy and data -driven innovation to support continuous   learning. This also includes the establishment of a network and digit al platform to exchange,  optimis e and manage those (regional) training activities.   22.7  Extend existing program mes like ERASMUS41, European Schoo lnet42 and e-twinning43 to AI.  This  creates synergies and allows to access existing know -how, networks and infrastructure.    INCREASE THE PROPORTI ON OF WOMEN IN SCIEN CE AND TECHNOLOGY  23. Today, only 12% of leading machine -learning researchers are female.44 Empirical evidence shows that  despite the growing demand of ICT specialists and digital profiles, the percentage of Europeans with ICT related education is decreasing.45 Compelling evidence of the impact of gender stereotypes is the “self efficacy gender gap” which is basically non -existent (or even reversed in favour of girls) at the primary and  lower secondary education levels, but starts to be measured in secondary levels and becomes even more  pronounced a t the tertiary level.46 Furthermore, the prevalence of male norms and networks in science  and technology professions disadvantage women in informal selection and promotion processes.47 As a  consequence, Europe is currently not exploiting its talent pool, cau sing an annual producti vity loss. For  instance, in ICT -related industries only, this loss extends to EUR 16.2 billion for the European economy to                                                              41  The European Union's Erasmus+ programme is a funding scheme to support activities in the fields of Education, Training,  Youth and Sport.

  35   women leaving their digital jobs to become inactive.48 An increased proportion of women in science and  technolo gy will increase the relevance and quality of research and innovation outputs for society as a  whole.49 Consequently, closing the gender gap in digital skills requires aggressive and sustained efforts.   23.1 Prioritise gender equality and gender mainstreaming  in all AI policies by also making use of gender  budgeting tools and the implementation of gender quota where appropriate. Target a proportion of  female talents of at least 30 % in AI higher education, AI workforce and AI eco -systems by 2030.   23.2 Attract female ta lents into the field of AI and related subjects  through sustained, dedicated and  substantial funding program mes and attractive scholarships based on inclusive practices (including  intersectional approaches)   23.3 Sponsor initiatives for networking and coaching fo r Women in AI. The importance of networking,  coaching and meeting role models has been emphasised repeatedly in the literature on women in  science and technology fields. Thus, it is essential to establish and fund AI mentorship programmes  as well as to cre ate safe spaces for women and girls both within and outside the formal education  sectors to support and encourage women in AI careers.   23.4 Incorporate humanities, social sciences, and gender research into AI research program mes to  increase diversity and guarante e a multi disciplinary approach.   23.5 Address gender bias in algorithmic decision -making , e.g. in the hiring funnel, institutionalized  biases are particularly difficult to track. Address the fact that AI implementation specifically affects  women (professions) i n labour markets. More research is needed to understand the impact on  traditionally “female” jobs.    UPSKILL AND RESKILL T HE CURRENT WORKFORCE  24. The Future of Jobs Report of the World Economic Forum50 forecasts a substantial reskilling need for every  second emp loyee within the next four years. Education and training thus have to be at the centre of the  implemented strategies to enlarge the talent pool for Europe. Continuous training measures will play a  key role in helping people to anticipate, adapt, upskill, r etrain and take advantage of the op portunities  presented by new AI -related activities as part of broader career support mechanisms. Continuous learning  activities and vocational education have to be supported to cope with the challenges of digital skills, as  well as the new social and behavioural skills needed in a human -machine working environment.   24.1 Create a right to continuous learning for all and implement it by law and/or collective agreements.   Adapt continuous learning systems to equip workers with bot h tech -related and personal skills, and  introduce a work -life-train balance. This includes the need for strong career guidance and  professional development for workers whose job is threatened by automation with important                                                              48  See footnote 4 4 above.  49  Diversity research has established that in general diversity increases problem solving capabilities and deci sion quality,  performance and innovation.

  36   training entitlements and the devel opment “professional passports” to ensure the portability of  skills.   24.2 Define critical skills in sensitive areas with human safety and security critical implications and  create measures against skill deterioration. Address undesirable de -skilling of workers through AI,  in particular in operations or processes that require human oversight or intervention.  Promote and  support the development of new skills transfer and acquisition programmes to enable workers made  redundant or faced with the threat of redundancy  due to automation and increased AI take -up to  acquire new skills that will enable them to seek new forms of employment as the structure of the  labour market is reshaped in response to the turn to increased reliance on digital services and  processes.   24.3 Devel op employment policies that support and reward companies who are setting up strategic up -  and reskilling plans for the  development of new data and AI -related applications.  Encourage  organisations to conduct a strategic workforce planning including a plan f or existing workforce to  upskill towards AI, also with potential support from universities and consultancies. Employers should  refrain from introducing new technologies with a disrupting impact on jobs without having initially  properly worked on reskilling p lans and alternatives for workers.   24.4 Upgrade the European Computer Driving License  (ECDL)  to an AI Driving License.  The ECDL  is a  computer literacy programme supported by the ECDL Foundation.51 Europe should develop a simil ar  syllabus and certification scheme for artificial intelligence.    CREATE STAKEHOLDER AW ARENESS AND DECISION  SUPPORT FOR SKILLING  POLICIES  25. The enormity of these educational tasks calls for a number of social innovations, provided through a multi stakeholder  model. Governments, social partners (employers and trade unions) and vocational education  and training providers are, in Europe, the main stakeholders defining training priorities, ensuring cross sectoral and sectoral funding, and delivering trainings to workers. These stakeholders need to be aware  of, and be up to date with , the effects of AI on job markets. Furthermore, they have to be provided with  appropriate decision support and in order to be able to pro -actively design effective policy measures.   25.1 Increase the knowledge and awareness on AI within EU and national policy -making institutions.  This will help them to make well -reasoned policy decisions.  Moreover, effective oversight of  regulated entities deploying AI -enabled tools will also require that sup ervisors are equally  knowledgeable about AI and aware of the developing trends in their respective regulatory  perimeter. One method to achieve this is through setting digital affairs comm ittees in national  parliaments gathering politicians with diverse bac kgrounds including AI experts.   25.2 Foster the development of advanced skills and jobs forecasting algorithms to anticipate and timely  address changes on the job market. This will allow the forecasting of job - and skills disruption across  numerous sectors, and enable organisations, policy -makers and unions to collaborate on re - and up -  skilling program mes and for workers. At the same time, it can help addressing one of the biggest  challenges of the digital era, namely job insecurity and anxiety for the future gene rations.   25.3 Reinforce or develop strong training and career guidance systems that support workers affected  by technological disruption.  Monitor changes in labour markets and make the European Social Fund  and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) mo re responsive by dedicating more  program mes to up -skilling strategies and making EGF intervention more preventive and less                                                              51  For more information, see: http://www.ecdl.org .  
  37   curative. Furthermore, maintain digital skills and job coalition initiatives that match workers and  companies seeking their skills and encourage the creation of tools allowing employees to conduct a  “self -assessment of employability”, so that they can map and visualise their competences.   25.4 Include critical and ethical awareness of AI in existing European awareness initiatives and  networks , such as those  under the pan -European Better Internet for Kids programme. In addition,  promote critical vigilance to industry interests in such awareness programmes.   25.5 In public procurement processes of AI -enabled technology for education, include a n assessment of  embedded interests, ethics and social impacts.  Such products should not be deployed ad hoc in  educational settings based on the free availability or promotional access to educators or institutions,  but must be based on an assessment of thei r ethical implications and the commercial or other  embedded interests/possible trade -offs between interests. Promote critical and ethical awareness  of available AI technology products used in education by educators and educational institutions and  consider  developing a standard for AI tools in education built on the seven key requirements for  Trustworthy AI as developed in our Ethics Guidelines.     G. Establishing an appropriate governance and regulatory framework     Ensuring Trustworthy AI necessitates an appro priate governance and regulatory  framework. By appropriate, we mean a framework that promotes socially valuable  AI development and deployment, ensures and respects fund amental rights, the  rule of law  and democracy , while safeguarding individuals and societ y from  unacceptable harm. On 8 April 2019, we published our Ethics Guidelines that set  out three components for Trustworthy AI: (1) lawful AI, (2) ethical AI and (3) robust  AI. The Ethics Guidelines only deal with the two latter components, yet the first is  equally crucial. Many of the principles set out in the Guidelines reflect existing EU law. This section  complements the Guidelines by providing guidance on appropriate governance and regulatory approaches  beyond voluntary guidance.   We acknowledge that e nsuring an appropriate framework that maximises the benefits of AI and that  preven ts and minimise s its risks is no easy task. Europe takes pride in its sound regulatory environment  that enables and stimulates  AI development and deployment through fostering l egal certainty and  providing a distinct global competitiveness element, while at the same time safeguarding fundamental  rights and protecting individuals  and society  from risk or harm , guided principally by the proportionality  principle . Yet to deliver tru stworthy AI for Europe, independent and meaningful oversight mechanisms  need to be established, and an expansion of the institutional capacities, expertise and instruments of  policymakers is needed. Yet little evidence is available to inform policy -making,  due to the novelty of the  technology, the lack of thorough  and systematic understanding of its impacts and associated business  models, and the unpredictability of its uptake, development and evolution even in the short term. Bearing  this in mind, here bel ow we propose a number of recommendations that should already be considered by  policy -makers at EU and national level.    ENSURE  APPROPRIATE POLICY -MAKING BASED ON A RI SK-BASED AND MULTI -STAKEHOLDER APPROACH  26. 26.1 Adopt a risk -based approach to regulation . The cha racter, intensity and timing of regulatory  intervention should be a function of the type of risk created by an AI system . In line with an  
  38   approach based on  the proportionality  and precautionary  principle, various risk classes should be  distinguished as not  all risks are equal .52 The higher the impact and/or probability of an AI -created  risk, the stronger the appropriate regulatory response should be. ‘Risk’ for this purpose is broadly  defined to encompass adverse impacts of all kinds, both individual and soc ietal.53  26.2 For specific AI applications that generate “unacceptable” risks or pose threats of harm that are  substantial , a precautionary principle -based  approach should be adopted instead .54 Regulatory  authorities should adopt precautionary measures when scien tific evidence about an  environmental,  human health hazard or other serious societal threat (such as threats to the  democratic process), and  the stakes are high . Questions about the kinds of risks deemed  unacceptable must be deliberated and decided upon by  the community at large through open,  transparent and accountable deliberation , taking into account the EU’s legal framework and  obligations under the Charter of Fundamental Rights.   26.3 Give due consideration to the  level of autonomy in AI-based decision -making  (e.g. is it an  information source only, a support function, or a fully autonomous system without human  involvement ) and the autonomy in learning  when developing and updating policy measures for AI  systems.   26.4 Foster a principle -based approach to regulati on. Unnecessarily prescriptive regulation should be  avoided. In contexts characterised by rapid technological change, it is often preferable to adopt a  principled -based approach, as well as outcome -based policies, subject to appropriate monitoring  and enfo rcement. The European Commission should ground its policy measures on AI in EU values,  as discussed and presented in our Ethics Guidelines, and should translate our aspirational goal of  Trustworthy AI into a concrete set of indicators that can be used for monitoring the convergence of  the European market towards the desired policy goals.   26.5 Consider the adoption of a segment -specific methodology when further developing the regulatory  framework for AI. Both the necessary measures to protect individuals against adverse effects and  the market environment of AI products and services developed and deployed in the B2C, B2B  and  P2C contexts differ from each other and merit a tailored approach .     EVALUATE AND POTENTIA LLY REVISE EU LAWS , STARTING WITH THE MO ST RELEVANT LEGAL DOMAINS  27. 27.1 Conduct a systematic mapping and evaluation of all existing EU laws that are particularly relevant  to AI systems. This should be done thr ough a Commission I nter -Service group that ensures  collaboration across different D Gs or the Secretariat -General to avoid “silo” -thinking. Three  questions are to be addressed in particular: (1) To what extent are the policy and legal objectives  underpinning these legislative provisions affected by AI systems and in what ways? (2) To what                                                              52  This can for insta nce be done on the basis of their impact (acceptable or unacceptable) and/or probability of occurrence  (certain v uncertain).   53  This includes not only tangible risks to human health or the environment, but also includes intangible risks to fundamental  rights, democracy and the rule of law, and other potential threats to the cultural and socio -technical foundations of  democratic, rights -respecting, societies. For a discussion of adverse impacts associated with contemporary AI systems, see  Council of Europe  (2019),  Revised draft study of the implications of advanced digital technologies (including AI systems) for  the concept of responsibility within a human rights framework . Available at: https://rm.coe.int/a -study -of-the-implications of-advanced -digital -technologies -including/168094ad40 .  54  The European Commission has held that “ whether or not to invoke the Precautionary Principle is a decision exercised wher e  scientific information is insufficient, inconclusive, or uncertain and where there are indications that the possible effects on  the environment, or human, animal or plant health may be potentially dangerous and inconsistent with the chosen level of  prote ction ”.

  39   extent are existing frameworks for monitoring, information -gathering and enforcement of the  legislative measures capable of providing meaningful and effective oversight to ensure that the  policy and legal objectives are still effectively met? (3) To what extent does existing legislation  operate in ways to promote and ensure the ethical principles and requirements set out in the Ethics  Guidelines?   27.2 For civil liability55 and accountability rules : in the context of laws in areas significantly affecting  individuals, consider whethe r for safety -critical and fundamental  rights -critical applications it is  necessary or desirable to introduce traceability and reporting requirements for AI applications to  facilitate their auditability, ex -ante external oversight before AI systems can be d eployed, systematic  monitoring and oversight by competent authorities on an ongoing basis, and the obligation for  meaningful human intervention and oversight when using AI decision in specific sectors (e.g. a  human doctor to check a medical treatment decis ion). Finally, civil liability rules must be able to  ensure adequate compensation in case of harm and/or rights violations (either through strict or tort  liability), and may need to be complemented with mandatory insurance provisions.   27.3 For criminal law prov ision s: consider the need to ensure that criminal responsibility and liability can  be attributed in line with the fundamental principles of criminal law.    27.4 For consumer protection rules : consider the extent to which existing law s have the capacity to  safegua rd against illegal, unfair, deceptive, exploitative and manipulative practices made possible by  AI applications (for instance in the context of chatbots, include misleading individuals on the  objective, purpose and capacity of an AI system) and whether a m andatory consumer protection  impact assessment is necessary or desirable.   27.5 For data protection rule s: consider whether existing laws allow sufficient access to public data and  data for legitimate research purposes whilst preserving privacy and personal data  protection, the  appropriate scope of intellectual property rights protection, and whether the GDPR mandated  transparency and explainability offers sufficient protection in light of the limitation of its scope to  the processing of personal data and the fac t that automated decision -making processes can also  significantly affect individuals when the system is not fully automated or based on non -personal  data.   27.6 For non -discrimination provisions : consider the extent to which laws prohibiting unlawful  discriminat ion require the explicitation of obligations upon AI developers to verify the absence of  unjust bias in AI systems’ decisions, and the adequacy of enforcement mechanisms against  discriminatory outcomes.   27.7 For cyber -security rules : consider the extent to whic h the current cybersecurity regime provides  sufficient protection against cybersecurity risks posed by AI systems.   27.8 For competition rules : consider the volume of data or incumbency  data advantages – the building  block of many AI systems  – in the assessment  of market power for the purposes of applying rules on  anti-competitive behaviour , abus e of dominance or (algorithmic) collusion , and when evaluating  mergers .                                                                 55  It should be noted that the European Commission has set up a separate Expert Group with the task to evaluate the current  legal framework for liability. More information on this Expert Group and its work is available at:  http://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regexpert/index.cfm?do=groupDetail.groupDetail&groupID=3592 .  
  40    CONSIDER THE NEED FOR  NEW REGULATION TO EN SURE ADEQUATE PROTEC TION FROM ADVERSE IM PACTS  28. 28.1 Examine the need for new regulation to address the critical concerns  listed in our Ethics Guidelines  for Trustworthy AI. More generally, it should continuously be evaluated whether AI systems  generate risks that are not adequately addressed by existing legislation . In particular, individuals  should not be subject to unjustified personal, physical or mental tracking or identification, profiling  and nudging  through AI powered methods of biometric recognition such as: emotional tracking,  empathic media, DNA, iris and behavioural identification, affect recognition, voice and facial  recognition and the recognition of micro -expressions. Exceptional use of such technologies, such as  for national security purposes, must be evidence based, necessary and proportionate , as wel l as  respectful of fundamental rights .   28.2 Monitor and restrict the development of automated lethal weapons, considering not only actual  weapons , but also cyber attack tools that can have lethal consequences if deployed. With respect to  offensive LAWS56, advoc ate to the Member  States to actively participate in the ongoing international  debate, involve internationally recogni sed, non-military  funded  scientists and academics , experts in  artificial intelligence, and propose  to international partners the adoption of a moratorium on the  development of offensive LAWS.   28.3 Monitor the development of personalised AI systems built on children’s profiles  and ensure their   alignment  with fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law . Consider introducing a legal  age at which children receive a “clean data slate”  of any public or private storage of data related to  them as children.57    28.4 For AI systems deployed by the private sector58 that have the potential to have a significant impact  on human lives,  for example  by interfer ing with a n individual’s fundamental rights at an y stage of  the AI system’s life cycle59 and for safety -critical applications, consider the need to introduce:  a  mandatory obligation to conduct a trustworthy AI assessment (including a fundamental rights  impact assessm ent which  also covers for example  the rights of children, the rights of individuals in  relation to the state , and the rights of persons with disabilities60) and stakeholder consultation  including consultation with relevant authorities; traceability, auditability a nd ex -ante oversight  requirement s; and an obligation to ensure  appropriate by default and by design procedures to  enable effective and immediate redress in case of mistakes, harms and/or other rights infringement.    CONSIDER WHETHER EXIS TING INSTITUTIONAL S TRUCTURES , COMPETENCES  AND  CAPACITIES NEED  REVISION TO 29. ENSURE PROPORTIONATE  AND EFFECTIVE PROTEC TION  We recommend a systematic evaluation of the extent to which existing institutional structures,  competences, capacities, resources, investigation and enforce ment powers arising under existing  legislation are capable of adequately ensuring meaningful and effective information -gathering, monitoring  and enforcement of legal standards in ways that provide proportionate and effective protection. In this  regard, c onsideration may be warranted for the necessity or desirability of the points listed here below.                                                               56  These are military robots which, without any human intervention, c an select, engage, attack and hit civilian and military  targets.   57  This does  not exclude the possibility for approp riate  exceptions that are necessary in a democratic society and in full  complianc e with fundamental rights .  58  For AI systems in the public sector, please refer to Recommendation 12.1.   59  When referring to AI systems with a high or significant risk for individuals, reference can be made to Art 35 o f the GDPR,  which could serve as a model for a definition.  60  With due regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of persons with disabilities.  
  41   29.1 Ensure the  consolidation of EU institutions’ “policy cycle” approach by more systematic monitoring  and periodic ex -post evaluation of regulatory measures, and by  enhancing stakeholder  consultations . The stakeholder consultation system of the Commission should be adapted to the AI  age, and important ethical questions should be approached with the help of a wide consultation of  civil society. In this context, the Eu ropean AI Alliance could be further developed and relied on as an  important channel.   29.2 Consider agile policy -making solutions such as the creation of regulatory sandboxes to help  stimulating innovation without creating unacceptable risks.  The creation of re gulatory sandboxes  should involve multiple public and private stakeholders (including NGOs) to support innovators and  allow for high pace viability assessments for new innovations and business models, without  hampering the public interest and the protectio n of individuals. The limitations of sandboxes should   be assessed, and the sandbox’ transparency and accountability must be ensured, including the  availability of avenues of redress in case of harm or adverse impact. Sandboxes can also help  develop ing impa ct assessment capabilities , which facilitates the fundamental rights impact  assessment of experimental AI implementations .  29.3 Institutionalise a dialogue on AI policy with affected stakeholders to define red lines and discuss AI  applications that may risk gen erating unacceptable harms , including applications that should be  prohibited and/or tightly regulated or in specific situations where the risk for people’s rights and  freedoms would be too high and the impact of this technology would be detrimental to indi viduals  or society as a whole. This could for instance be done through the European AI Alliance.   29.4 Develop auditing mechanisms for AI systems.  This should allow public enforcement authorities as  well as independent third party auditors to identify potentiall y illegal outcomes or harmful  consequences generated by AI systems, such as unfair bias or discrimination.   29.5 Ensure that the use of AI systems that entail interaction with end users is by default accompanied  by procedures to support users in accessing effec tive redress in case of infringement of their rights  under applicable laws. These procedures should be accompanied by simple explanations and a user friendly procedure, and should entail interaction with a human interlocutor whenever possible and  chosen by  the user.  Access to justice and effective redress are key elements of building consumer  trust and thus are an important part of Trustworthy AI.   29.6 Foster the availability of redress -by-design mechanisms.  This entails establishing – from the design  phase – mechanisms to ensure alternative systems and procedures with an adequate level of human  oversight (human in the loop, on the loop or in command approach) to be able to effectively detect,  audit, and rectify incorrect decisions taken by a "perfectly " function ing system, for those situations  where the AI system’s decisions significantly affects individuals.   29.7 In addition, we urge policy -makers to refrain from establishing legal personality for AI systems or  robots.  We believe this to be fundamentally inconsisten t with the principle of human agency,  accountability and responsibility, and to pose  a significant moral hazard.    ESTABLISH GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS FOR  A SINGLE MARKET FOR TRUSTWORTHY AI IN EUROPE  30. Achieving the Single European Market is crucial both to ensur e a level playing field in terms of protective  regulation, as well as to enable competitiveness of European companies both in Europe and globally.  The  New Legislative Framework adopted in 2008 can be an enabling framework to accelerate this. Subject to  the provisions of subsidiarity and proportionality, we propose that new regulatory frameworks related to  AI systems, including all digital aspects associated therewith, should be developed at European level.  
  42   30.1 Harmonise regulation – including  its implementation and en forcement mechanisms – across the  EU and foster cooperation between Member States  regarding regulatory frameworks relevant to AI  throughout Europe. In particular, complete and harmonise the EU data regulatory framework.  Harmonisation should however not pre clude existing higher standards of protection at national level  with regards to individuals, for instance regarding  individuals' health and safety and consumer  protection.   30.2 Cumulative regulatory interventions at the national level should be avoided,  unless strictly  satisfying the principles of subsidiarity , necessity and proportionality. Fragmentation of rules at  Member State level should be avoided and the creation of a true European Single Market for  Trustworthy AI systems and services should be prior itised.61 The relevant EU law mapping exercise  proposed under Recommendation 27 .1 should also identify areas where harmonisation of rules may  be appropriate to foster  this goal .  30.3 Establish a comprehensive strategy for Member State cooperation for the enforce ment of  regulation relevant to AI  through enforcement authorities such as data protection, consumer and  competition authorities, ensuring that they cooperate across sectors systematically and apply EU  regulations in a consistent manner throughout differen t Member States and that they have  adequate and equally effective resources and enforcement tools in place.   30.4 Foster the harmonisatio n of T rustworthy AI standards by contributing to the Guidelines’ piloting  process and ensuring an appropriate follow -up. With  the aim to establish a European -wide  framework for trustworthy AI, the Ethics Guidelines put forward a practical assessment list. To  better understand how this guidance can be implemented in different applications, sectors and  Member States, a piloting pr ocess was established. Member States should encourage stakeholders  to participate in this process and ensure funding to enable civil society organisations to participate.  European Institutions and (national) public organisations should participate themselv es in case they  develop, deploy or use AI systems. Moreover, the Commission should ensure an appropriate follow up process to the revised assessment list in early 2020.   30.5 The European Union should consider the setting up an institutional structure for Trustw orthy AI to  fill an existing governance gap. It would be tasked with the following missions:   - Contribute  to developing the EU’s framework and policy for Trustworthy AI, ensuring that AI is  lawful, ethical and robust, by advising EU institutions and supporti ng them in the implementation  of such framework ;  - Provide guidance to stakeholders on how their AI applications can comply with the applicable law  and the principles and requirements for Trustworthy AI ;  - Assist the public and private sector in the applicatio n of a risk -based approach. This includes  providing opinions for the assessment of the intensity, probability and unacceptability of AI created risks ;  - Oversee politically defined system -wide targets for AI applications that can significantly impact  individ uals and society, considering systemic effects both in terms of benefits and risks ;  - Help standard setting organisations define target outcomes for  Trustworthy AI, in particular i n the  context of public -private cooperation on standards ;                                                              61  At the same time, we acknowledge that there may be specific sectors where additional regulatory requirements a pply  compared to the future horizontal policy framework for AI in the EU: sectors such as banking, insurance and healthcare are  already exposed to significant regulatory requirements that are likely to overlap with the emerging policy framework for AI.  In these sectors, as well as any other sector that will features such overlaps, it is essential that the European Commission  performs regular fitness checks to ensure that legislation is proportionate, clearly designed and effectively implements.  
  43   - Promote cooperation amongst Member States for the implementation of Trustworthy AI ;  - Host and update a repository of best practices that are deemed compliant with applicable law and  the Trustworthy AI principles and requirements ;  - Contribute to preparing for socio -economic chan ges brought about by AI , for examp le through  awareness campaigns and training measures for public institutions.   30.6 Develop guidance for stakeholders on how to ensure compliance with Trustworthy AI’s first  component, lawful AI,  for each of the seven requirements. In t he Guidelines, guidance is provided  on how to ensure the implementation of ethical and robust AI for each of the seven requirements.  However, as those requirements are also already captured by a number of legal obligations, and as  legal uncertainty exists regarding  the extent to which such legal obligations are already in place, a  guidance  document  on this first component would be welcomed.   30.7 Consider a range of certification mechanisms for AI systems, and assess the necessity of technical  standards and other standardisation measures .62 The development of co -regulation mechanism s  for the certification of AI systems at EU level could counter fragmentation of standards, but could  also help provide th e means to assess the quality of an AI solution after deploym ent and possibly to  decide which solution is best. Feedback received through the piloting phase of the Ethics Guidelines  could help assess the necessity and shape of any such mechanism. As concerns standardisation,  Europe should develop a clear strategy in  terms of key standardi sation fora and adequate resources.  A European vision is needed on the main components of Trustworthy AI that may necessitate  standards. Finally, it should be ensured that AI systems comply with mandatory sectoral certification  requi rements that already exist today .63     H. Raising Funding and Investment    The availability of capital is essential  for rapid market expansion , and Europe has a  challenging position with a two - to five -fold investment gap compared  with other  world regions.  Europe currently attracts only ~11% of global VC funding , with ~50%  going to US and the rest mostly to China.64 An assessment of the economic activity  growth due to AI until 2030 shows that the value at stake for Europe is significant: if  no actions are ta ken, the EU28 will suffer a deterioration of its innovation capital, which would result in a  loss of €400 billion in cumulative added value to GDP by 2030.65 On the other hand, if Europe develops  and diffuses AI according to its current assets and digital p osition relative to the rest of the world, it could  add €2.7 trillion, or 19 %, to output by 2030 .66 Investments in companies supported by the European  Investment Fund across the EU shows a stabilisation of around €90 million  per year over 2017 -2018 in the  EU27 (€1 28 million for the EU28) for about 50 AI -related deals (70 for the EU28) ,67 which is clearly  insufficient for the EU to be a major actor in volume of investments. The EU therefore  urgently needs an  intensification of investments.                                                               62  Considera tion should be given to the failure of certification systems to safeguard against the implementation of ‘cheat  devices’ in diesel vehicles by a leading car manufacturer on a massive scale, and lessons learned from that experience.   63  See in this regard also the New Legislative Framework for instance, on which more information can be found at:  https://ec.europa.eu/growth/single -market/goods/new -legislative -framework_en .  64  See KPMG, Venture Pulse, 2018,  https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/01/kpmg -venture -pulse -q42018.pdf .  65  See McKinsey Global Institute, Notes from the AI frontier, Tackling Europe’s Gap in Digital and AI, February 2019 .  66  Ibidem .  67  Data includes all deals notified  to the European Investment Fund up until 31/1/2019 and might not yet reflect all 2018, Q4  deals.   
  44   The private investment gap in A I in Europe, which “totalled around € 2.4 -3.2 billion in 2016, compared  with € 6.5 -9.7 billion in Asia and € 12.1 -18.6 billion in North America" ,68 was duly acknowledged in the  Commission’s AI strategy of April 2018, which sets an ambitious objective: incre ase investment and  reaching a total (public and private sectors combined) of at least €20 billion per year in the course of the  next decade. To achieve this, the Coordinated Plan on AI prepared by the Commission and Member States  set out a number of invest ment actions. Furthermore, the Commission proposed a number of financing  initiatives in its 7 -year Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), for instance in terms of research areas  (such as explainable AI, unsupervised machine learning or energy and data effi ciency) or infrastructures  (upgrading the pan -European network of AI excellence centres, creating additional Digital Innovation  Hubs, and establishing world -leading testing and experimentation facilities). The implementation of these  actions require s the s wift adoption by Member States of the MFF and its instruments. Amongst those  instruments, the Digital Europe programme (of which €2.5 billion is allocated to the uptake of AI) and the  Horizon Europe programme (of which €700 million is allocated to research  in AI and other digital  technologies) are important steps. We address in this section the need to steer public funding towards the  recommendations set out in the sections above, as we believe this can help leveraging private funding,  and create a more att ractive investment environment for trustworthy AI in Europe.    ENSURE ADEQUATE FUNDI NG FOR THE RECOMMEND ATIONS PUT FORWARD I N THIS DOCUMENT  31. Throughout this document, various recommendations necessitate dedicated funding mechanisms to be  put in place by the  European Commission together with Member States in order to enable their  implementation . We limit ourselves here  to the most significant ones:   31.1 Transitions taking place on the job market and the workplace require a European transition fund  to help managing  this in a socially responsible way (Recommendation 3.6). Moreover, the re - and  up-skilling of the workforce in Europe, and the securing of a work -life-train balance, will require  significant public funding, particularly at national level – which will need  to be supported by even  more significant levels of private funding.   31.2 The earmarking of substantial funding in the InvestEU programme for AI (Recommend ations 6.1   and 7.1) can help organisations to tackle the digital transformation. While structurally this agency  could be part of the European Investment Bank, its methods and instruments need to be adapted to  the specific needs of the AI ecosystem.   31.3 The proposed Multi -Stakeholder Alliances that will enable AI ecosystems on a sectoral basis   (Recommendation 8 .2) will necessitate the availability of public funds that can help back  solutions  proposed by the relevant stakeholders. Those Alliances can not only help in analysing the concrete  investment needs for the sector in question from different angles, bu t can also stimulate funding  commitments from industry through a collaborative environment of trust that such ecosystem can  create.   31.4 Within public procurement processes, both at EU and national level, a substantive  amount  should  be allocated to innovation -driven solutions (Recommend ation 11.1 ). This can serve as an  instrument to fund innovative AI -based solutions in Europe.   31.5 Dedicated, significant and long -term research funding is needed for fundamental and purpose driven research on AI to maintain competitiv eness of European companies and address relevant  societal challenges  (Reco mmendation 14.1 ). In particular, funding should be made available to                                                              68  See Euralarm report, available at: https://www.euralarm.org/download/87_e78189598ff22b4a957c46350831c66c . 
  45   collaborative research, which  can help creating projects of a critical mass on targeted topics, rather  than foc using solely on individual projects without global coherence. This can help bring ing research  teams together to work towards common objectives. Currently , no instrument is available at  European level that would support this type  of high -level basic researc h, which could nevertheless  play an anchoring role for researchers to stay in Europe, and attract the best ones from abroad.   31.6 A structural and investment fund for European data infrastructure is proposed in order to  support  ecosystems to coordinate data sha ring and access  (Recommen dation 18.1 ). Opening public ly funded  data sources, and redirecting funding  flows to foster collaboration between public and private sector  is critical  to enhance Europe’s competitiveness.   31.7 The establishment of an institutional stru cture at EU level for Trustworthy AI will likewise require  resources to be made available  (Recommendation 30.5) . Such resources should come both from the  European Union's budget and from Member States, as close cooperation with relevant Member  State author ities will be necessary .    ADDRESS THE INVESTMEN T CHALLENGES OF THE MARKET  32. The forecast  of the AI world wide market value shows a fast growth, with AI reaching $ 118 billion by 2025  from $ 9.5 billion in 2018 .69 AI is a family of deep technologies at a stage of development where volumes of  investments make a difference in terms of innovation speed and market share, notably in areas that will  unde rpin the future digital systems and services. With the digital ec onomy being characteris ed by a  “winner takes all” -logic and diminishing returns for late entrants, it is essential for European actors  to  invest as first movers so as to have the possibility to capture large market shares. Slow movers will have to  catch up with established market players, which is expected to b e difficult, especially as market growth is  estimated to decline after having reached a high in 2021.70 The market pull for European AI start -ups is  rather weak but need s to be anticipated to ensure that the engines of the European economy embrace  the shift  to AI , bringing  benefits to the  European economy .71  32.1 Introduce EU level thematic actions to build synergies between national initiatives, to encourage  new publ ic initiatives  and to mobilise and leverage private investments. Financing by EU  Institutions and Member States is  crucial for creating bigger funding pools and leveraging private  investments to AI -focused start -ups and SMEs – and for accelerating the digital transformation of  Europe. Member States need to seek such co -investments at European level  (e.g. through their  National Promotional Banks) to crowd -in additional investments by the private sector. Such co investments also have to address the large investments targeting company growth, beyond the  priority action s of Member States already identified in the Coordinated Plan for AI.   32.2 Encourage Member States to create and expand the testing and experimentation facilities  proposed in the EU in itiative of the Digital Europe programme , and raise awareness by SME s,  notably from traditional sectors of the economy, to adopt and digitally transform. A dense network  of Digital Innovation Hubs should be actively diffusing digital and AI -enabled technologies.   32.3 Ensure financing avenues for larger market deals that can help established companies grow and  scale up in the digital economy  (“scale without mass” until generating revenues). Although existing  European and nat ional instruments primarily aim  at the market gap in equity finance for the early -                                                              69  Tractica, Artificial Intelligence Market Forec asts, https://www.tractica.com/research/artificial -intelligence -market forecasts , 19Q1 .  70  Ibidem .  71  Roland Berger, Artificial Intelligence – A strategy for Europea n start -ups, 2018.  
  46   and growth stage of start -ups and SMEs (seed -series A), it is equally critical to address the market  gaps of bigger deals, in the order of €100 million and more (series C and D).72  32.4 Set up a European Coalition of AI Investors (ECAI),  which gathers companies in Europe that pledge  to allocate funding for and investmen t in the European AI ecosystem.    ENABLE AN OPEN AND LU CRATIVE CLIMATE OF I NVESTMENT THAT REWAR DS TRUSTWORTHY AI 33. 33.1 Encourage the Commission to work with European financial institutions, such as the E uropean  Investment Bank, to develop investment guidelines  that take into account the Ethics Guidelines,   lead ing to sustainable business developments. This could take the form of a criterion in the social  proofing of future financial investments such as InvestEU. The appraisal of the Ethics Guidelines by  all stakehol ders, and notably industry and other international organisations, indicates how  technologies with human -centr ic values are critical to ensur ing societal acceptance.   33.2 Ensure the EU remains an open economy, and a lucrative place for innovators and investors .  Europe's lucrative investment environment is the sum of  a number of enabling elements – from  its  labour and immigration regime  to the legal certainty created through its regulation – that as an  aggregate can provide the necessary level of attraction to bring in  investors . Achieving the AI  investment target set by the EU will require  an increase in the EU's investment attractiveness . In the  current context of global trade uncertainties and protectionist actions by other world regions, it is  essential that the EU remains a champion of free trade and investment in the world, while taking  decisive action to counter unfair practices by third countries.73                                                                    72  KPMG, Venture Pulse (2018), https://assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/01/kpmg -venture -pulse -q4-2018.pdf .  73  EPSC, “EU Industr ial Policy After Siemens -Alstom, Finding a New Balance Between Openness and Protection”, March 2019,   https://ec.europa.eu/epsc/sites/epsc/files/epsc_industrial -policy.pdf .   
  47   CONCLUSION : KEY TAKEAWAYS   Europe has set its overarching am bition  on a human -centric approach to Artificial Intellige nce. In our first  deliverable, this concept was captured in the notion of Trustworthy AI, which we characterised in terms of  three components – being lawful, ethical and robust – and in line with the core tenets of the European  Union: fundamental rights, d emocracy and the rule of law. Our Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI hence  constituted a crucial first step in delineating the type of AI that we want and do not want for Europe.   While such delineation is necessary, it is however not enough to ensure th at Europe can also materialise  the beneficial impact that AI can generate. Taking the next step,  this document therefore presents a set of  policy and investment recommendations on how Trustworthy AI can actually be developed, deployed,  fostered and sca led in Europe, all the while maximising its benefits whilst minimising and preventing its  risks.   We recall that Trustworthy AI is not an end itself, but can be a means to enhance individual and societal  well-being. This requires sustainability, in order  to safeguard our societal and natural environment for  generations to come. It requires growth and competitiveness, so as to grow the pie, secure employment  opportunit ies and generate beneficial progress. And it requires inclusion, to allow everyone to benefit  there from. Technology is a crucial driver of innovation and productivity, and AI is one of the most  transformative technologies of our time. We believe that Trustworthy AI can help achieving sustainability,  growth and competitiveness, and inclusion – thus  contr ibuting to individual and societal well -being.   For this purpose, we formulated 33 concrete recommendations addressed to the European Institutions  and Member States. These focus on four main areas where we believe Trustworthy AI can help achieving a  beneficial impact, starting with humans and society at large, and continuing then to focus on the private  sector, the public sector and Europe’s research and academia. At the same time, we looked into the main  enablers needed to facilitate those impacts, evolving aro und the availability of data and infrastructure,  skills and education, appropriate governance and regulation, as well as funding and investment.   We list here below the main takeaways from our report:   1. Empower and protect humans and society   Using Trustworth y AI to enhance our well -being implies important prerequisites, in particular securing  individual and societal empowerment and protection. First, individuals need to be aware of and  understand the capabilities, limitations and impacts of AI. Second, they m ust have the necessary  education and skills to use the technology, to ensure that they can truly benefit therefrom as well as  being prepared for a transformed working environment where AI systems will become ever more  prevalent. And third, they need adequa te safeguards from any adverse impact that AI might bring.   2. Take up  a tailored approach  to the AI landscape   When positioning Europe in the AI landscape, policy -makers must adopt a tailored approach. They  should consider the “big picture”, by looking at A I’s overall impact on – and potential for – society,  while simultaneously understanding the sensitivities of AI solutions in B2C, B2B and P2C contexts,  both as digital products and services only, and as digital solutions embedded in physical systems. The  underlying logic of each of those segments across different sectors should be analysed and harnessed,  both in terms of impacts to be made and the enablers needed, including governance measures.   3. Secure a Single European Market for Trustworthy AI   A major achieve ment in Europe over the last few decades has been the creation of the Single Market,  which – as we move into the new economic and technological wave that is created by AI – must also 
  48   focus on a Single European Market for AI. This is a complex and multiface ted undertaking which  includes the avoidance of market fragmentation, for instance through the harmonisation of legislation  where appropriate, while at the same time maintaining a high level of protection of individuals’ rights  and freedoms across all Memb er States. Establishing a level playing field for Trustworthy AI across  Europe can benefit individuals and organisations by removing barriers to procure lawful, ethical and  robust AI -enabled goods and services, while also ensuring a competitive position on  the global market  through economies of scale enabled by large integrated markets.   4. Enable AI ecosystems through Sectoral Multi -Stakeholder A lliances   Implementing the recommendations put forward in this document necessitates stakeholder  cooperation. It is  only by joining forces and bringing all relevant actors – from civil society, industry,  the public sector and research and academia – around the table, that we can make a differenc e.  Together, these can help giving shape to vibrant AI ecosystems on a sect oral basis, which can enable a  more granular and much -needed analysis of the specific needs, challenges and opportunities to seize  the benefits of AI within those respective sectors. We propose to start laying the groundwork for this  in the second half of 2019, building on the current report.   5. Foster the European data economy   Europe must foster and invest in a European data economy. The data -driven economy is a  cornerstone for the EU’s future success in the global market. A whole set of policy actions are n eeded  for European organisations to generate societal benefits and succeeding in global competition,  including provisions for data access, data sharing, use of data, re -use of data and data interoperability,  all the while ensuring high privacy and data pro tection standards for individuals. This also requires  putting in place the necessary (physical) infrastructures to enable the other building blocks needed to  develop and deploy Trustworthy AI in Europe.   6. Exploit the multi -faceted role of the public sector   The public sector plays a vital role in steering Europe’s future. It is uniquely placed to deliver and  promote human -centric and Trustworthy AI services, leading by example, while ensuring a strong  protectio n of fundamental rights. Public  procurement -based innovation provides a great op portunity  not only to incentivi se the development of novel AI solutions that can optimise public services, but  also to foster Trustworthy AI solutions amongst European companies of all sizes, and to create  beneficial solutions  in their own right for application elsewhere. Finally, the public sector is in a crucial  position to bring all stakeholders together and maximise joint efforts towards our overarching aims.   7. Strengthen and u nite Europe’s research capabilities   Europe must f ocus the power of its distributed research landscape  to establish and demonstrate its  intellectual and commercial leadership in AI . It should  strengthen and creat e additional  Centres of  Excellence  in AI , and foster collaboration with other stakeholders, in cluding small and large  companies, the public sector, as well as society at large.  An ambitious research roadmap for AI should  be developed, which includes  grand challenges of global relevance, respects and fosters  Trustworthy  AI, and substantially impacts  human -centr ic application domains. It should focus on Europe's  strengths, opportunities and areas of strategic importance , and be constantly updated based on  new  developments and stakeholder consultation . Research funding should be increased and streamlin ed  to build a unified AI capacity for Europe , which will  ensure world -class research capabilities that can  also help develop, retain and acquire AI talent .  
  49   8. Nurture  education to the Fourth Power   A sufficiently deep and wide skills base is needed to suppor t our Trustworthy AI ambitions. This starts  with raising awareness and providing education on AI’s capabilities, challenges and limitations, as well  as teaching appropriate skills to deal with this, whil st ensuring an inter - and multi disciplinary  perspect ive. Primary (1), secondary (2) and tertiary (3) education models need to take this into  consideration , and continuous learning (4) – including on -job lea rning – must secure the re - and up skilling of individuals for the new digital era in Europe, establis hing a work -life-train balance.   9. Adopt a risk -based governance approach to AI and an ensure an appropriate regulatory framework   Ensuring Trustworthy AI requires an appropriate governance and regulatory framework. We advocate  a risk -based approach that is fo cused on proportionate yet effective action to safeguard AI that is  lawful, ethical and robust, and fully aligned with fundamental rights. A comprehensive mapping of  relevant EU laws should be undertaken so as to assess t he extent to which these laws are still  fit for  purpose in an AI -driven world. In addition, new legal measures and governance mechanisms may  need to be put in place to ensure adequate protection from adverse impacts as well as enabling  proper enforcement and oversight, without stifling benefici al innovation.   10. Stimulate  an open and lucrative investment environment   Europe must harness its lucrative investment environment. The new Horizon Europe and Digital  Europe programmes set firm steps towards enhanced European investment levels in AI, yet much   more needs to be done on the public side, and real successes can only be achieved through significant  private sector support. We believe that sectoral multi -stakeholder alliances that foster trust across  policy -makers, industry and academia as well as soc iety, can help securing those investments, as well  as steering them towards Trustworthy AI.   11. Embrace  a holistic way of working, c ombing  a 10-year  vision with  a rolling action plan   To achieve these goals, Europe needs a holistic strategy with a long -term vision that  can capture the  opportunities and challenges of AI for the next 10 years. At the same time, a framework is needed  that allows  continuous monitoring of the landscape and adapting impactful actions on a short -term  rolling basis. In this regard, t he yearly update of the Commission’s and Member States ' Coordinated  plan for AI is a welcome development  and should be secured . In a competition amongst different  economic entities, the single most important element is the capability to apply and learn fast  and  consistently over a long period of time. This report on Policy and Investment Recommendations,  together with earlier published Ethical Guidelines on Trustworthy AI, is a first step to establish the  foundation for this durable strategy. However, a long -term follow -up scheme  for their  implementation is crucial if we truly wish to move the needle in Europe .   As concrete next steps  to pave the road for this new way of working , in the second half of 2019 we will (1)  run a piloting phase of the Ethics Guidel ines for Trustworthy AI to enable their improvement and secure  their (sectoral) relevance, and we propose to (2) instigate a limited number of sectorial AI ecosystem  analyses. Building on this report’s cross -sectoral recommendations, we believe it is now n ecessary to learn  which and impactful actions should be undertaken for various strategic sectors, covering all the areas of  impact and the enablers mentioned in this report.
