Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/         Argentina   The Argentinian Secretary of Government of Science and Technology is drafting the “National Plan of  Artificial Intelligence” (ARGENIA) to cover the years 2020 -2030 (see  article ). The plan seeks to  position the country as a regional leader in the field, and maximize  the generation and use of  knowledge with the ultimate goal of improving the competitiveness of the private sector and  modernising the management of the State to provi de better services to citizens. It includes  participation of government, academia, civil society and the private sector.   As discussed in the OECD report on the  State of the Art in the Use of Emerging Technology in the  Public Sector,  Argentina is in the pro cess of establishing a national AI Innovation Hub. The Hub will  implement projects in various thematic groups, each of which will be governed by a steering group  charged with defining goals and metrics to measure progress.   See additional details on Argenti na on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .  Australia   In November 2019, Australia issued its an  Artificial Intelligence: Solving problems, growing the  economy and improving our quality of life   (AI Roadmap) to help develop a national AI capability to  boost the productivity of Australian industry, create jobs and economic growth, and improve the  quality of life for current and future generations.   Subsequently, in March 2020, the Australian government relased the  Artificial Intelligence  Standards Roadmap: Making Australia’s Voice Heard , which was developed by Standards Australia  and commissioned by the Australian Department of Industry, Science, Energy & Resources. The  document provides recommendatio ns to help Australia effectively support Artificial Intelligence (AI)  and its future across the globe.   Australia’s 2018 -2019 budget sets aside AUS 29.9 million over four years to fund government  initiatives to catalyze  AI innovation in the broader economy.  This includes funding cooperative  research centers , scholarships for AI educational and PhD programs, and developing an AI technology  roadmap, standards and ethics frameworks.   Australia’s Tech Future  (2018) strategy seeks to achieve strong, safe, and inclusive digital economy,  including using emerging technologies such as AI. Digital government is a sub -focus of the strategy,  with goals to make it easy and safe to interact with government online, and to ensure ICT  infrastructure promotes modern, future -proof digital services.   The government’s 2025 Digital Transformation Strategy ( Vision 2025 ) does not explicitly promote the  exploration of AI, but it does include specific initiatives or processes that currently include or will  necessitate AI to make them a reality.   As discussed the Department of Industry, Science, Energy, and Re sources  website ,  Australia also  developing a voluntary  AI Ethics Framework.   While all of these items help to position Australia to seize the potential for AI, there has been no  indication that any of them in themselves (or in combination) formally represent Australia’s national  AI strategy.   See additional details on Australia on the OEC D AI Policy Observatory . 
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/         Austria   In June 2019, the government of Austria issued  Artificial Intelligence Mission Austria 2030  (AIM AT  2030 ) as Austria’s current strategy for AI. The strategy outlines seven fields for which AI will be  critical:   1. Research and innovation   2. Society, ethics and labour market   3. Qualification and train ing  4. AI governance, security and law   5. AI in the public sector   6. Infrastructure for industrial leadership positions   7. AI in the economy   The strategy pledges funding and investment in these areas. Specific for the public sector, AIM AT  2030 promotes streamlining operations and creating new services for citizens. It also promotes the  public sector’s role in serving as first -time adopters, which helps to illustrate to businesses how AI  can improve performance.     Belgium   In March 2019, Belgium launches it s national AI strategy, “ AI 4 Belgium ”. The strategy includes seven  objectives for action:   1. Policy support on ethics, regulation, skills and competences   2. Provide Belgian AI cartography   3. Co-animate Belgian AI community   4. Collect EU funding and connect EU ecosystems   5. Propose concrete action for training in AI   6. Contribute to the uptake of AI technologies by the industry   7. Make new products and services based on AI technologies emerge   To achieve th ese objectives, AI 4 Belgium provides a series of recommendations. Several of these are  particularly relevant to public sector transformation.   • Develop a responsible data strategy  — providing an updated and robust legal framework,  fostering a robust cross -sector data ecosystem, and reinforcing open government data  policies.   • Improve public service and boost the ecosystem  — encourage government organisations to  experiment with AI, and to rethink their roles and move towards a government -as-a-platform  approach.  Also calls for giving public organisations tools and other resources to help 
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       experimentation (e.g., rolling funds, easier procurement, etc.) The strategy proposes at least  EUR 1 billion in this area by 2030.     Brazil   Brazil’s digital transformation strateg y (E-Digital ), published on March 2018, harmonises and co ordinates different governmental initiatives on digital issues, including AI, to advance the Sustainable  Developmen t Goals in Brazil.   In December 2019, the Government of Brazil’s  Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovation and  Communications (MCTIC) launched a  public consultation  to help inform the development of a  Brazilian Artificial Intelligence Strategy. The consultation posed a series of questions to citizens on a  number o f areas. In particular, there were six topic areas (“vertical axes”):   1. Education and training   2. Workforce   3. Research, development, innovation and entrepreneurship   4. Application by the government   5. Application in the productive sectors   6. Public security   For each of these topic areas, participants we able to address three types of questions:   1. Legislation, regulation and ethical use   2. International aspects   3. AI governance   The consultation period ended on 31 January 2020. The final version has not yet been released.   See addi tional details on Brazil on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    Canada   Canada was the first to launch a national AI strategy, in 2017. The  Pan-Canadian Artificial  Intelligence Strategy  is a five -year, CAD 125 million (EUR 88.3 million) strategy to enhance AI -related  talent and research capabilities. One of the goals of the strategy seeks to translate research  discoveries into value in the private and public sectors. Besides this, the public sector is not  addressed.   As a strategy specific for the public sector, the Treasury Board has developed the “ Responsible use of  artificial intelligence ” for the public sector as a living digital resource in order to help public servants  explore AI in a way that is “g overned by clear values, ethics, and laws.” Components of the strategy  include:   • A set of  guiding princi ples to ensure effective and ethical AI.   • A series of updates and blog posts to help guide public servants.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       • A range of  private sector vendors  that have been pre -qualified to help streamline the  procurement process.   • A Directive on Automated Decision -Making and associated Algorithmic Impact Assessment  tool to that set  up guidelines for a risk -based approach to AI.   In November 2019, Canada and France announced the formation of a Global Partnership on Artificial  Intelligence (GPAI), which will will facilitate international collaboration in a multistakeholder manner  with the scientific community, industry, civil society, related international organizations, and  governments to become a global point of reference for understanding and sharing research results  on AI issues and best practices, as well as convening substantive p roject -based work on priority AI  themes.   See additional details on Canada on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    China   The 2017 “ New Generation of Artificial Intelligence Development Plan ” seeks to make China the  leading country for AI by 2030. This comprehensive AI includes a focus on “smart government”, and  it calls for:   • The development of AI pla tforms for digital services and decision -making, as well as the  digital infrastructure needed to support them.   • Promoting the use of AI for programme design and major strategic decisions, such as in  policy evaluation, emergency mitigation and response, and public safety.   • Integrating government data to develop personalised, anticipatory services and promote  seamless public engagement.   • Providing a platform for open government data to help catalyse AI innovation both inside  government and externally.   To achieve this strategy, in 2018 the Chinese government published a three -year  action  plan  cover ing 2018 -2020. Relevant to the public sector, the plan calls for the development of “public  service robots” for innovative applications, such as in inspection and firefighting. It also calls for  strengthened collaboration and synergies across the central g overnment, across levels of  government, and across sectors. Notably, it calls for government to be in a leadership position by  being among the first to use AI to improve efficiency and effectiveness of services.   See additional details on China on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    Colombia   On 13 November 2019, the Government of Colombia published its national strategy,  National Policy  for Digital  Transformation and Artificial Intelligence  (in Spanish). It is designed to be a starting point  to boost Colombia as one of the leaders in the region in AI markets.   The strategy is broader than just AI an d includes components that promote digital transformation of  the public sector and of the broader economy. As it relates to AI, the strategy mostly focuses on the 
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       creation of an AI market lead by private entrepreneurs, where the Government’s role appears t o be  more of a regulator, facilitator, and customer of these services.   The strategy includes four key strategic objectives:   1. Reduce the barriers that prevent the incorporation of digital technologies into the private  sector and in the public sector to facil itate the digital transformation of the country.   2. Create enabling conditions for digital innovation in the public sectors and private with the  purpose of being a mechanism for the development of the transformation digital.   3. Strengthen the competences of huma n capital to face 4RI in order to ensure the required  human resource.   4. Develop enabling conditions to prepare Colombia for changes   economic and social that AI entails.   To achieve these, the strategy lays out a an action plan with four clusters of activities  and 14 lines of  action:   1. Reduce the barriers that prevent the incorporation of digital technologies in the private  sector and in the public sector, to facilitate the digital transformation of the country   o Reduce barriers related to lack of culture and ignor ance to address the adoption and  exploitation of the digital transformation in the private sector.   o Develop regulatory and institutional adjustments to favor the adoption of digital  transformation in key components of business productivity.   o Improve the perf ormance of digital government policy, to address the adoption and  exploitation of digital transformation in the public sector.   2. Create enabling conditions for digital innovation in the public and private sectors, with the  purpose of being a mechanism for th e development of digital transformation   o International alliances for innovation.   o Design and execute initiatives to promote entrepreneurship and digital  transformation.   o Promote ICT -based innovation in the public sector.   o Execute high impact initiatives suppor ted by digital transformation.   3. Strengthen the competences of human capital to face the 4RI, in order to ensure the  required human resource   o Generate enabling conditions that favor the development of digital skills during the  educational career, corresponding to the challenges of technological transformations   o Develop skills and competencies to enhance the interaction of the educational  community with emerging technologies to take advantage of the opportunities and  challenges of the 4RI or industry  4.0.  o Configuration of innovation ecosystems aimed at generating appropriation of the  innovative culture to encourage social and economic development.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       o International alliances for talent training.   o Education preparation, with priority in AI, to contribute   to the development of competencies for the 4RI.   4. Develop enabling conditions to prepare Colombia for the economic and social changes that  AI entails and promote other 4RI technologies.   o Generate the enabling conditions to boost the development of   AI in Colombi a.  o Promote the development of digital technologies for 4RI in   Colombia.   1. Creating a Market.   2. Prioritize market -creating innovations.   3. Evidence -based policies and design of impact metrics.   4. Regulatory experimentation.   5. Data infrastructure for AI.   6. AI Market as a tool to achieve social equality and inclusion.   7. Ethical framework for Artificial Intelligence and safety.   8. Credible commitments and consensus building.   9. Education and talent policies based on experimentation.   10. Strategic role of academic research in the develop ment of an AI market.   11. Attract international talent and skilled labor.   12. Evidence -based policies on the future of labor.   13. Government as a facilitator and consumer of AI systems.   14. Effective implementation of the AI strategy.   15. Continuous interaction with the inter national community and global experts.   There is no direct mention in the initial draft of AI for public sector innovation and transformation.     Croatia   • According to an  interview  with Ratko Mutavdžić, a member of the Croatian Emp loyers’  Association (HUP) -ICGT association, Croatia is drafting a national strategy and that a draft is  with the National Digital Economy Council’s Working Group for development.   Cyprus   Cyprus released  National Strategy AI: Actions for the use and developm ent of AI in Cyprus  (link, in  Greek) in October 2019 after a public consultation process.   The strategy includes four pillars, each with defined action items. These pillars are:  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       1. Maximizing investments th rough covenants.   2. Creating national data areas.   3. Cultivating talents, skills and lifelong learning.   4. Developing ethical and trustworthy AI.   As part of pillar 1, the strategy includes a dedicated focus on the public sector. It calls to human centred, transpare nt, and AI -enabled digital services for citizens.     Czech Republic   The National Artificial Intelligence Strategy  of the Czech Republic wa s launched in May 2019 with  the main objective to make the Czech Republic an innovation leader. The strategy seeks to:   • Concentrate research on developing responsible and trusted AI   • Promote digital transformation, especially among SMEs   • Enhance economic deve lopment and ensure equitable distribution of AI benefits   Within the  National Artificial Intelligence Strategy , recognition for the poten tial of AI for public  sector innovation and transformation is discussed in a section on “AI in industry, services and public  administration.” This section calls for introducing AI applications in the public sector (both central  and municipal levels) in are as such as health care and transportation. It also calls for creating an open  data policy for creating data standards and opening government data for AI use in all sectors. Longer term objectives include implementing “ground -breaking AI projects in public administration to  simplify life for citizens and businesses and streamline activities and increase the added value of  public administration.”     Denmark   The March 2019  National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence  has four key objectives, including that  “Denmark should have a common ethical and human centred basis for [AI]” for all sectors, and that  the “public sector should use artificial intelligence to offer world -class services”. For the latter,  Denmark goal is to become the leading European country in using data and AI for targeted public  services, government organisations   frameworks and systems for data -driven, responsible, and  optimised development and use of AI.   The strategy sets forth 24 key initiatives, including several  directly related to the public sector. Examples include:   • Developing principles for the development and use of AI, including for the responsible and  transparent use of AI by the public sector.   • Identifying and opening five government datasets that may be most important for AI  progress in all sectors.   • Launching signature public sector and projects in healthcare, social and employment areas,  and cross -sector case processing.    
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       Estonia   In May 2019, Estonian Artificial Intelligence experts, led by government CIO Siim Sikkut, produced a  document for accelerating the development of AI in Estonia. It was later presented to the  government in June and adopted as the Estonian National AI Strategy in J uly 2019.   The “ Kratts ” strategy covers the period suggests taking an agile approach to strategy development  with, first, the rollout of a biannual action plan, and second a longer -term strategy b uilding up on  that base and evolving as AI implementation progresses.   The strategy has four key pillars:   1. Advancing the update of AI in the public sector.   2. Advancing the uptake of AI in the private sector.   3. Developing AI R&D and education.   4. Developing a legal environment for the uptake of AI.   For Pillar 1 on the public sector, the strategy includes a number of action items, responsible agencies,  and deadlines for enhancing the awareness of, skills for, and adoption of AI across the public sector.   From a public sector perspective, the development of AI participates to the broader efforts made by  the Estonian government to create an e -state and information society. The public sector has a major  role to play by creating demand for AI solutions, ensuring the availab ility of quality data and  supporting the launch of several pilot projects in different areas of the public sector to create  learning opportunities instead of restricting itself to specific applications. The development of pilot  projects would benefit from more flexible public funding and the creation of “sandboxes” to test and  develop solutions. The report also places a strong emphasis on education for AI -related skills and  applied research.   The legal analysis carried out finds no current need for a separat e law on AI but does suggest changes  needed in the current legislation for instance regarding liability in implementing AI solutions.   As of August 20, 2019, there are 22 projects associated with AI running in the Estonian public sector.   More information wi ll be made available in English at the following  link.    European Union   The European Commission (EC) “ Communication on Artificial Intelligence ” puts forth a European  Initiative on AI as an overarching approach to AI in Europe. It seeks to boost AI capacity and use in  both the private and public sector, among other things. It also calls for join efforts, such as public private partnerships across sectors at national and international levels. It provides several concrete  action items, incl uding:   • Providing an AI toolbox focusing on companies and public administrations.   • Creating a support centre with legal and technical support for data sharing to facilitate  business and public sector AI applications.   • Promoting the opening of data and researc h results.   • Updating a Directive on public sector information.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       To help actualize this strategy, the EC issued the “ Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence ” in  December 2018. This action plan focuses largely on promoting public and private investments in AI. It  also focuses on:   • sharing government data across EU borders and opening government data for public  consumptio n,  • aggregating such data in “data spaces” to make it easy to use and find for all sectors,   • developing joint procurement and cybersecurity solutions.   The EC’s High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence has also issued  Ethics Guidelines for  Trustworthy AI  to provide guidance on how to design and implement AI systems in an ethical and  trustworthy way. These guidelines are discussed in -depth a s a case study in the draft OECD  OPSI  working paper  Hello, World: Artificial Intelligence and its Use in the Public Sector .  In February 2020, the EU issued the white paper  On Artificial Intelligence – A European approach to  excellence and trust  to build upon the European strategy. The paper has the objective  to set out  policy options on how to achieve promoting the uptake of AI and of addressing the risks associated  with certain uses of this new technology; to “enable a trustworthy and secure development of AI in  Europe, in full respect of the values and righ ts of EU citizens”. The paper has two key components, or  “building blocks”:   • A policy framework to align efforts across Europe, including building a cross -sector  “ecosystem of excellence”.   • Elements of a future regulatory framework to enable an “ecosystem of  trust”.   As it related to the public sector specifically, the white paper calls for mobilising public sector  investments, opening of government data, establishing public -private partnerships, and promoting  the adoption of AI by the public sector (especiall y in the areas of healthcare and transport). As the  building blocks note, it also calls on members states to work together to align visions, efforts, and  regulations.   The Commission invites for comments on the proposals set out in the White Paper through a n open  public consultation available at  https://ec.europa.eu/info/consultations_en . The consultation is  open for comments until 19 May 2020.     Finland   Finland’s AI strategy is discussed in -depth as a case study in the draft OECD OPSI  working  paper  Hello, World: Artificial Intelligence and its Use in the Public Sector .  In May 2017, Finland’s Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment c reated an Artificial Intelligence  Programme and a Steering Group to develop a national vision for AI. The group leveraged a broad  network of experts to explore key questions about how best to support the public and private sectors  in producing AI -based inn ovation, how to position government data as resources for economic  development, how AI will affect society and what the public sector should do to move Finland  towards an AI -driven future. Because of this work, the Steering Group issued two key reports tha t set  forth Finland’s approach to AI.  Finland’s Age of Artificial Intelligence  (December 2017) and  Leading  the Way into the Age of Artificial Intelligence  (June 2019) collectively lay out 11 key actions covering  all sectors to help Finland achieve its ambitious goal.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       1. Enhanc e business competitiveness through the use of AI.   2. Effectively utilise data in all sectors   3. Ensure AI can be adopted more quickly and easily.   4. Ensure top -level expertise and attract top experts.   5. Make bold decisions and investments.   6. Build the world’s best publ ic services.   7. Establish new models for collaboration.   8. Make Finland a front runner in the age of AI.   9. Prepare for Artificial Intelligence to change the nature of work.   10. Steer AI development in a trust -based, human -centred direction.   11. Prepare for security challe nges.   While number six is the action with the clearest implications for the public sector, there is a strong  sub-focus on the public sector throughout the document. It envisions a government that provides  anticipatory and personalised services to all citiz ens at all stages of their life in order to support a  well-functioning society. Uniquely, when compared to other national strategies, Finland’s approach  places efficiency of the public sector and the effectiveness of its services on a par with economic  growth.   The Age of AI  report calls for the government to establish Aurora, a network of different smart  services and applications to “allow [the] public administration to bette r anticipate and provide  resources for future service needs” and to allow citizens to access high -quality 24/7 digital services.   Since the initial concept for Aurora was released, it has been expanded significantly into  the AuroraAI National AI Programme . AuroraAI seeks to provide a holistic set of personalised AI driven government services for citizens and businesses in a way  that is human -centric and works  towards their wellbeing as its ultimate goal. AuroraAI, as a broader concept, is intended to enable  citizens to access the wide range of services available from various government and cross -sector  service providers in a sea mless way.   The AuroraAI programme seeks to re -orient the provision of services around citizens and businesses  by combining data from multiple domains and building a network of AI citizen -focused applications  that provide services when they are needed – around various business activities or life stages and  events such as childbirth, buying a home or retirement.     France   In March 2018, President Emmanuel Macron presented the  country’s vision and strategy to make  France a leader in AI . The strategy has three core commitments: (1) bet on French talent, (2) pooling  our assets, especially through opening government data, a nd (3) establishing an ethical framework.  The strategy also pledges EUR 1.5 billion in funding for AI research, companies, and projects. While  the public sector will certainly have a role in executing the strategy, the objectives of the strategy are  focuse d generally on economic growth and not on public sector innovation and transformation.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       The strategy was informed by the March 2018 report,  For a  Meaningful Artif icial Intelligence:  Towards a French and European Strategy . It was authored by Cédric Villani, Mathematician and  Member of French Parliament by request of the French Prime Minister. The report touches on public  sector reform in a number of areas. In partic ular, the report has a dedicated section on  “Transformation of the State: Leading by Example”. This section states that, “together with  businesses, the State must undertake a transformation in order to be capable of integrating AI into  public policy manage ment.” Specific action items include:   • Appointing an Inter -ministerial Coordinator to implement France’s AI strategy, including  public sector AI transformation efforts, and serving as an interface between the public and  private sectors.   • Creating a Joint Cen tre of Excellence for AI at the State level to help recruit AI talent and to  serve as an advisor and lab for public policy design.   • Integrating AI with France’s Digital Government Strategy to ensure digitalisation efforts are  done with future AI uses in min d.  In addition, some recognition of public sector transformation is woven throughout the rest of the  report. For instance, the report states that:   • Public authorities must be a driver of AI, and adopt materials and human resources to factor  AI into policyma king and pursuing modernisation.   • Public procurement practices should be reviewed to better permit innovation.   • Governments must open valuable data to enable AI in all sectors.   • It may be useful to create a group of certified public experts with the capabilit y to audit  algorithms and test methods to ensure ethical AI use and design.   • Public authorities need to support AI initiatives for social programmes, as they such  programs receive little private investment.   • It is the role of the public sector to connect dat a holders in both the public and private  sectors with those who may be able to use the data for AI solutions.   • It is important for government organisations and private sector businesses to collaborate and  partner on AI solutions that can benefit citizens.   • The government should build capacity to evaluate and audit AI and associated algorithms,  but to also open itself to such review by civil society.   While the report does provide a good bit of emphasis on AI for public sector innovation and  transformation, the  report of not considered part of the official strategy. However, the government  may seek to pursue the report’s findings in to fulfill the strategy.   In November 2019, France and Canada announced the formation of a Global Partnership on Artificial  Intellig ence (GPAI), which will will facilitate international collaboration in a multistakeholder manner  with the scientific community, industry, civil society, related international organizations, and  governments to become a global point of reference for understa nding and sharing research results  on AI issues and best practices, as well as convening substantive project -based work on priority AI  themes.

Germany   Germany published its  Artificial Intelligence Strategy , dubbed “AI Made in Germany” in November  2018. It is based on the results of a national consultation and focuses on strengthening Germany as a  centre for AI research, funding private sector AI applications, and providing guidance on ethical,  legal, and cultural considerations for using AI in German y. This includes adapting the legal and  regulatory framework, as appropriate, to promote economic growth through AI and improving the  talent pipeline.   The strategy includes a sub -focus on using AI in the public sector to provide information and services  that are more targeted, tailored, and accessible. Like many other strategies, a main element of the  public sector component is a focus on opening government data as fuel for AI applications in all  sectors. To facilitate this, the strategy includes exploring funding to improve data management  across central government organisations. With a focus on private sector data, the strategy calls for  exploring creating trusted infrastructure for data sharing by the private sector, which could help all  sectors. The Germ an strategy also calls for exploring the use of AI for emergency response and for  maintaining internal and external security.   See additional details on Germany on the OECD  AI Policy O bservatory .    Greece   In September 2019, Greece’s Minister of Governance stated in a  letter  that the country is developing  a national AI strategy, and that is supports numerous international European AI efforts.   Hungary   In October 2018, the government and a number of academic institutions and companies joined  forces to create the  Artificial Intelligence Coalition . The Coalition is w orking on developing a  national strategy and positioning Hungary as a leader in AI, among other things.   In October 2019, Hungary announced an AI Action Plan, which may serve as one of the first  pillars of a national AI strategy (see details  here ).  A full strategy is expected in 2020.     India   India’s June 2018  National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence  – #AIforAll seeks to build a “vibrant AI  ecosystem” to strengthen both economic growth and social inclusion. Its overarching objectives are  to help India obtain the r ight skills and capabilities, invest in initiatives and projects that can achieve  both economic growth and inclusion, and scale Indian AI solutions internationally. The strategy  identifies government’s role across these areas.   Relevant specifically AI for public sector innovation and transformation, the strategy identifies  “public sector undertaking” (state -owner companies) and the government itself as two of three  “major market segments”, with the other being the private sector. The “ Artificial Intelligence in the  Governance Sector in India ” report provides details on projects and the potential for AI in  governance in India.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       For government, it seeks to “im prove process efficiency, reduce human discretion, eliminate  middlemen, advance prediction, proactive and predictive service delivery to citizens”. The report  makes a series of recommendations across these market segments. For the public sector, these  include:   • Spreading awareness on the advantages AI offers, including senior government officials. This  can be done through workshops and live demos, as well as a digital platform with  information on AI experts and projects.   • Improving the quality and openness of government data in order to promote AI in all sectors,  and facilitating sharing and access to data from other sectors.   • Creating a National AI Marketplace (NAIM) to help all sectors come together to share data  and collaborate, as well as look fo r solutions that can be purchased and used.   • Holding challenges and crowdsourcing initiatives to improve government data (e.g.,  crowdsourcing could have obtain annotation for valuable datasets).   • Creating an AI fund to promote government AI projects.   The gov ernment, according to press  coverage , has stated that near finalisa tion for mechanisms to  implement India’s national AI strategy.   See additional details on India on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    Indonesia   Indonesian  press  reported in November 2020 on government statements indicating that Indonesia  was developing a national strategy for AI, with a targeted completion date in 2020.   In February 2020, press also reported that the government’s Assessment and Application of  Technology Agency was charged with developing the strategy, and that it was aiming for a July 2020  issuance. It also reported that the strategy, “will be focused on public services that are hoped to have  a major impact on society. One program currently developed by the BPPT that adopts the manmade  intelligence is to handle forest fires.”   Other  coverage  has indicated that the strategy will include “advances in specific sectors in Indonesia  such as the national defense industry” and supporting “local industrial integration of technologies in  fields suc h as big data analytics and data sciences”.   See additional details on Indonesia on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    Ireland   Ireland’s Department of Business, Enterprise and Innovati on is currently preparing a National  Artificial Intelligence Strategy which is expected to be published by the end of 2019.   On 16 October 2019, Ireland published  public consultation  related to the strategy, welcoming “views  on the key areas and issues that should be a ddressed by the strategy as well as the guiding principles  that should drive the design, development and deployment of AI in Ireland”. The consultation closed  on 7 November 2019.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/         Israel   A July 2019  article  in Science|Business identified that the government was in the process of  developing   national AI strategy. OPSI was not able to find many details about this forthcoming  strategy.   Italy   In August 2019, the Italian Ministry of Economic Development published for public comments a  draft  Natio nal Strategy on Artificial Intelligence .  The draft lists a number of principles and  objectives, which ar egenerally geared towards the private sector. However, one of the principles is  to “Make  public administration, policies and services more digital and , therefore, efficient”, and lists  the public sector as a “priority sector”. A fuller OECD analysis of the draft (in English) can be found  on LinkedIn .  Prior to the development of a more comprehensive national srtrategy, Italy had put in place a  national strategy focused on the public sector. In March 2018,  Italy’s A I Task Force , led by the  Agency for Digital Italy (AGID), published the white paper  Artificial Intelligence at the Service of  Citizens . Similar to Finland, but fairly uncommon among national strategies, the white paper looks  specifically at how the public sector can best use AI technologies to serve both people and business,  and to improve the efficiency and user satisfaction of public services. The white paper discusses nine  key challenges related to implementing AI in the public sector, and makes a series of ten  recommendations on how the government can overcome these challenges:   1. Ethics . Ensuring AI serves citizens and not the other way around; ensuring principles of  equity, fr eedom, and human rights; data quality and neutrality; responsible use of  algorithms; transparency and accountability, and privacy.   2. Technology . Making AI functionality more similar to how humans relate to the world,  personalisation and adaptively of algorit hms, and improving public sector effectiveness.   3. Skills . Education and training to help citizens and public servants understand how AI and  algorithms are used in the public sector and how to interact and coexist with machines.   4. Role of Data . Obtaining and pr oviding broad, open access to quality, bias -free data.   5. Legal context . Reconciling transparency and openness with privacy and intellectual property;  appropriateness and accountability for automated decision -making; and compliance with  GDPR.   6. Adoption of AI i n the public sector . Training public employees on the functioning, benefits,  and ethical and technical implications using AI in the public sector. Supporting employees  without replacing them.   7. Preventing inequality . Developing inclusive, accessible, transpa rent, non -discriminatory, and  bias-free solutions.   8. Measuring the impact . Conducting multi -disciplinary research to measure different aspects  of how AI affects (1) citizens’ quality of life and satisfaction with government services, and (2)  public sector ef ficiency and effectiveness.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       9. The human being .  Experiments in the fields of design, arts, psychology, anthropology and  sociology that can close the gap between research, industry, and society.   The 10 associated recommendations consist of:   1. Promote a national  platform dedicated to the development of AI solutions, as related to  quality data, code, and models; testing AI systems pre -release, providing computing  resources for experimentation.   2. Disclose the results of AI algorithms to facilitate reproducibility, ev aluation, and verification.   3. Provide open resource in the Italian language.   4. Develop adaptive customisation and recommendation systems to facilitate services to  citizens based on their specific needs.   5. Promote the creation of a National Competence Centre to s upport AI in the public sector,  which, among other things, would produce a manifesto for using AI in the public sector.   6. Facilitate skills by promoting an AI certification and establishing training paths.   7. Provide a “Public Administration 4.0” plan to encour age public investments in AI.   8. Support cross -sector and cross -Europe collaboration.   9. Establish a Trans -disciplinary Centre on AI to promote debate and reflection on AI ethics, and  to involve experts and citizens in the considerations needed to develop regula tions,  standards, and solutions.   10. Define guidelines for secure -by-design AI, and facilitating data sharing on cyber -attacks  across Europe.   The white paper also provides a set of Italy -specific next steps that the government could take to  actualise these recommendations and move forward with AI in the public sector.     Japan   Japan was the second country to develop a national AI strategy, after Canada. The March  2017  Artificial Int elligence Technology Strategy . The strategy includes three phases:   1. Now : Utilization and application of data -driven AI developed in various domains.   2. Approximately 2020 : Public use of AI and data developed across various domains.   3. Approximately 2025 -2030 : Eco system built by connecting multiplying domains.   “Public use” from phase 2 does not generally mean public sector, however, and refers to the use of  AI in multiple sectors, especially industry. Japan has created a Strategic Council for AI Technology,  which m anages five public sector National Research and Development Agencies. These agencies  promote research and development for private industry. The strategy notes that the agencies are  also moving forward with “social implementation of AI technology” which may  indicate, but is not  explicit about, AI for the transformation of the public sector. Besides the opening of government  data, which could benefit all sector, the strategy does not explicitly discuss public sector  transformation.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       The government also publish ed Social Principles of Human -Centric AI  to help guide AI design and  development in the country.   Officials from the government of Japan, in interviews with OPSI, have indica ted that Japan is  increasingly exploring and using AI in the public sector. Interestingly, the approach so far has been  for the central government to fund city -level AI experiments, rather than experimenting at the  central government level. Cities serve as  testbeds for AI experimentation, which could potentially be  scaled to others, according to the officials.   Efforts so far have initially been done with through  robotic process automation, but there are plans to delve further into machine learning. The off icials  stated that they are exploring the development of a new strategy that is more tailored for the public  sector will be released in the near future.   In June 2019, the government of Japan issued its AI Strategy 2019  AI for Everyone: People,  Industries, Regions and Governments . The purpose of the strategy is to “specify the environment  and measures conducive to effective future utilization of AI for the purposes of cont ributing to the  solution of global issues through realization of Society 5.0 and overcoming the issues facing Japanese  society. It contains a series of objectives and goals for achieving this.   One of the objectives call for bringing about an “AI Era Digita l Government”. This includes the items  below, each with sub -goals for achieving them:   • Promotion of complete digital government transformation, improved efficiency and  convenience through the utilization of AI, and the realization of inclusion.   • Implementati on of administrative and policy planning based on appropriate data collection  and analysis.   • Promotion of cost reduction, work efficiency improvement, and advancement by utilizing AI  and robotics in the local government administration field, and to secure s ustainable public  services   See additional details on Japan on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    Kenya   The Government of Kenya announced a task force in January 2018 to create a five-year  strategy on  national use of emerging technologies . The strategy has not yet been published, but it is expected  that public sect or innovation will be a significant focus.   Korea   Korea has launched  a five -year strategy  with associated R&D investment funding totalling KRW 2 .2  trillion (EUR 1.7 billion) in order to position itself as a leader in AI. The strategy has three objectives:   1. Securing AI talent, such through establishing training programmes and AI graduate schools.   2. Developing AI technology, such as through funding major projects in health, public safety,  and defense.   3. Investing in infrastructure, such as through creating AI semiconductors to enable things  like autonom ous vehicles . 
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       While there is some focus on domains in which government is involved (health, public safety,  defense), this strategy and subsequent announcements have generally focused efforts on economic  development in the private sector, with little focus on AI for public sector innovation and  transformation. Recent reports indicate that the country will release a new AI strategy in 2019,  focused on building up  AI-focused manu facturing .  See additional details on Korea on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    Latvia   On 11 July 2019, the Government of Latvia announced a draft Latvian AI Strategy announced at a   meeting of the State Secretaries. The draft was  published  for consultations between public bodies.  The government intends for these public consultations to allow it to collect the ne cessary feedback  to move ahead with its national strategy. The draft provides an an action plan with nine steps:   1. Promote the role of AI in education and science.   2. Making data available.   3. Using AI in the public sector.   4. Increasing AI related expenditure.   5. Estab lishing an assessment system.   6. Developing an appropriate legal framework for AI.   7. Promote the adoption of AI in the economy.   8. Actively engage in international cooperation.   9. Developing a unified communication system.   10. Integrate automation and AI in all sector st rategies.     Lithuania   In April 2019, the government of Lithuania published  Lithuanian Artificial Intelligence Strategy: A  vision of the future  in order to “moder nize and expand the current AI ecosystem in Lithuania and  ensure that the nation is ready for a future with AI.”   The strategy include several provisions that recognise the importance for AI in the public sector. In  particular, it recognises that AI has uni que advantages for the public sector and that it can be used to  improve wellbeing. It states that AI can be used in the public sector for things such as crime  prediction, developing better services for citizens, and improving internal government processes.  To  help achieve the potential of AI, the strategy provides for a series of mechanisms to:   • Adopt a culture of innovation that promotes developing and testing AI solutions.   • Create a regulatory sandbox that will allow the use and testing of AI systems in the  public  sector.   • Assist public institutions in implementing AI systems that help benefit citizens and improve  workflow.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       • Establish a Lithuanian Artificial Intelligence Advisory Board that will assist government in  decisions on future AI policy.   • Create public -partnerships that create better conditions for development of AI system.   The strategy also calls for the public sector to adopt a “unified approach to data management” and  to open public sector data to help fuel AI progress in all sectors. To help a chieve this, the strategy  calls for funding a public sector data team to oversee open government data initiatives.     Luxembourg   In May 2019, the government of Luxembourg launched  Artificial Intelligence: a strategic vision for  Luxembourg . The document is to be seen as a living strategy that will be updated regularly. The  present version seeks to achieve three ambitions:   1. To be among the most advanced digital societies in the world, especially in the EU.   2. To become a data -driven and sustainable economy.   3. To support human -centric AI development.   One of seven focu s areas is “AI for the public sector.” In this area, it provides a series of key actions:   • Building a comprehensive overview of potential AI projects.   • Engaging with other EU members for sharing learnings, best practices, experiences, and data.   • Developing AI  solutions for more efficient and effective public services.   • Supporting digital by default with AI tools that can help provide customer -oriented, tailored  services.   • Fostering research and innovation that assess AI for the public sector, disseminating resul ts  and questions to the public.   • Studying the creation of a structured public database ecosystem to ease AI use.   The strategy also calls for relaunching the government’s open data policy to better provide data as  fuel for AI innovation for all sectors. The next step for Luxembourg is to hold public consultations in  late 2019 to help inform future AI policies.     Malaysia   In October 2017, the government of Malaysia  announced that it would develop a National AI  Framework . The government expects that the framework will be complete by the end of 2019. It is  unclear whether the framework will have a focus on the public sector.   Malta   The Government of Malta ha s launched the initiative  Malta.AI  in order to “transform the potential of  Artificial Intelligence into a new contributor to Malta’s economic growth in digital innovation”.   As part of this initiative, the gover nment formed an AI task force made up of entrepreneurs,  academics and experts in the field to develop a national strategy. The final strategy,  Malta the 
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       Ultimate AI Launchpad: A Strategy and Vision for Artificial Intelligence in Malta 2030  was issued in  October 2019.   The strategy identifie three “strategic pillars” for AI in Malta, as well as three key “enablers:. The  pillars are:   1. Investment, s tart-ups and innovation.   2. Public sector adoption   3. Private sector adoption.   And the enablers are:   1. Education and workforce.   2. A legal and ethical framework.   3. Ecosystem infrastructure.   Regarding public sector adoption, as stated by the Strategy, the pillar related to public sector  adoption explores how AI can be deployed widely across the public administration to improve  citizens’ experiences, expand access to public services, and directly improve well -being.   Six AI pilot projects covering traffic management , education, health, customer service, tourism, and  utilities will be undertaken over the coming three years. Details and timeframes for these projects  are included in the strategy document.     Mexico   In June 2018, the government of Mexico published the stud y Towards an AI Strategy in Mexico:  Harnessing the AI Revolution , serves as a foundation for building full AI strategy. The study focuses  its analysis an d provides recommendations across five areas:   1. Government and public services   2. Data & digital infrastructure   3. Research and development   4. Capacity, skills & education   5. Ethics   Under the area of government and public services, which is most relevant for this guide, its  recommendations consist of:   1. Set a clear strategic direction.   2. Appoint Emergent Technology Innovation teams in selected ministries.   3. Government should act as a champion.   4. Develop guidelines for smart AI procurement.   5. Create a multi -stakeholder steeri ng group to develop and promote Mexico’s AI strategy.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       6. Create a network of AI practitioners from all sectors and disciplines, including national and  local actors, to develop a multi -sector 2030 AI road map.   7. Create an AI working group in Congress.   8. Take a lead role in the global debate.   A number of recommendations relevant to AI in the public sector are also included under the other  focus areas, including:   • Creating a national centre for AI research, modelled on The Alan Turing Institute in the UK  (note: The  Alan Turing Institute is discussed in -depth as a case study in the draft OECD  OPSI  working paper  Hello, World: Artificial Intelligence and its Use in the Public Sector ).  • Maintain a resilient open gover nment data infrastructure.   The study provides timeline and lists those responsible for implementing the recommendations.   The government of Mexico website published the  official policy  and stated that it, in conjunction  with the  Artificial Intelligence Strategy of Mexico 2018  (IA-MX 2018) , constitutes the country’s full AI  strategy.   OPSI was unable to locate an IA -MX 2018 document; however, the government webs ite states that it  includes:   • Developing an AI subcommittee to promote multi -sectoral dialogue and approaches.   • Map the uses and needs in the industry and identify best practices in government.   • Promote the international leadership of Mexico in the matter, wi th special emphasis on the  OECD and D7 [ now D9 ]  • Publish the recommendations made by the report to public consultation.   • Work with experts an d citizens through the AI Subcommittee to achieve the continuity of  these efforts during the next administration.   Since the study and IA -MX 2018 document was announced, Mexico has held an election and a new  government has formed. It is not clear whether th e new administration will carry out further  implementation; however, it did submit the strategy to the AI Policy Observatory as a national  strategy instrument in early 2020.   See additional details on Mexico on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    The Netherlands   Public -private partnership AINED has started the process of developing a Dutch AI strategy. In  November 2018, it published a  roadmap  (in Dutch) ( this article  explains it in English) for developing a  full strategy, which also discussed the potential for AI in the Netherlands now and in the future. The  roadmap focuses on building up AI talent, taking a human -centric approach to AI design and  implemen tation, integrate ethics in AI frameworks, R&D investment, and balancing the role of man  and machine. The AINED and the government are working on creating action plans for developing  the AI strategy.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       Relevant for public sector innovation, the roadmap expli citly calls out the government’s role as an AI  user, among its other roles of a regulator and stimulator. It promotes small -scale AI experimentation  within government, which can result in improved accuracy and time savings. The document  advocates for syste mic introduction of AI to government services, and for overcoming governmental  challenges such as accessing and using data, securing talent, avoiding bias, and protecting privacy.     New Zealand   In March 2018, the  AI Forum of New Zealand –an independent organisation that brings together NZ  AI experts and stakeholders from all sectors, including government –published the report  Artificial  Intelligence: Shaping a Future New Zealand . The report provided an overview the status of AI  strategies, investments, and initiatives around the world, and discussed how AI may impact New  Zealand. Final ly, it provided a series of recommendations on what key actors in NZ should do to help  maximize the potential for AI. One of the recommendations was that government needs to  coordinate a national AI strategy as part of New Zealand’s wider Digital Strategy in order to help  remedy a challenge of AI in New Zealand being “disconnected and sparsely deployed.” For more  information check the report from the AI Forum entitled,  Government Use of Artificial Intelligence  in New Zealand .  As a response to the report, in May 2018, the New Zealand government stated exploring the creation  of an  AI action plan and ethical framework .    Nordic -Baltic Region   Some countries have opted to band together for a regional, collaborative approach to AI.  The  Declaration on AI in the Nordic -Baltic Region  was issued in May 2018 by the countries of: Denmark,  Estonia, Finland, the Faroe Islands, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Sweden, and the Ål and Islands.  In the declaration, the countries commit to collaborating on:   • Improving opportunities for skills development   • Enhancing access to data   • Developing ethical and transparent guidelines, standards, principles, and values   • Ensuring standards for infrastructure, hardware, and software that enable privacy, security,  and trust.   • Ensuring AI gets a prominent place in European discussions of the Digital Single Market.   • Avoiding unnecessary regulations   • Utilising the Nordic Council of Ministries to facilit ate collaboration.   The declaration is not detailed enough to state whether any of the commitments has a specific focus  on the public sector. As seen in this section several of these countries also have their own AI strategy.     Norway   In January 2020, Norway  issued its  National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence . 
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       In February 2019, the government of Norway announced that it woul d develop a  coordinated  strategy for AI  in Norway. The strategy is expected to be launched by the  end of 2019,  and it will include focuses on:   • Building up expertise through education, research, and innovation.   • Enabling Norway to adopt AI, including using AI in the public sector.   • Exploiting commercial opportunities, including enablers such as regulatio n and data access.   • Infrastructure and enabling technologies (e.g., 5G, high performance computing)   • Ethical guidelines, data protection, and security   The announcement indicates that the use of AI for public sector transformation will be explicitly  address a s part of the broader strategy, as well as international collaboration through organisations  such as the OECD and EU.     Poland   The government of Poland has not yet published an AI strategy, but it is in the process of developing  one.  This timeline  describes the “Polish Road to an AI Strategy.” The government has held a series of  roundtables with government officials, academics, and industry representatives to discuss the  development of the stra tegy.  The first was held in May 2018 . The Minister of Science and Higher  Education stated that the eventual strategy woul d include focuses on the future of health care,  public administration, education and cybersecurity.   In November 2019, the Ministry of Digitization published  Assumptions for the AI strategy in  Poland  as an action plan towards developing an AI strategy. It includes provisions for the  management and opening of government data, participation of public sector companies in the  developmen t of AI projects. It is not clear when the final strategy will be issued.     Portugal   In February 2019, the Portuguese government launched  AI Portugal 2030 , which seeks strengthen  economic growth, scientific excellence, and human development using with AI. The strategy includes  a number of focus areas, each with associated objectives and specific actions. These areas include  the “pub lic administration and its modernisation”. The overarching goal is to better inform public  policies and decision -making processes, as well as to make public services more anticipatory.   To achieve these goals, the public sector focus area has objectives to:   • Make government data open for all sectors, while respecting security and privacy.   • Foster collaboration between public sector entities for AI.   • Promote innovative solutions for administrative simplification.   • Reinforce public sector skills and capabilities in AI and data science.   • Ensure the ethical use of AI in government.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       The strategy calls for developing a national data infrastructure, funding collaborative project,  creating a “Collaborative Laboratory”(CoLab) for AI, reinforcing government AI  skills, and including  public sector organisations in the governments ethics committee for AI.   In addition to the strategy, the Portuguese government is backing 19 new Data Science and AI  projects for public services. They are funded by the Foundation for Science and Technology, at €4.3  million and are the result of cooperation between scientific institutions and Public Administration  entities. The funding of the projects are part of the government’s mission to employ more artificial  intelligence in Portugu ese public services. The following projects aim to promote knowledge linked to  innovation and modernization of public services and the development of scientific research, in order  to implement public policies for the benefit of citizens:   • Predicting the ris k of long -term unemployment   • Detecting abnormal patterns of antibiotic prescription   • Selecting economic agents for targeted inspection   • Help entrepreneurs deal with bureaucracy and legal compliance   • Use of Artificial Intelligence to enhance the Teledermatologi cal Screening   • Intelligent Water Data System   • Neuroimaging Biomarkers for Diagnosis of Neuropsychiatric Diseases, using Artificial  Intelligence   • Identification and Prediction of Demand for Hospital Emergencies   • Data2Help: Data Science for Optimization of Emerg ency Medical Services   • Early detection of failures of public transport vehicles in an operating environment   • Modeling and prediction of road accidents in the district of Setúbal   • IPSTERS – Land Recognition System of IPSentinel   • Modeling the flow of students in  the Portuguese education system   • Understanding the Determinants of Academic Performance: Evidence from the   • Portuguese Higher Education System   • iLU: Advanced Learning in Urban Data with Situational Context to Optimize Mobility in Cities   • EPISA -Entity and Prop erty Inference for Semantic Archive   • Detection of patterns of addiction in online play   • Preventing the risk of complications of surgical treatment and defining the prognosis in  cancer patients through the integration of clinical and pathological data     Russian Federation   On 10 October 2019, Russia published its  National Strategy  for the Development of  Artificial  Intelligence  by 2030 .

(see OECD  AI in  Society  report).   Also pursuant to Vision 2030, in August 2019, the government of Saudi Arabia created the Saudi  Authority for Data and Artificial Intelligence (SDAIA) by Royal Decre e. Through the same decree, the  government created two offices: (1) The National Centre for Artificial Intelligence, and (2)The  National Data Management Office.   See additional details on Saudi Arabia on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    Serbia   In January 2020, Serbia published their  Strategy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in the  Republic of Serbia for the period 2020 -2025  (condensed version available  here ).  The strategy defines national objectives and measures for the development of AI across the Serbian  economy, including the use of AI for improving services provided by the public sector. S pecific to  government, the strategy identifies three key areas where AI can contribute significantly to public  welfare and higher -quality services:   1. Public Administration : Using business intelligence to better decision making, building  conversational user i nterfaces (e.g., chatbots). personalised services, and accelerating  routine processes. The strategy also specifically states that user privacy and data protection  must be ensured.   2. Healthcare and medicine : Using AI to enhance diagnostics, ensure availabilit y of resources  and equipment and optimise their use, and contribute to the quality and efficiency of health  services.   3. Traffic, road infrastructure and mobility in urban environments : Leveraging AI to improve  traffic planning, enable optimisation of signali ng, and give real -time conditions to allow for  rapid response to traffic situations.   The strategy also calls for:   • Optimising the country’s legal and regulatory framework to better promote AI adoption in all  sector.   • Opening government data to and providing incentives to the private sector to open private  sector data.   • Providing the infrastructure needed for AI, such as high -performance computing resources.   Going forward, the strategy states that Serbia will issue national ethics guidelines based on the  Ethics  Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence  created by the Expert Group appointed by the  European Commission.     Singapore   In May 2017, Si ngapore launched “ AI Singapore ” (AI.SG) as its national programme in AI in order “ to  catalyse, synergise and boost Singapore’s AI capabilities to power [its] future, digital economy .” 
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       AI.SG is a government -wide partnership, with the Digital Government Office as one of the leading  agencies, which also brings together rese arch institutions and the private sector. It commits SGD 150  million (EUR 97.4 million) over five years to facilitate three objectives:   1. Use AI to address major challenges that affect society and industry.   2. Invest in deep capabilities to catch the next wave of scientific innovation.   3. Broaden adoption and use of AI and machine learning within industry.   The AI.SG launch press release specifically refers to the “better provision of public services” as a  goal.  Singapore’s Digital Government Blueprint  makes a solid push for AI in government, and  commits to developing a set of guidelines on the use of AI to manage risk.   The Blueprint’s key  performance indicators call on all ministries to have at least one AI project by 2023. Like other  countries, the government is also working to open government data to help fuel AI in all sectors.     Slovakia   In June 2019, a collaboration of government organisations, academic institutions, and industry  representatives launched the Slovak Center for Artificial Intelligence Research – slovak.AI . The  website states that the Slovak Center aims to ‘turn Slovakia into a country of excellence in the use of   technology with AI elements for the well -being of its citizens.”   OPSI was able to find very little information related to a national AI strategy for Slovakia. However,  the AI Hub Europe  website  indicates the the country is in the process of developing one.     Slovenia   According to officials from the Government of Slovenia, based on coordinated EU approach, Slovenia  has started preparation of national AI strategy and organised an intergovernmental working group,  including experts from academia and industry to drive all the activities.   Public sector transformation will be included as a focus area in a broader AI strategy.     Spain   In March 2019, t he government of Spain’s Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities launched  the RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence . It establishes  six priorities and seven recommendations to  align government to support progress in AI across sectors. The RDI Strategy is intended to serve as  the initial “embryo” for developing a fuller  National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence”  in the future.   These priorities are to:   1. Achieve an organizational structure that allows the development of an AI RDI system and to  measure its impact.   2. Establish strategic areas in which it is necessary to focus the efforts of RDI activities.   3. Facilitate the transfer of kn owledge and its return to society.   4. Plan training and professionalization actions in the field of AI.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       5. Develop a digital data ecosystem and enhance the available infrastructures.   6. Analyse the AI ethics from the perspective of RDI.   The recommendations are to:   1. Launch a National AI Strategy that allows the development and implementation of specific  measures aimed at national strategic sectors.   2. Take advantage of AI to achieve the objectives set out in the Agenda 2030.   3. Design and implement specific actions promotin g the transfer of knowledge to the  socioeconomic environment.   4. Launch or adapt vocation promotion programs, not limited to R&D, as well as the attraction,  retention and recovery of talent aimed at AI.   5. Use AI to ensure an optimal use of open data. To create a National Data Institute to plan and  define governance over data from different levels of government.   6. Detect the needs of adjustment and improvement of competences in the different levels of  our educational system.   7. Ensure that all the activities and initi atives derived from the strategic frameworks focused on  the development of AI, as well as their results, comply with the ethical, legal and social  commitments of our country and our European environment.   The RDI Strategy includes a specific focus on the public sector, calling AI “catalyst for the  transformation of the activity and digital presentation of the public administration.” It calls a number  of actions, including:   • Leveraging machine learning to gai n better insights using government data.   • Developing applications to better interact with citizens (e.g., chatbots)   • Using AI for cheaper and more personalised services in key areas (e.g., healthcare,  education).   • Using AI to reinforce the National Security S trategies (e.g., though unifying data criteria and  better sharing data).   It also calls for opening up government data, as well as data and software code derived from  government -funded research.     Sweden   Sweden’s May 2018  National Approach for Artificial Intelligence  put forth the country’s strategic  priorities for AI and establishes a high -level framewor k for aligning AI stakeholders from all sectors to  help make Sweden “a leader in harnessing the opportunities that AI can offer, with the aim of  strengthening Sweden’s welfare and competitiveness”. The document is intended to serve as a  foundation for futu re priorities and strategies.   To achieve its full potential in AI, the document has determined that Sweden needs to:   • Develop rules, standards, norms, and ethical principles to guide AI use.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       • Promote international standards and regulations that promote AI wh ile mitigating risk.   • Continually review digital infrastructure needs.   • Make data available.   • Actively participate in EU efforts to promote digitization and AI.   The document explicitly notes that AI has considerable potential to contribute to a more effective   and relevant public sector and improve public services, and it has a significant role in helping the  public sector to succeed in address future societal challenges. It calls for public sector stakeholders to  support opening data and creating a national di gital infrastructure. It also calls on public  organisations to collaborate with academia through things like joint projects and staff exchanges to  strengthen public sector capacities. It also stresses that ethics in AI is critical, especially in the public   sector. Thus, algorithms must be transparent and understandable, and AI use must consider legal and  moral issues.   In the same month,  Vinnova , the Swedish government’s innovation agency published  Artificial  Intelligence in Swedish Business and Society  as an analysis of the development and potential of AI in  Sweden, including the public sector. Uniquely, this report expressed that AI can contribute to  Sweden’s efforts in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It also calls for a “concerted  effort to boost Sweden’s AI development”. Such an effort should include:   • A targeted and powerfu l national strategy based on an inclusive process that includes most  policy areas and public organisations.   • Mutual collaboration across sectors   • A focus on a number of strategic areas: drivers, cooperation, education, research  investments, regulatory develo pment, infrastructure development, and labour market  development.   As part of this concerted effort, the Vinnova report calls for the government to generate initiatives to  build or improve education programmes, collaborate environments, data access, experim entation  testbeds, and guidance to help bring about responsible, ethical AI.     Tunisia   The government of Tunisia kicked off an effort to develop a national AI strategy at a UNESCO -hosted  event on “ National AI Strategy: Unlocking Tunisia’s capabilities potential ”. The Secretary of State  for Research created a task force to create an action plan and oversee the development of the  strategy.   The governm ent anticipated that the final AI strategy would be published in January 2019; however,  it has yet to be released as of July 2019. It is unclear when the final strategy will be released, or the  extent to which will include provisions for using AI for publi c sector innovation and transformation.  However, a  slide deck  from the strategy launch event indicates that e -government will  be a subject  for one of five strategy development working groups.    
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       Turkey   According to data submitted to the OECD AI Policy Observatory by Turkey, the country in 2019  developed priority areas, and it is developing an upcoming technology roadmap in AI.  Press  coverage  of an event in 2019 indicate that Turkey’s  Scientific and Technological Research  Council of Turkey (TÜBİTAK) Informat ics and Information Security Research Center (BİLGEM) is  responsible for developing this roadmap.   In September 2019, the country also held a  focus group  of Turkish scientists abroad dedicated to  horizontally scan the artificial intelligence landscape. Current global trends and international  collaboration models in artificial intelligence were discussed among Turkish scientists, which will  pave the way for f uture planning in this area.   In March 2020, the governement Presidency’s Digital Transformation Office more clearly stated that  a national strategy was being developed. See article  here .  See additional details on Turkey on the OECD  AI Policy Observatory .    United Arab Emirates (UAE)   The UAE is the only country in the world to have a Ministry for Artificial Intelligence. It was launched  in October 2017 alongside the country’s  UAE Strategy for Artificial Intelligence  (AI). The main goal  for the strategy is to improve government performance and efficiency, and one of it key objectives is  to “boost government performance at all levels”. Other objectives include creating a new vital  market with high economic value, and making the UAE the first  in the field of AI investments in key  areas. The strategy includes five key action themes:   1. The formation of the UAE AI Council.   2. Workshops, programmes, initiatives and field visits to government bodies   3. Developing capabilities and skills of all staff operat ing in the field of technology and organise  training courses for government officials.   4. Providing all services via AI and the full integration of AI into medical and security services.   5. Launching leadership strategy and issue a government law on the safe use  of AI.   Since then, in April 2019 the UAE adopted the  UAE Artificial Intelligence Strategy 2031 , which “aims  at positioning the UAE as a global leader in artificial intelligence by 2031, and to develop an   integrated system that employs artificial intelligence in vital areas in the UAE”.  The strategy  includes  obje ctives as well as a number of AI initiatives, including several for government services. The goals  relate to:   • Making the UAE more competitive and making it a global AI hub.   • Establishing an AI incubator.   • Employing AI in customer service to improve quality o f life.   • Attracting and training talent for jobs of the future.   • Building lead research capabilities.   • Providing a data -driven infrastructure for experimentation.

United Kingdom   The UK government issued the  AI Sector Deal  in April 2018 (updated in May 2019). The strategy is  borne from the  UK’s Industrial Strategy , which identified AI and data as one of four “ Grand  Challenges ” in which the UK has the potential to lead the world. It reinforces five “foundations” that  were first laid out in the industrial strategy. These foundations are listed below, alongside a selection  of strategy action items that are relevant for public sector innovation and transformation:   1. Ideas : Investing in programmes applying AI to improve different areas to productivity,  including digital service delivery in the public sector.   1. Create a GBP 20 million (EUR 22.4 million) GovTech Fund to support businesses in  providing the government with innovative solutions for enhanced public services.   2. Increase spending across all sectors by 2.4% by 2027, a 3% long -term. Obtain some  industry matching funds for key areas, including the public sector.   2. People : Improving skills and AI expertise; attracting global AI talent.   1. Develop a Turing Fellowship programme, and use The Turing Institute reviews to  inform approaches to AI adoption in both industry and government.   3. Infrastructure : Address barriers to sharing both public and private sector data for fair,  equitable, secure, and accountable data sharing.   1. Publish more quality, re -usable data.   2. Collaborate with developers on a framework for data interoperabilit y.  4. Business environment : Establish an AI Council to convene industry and academia, supported  by a new Office of AI in government. Create a new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation to  guide progress.   5. Places : Help businesses around the UK grow by backing th e expansion of  Tech City  UK and Tech North  into a national network “Tech Nation”. Scaling up academic focus on AI  through more university partners for the Alan Turing Institute (note: The Alan Turing Institute  is discussed in -depth as a case study in the draft OECD OPSI  working paper  Hello, World:  Artificial Intelligence and its Use in  the Public Sector ).  The Sector Deal charges the new  Office of AI  (OAI) with governance of the Deal and reviewing  progress on the objectives. Since i ts creation, this office and the Government Digital Service (GDS)  have jointly issued a  guide to using artificial intellige nce in the public sector  in January 2020 to help  actualise the Sector Deal. The guide is a collection of resources that help public servants understand  how:   • To assess if using AI will help you meet user needs.   • The public sector can best use AI.   • To implemen t AI ethically, fairly and safely.  
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       In addition to the Sector Deal, the UK launched the  Government Technology Innovation Strategy  in  June 20 19 to set out how government will use emerging technologies, including AI, to build better  public services. The Strategy is structured around the themes of people, process, and data and  technology.     United States   In February 2019, the United States launche d the  American AI Initiative , in the form of an executive  order. This “whole -of-government strategy” aims at focusing federal gover nment resources for:   • Investing in AI research and development , generally by prioritising spending on cutting -edge  ideas.   • Unleashing AI resources , especially as related to opening government data, models, and  computer resources.   • Setting AI governance standa rds, through developing guidance for AI development and use,  and for creating technical standards for reliable, trustworthy, secure, and interoperable AI  systems.   • Building the AI workforce , such as through prioritising fellowship, training, and educational   programmes to help workers gain AI skills.   • International engagement and protecting the US AI advantage , through promoting open  markets and requirement government agencies to develop action plans to maintain the US’s  potion in AI leadership.   Following up o n the American AI Initiative executive order, the US issued the  National Artificial  Intelligence  Research and Development Strategic Plan: 2019 Update , which, among other things,  calls for developing shared public datasets and environments for AI training and testing (this item  was established in the 2016 R&D strategic plan, and it remains in the 2019  update).   As well as  expanding public -private partnerships to accelerate advances in AI (this was new for the 2019  update). The Initiative was also considered in the development of the US’s new Federal Data Strategy  and associated  Action Plan , which includes an action item to “improve data resources for AI research  and development”. The Federal Data Strategy and Action Plan are discussed in -depth as a case study  in the OECD OPSI  working paper  Hello, World: Artificial Intelligence and its Use in the Public Sector .  To help actualise this initiative and to help people identify the different AI work areas underway, the  White House launched AI.gov,  Artificial Intelligence for the American People .  While there are many connected facets to the US approach to AI, they are generally focused on  economic development and R&D. The extent to which the Initiat ive and its associated strategies and  practices seek to innovate upon and transform the public sector itself is not specified.     Uruguay   In April 2019, AGESIC, the eGovernment agency in the President’s Office, published a draft for public  consultation of Ur uguay’s  Artificial Intelligence Strategy for the Public Administration . In a related  effort, Transform Uruguay issued a  Roadmap for Data Science and Machine Learning . 
Created by Murat Durmus (CEO AISOMA)   LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceosaisoma/       The draft strategy is focused on building better digital services improving public sector back -office  processes. The draft strategy includes four pillars:   1. Governance of AI.   2. Capabilities of public servants.   3. Efficient use of AI.   4. Educating citizens.   A final strategy is expected by the end of 2019.         *Content adapted from OECD  (Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development)
