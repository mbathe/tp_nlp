Trustworthy AI in Aotearoa AI Principles March 2020 March 2020 , AI Forum , AI Principles | 1 _______________________________________________________________________________________ Trustworthy A I in Aotearoa March 2020 Artificial intelligence ( AI ) can drive significant economic and social benefits for New Zealand . But it also introduces a range of risks and challenges to New Zealand society that can not be overlooked . To help maintain public trust in the development and use of AI in New Zealand , the La w , Society and Ethics Working Group of the AI Forum has published a set of guiding principles for “ Trustworthy AI in Aotearoa New Zealand ” ( the AI Principles ) . Those principles are designed to provide high- level guidance for anyone involved in designing , d eveloping and using artificial intelligence in New Zealand ( AI stakeholders ) , with the goal of ensuring New Zealanders have access to trustworthy AI . A key focus of the group has been to make sure the AI principles are simple , succinct and user friendly . The AI Principles aim to : • start a conversation about the importance of ethical and legal considerations in AI design , development , deployment and operation • raise awareness that AI ethical and legal issues need to be identified and addressed early on • set the groundwork for more detailed , practical guidance that will define and inform good practice in AI design , development and implementation in New Zealand . The AI Principles are designed to be very much a first step in developing more comprehensive Trustworthy AI guidance for New Zealand . It is hoped t he AI Principles can be operationalised through a follow -up set of detailed and practical guidelines to hel p ensure adequate consideration of the legal and ethical implications of AI at each stage of the AI lifecycle . It is expected that such guidelines would help AI stakeholders understand what they should be planning , doing and reviewing at each state of the AI lifecycle . PURPOSE OF THE PRINC IPLES A FIRST STEP March 2020 , AI Forum , AI Principles | 2 We also recognise the complex issues associated with AI can not be reduced to a simple “ tick -box ” activity . As such , this document is intended to provide to set of overarching first principles for AI stakeholders to refer to when faced with c hallenging questions relating to AI . We have drawn upon the common themes emerging from the growing body of published AI ethical principles , including the OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence , the European Commission ’ s Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI , the iTech Principles , the Montréal Declaration and Singapore ’ s Proposed Model AI Governance Framework . However , we have aimed to distil the language and concepts used elsewhere into something more accessible and relevant to New Zealand . A common feature of many sets of AI principles is a focus on ethical considerations only . We believe it is important to remind AI stakeholders that existing laws and regulations apply to AI just as they do to any other form of technology . AI does not exi st in a legal vacuum - among others , e xisting laws relating to consumer protection , privacy , liability , intellectual property and human rights will all continue to apply . The AI Principles are no substitute for compliance with those legal regimes . Human rights law plays a key role . It provides a ready -made , internationally tested and legitimate framework of civil , political , economic , cultural and social values , addressing both individual and collective concerns . The AI Principles are designed to assist everyone in the AI ecosystem , including in both the private and public sectors . However , we recognise that Government has add itional obligations and a broader role to play in ensuring AI and other emerging technologies serve the long -term public good of New Zealand , including in meeting its obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi . Government regulation and regulator s have an important role to play here . Self-regulat ion in the form of ethical principles or standards may fill a gap where the law is incomplete or out of date , but they are no substitution for democratically -mandated rules backed up by the force of law . We note also that p ublic sector agencies ’ AI -related decisions are subject to additional public and international law obligations . Those demand a higher level of scrutiny , transparency and protection of human rights than is currently legally demanded of businesses . Drawing o ut the implications of these requirements in the AI context is an important task we hope the Government will undertake , with support from organisations like the AI Forum , which is a neutral , professional and inclusive group of thought leaders , experts and practitioners . THE ROLE OF GOVERNME NT MORE THAN ETHICS ALIGNMENT WITH EMERG ING AI ETHICAL NORMS March 2020 , AI Forum , AI Principles | 3 The overall intention of these AI principles is not to provide an exhaustive list of AI legal and ethical principles . Instead , we have aimed to provide a useful reference point that summarises key considerations in the design , development , deployment and operation of AI systems . We believe AI stakeholders that design , develop and use AI systems in accordance with these principles will be better able to manage many of the identified risks and untintended consequences of AI . As a result , the public will be more likely to trust AI , ultimately enhancing the ability of all New Zealanders to enjoy the benefits of AI . CONCLUSION March 2020 , AI Forum , AI Principles | 4 Trustworthy AI in Aotearoa The AI Principles The following principles aim to foster both innovation and trust in the design , development and deployment of artificial intelligence ( AI ) in Aotearoa New Zealand . Designers , developers and users of AI systems ( AI stakeholders ) must respect : • Applicable laws in New Zealand and other relevant jurisdictions • Human rights recognised under domestic and international law • Rights of Māori articulated in Te Tiriti o Waitangi • Democratic values including the electoral process and informed public debate • Principles of equality a nd fairness so that AI systems do not unjustly harm , exclude , disempower or discriminate against individuals or particular groups . AI stakeholders must ensure AI systems and related data are reliable , accurate and secure and the privacy of individuals is protected throughout the AI system ’ s life cycle , with potential risks identified and managed on an ongoing basis . The operation and impacts of an AI system should be transparent , traceabl e , auditable and generally explainable to a degree appropriate to its use and potential risk profile so outcomes can be understood and challenged , particularly where they relate to people . AI stakeholders should retain an appropriate level of human oversight of AI systems and their outputs . Technologies capable of harming individuals or groups should not be deployed until stakeholders have determined appropriate accountability and liability . Where appropriate , AI stakeholders should design , develop and use AI systems to promote , as much as possible , the wellbeing of New Zealand ’ s people and environment in areas such as health , education , employment , sustainability , diversity , inclusion and recognition of the unique values of Te Ao Māori . 1 .
