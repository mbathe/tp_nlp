Responding to issues of trust Artificial intelligence ( AI ) has developed strongly in recent years in many professional sectors ( collaborative industrial robots , inspection and maintenance robots , autonomous mobility systems , etc . ) and in the home ( personal assistance robots , medical devices , personal assistants , etc . ) , making it necessary to be able to reliably demonstrate the levels of performance , robustness , ethics and explicability achieved by the different AI solutions . Thanks to our dual expertise in certification and evaluation of AI algorithms , LNE has decided to create a voluntary certification in this field that meets the needs of market players . Market players Requirements AI certification responses End users and buyers of AI solutions Having confidence in the performance of the systems they acquire The ability to choose from a multitude of existing solutions A common , objective and clear reference to make their choice Guarantees allowing to increase the acceptability of these technologies AI developers , suppliers , integrators Stand out from competitors Guarantee the performance of their algorithms or systems Demonstrate that they master all the stages of the AI life cycle and meet the requirements defined by their clients in terms of performance , confidentiality , ethics , as well as regulatory requirements Use as a benchmark to guide their R & D and control efforts Certification , the outcome of a consensus To build the certification standard and meet the need for trusted solutions , LNE has set up ( in 2020 ) a working group representative of the AI community , bringing together developers , evaluators and end users of algorithms . It also collected opinions through a public call for comments . Click for more information A certification of processes This standard aims to define common requirements for the design , development , evaluation and maintenance processes of all types of AI functionalities using machine learning . It therefore covers all business sectors in which AI is used , in order to ensure the application of best practices that promote confidence in AI . It is not intended to define requirements for AI functionalities and therefore specific to their uses . The design , development , evaluation and maintenance processes covered by the standard are defined as follows : Certified procedures Definition Examples of audited procedures Design Transforming an expression of requirements into functional specifications Specification and inclusion of normative and regulatory requirements Development Translate these specifications into a version of the AI functionality ready for evaluation Learning Quality of Databases Evaluation Verify the conformity of the system to the specifications defined before its deployment Definition of evaluation protocols , metrics , in every evaluation tools to allow reporting on the effectiveness of these intelligent systems Maintaining operational conditions Ensure compliance of the AI functionality with the defined specifications after its deployment and throughout its operating phase All features necessary to maintain operating conditions AI systems can evolve throughout their life with performance degradations Why opt for certification ? Developers , suppliers and integrators of AI solutions , thanks to certification , will benefit from multiple advantages allowing them to bring an optimum guarantee of confidence to their customers . Demonstrate that they master all the stages of the AI life cycle and meet customer requirements for performance , regulatory compliance , confidentiality and ethics Attest to the quality of development of their products containing AI Establish a high level of confidence in their solutions by mastering the processes and best practices of the AI domain Demonstrate that they have an organisation , structure and processes in place to produce quality and trusted AI over the long term Have a competitive advantage Benefit from optimal credibility by being audited by an independent and competent body , thus ensuring a good level of confidence in the respect of the requirements Obtaining the AI certification To obtain AI certification , developers , suppliers and integrators of AI solutions must meet the requirements of the `` Certification standard of processes for AI : design , development , evaluation and maintenance in operational conditions '' . The standard Image The certification standard of processes for artificial intelligence defines : The certification procedure , including the scope of application The requirements to be met by the applicant/owner Admission , supervision and staffing arrangements Procurement of the certification is governed by § 2 of the standard . Download the AI certification standard The steps to AI certification Image Image AI certification audit cycle After obtaining your certification , you enter in a cycle of annual audits : An initial follow-up audit to be carried out at 12 months A second follow-up audit to be carried out at 24 months , A renewal audit after 3 years Applying for certification For any request with LNE Digital certification , artificial intelligence , contact us by clicking on `` Obtain a quote '' .
