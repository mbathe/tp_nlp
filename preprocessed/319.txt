least part forms cognitive error lead designers engineers ignore exclude key stakeholder interests mitigate common errors design teams need tool requires expand ethical circle invite stakeholder input perspectives beyond tool analysis analysis essential tool enabling ethical knowledge skill transfer across ethical situations allows identify prior cases mirror key ethical respects analyze relevant parallels differences study adopted solutions strategies outcomes draw reasoned inferences might helpfully illuminate carry present situation tool remembering ethical benefits creative work ethical design engineering identifying risks avoiding disaster positive outcome human flourishing including future generations promotion healthy sustainable life planet often goals obscure focus counter helps implement workflow tool makes ethical benefits work explicit reinforces sincere motivation create tool think terrible people positive thinking work tool reminds important part ethical design must envision work used wisest best people wisest best ways reality technology power always wish abuse power tool helps design teams manage risks associated technology abuse tool closing loop ethical feedback iteration ethical design engineering never finished loop must ensure gets closed enable ethical iteration improvement tool helps ensure ethical initiatives intentions sustained practice degrade ethical tool ethical risk sweeping ethical risks choices may cause significant harm persons carrying morally significant status ecosystems democratic institutions water supplies animal plant populations etc likely spark acute moral controversy reasons ethics technology design engineering often begins seeking understand moral risks may created exacerbated technical choices activity determine reduce eliminate mitigate risks history design engineering many avoidable harms disasters resulted failing adequately identify appreciate foreseeable ethical risks failures form ethical negligence technologists held responsible range stakeholders including directly harmed failure general public regulators lawmakers policymakers scholars media investors foreseeable ethical risks get missed ethical risks particularly hard identify share moral perspective stakeholders fail anticipate likely causal interactions lead harm consider causes harm fail draw distinction conventional moral norms ethical risks subtle complex significant aggregate misclassify ethical risks legal economic cultural risks lack explicit regularized practices looking mitigate challenges institute regularly scheduled ethical strengthen sustain team ethical muscle detecting kinds risks assume missed risks initial project development phase reward team members spotting new ethical risks especially ones practice assessing ethical risk risks trivial urgent remote consider remote serious ignore treat would cybersecurity penetration testing vulnerabilities found generally good news consider wasted effort keep implementation example company makes wearable smart devices health wellness company onboarding employees complete comprehensive workshop highlighting ethical norms practices company includes introduction protocol among others onboarding workshop includes training particular risks safety privacy autonomy dignity emotional etc concentrated health wellness sector risks specific wearable design sector example risks locational privacy risk obsessive populations company project managers must implement protocols four stages workflow initial product proposal idea generation stage prototype stage stage quality assurance stage phase risk sweeping involves mandatory team meeting equivalent team member expected identify present risks productive contributions meetings must noted performance reviews one stages project managers must seek outside input process ensure protocol constrained groupthink bubble mentality example may work marketing ensure input possible ethical risks sought diverse focus group may seek feedback tech ethicists critics willing offer nda phase risk sweeping builds upon last assumption one significant risks may missed prior stage newly emerged due design change new use case ethical risks stage identified assessed classified documented even trivial remote assuming absence risks would necessitate abandoning project risks continue classified significant must subjected monitoring mitigation strategy tool ethical protocol focuses individual risks tool focuses avoiding systemic ethical failures project many ethical disasters engineering design resulted cascade effect multiple team failures isolation would jeopardized project concert produced aggregate ethical disaster thus ethical protocol paired tool geared toward dynamics systemic design failure something ethical suited offer concept familiar certain circumstances patient dies medical care manner time death expected medical team may tasked review case determine went wrong death could reasonably anticipated prevented highlighting missed opportunities cascade effects recurrent patterns team failure exercises used improve medical team practice going forward encourage open sharing information constructive learning documentation team failures many contexts designed process purpose assign apportion blame punish individuals would judicial review determine system team failed prevent failures improved procedures protocols enable better outcomes future version process aid technical design engineering settings enhanced protocol instead waiting ethical disasters happen analyzing teams get habit exercising skill moral imagination see ethical failure project might easily happen understand preventable causes mitigated avoided team ask project ethical failure combination cascade causes led ethical failure learn ethical failure already know team dynamics protocols could prevented ethical failure must change better next time team ask could project fail ethical reasons would likely combined causes ethical blind spots would lead would fail act would choose wrong action put place reduce failure risk implementation example company makes massive multiplayer online video games five years ago costly commercial failure game project echo injured brand wasted years investment resulted departures highly talented designers valued personnel failure many ethical dimensions game perceived gaming community gaming media transparently exploitative pay play design choices unfairly excluded disadvantaged players less disposable income also unwittingly incentivized certain antisocial player behaviors led serious online offline harms prevented emergence healthy growing player community finally included portrayals certain social groups perceived many including vocal critics outside gaming community insensitive morally offensive company determined avoid kind disaster future implement extensive project echo focusing systemic cascading weaknesses design process led outcome learn ethical risks anticipated several points design development game due poor communication creative technical marketing teams worries never addressed also learn game suffered company lack clear consistent messaging employees ethical principles values example regards pay play models kind player communities wants games foster wants game narratives fit within broader ethical norms society finally learn team leaders unwittingly set perverse incentives meant foster team cohesion instead ended rewarding careless design choices suppressing surfacing worries concerns risks created choices company seeks anonymous input ranks employees possible solutions data implement number changes game design workflows procedures improve ethical viability future game projects also implement game design requirement must executed jointly creative production team leaders phase team leaders incentivize members come multiple creative scenarios project might fail technical commercial failure risks identified specifically ethical failure risks explicitly required identified well framed process supported addition company onboarding process employees presented overview company ethical values culture processes provided review discussion distinctive ethical risks concerns emerge game design development given conceptual framework vocabulary identifying ethical concerns asked review discuss ethical case study project echo tool expanding ethical circle cases technology company caused significant moral harm violated ethical norms ways damage internal morale reputational standing invited aggressive regulatory oversight due ethical negligence scope harm anticipated due least part pernicious forms groupthink social phenomenon cognitive processes group become closely aligned begin think lockstep become unable consider accurately assess alternative perspectives currently operating bubble mentality similar groupthink caused group social dynamic demographic cognitive similarities one another put terms cognitive moral failure caused lack sufficient diversity life experiences values worldviews identities abilities personality styles environments tech industry teams may similar levels educational attainment many shared values interests common cultural assumptions vocabularies similar gender identities ethnicities age group physical abilities add additional cohesion shared work culture identity breeding ground dangerous bubble mentality takes deliberate concerted effort counteract phenomenon good people good intentions easily make unethical decisions due insular cognitive view blindspots slogans like technology social good making world better place dangerous allow people operating within bubble mentality sincerely believe acting ethically fact may lack cognitive access broader social realities would need understand order friedman fallacy economist milton friedman notoriously argued companies employees acting behalf morally obligated maximize shareholder profit way responsible considering impact actions public stay within rules game law view rightly criticized licensing grievous corporate harms public also anathema even moral foundations capitalism outlined adam smith others tied legitimacy capitalism public good unfortunately friedman fallacy still taught many business schools environments often used justify company deliberate reckless disregard legitimate moral interests affected stakeholders public general public must noted generally accept fallacy company knowingly poisons local river toxic waste legally via loophole federal environmental regulations local residents shrug say well course company executives really choice give kids cancer would wrong impose costs safe disposal shareholders likewise technology company leaves sensitive personal information unencrypted wide open hackers save cost security quietly sells restrictions use innocent people lose life savings safety result one accepts friedman fallacy excuse even law prohibit actions grave widespread causes ethical failure technology practice addressed explicit deliberate measures designed expand ethical circle ensure legitimate moral interests full range stakeholders people directly indirectly affected actions taken account expanding ethical circle implemented explicit regularized design exercise also implemented higher levels corporate leadership respect broader impact company activities society exercise pose questions following invite explicit reflection upon answers well active steps taken result whose interests desires skills experiences values simply assumed rather actually consulted done justification stakeholders directly affected product interests protected know interests really asked groups individuals indirectly affected significant ways interests protected know interests really asked might use product expect use purposes initially intend stakeholder picture substantial risk harm product justified mitigated risk done procure informed meaningful consent risk people least likely purchase use product might strong opinions anyway opinions implementation example company designing app aims assist young people autism navigating social settings design team highly motivated help people autism integrate society comfortably effectively clear everyone involved morally noble aim technically within reach worthy pursuit ethical commercial grounds however company internal ethical design protocols prompt expand ethical circle ways ensure fall victim groupthink collectively overtaken moral enthusiasm one thinks downsides risks bubble mentality none designers autistic come privileged economic backgrounds similar educational cultural experiences friedman fallacy noble aims project sidelined road profit considerations place users trying help risk team session early ideation process one dedicated specifically tool begin work questions determine quickly consult range young adults autism setting specific design goals realize assumed autism community would welcome perceive need app actually asked members community goals interests might relation social experiences also identify potential class users autism may seek app help manage general social anxiety must consider whether design specifications expand features designed users also realize trained professionals involved support people autism might strong opinions app design would need consider whether app would seen used replacement modes support inviting group young autism activists care professionals conversation design team presented far richer set ethical perspectives started come realize several initial design goals features might helpful thought users given great diversity forms autism realize operating many stereotypes autism grounded movies television real lived experiences autistic people also realize experiences autistic vary considerably according social factors including cultural economic differences also learn specific privacy safety risks many app prospective users would want considered addressed design learn also significant subset people autism resistant interventions framed treatments therapies see autism problem solved technology simply difference way relating world many want greater onus put people society without autism socially receptive accommodating autism still conversations designers identify areas strong consensus common social difficulties ideas app might help many users navigate decide move forward app continued dialogue full range stakeholders invited offer later input marketing stages ensure app functions described appropriate ways tool analsyis essential ethical practice able transfer ethical knowledge skill across cases starting zero every time analyze ethical situation tool analysis essential way executing ethical knowledge skill transfer procedure analysis fairly straightforward identify similar paradigm cases mirror present

leadership organizes meeting dedicated explicitly revitalizing ethical culture company reaffirming company dedication ethical benefits work sensitive likelihood cynical employees may see pointless exercise leadership seeks input highly respected employees ranks message delivered made sincere conclude key policy changes needed order demonstrate company sincere interest revitalizing ethical mission implement announce changes prior meeting also develop anonymized survey instrument administered trusted ask employees answer questions offer input changes would strengthen company ethical mission resolve part meeting involves examining openly discussing anonymous feedback tool think terrible people former google ceo alphabet chairman eric schmidt spoke rsa conference san francisco said
