DIGITAL ETHICS A GUIDE FOR PROFESSIONALS OF THE DIGITAL AGE OCTOBER 2018 WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS GUIDE ? AI technology is a fast -growing field , and people are becoming very anxious about the ethical issues raised by the g rowth in digital uses . However , this area is about much more than just the dilemmas that might hypothetically relate to , for example , a driverless car . Tool bias , environmental impacts and the ethical issues solution designers have to address are just some of the points that merit discussion from an ethical standpoint . The public authorities have grappled with the issue of ethics and digital technology , including the proposal , made in the Villani report , and in the r eport from CERNA ( the Research Ethics Bo ard of Allistene , the Digital Sciences and Technologies Alliance ) , to set up a national digital ethics council modelled on the existing consultative ethics committee for life sciences and healthcare . While praising this approach , Cigref and Syntec Numériq ue , as representatives of the main players in digital society , wanted to provide an initial , operational take on the subject . The aim of this guide is to describe the topics that are being – or should be – considered by people working with digital technology in their current practice , and to provide some pragmatic answers to the questions they have . This guide is an educational tool for digital professionals , and a first step on the way to a common vis ion of ethics we can all share , a key element in buildi ng trust in the digital economy . This is a tool everyone can use !

ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 3 BACKGRO UND Digital technology is bringing about a radical change in business , a paradigm shift that has an impact on organisational practices , business models , management methods and human relationships . The nature of work is changing , and the boundaries of business are shifting . This transformation is giving rise to new opportunities for the new digital economy , but is also raising new and related ethical issues . There has never been so much talk about the issues around data protection , respect for privacy , neutrality , the transparency of algorithms and the right to be forgotten . Every business stakeholder must therefor e be urged to grip the potential opportunities linked to new digital tools and uses , and at the same time the ways in which they might be misused . But how can we come to terms practically with this subject in business , and what ethical issues need to be addressed with departments and/or operations teams ? Cigref and Syntec Numérique , as representatives of the main players in digital society , believe that a common and shared vision of digital ethics needs to be developed as a matter of urgency , in order to build , together , the soli d basis needed for trust going forward . That is why our two organisations were keen to develop a practical frame of reference that companies and their partners can all use , in order to educate teams and managers about the ethical challenges of digital tec hnology , and give them the tools to deal with them . 4 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE HOW SHOULD THIS GUIDE BE USED ? The “ Digital Ethics ” guide from Cigref and Syntec Numérique is intended to categorise the ethical issues linked to digital technology , from the point of view of both the us er ( Cigref ) and the designer of digital solutions and/or services ( Syntec Numérique ) . It offers food for thought ( which questions might companies ask themselves about the ethics of digital technology ? ) and sugge sts avenues to pursue . This guide is not exhaustive . It is designed to be generalist and open to any contributions . Nor is it intended to restate a company ’ s regulatory duties ; the regulations state precisely what is and is not allowed , and the applicable sanctions . Companies are obliged to comply , and this has nothing to do with ethics . However , there might be ethical issues around how they achieve compliance . This guide does however address a number of key points in the GDPR , the regulation which writes into law a range of concepts that had previously been discussed from an ethical standpoint , such as the notion of privacy by design . The guide is made of two sections : • The first section presents the questions to ask ones elf , and then the resources and measures to implement in response . • The second section identifies existing initiatives relating to the ethics of digital technology in business ( with a focus on France ) . ETHICS : NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH COMPLIANCE Ethics and compliance should be considered as separate domains . Compliance is all about operating in accordance with a standard or a law – something external which has authority . It is therefore everyone ’ s responsi bility to abide by the law or face sanctions . Ethics , on the other hand , is a personal or collective approach ( at company level , f or example ) which entails setting guidelines for oneself . This approach is based on values or principles that can guide one 's actions . Ethics is an act of empowerment ( and not only responsibility ) , engagement and integrity . ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 7 That is why this guide is not about GDPR compliance , because ethics begins where regulation ends . As the Villani report says : “ Where stan dards are nonexistent , silent or insufficient , the developer has an increased moral responsibility. ” ( p.147 of the report ) COMPARATIVE TABLE OF ETH ICS AND COMPLIANCE ( Source : Flora Fischer – Cigref ) ETHICS COMPLIANCE • Provides a basis for making our own decisions about courses of action based on the values and/or principles we hold dear • Entails respecting standards/laws/principl es issued by one or more external bodies • Addresses value dilemmas and conflicts specific to each context , on a case- by-case basis • Forms part of a universal framework ( at the national/international level ) • Draws on ideas relating to values , deliberation and recommendations • Draws on notions of standards and obligations Provides a basis for choosing how best to consider an issue and then act on a case- by-case basis , and for considering different and conflicting values/principles Provides a basis for action in accordan ce with the law or any other measures having a legal and moral dimension ( contract , specificatio ns , etc . ) 8 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE DIGITAL ETHICS , AN APPLIED ETHICS There are various branches of ethics , all derived from moral philosophy , including normative ethics , meta -ethics , and applied ethics . It is the latter that inter ests us here . It can be argued that digital technology opens up a new sphere of action , which is not neutral and must therefore implement a number of ethical principles . Some debates may be wholly new , because each technology raises its own issues . The ethics of digital technology is therefore first and foremost an applied ethics which must , depending on the context and the technologies in place , adapt or reinvent itself . • NORMATIVE ETHICS encompas ses various conceptions of what we might call ethical behaviour . It is made up of three major schools of thought : - Virtue ethics : describes the moral character of an action according to the accompanying virtue . People talk of courageous , just and generous a cts , for example . In this conception , it is the courses of action and moral attributes of the person that are most important . - Consequentalism : focuses on the effects of actions , and their short - and longterm positive or negative consequences . Utilitariani sm , which is also regarded as a branch of consequentalism , starts from the premise that we should aim for outcomes that maximise the life chances and well -being of the greatest number of people . - Deontology : examines whether an action complies with a duty ( often a professional duty ) , or an established norm . It tends to translate into codes specific to a profession . It builds into a framework intended to establish behavioural principles within a group . • META -ETHICS , meanwhile , examines the grounds for morals . This con stantly feeds into normative ethics by discussing afresh the proposed principles , the criteria for the ethical evaluation of an action , etc . • APPLIED ETHICS puts normative ethics into practice , by comparing a concrete situation with principles der ived from various schools of normative ethics . Ethical dilemmas are always resolved using applied ethics . THE MAIN BRANCHES OF ETHICS ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 9 Applied ethics demands a form of vigilance on the part of the person concerned , who may be subject to contradictory demands , in an urgent context specific to the business environment . If an ethical dilemma is raised , the person may follow this path , for ex ample : TAKE A STEP BACK This entails putting some distance between you and your everyday reality in order to better evaluate and gain perspective on various dimensions ( social , environmental , divergent interests , etc . ) before acting in accordance with a purely economic rationale . It also means having an ability to forecast possible future events , and more modestly the medium - and long -term consequences of our present actions . For example , developer s of artificial intelligence algorithms may draw on tools enabling them to limit the biases of their solutions by design because they haave studied , in advance , the risks of using their solution . CHOOSE THE “ B EST ” POSSIBLE ETHICS There are always multiple possible choices when thinking ethically . That is why people often talk about “ ethical dilemmas ” . Ethical choices often put to the test the various ethical theories ( consequentialism , deontology , virtue ethics , etc . ) , which can contradict each other , depending on the context . In ethics , there is never an absolute answer , but more likely “ best ” possible choices in different situations . For example , during their career developer s may encounter a conflict between their duty-based ethics and their personal ethics ( or virtue ethics ) . ARBITRATE WITH A THIRD PARTY IF NECESSARY Arbitration means resolving an ethical dilemma by calling on an external third party because the interests of the parties concerned are too subs tantial to settle a situation fairly . This third party may be a code ( e.g . an ethical charter ) , a mor al entity ( e.g . an ethics committee or an ethics department ) , or a legal entity ( e.g . a contract ) . For example , a robotics company may reserve the right to forbid its customers from reprogramming its robots , if the reprogramming does not comply with its usage policy , which in this case acts as a third party . 10 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE 3 MAIN CATEGORIES FOR AN ETHICS APPLIED TO DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY The ethics of digital technology can be segmented into three separate categories . 1 ETHICS BY DESIGN This ethics fo cuses on the design phase of digital tools . It directly concerns technology in all its technical complexity and the know -how of engineers , programmers , etc . This ethics theref ore touches in particular on the deontology ( duty -based ethics ) of digital creators of all kinds ( developers , digital designers , project managers , etc. ) . Indeed , they have an ethical responsibility from the design stage onwards , insofar as data or algorithms may or may not reproduce human biases , reveal new discriminations ( or reproduc e them on a larger scale ) , give rise to injustices , etc . 2 ETHICS OF USE This ethics aims to examine how the customers and employees as well as the managers and partners of a company use digital technology . This entails conducting an ethical evaluation of how people use the technological resources at their disposal . 3 SOCIETAL ETHICS This ethics examines , at a macroscopic level , the impacts of digital technology on soci ety . It thus deals with the acceptability of digital innovations and solutions , “ attention econom ics ” , the environmental and energy footprints of digital tools , and social inclusion . These three categories of ethics are of course interconnected , but they need to be separated in order to better define the issues at stake , which are often located on very different scales . ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 11 SOME DIGITAL -SPECIFIC ETHICAL ISSUES In this section we will highlight several digita l-specific ethical issues , some of which have emerg ed recently or are still unclear . M ore conventional and better known issues such as cross- referencing data , and transparency with customers , are not discussed below but are mentioned quite frequently in th e guide . THE DESIGN OF ATTENTION While grabbing a c ustomer ’ s attention and trying to keep it for as long as possible is a well -known marketing strategy that can easily be spotted , it is worth noting that with digital tools this type of strategy is less per ceptible , because the attention -grabbing techniques are more subtle , and may also harness apparently playful mechanisms . The term “ dark patterns ” is used to describe some interface design tricks intended to trick the user . THE DUTY -BASED ETHICS OF DEVELOPE RS , SUPPLIERS AND INTEGRATORS OF DIGITAL SOLUTIONS AND SERVICES Following breakthroughs and major progress in data science and in AI algorithms capable of learning , there is a growing awareness of the ethical responsibility of the developers of digital sol utions . Their profession is particularly liable to be asked these questions , because they are the ones who oversee machine learning , using databases that may contain biases ( see “ Algorithmic ethics and AI ” below ) , which demands an aptitude for impartiality and the default consideration of these issues at t he earliest possible stage . Suppliers and integrators have a high de facto level of responsibility for the way in which digital solutions or services are designed and put together . ALGORITHMIC ETHICS AND A RTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AI raises specific ethical i ssues . Machine learning algorithms are mushrooming in numerous sectors . These algorithms , which learn from multiple examples , lack transparency and traceability tools that can explain their results . Hence the expression “ black box ” , which is often used to characterise the opacity of some systems . 12 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE For algorithms to be explainable , we need to take account of multiple factors : Database selection : some databases used as learning resources for algorithms may spread cognitive biases . Some databases may , for exam ple , in a particular domain , contain a cultural and historic bias when it comes to gender representativeness . It seems important to be able to explain the content of the data selected and used by learning algorithms in order to ensure their neutrality . Supervised learning : there is a risk that injustices or discrimination may be reproduced in machine learning . That is why the supervision of machine learning is particularly important . Some developers put in place an evaluation process dedicated specifically to the issue of neutrality in learning , and set aside pre- live release test phases . Social acceptability : some algorithmic systems have a non- negligible socia l impact ; they might , for example , have a huge influence on political behaviour by means of “ filter bubbles ” . THE ENVIRONMENTAL AND ENERGY FOOTPRINT OF THE DIGITAL SECTOR Digital technology is generating a large rise in energy consumption , through both the production and the use of devices . The digitalisation of the world ( leading to an increase in dat a flows , data processing , data storage , etc . ) is having serious negative effects on the planet ( climate change , extraction of scarce metals , health impacts , etc. ) . Yet there is still a low level of awareness of the environmental and energy footprint of dig ital technology . ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 13 > DIGITAL ETHICS GUIDE Duty-based ethics of the developers and creators ( publishers , integrators , designers , etc . ) of digital solutions and services Does the IT department offer training programmes on ethics in the creation of digi tal tools ? Set up training workshops and/or skills refresher courses within the IT Department Are solutions designers representative of the social and gender diversity of society ? Draw up a HR policy ensuring social and gender diversity in the workplace Protection of privacy and personal data Are new projects evaluated for their impact on privacy ? Set up an ethics committee to approve sensitive projects Do tools and solutions protect personal data by design ? Adopt a privacy by design approach , in acco rdance with the requirements of the GDPR : this means building the protection of personal data into products and services by design , but also by default ( notably by abiding by the data minimisation principle introduced by the GDPR ) ; this is also a cultural challenge because this concept needs to be factored into a project early on Is the right to be fo rgotten factored into the design chain ? Does the correlation of data collected from various sources result in the production of personal information ( as p art of big data and AI projects , for instance ) ? Put in place a system that measures the personalisation of data after processing operations Algorithmic ethics and artificial intelligence Are the risks of bias in the datasets identified and addressed ? Train designers in the risks of bias in the datasets used for machine learning Carry out a DIA ( discrimination impact assessment ) as suggested in the Villani report ( p.148 ) , inspired by the PIA ( privacy impact assessment ) introduced with the GDPR , in order to analyse the possible design -induced discriminatory impacts of algorithms Put in place checks and balances at each stage of development to ensure there is no bias in the results Can the operating rationale of the algorithms deployed for artificial intelligence be explained ? Have a systems explainability policy encompassing the whole chain ( data provenance , explanation of the reasoning followed ) Develop algorithms that are transparent by design , in order to make it easier to explain them and to an alyse how they reason Adopt a labelling ( with an ethical scoring/rating system ) and ethical support approach Is ethics clearly defined and distinguished from compliance issues/the work of legal depart ments ? Is ethics one of the overall governance issues relating to the digital transformation ? Is ethics specifically addressed in the digital company ( are there ad hoc committees , awareness programmes focusing exclusively on the ethics of digital tools and AI , etc. ) ? preliminary questions ETHICS BY DESIGN 14 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE Accessibility of solutions for people with disabilities Are digital tools designed with the accessibility needs of disabled people in mind ? By default , design solutions that are accessible for people with disabilities Access to data by employees Are ethical rules for data collection and processing defined and shared internally ? Raise teams ’ awareness with data ethics workshops Is there a f ramework for internal rights of access to personal and/or sensitive data ? Define procedures for access to sensitive data based on employees ’ profiles and roles Managerial ethics Are ethics -related issues addressed on a cross functional basis wit hin the company ? Put in place an awareness -raising programme for all employees ( information and examples of best practice ) Appoint a Chief Digital Ethics Officer tasked with ensuring the overall coherence of the company ’ s “ ethics and digital ” policy Are employ ees informed of how their data will be stored and processed , and their rights in this area ? Inform employees of how their data will be stored and processed , and their rights in this area ( display , updating of the company ’ s internal regul ations ) Are the c onsequences of the internal use of certain digital tools assessed ? Carry out an assessment of the impact of digital tools on the day-to-day experience of employees in the company Ethics with users Are the users of personalised services given the option to manage their settings ? Ensure that the information given to users is clear and transparent Make it easy for users to change their personal data management settings , and to make informed choices Are users informed of the terms of use of a digital solution or application ? Draw up a digital user charter setting out the ethical terms of use of a solution Set out the framework for the use of a solution in contractual form , and allow the designer to object to non compliant use Partnership ethics Is there a policy allowing you to check , when digital solutions are built by a number of partners , that the whole process is ethical ? Ensure that the ecosystem is trustworthy and give each partner a vision of the purpose of the overall solution Call on tru sted third parties , certifications and/or labels , demonstrating the ethical commitment of each stakeholde r ETHICS OF USE ( with employees , users , partners ) ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE | 15 Environmental and societal footprint of solutions Has an approach designed to improve the environmental footprint of the IT system been introduc ed ? Identify a manager and draw up an action plan including raising the awareness of all IT department staff and users , building on recognised standards Factor in environmental impact when entering into any contract that has consequences for the enviro nmental footprint of the IT system Does the evaluation of the IT system 's environmental impacts cover primary energy , greenhouse gas emissions , water , the depletion of abiotic resources , paper and WEEE ( waste electrical and electronic equipment ) ? Conduct a regular assessment of the environmental footprint of the IT system ( at least every two years ) , based on recognised and auditable indicators ( Green IT or WWF France ) Is the societal impact of projects ( origin of materials , partners ’ good practices ) tak en into account ? Carry out a societal impact assessment of projects Use companies that form part of the solidarity economy and those that provide sheltered employment Economic impact and acceptability of innovations Is an assessment carried out of the impact of innovations on jobs in the company , especially when automation occurs ? Forecast , with the help of teams specialising in forward planning and strategy , the impacts of technological change on the company ’ s jobs and activities . Include the impact s of automation and more broadly of digital technology in strategic workforce planning Attention economics and information bubbles Are addiction phenomena factored into the design of digital solutions ? Formally discourage the use of “ dark patterns ” ( inte rface design tricks inten ded to trick the user ) Pursue “ high attention quality ” standards or “ responsible attention labels ” ( “ Ethics by Design ” conference , May 2017 ) Are the risks of human cognitive biases factored into the design of digital solutions ? Ensure that digital applications and solutions have not been designed in such a way as to deliberately manipulate users by exploiting cognitive biases SOCIETAL ETHICS ( impact of digital solutions on society ) 16 | ETHICS & DIGITAL GUIDE DESCRIPTION TARGET AUDIENCE TYPE OF TOOLS PROPOSED ADEL Algorithm Data Ethics Label www.adel -label.com Label , created by researcher Jérôme Béranger , evaluating the ethics of digital data processing algorithms .
