Yet a thorough and open discussion around AI ethics , and the principles organisations using this technology must consider , is urgently needed . Dubai ’ s Ethical AI Toolkit has been created to provide practical help across a city ecosystem . It supports industry , academia and individuals in understanding how AI systems can be used responsibly . It consists of principles and guidelines , and a self-assessment tool for developers to assess their platforms . The Dubai AI Ethics Guidelines relate to Ethics principle in Dubai AI Principles : “ AI systems should be fair , transparent , accountable and understandable ” They oﬀer tangible suggestions to help stakeholders adhere to the principle . They deliver detailed guidance and are arranged according to the four sub-principles of Ethics principle : • We will make AI systems fair• We will make AI systems accountable• We will make AI systems transparent• We will make AI systems as explainable as technically possible The guidelines are non-binding , and are being drafted as a collaborative , multi-stakeholder eﬀort , with full awareness of organisations ’ needs to innovate and protect their intellectual property . This is a collaborative process where all stakeholders are invited to be part of the dialogue . We would like to see the Dubai AI Ethics Guidelines evolve into a universal , practical and applicable framework informing ethical requirements for AI design and use.With these guidelines our aim is to oﬀer uniﬁed guidance that is continuously improved in collaboration with our communities . The eventual goal is to reach widespread agreement and adoption of commonly-agreed policies to inform the ethical use of AI not just in Dubai but around the world.SCOPE This document gives guidelines for achieving the ethical design and deployment of AI systems in both the public and private sectors . Speciﬁcally it covers the crucial issues of Fairness , Accountability , Transparency and Explainability of the algorithms at the heart of AI systems . This document does not cover issues relating to employment , security or any other aspects of the governance of artiﬁcial intelligence besides those mentioned above . AI already surrounds us , but some applications are more visible and sensitive than others . This document is applicable only to those AI systems which make or inform ‘ signiﬁcant decisions ’ – that is , those decisions which have the potential for signiﬁcant impact either on individuals or on society as a whole . They also apply to ‘ critical decisions ’ , which are a subset of signiﬁcant decisions and are of especially critical nature . See the Deﬁnitions section for a full deﬁnition of ‘ signiﬁcant decision ’ and ‘ critical decision ’ . DEFINITIONS For the purposes of these guidelines , the following deﬁnitions apply : AI developer organisation An organisation which does any of the following : • determine the purpose of an AI system ; • design an AI system ; • build an AI system , or : • perform technical maintenance or tuning on an AI system Note 1 to entry : the deﬁnition applies regardless of whether the organisation is the ultimate user of the system , or whether they sell it on or give it away EXAMPLE : A company develops an artiﬁcially intelligent facial recognition system and sells it to a country ’ s border force , who use it to identify suspicious personnel . The company is an AI developer organisation and the border force is an AI operator organisation . 15 AI OPERATOR ORGANISATION An organisation which does any of the following : • use AI systems in operations , backroom processes or decision-making ; • use an AI system to provide a service to an AI subject ; • is a business owner of an AI system ; • procure and treat data for use in an AI system , or : • evaluate the use case for an AI system and decide whether to proceed Note 1 to entry : this deﬁnition applies regardless of whether the AI system was developed in-house or procured . Note 2 to entry : it is possible for organisations to be both an AI developer organisation and an AI operator organisation ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ( also “ AI ” ) The capability of a functional unit to perform functions that are generally associated with human intelligence such as reasoning , learning and self-improvement1 . ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT SYSTEM ( also “ AI system ” ) A product , service , process or decision-making methodology whose operation or outcome is materially inﬂuenced by artiﬁcially intelligent functional units Note 1 to entry : it is not necessary for a system ’ s outcome to be solely determined by artiﬁcially intelligent functional units in order for the system to be deﬁned as an artiﬁcially intelligent system Note 2 to entry : a particular feature of AI systems is that they learn behaviour and rules not explicitly programmed in EXAMPLE : A small claims court uses an artiﬁcially intelligent software package to collect evidence pertaining to a case , compare it to similar cases in the past , and present a recommended decision to a judge . The judge determines the ﬁnal outcome . This decision-making methodology is materially inﬂuenced by an artiﬁcially intelligent functional unit , and is therefore classiﬁed as an AI system . EXAMPLE : A government entity uses a chatbot which allows customers to ask routine questions , book appointments and conduct minor ﬁnancial transactions . The chatbot responds to customer queries with pre-written responses and is based on pre-programmed decision rules . Therefore the chatbot is not an AI system . If , however , the chatbot autonomously adjusted its treatment of customers based on the outcome of past cases , it would be an AI system . BIAS ( of a system ) Inclination or prejudice for or against one person or group , especially in a way considered to be unfair2 . CRITICAL DECISION An individually signiﬁcant decision which is deemed to either have a very large impact on an individual or to have especially high stakes , be especially sensitive , have the potential to cause high loss or damage , is societally signiﬁcant , or sets important precedent . Note 1 to entry : the types of decisions referred to here are the same as those in the deﬁnition of signiﬁcant-at-scale decisions , except in this case the eﬀects are felt as a result of an individual decision rather than an aggregate of many decisions.EXAMPLE : A court determines whether a defendant is guilty of a criminal charge , with the punishment for guilt being a life sentence . This is a critical decision because it has a very large impact on the life of the defendant and also sets precedent for similar cases in the future . ETHICS ( as applied to AI ) The concepts of fairness , accountability , transparency and explainability.Note 1 to entry : for the purposes of this document , ethics does not include privacy concerns , model accuracy ( except insofar as fairness and redress are concerned , for example ) , employment , or any other AI-related issues besides those listed in the deﬁnition . FUNCTIONAL UNIT Entity of hardware or software , or both , capable of accomplishing a speciﬁed purpose3 . INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT DECISION A decision which has the potential for signiﬁcant impact on at least one individual ’ s circumstances , behaviour or choices , or has legal or similarly signiﬁcant eﬀects on him or her . EXAMPLE : A company decides to make an employee redundant . This is an individually signiﬁcant decision because of its potential impact on the employee ’ s ﬁnancial situation . NON-OPERATIONAL BIAS ( of a system ) Bias that is either : 1. not a design feature ; or 2. not important in achieving the stated purpose of the system 1 Consistent with ISO/IEC 2382:201516 AI OPERATOR ORGANISATION An organisation which does any of the following : • use AI systems in operations , backroom processes or decision-making ; • use an AI system to provide a service to an AI subject ; • is a business owner of an AI system ; • procure and treat data for use in an AI system , or : • evaluate the use case for an AI system and decide whether to proceed Note 1 to entry : this deﬁnition applies regardless of whether the AI system was developed in-house or procured .

NON-OPERATIONAL BIAS ( of a system ) Bias that is either : 1. not a design feature ; or 2. not important in achieving the stated purpose of the system 3 From ISO/IEC 2382:201518 SET OF SIGNIFICANT-AT-SCALE DECISIONS A set of decisions made by the same system or organisation which , when taken in aggregate , have signiﬁcant impact on society as a whole or groups within it . Note 1 to entry : the decisions need not be individually signiﬁcant in order to qualify , in aggregate , as a set of signiﬁcant-at-scale decisions Note 2 to entry : examples of areas which have a large impact on society include but are not limited to : the large scale allocation of resources or opportunities amongst groups ; the structure of government ; the division of power between large entities or groups ; the law , and its interpretation and enforcement ; conﬂict and war ; international relations , etc . EXAMPLE : An AI system is used by a website to determine which content to show users . This decision is not individually signiﬁcant , since a user is not greatly aﬀected by whether a particular piece of media is shown to them . However if the website is popular then the AI system may be making a set of signiﬁcant-at-scale decisions , because any biases in the system will aﬀect a large number of users . SIGNIFICANT DECISION A decision which is either individually signiﬁcant or is part of a set of signiﬁcant-at-scale decisions . SUBJECT OF AN ARTIFICIALLY INTELLIGENT SYSTEM ( also ‘ AI subject ’ ) A natural person who is any of the following : • an end-user of an AI system • directly aﬀected by the operation of or outcomes of an AI system , or : • a recipient of a service or recommendation provided by an AI system 19 GUIDELINES 1.1 . WE WILL MAKE AI SYSTEMS FAIR 1.1.1 . Consideration should be given to whether the data ingested is representative of the affected population 1.1.1.1 . AI developer organisations and AI operator organisations should undertake reasonable data exploration and/or testing to identify potentially prejudicial decision-making tendencies in AI systems arising from biases in the data EXAMPLE : Following a natural disaster , a government relief agency uses an AI system to detect communities in greatest need by analysing social media data from a range of websites . However those communities where smartphone penetration is lower have less presence on social media , and so are at risk of receiving less attention . Therefore the charity complements their AI tool with traditional techniques to identify needy populations elsewhere . 1.1.1.2 . AI developer organisations and AI operator organisations should refrain from training AI systems on data that is not likely to be representative of the aﬀected AI subjects , or is not likely to be accurate , whether that be due to age , omission , method of collection , or other factors 1.1.1.3 . AI developer organisations should consider whether their AI systems can be expected to perform well when exposed to previously-unseen data , especially when evaluating people who are not well-represented in the training data 20 1.1.2 . Consideration should be given to whether decision-making processes introduce bias 1.1.2.1 . When subjecting diﬀerent groups to diﬀerent decision-making processes , AI developer organisations should consider whether this will lead to non-operational bias 1.1.2.2 . When evaluating the fairness of an AI system , AI developer organisations and AI operator organisations should consider whether AI subjects in the same circumstances receive equal treatment EXAMPLE : An organisation uses an AI tool to automate the pre-screening of candidates for a job opening . It is trained on data from the company ’ s existing employees , the majority of whom are from the same ethnic background . Therefore the system learns to use name and nationality as discriminating factors in ﬁltering job applicants . This could have been identiﬁed through testing and rectiﬁed by , for example , balancing the training data or only using relevant data ﬁelds for training . 1.1.3 . Signiﬁcant decisions informed by the use of AI should be fair 1.1.3.1 . AI developer organisations and AI operator organisations could consider formal procedures such as Discrimination Impact Assessments as a means of ensuring fairness 1.1.4 . AI operator organisations should consider whether their AI systems are accessible and usable in a fair manner across user groups 21 1.1.5 . Consideration should be given to the effect of diversity on the development and deployment processes 1.1.5.1 . Eﬀorts could be made to include people from diverse demographic backgrounds in the development and deployment processes 1.1.5.2 . AI developer organisations should consider whether the assumptions they make about AI subjects could be wrong or are likely to lead to non-operational bias ; if so , they should consider consulting the AI subjects in a representative manner during development and deployment to conﬁrm these assumptions 1.2 . WE WILL MAKE AI SYSTEMS ACCOUNTABLE 1.2.1 . Accountability for the outcomes of an AI system should not lie with the system itself 1.2.1.1 . Accountability for loss or damages resulting from the application of AI systems should not be attributed to the system itself 1.2.1.2 . AI operator organisations and AI developer organisations should consider designating individuals to be responsible for investigating and rectifying the cause of loss or damage arising from the deployment of AI systems 1.2.2 . Positive efforts should be made to identify and mitigate any signiﬁcant risks inherent in the AI systems designed 1.2.2.1 . AI operator organisations should only use AI systems that are backed by respected and evidence-based academic research , and AI developer organisations should base their development on such research 1.2.2.2 . AI operator organisations should identify the likely impact of incorrect automated decisions on AI subjects and , in the case where incorrect decisions are likely to cause signiﬁcant cost or inconvenience , consider mitigating measures 22 EXAMPLE : A foreign country has a government service which identiﬁes parents who owe money in child maintenance . The data matching process is often incorrect due to misspelled names or missing data which results in some individuals being incorrectly targeted automatically by the system with the result being a large bill , poor credit ratings and even freezing wages . The recourse for individuals who are incorrectly targeted is time-consuming and not straightforward 4 . If the potential impact of incorrect decisions had been assessed , mitigation measures such a user-friendly review procedure could have been set up . 1.2.2.3 . AI operator organisations should consider internal risk assessments or ethics frameworks as a means to facilitate the identiﬁcation of risks and mitigating measures 1.2.2.4 . In designing AI systems to inform signiﬁcant decisions , AI developer organisations should consider measures to maintain data accuracy over time , including : • the completeness of the data ; • timely update of the data , and ; • whether the context in which the data was collected aﬀects its suitability for the intended use case EXAMPLE : A border camera scanning for predictors of risk may misinterpret a “ tic ” of an individual with Tourette syndrome as suspicious . These can manifest in a diverse fashion , and should not cause this person to undergo secondary inspection every time they pass through the border 5 . If the data is updated after the ﬁrst case is encountered then it would avoid causing inconvenience on subsequent visits . 1.2.2.5 . AI developer organisations and AI operator organisations should consider tuning AI models periodically to cater for changes to data and/or models over time 1.2.2.6 . AI operator organisations should consider whether AI systems trained in a comparatively static environment will display model instability when deployed in dynamic environments 4 Cabinet Oﬃce ( UK ) , Data Science Ethical Framework , Version 1.0 , licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0 , p. 13 5 Government of Canada .

Retrieved from : https : //docs.google.com/document/d/1Sn-qBZUXEUG4dVk909eSg5qvfbpNlRhzIefWPtBwbxY/edit23 EXAMPLE : AI systems will need to be able to adapt to the changes in the environment that they are deployed in . For example , a self-driving car would need to quickly adapt to unexpected and dangerous road by learning in real time from other cars that have successfully dealt with these conditions . In addition , such mission-critical applications must handle noisy inputs and defend against malicious actors 6 . 1.2.2.7 . AI operator organisations should consider working with their vendors ( AI developer organisations ) to continually monitor performance 1.2.2.8 . AI operator organisations should subject AI systems informing signiﬁcant decisions to quality checks at least as stringent as those that would be required of a human being taking the same decision 1.2.3 . SUSPENDED - AI systems informing critical decisions should be subject to appropriate external audit 1.2.3.1 . When AI systems are used for critical decisions , external auditing of the AI systems in question should be used as a means to ensure meaningful standards of transparency and accountability are upheld 1.2.3.2 . In the case that critical decisions are of civic interest , public release of the results of the audit should be considered as a means of ensuring public processes remain accountable to those aﬀected by them SUSPENSION NOTICE : Guideline 1.2.3. has been suspended until further notice . Reason : no external auditing mechanism has yet been established . 6 Stoica , I. et . al.,2017 , A Berkeley View of Systems Challenges for AI , p. 2 , https : //arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05855.pdf24 1.2.4 . AI subjects should be able to challenge signiﬁcant automated decisions concerning them and , where appropriate , be able to opt out of such decisions 1.2.4.1 . AI operator organisations which use AI systems to inform signiﬁcant decisions should provide procedures by which aﬀected AI subjects can challenge a speciﬁc decision concerning them 1.2.4.2 . AI operator organisations should consider such procedures even for non-signiﬁcant decisions 1.2.4.3 . AI operator organisations should make aﬀected AI subjects aware of these procedures , and should design them in a convenient and user-friendly way 1.2.4.4 . AI operator organisations should consider employing human case evaluators to review any such challenges and , when appropriate , overturn the challenged decision 1.2.4.5 . AI operator organisations should consider instituting an opt-out mechanism for signiﬁcant automated decisions EXAMPLE : A bank allows customers to apply for a loan online by entering their data . The bank uses an AI system to automatically determine whether to give the loan and what the interest rate should be . They provide users with an option to contest the decision and have it reviewed by a human 7 . They also require that customers justify their challenge by ﬁlling in a form , which assists the case reviewer and deters customers from challenging a decision without good reason . 1.2.4.6 . AI operator organisations could consider compensating aﬀected AI subjects in the case of loss or inconvenience caused by incorrect automated decisions 1.2.4.7 . AI operator organisations could consider “ crowd challenge ” mechanisms whereby a critical number of complaints triggers an investigation into the fairness and/or accuracy of a decision-making process as a whole 7 Adapted from EU Commission , Can I be subject to automated individual decision-making , including proﬁling ? Retrieved from : https : //ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/reform/rights-citizens/my-rights/can-i-be-subject-automatedindividual-decision-making-including-proﬁling_en # example25 1.2.5 . AI systems informing signiﬁcant decisions should not attempt to make value judgements on people ’ s behalf without prior consent 1.2.5.1 . When informing an AI subject about signiﬁcant choices they will make , AI systems should not unreasonably restrict the available options or otherwise attempt to inﬂuence their value judgements without the explicit consent of the AI subject in question 1.2.6 . AI systems informing signiﬁcant decisions should be developed by diverse teams with appropriate backgrounds 1.2.6.1 . AI developer organisations who develop AI systems which may be used to assist in making critical decisions should involve in the process experts with a background in social science , policy , or another subject which prepares them to evaluate the broader societal impact of their work 1.2.6.2 . Development of AI systems informing signiﬁcant decisions should include consultation with experts in the ﬁeld in which the system will be deployed EXAMPLE : An app that uses AI to assess medical symptoms and has a large user base had to face regulatory scrutiny because of number of complaints from doctors . They warned that the application can miss signs of serious illness . A number of diﬀerent shortcomings were identiﬁed by doctors , some of which the company could address and resolve 8 . 1.2.7 . AI operator organisations should understand the AI systems they use sufﬁciently to assess their suitability for the use case and to ensure accountability and transparency 1.2.7.1 . In the case of critical decisions , AI operator organisations should avoid using AI systems that can not be subjected to meaningful standards of accountability and transparency 1.2.7.2 . AI developer organisations should consider notifying customers and AI operator organisations of the use cases for which the system has been designed , and those for which it is not suitable 8 Financial Times . 2018 . High-proﬁle health app under scrutiny after doctor ’ s complaints . Retrieved from : https : //www.ft.com/content/19dc6b7e-8529-11e8-96dd-fa565ec5592926 1.3 . WE WILL MAKE AI SYSTEMS TRANSPARENT 1.3.1 . Traceability should be considered for signiﬁcant decisions , especially those that have the potential to result in loss , harm or damage 1.3.1.1 . For AI systems which inform signiﬁcant decisions , especially those with the potential to cause loss , harm or damage , AI developer organisations should consider building in traceability , i.e . the ability to trace the key factors leading to any speciﬁc decision 1.3.1.2 . To facilitate the above , AI developer organisations and AI operator organisations should consider documenting the following information during the design , development and deployment phases , and retaining this documentation for a length of time appropriate to the decision type or industry : • the provenance of the training data , the methods of collection and treatment , how the data was moved , and measures taken to maintain its accuracy over time ; • the model design and algorithms employed , and ; • changes to the codebase , and authorship of those changes 1.3.1.3 . Where possible given the model design , AI developer organisations should consider building in a means by which the “ decision journey ” of a speciﬁc outcome ( i.e . the component decisions leading to it ) can be logged EXAMPLE : A technology company has a product which is designed to assist in medical diagnosis . It documents each stage of its reasoning and relates it back to the input data 9 . 1.3.2 . People should be informed of the extent of their interaction with AI systems 3.3.2.1 . AI operator organisations should inform AI subjects when a signiﬁcant decision aﬀecting them has been made by an AI system 9 See IBM WatsonPaths27 EXAMPLE : A small claims court adjudicates minor civil matters such as debt collection and evictions . They introduce an AI system to suggest the outcome of a ruling . At the time of the ruling the plaintiﬀ and defendant are notiﬁed that the decision was assisted by an AI system . The court also provides an explanation for the decision . 1.3.2.2 . If an AI system can convincingly impersonate a human being , it should do so only after notifying the AI subject that it is an AI system EXAMPLE : A technology company produces a conversational AI agent which can make some phone calls on behalf of its users . Those who receive the calls may believe that they are speaking to a human . Therefore the company programs the agent to identify itself at the start of every conversation . 28 1.4 . WE WILL MAKE AI SYSTEMS AS EXPLAINABLE AS TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE 1.4.1 . AI operator organisations could consider providing affected AI subjects with a high level explanation of how their AI system works 1.4.1.1 . AI operator organisations could consider informing the aﬀected AI subjects in understandable , non-technical language of : • the data that is ingested by the system ; • the types of algorithms employed ; • the categories into which people can be placed , and ; • the most important features driving the outcomes of decisions EXAMPLE : A person turned down for a credit card might be told that the algorithm took their credit history , age , and postcode into account , but not learn why their application was rejected 10 . 1.4.1.2 . For non-sensitive public sector use cases designed for the common good , AI operator organisations could consider making source code , together with an explanation of the workings of the AI system , available either publicly or upon request ( this should be done only if there is low risk of people ‘ gaming the system ’ ) 1.4.2 . AI operator organisations should consider providing aﬀected AI subjects with a means to request explanations for speciﬁc signiﬁcant decisions , to the extent possible given the state of present research and the choice of model 1.4.2.1 . AI operator organisations should consider providing a means by which people aﬀected by a signiﬁcant decision informed by AI can access the reasoning behind that decision 10 The Guardian . AI watchdog needed to regulate automated decision-making , say experts . Retrieved from : https : //www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/jan/27/ai-artiﬁcial-intelligence-watchdog-needed-to-preventdiscriminatory-automated-decisions 29 EXAMPLE : The US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau requires that creditors in the US who reject credit applications must explain to the applicant the principal reason ( s ) why their application was rejected ( e.g . “ length of residence ” or “ age of automobile ” ) 11 . In particular , “ statements that the adverse action was based on the creditor 's internal standards or policies or that the applicant , joint applicant , or similar party failed to achieve a qualifying score on the creditor 's credit scoring system are insuﬃcient ” . 1.4.2.2 . Where such explainability is not possible given available technology , AI operator organisations should consider compromises such as counterfactual reasoning , or listing the most heavily weighted factors contributing to the decision EXAMPLE : The UK ’ s NHS developed a tool called Predict , which allows women with breast cancer to compare their case to other women who have had the same condition in the past , and visualize the expected survival rate under various treatment options . The website has an explanation page which shows the weights behind various factors and contains a description of the underlying mathematics 12 . 1.4.3 . In the case that such explanations are available , they should be easily and quickly accessible , free of charge and user-friendly 11 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , 12 CFR Part 1002 - Equal Credit Opportunity Act ( Regulation B ) , § 1002.9 Notiﬁcations , Retrieved from https : //www.consumerﬁnance.gov/policy-compliance/rulemaking/regulations/1002/ 12 Predict website , accessible at http : //www.predict.nhs.uk/predict_v2.1/legal/algorithm30 CHANGELOG VERSION STAGE DATE COMPLETEDSUMMARYOF CHANGES 1.0 1.11.21.3 1.4 1.51.61.71.81.9 1.10 1.11Consultation ConsultationConsultationConsultation Consultation Consultation ConsultationFeedbackFeedbackFeedback Internal Review Internal Review05/09/2018 06/09/201810/09/201810/09/2018 30/09/2018 01/10/201803/10/201809/10/201809/10/201810/10/2018 10/10/2018 30/12/2018 Initial draft Amendments prior to circulation Added deﬁnitions ; reworded guidelines accordingly Added examples Reformatting of examples Added deﬁnition of AI Reformatted & swapped some examples Incorporated ﬁrst round of feedback Edited examples ; miscellaneous other edits Miscellaneous edits Added bibliography Minor tweaks to wording , addition to introductionsection This document was produced by Smart Dubai in collaboration with Falcon and Associates.31 BIBLIOGRAPHY 1 .
