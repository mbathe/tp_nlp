Artificial intelligence ( AI ) and related technologies are among the most important drivers of change , and have an impact on every area of intellectual property rights ( IPR ) . This study has been drawn up as a tool for practitioners , shedding light on how these technologies are used bo th to safeguard copyright and design s and infringe them . Understanding the implications of these transformations is vital at a time when the Fourth Industrial Revolution ( 4IR ) is transforming virtually every area of the economy and society . We are seeing inventions and breakthroughs in the fields of autonomous transport , biotechnology , the Internet of Things ( IoT ) , smart devices , AI , 3D printing , robotics , and quantum computing . These inventions affect healthcare , transport , agriculture and law enforcement , among other fields , and the pace of global innovation has accelerated greatly during the last decade . According to some estimates , by 2023 there will be some 29 billion connected devices on the planet that use AI technologies , and the underlying algorith ms are becoming ever more central . Infringements of IP R through the malicious use of various new technologies , including AI , are on the rise , as reported by Europol ’ s European Cybercrime Centre ( EC3 ) , the EU Agency for Cybersecurity ( ENISA ) and the United Nations . In May 2021 , the EU ’ s Council of Ministers named IP crime as one of the top 10 priorities in the fight against organised crime for 2022 -2025 . This issue will be tackled through the European multi -disciplinary platform against criminal threats ( EM PACT ) . The European Union Intellectual Property Office ( EUIPO ) , via the European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights , will be actively involved in supporting the implementation of this priority under the EMPACT . 7 In this new era , it is critical that we adopt ‘ smart ’ intellectual property strategies , and the EUIPO , working with its network of partners and IP stakeholders , has been developing tools and promoting best practice s. This study represents another step on the journey to cre ating an IP excellence hub in which new technologies and AI work to protect legitimate businesses and citizens .

T he cycle begins with a digital file in which the item to be printed is digitally arranged using either 3D print ing software or a 3D scanne r. This digital file is then exported to a 3D printer , which uses dedicated software t o assemble the digital model into a physical object by building liquid material up in layers that then harden until the finished object emerges . Artificial intelligence : a subfield of computer science focuse d on develop ing computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence . These systems are designed by humans , and when given a complex goal can act in the physical or digital dimension . In the context of this study , AI is understood as c omputer code ( implemented in software and hardware ) that dynamically adapt s according to algorithmic rules as large datasets are processed , with the aim of predicting phenomena and assisting decision -makin g. Artificial neural networks ( ANN ) : comput er systems intended to mimic the way the human nervous system analyses and processes information . They are based on the functioning of the human brain , with interconnected neuron s that process information by tran smitting it towards ( inputs ) and away from ( outputs ) the brain . ANN s are a subset of machine learning ( ML ) systems and are at the centre of deep learning algorithms . Algorithm : a series of instructions and rules that a computer must follow to complete an assignment , which can be used to handle and process data and perform calculations or various other actions . Cloud computing : the p rocess of storing and accessing data and other programs on the internet rather than on a computer hard drive . Computer speec h : the c apability of a machine to apply speech recognition and synthesis to creat e human -like speech . AI can be used in speech recognition , natural language processing ( NLP ) , and translation . Several speech recognition applications are generated by automat ic speech recognition , conversion of audio to text , and processing the text to determine its meaning . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 11 Convolutional neural network ( CNN ) : a type of neural network that has one or more convolutional layers ( in which a filter is applied to an input that res ults in an activation ) . CNN s are mainly used for image processing , classification , and segmentation , as well as for other auto -correlated data . They are d eep learning neural network s designed for processing structured arrays of data such as images . Copyri ght : is a legal term used to describe the rights that creators have over their literary and artistic works . Works covered by copyright range from books , plays , music , paintings , photographs , sculpture , films and choreography , to computer programs , database s , advertisements , maps , technical drawings and architecture . For the purposes of this study , references to copyright include the ‘ related rights ’ set forth in copyright -related treaties administered by WIPO and relevant EU directives . Cryptography : the s tudy of mathematical techniques related to aspects of information security such as confidentiality , data integrity , entity authentication , and data origin authentication . Deep learning ( DL ) : a subset of machine learning that uses a special type of algorit hm known as a neural network and that is able to process a wider range of data resources . In some cases , it may require less human data pre -processing to achieve more accurate results than other machine learning approaches . DL must have more than three lay ers of neurons ( including input and output ) . Design : the appearance of the whole or a part of a product resulting from the features of , in particular , the lines , contours , colours , shape , texture and/or materials of the product itself and/or its ornamenta tion ( Article 3 of Regulation ( EC ) 6/2002 on Community designs ) . At international level , design rights are understood some what differently ; that is , non -EU countries may not recogni se a design as a stand -alone right . Instead , these countries may protect de signs through a combination of other intellectual property laws , such as patent , trade mark and copyright laws . Expert system ( ES ) : a subfield of AI concerning the use of a computer program designed to solve complex issues and imitate a human expert ’ s decision-making ability through extracting knowledge from its knowledge base and using reasoning and inference rules in accordance with user queries . Explainable AI ( XAI ) : a set of processes and methods that enables users to understand and trust the results generated by machine learning algorithms . XAI can be defined as AI that produces details or reason ing to make its functioning clear or easy to understand . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 12 Generative adversarial networks ( GANs ) : generative models used in machine learning frameworks that can create new data instances that resemble the training data . GANs are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks , pitting one against the other to generat e new , synthetic items of data that can pass for real data . Generative design : a design exploration process in which designers or engineers select specific goals to add to the generative design software , along with selected parameters including performance or spatial requirements , materials , manufacturing methods , and cost constraints . Infringement : a term that c overs direct ly IP-infringing acts as well as contributory and preparatory acts and other closely related illegal acts or criminal offences ( e.g . cybercrim e offences , money laundering , etc . ) Intellectual property ( IP ) : creations of th e mind , such as : inventions ; literary and artistic works ; designs ; and symbols , names and images used in commerce . IP is protected in law by patents , design , copyright , trade mark and trade secret law , which enable people to earn recognition or financial b enefit from the ir invent ions or creat ions . ( 1 ) Intellectual property infringement : the unauthorised use , translation , adaptation , reproduction , or sale of materials or products that are legally regarded as protected intellectual property ( IP ) , as defined in the relevant legislation . Internet of Things ( IoT ) : a network of physical objects – ‘ things ’ – that are embedded with sensors , software , and other technologies to connect and exchang e data with other devices and systems over the internet . These devices range from ordinary household objects to sophisticated industrial tools . Machine learning ( ML ) : a subfield of AI focuse d on creating applications that learn from data and can progressively improve their accuracy . This process allows the system to develop beyond the data and algorithms with which it was originally provided , with a view to achiev ing independent development and learning based on previous experience gained in the same manner . ( 1 ) WIPO , “ What is Intellectual Property ? ” https : //www.wipo.int/about -ip/en/ STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 13 Malicious software ( malware ) : software designed to carry out an una uthori sed process that will have an adverse impact on the privacy , integrity , or accessibility of an information system . This term commonly includes viruses , worms , Trojan horses , and other code -based process es that infect a host , as well as spyware , and s ome forms of adware . Natural language processing ( NLP ) : a subfield of AI focuse d on providing machines with the ability to read , understand and derive meaning from human languages . NLP adopts a cognitive approach by enabling the extraction of data to crea te relations , making it possib le to identify figures of speech and perform sentiment analysis . Quantum computing : an area of computing focused on developing computer technology based on the principles of quantum mechanics , a mathematical machine used to p redict the behaviours of microscopic particles or to measure instruments created to explore those behaviours . Recurrent neural network ( RNN ) : a type of artificial neural network that uses sequential or time series data . While traditional deep neural netwo rks assume that inputs and outputs are independent of each other , the output of recurrent neural networks depend s on the prior elements within the sequence . Reinforced learning : a behavioural model similar to supervised learning , but one in which the algorithm is not trained using sample data ; rather , the model learns through trial and error . The system must iteratively test solutions independently to discard or further develop them . This process is driven by ‘ rewards ’ for appropriate solutions and ‘ punish ments ’ for unsuccessful approaches . Robotics : a branch of engineering encompassing the conception , design , manufacture , and operation of robots . This field frequently overlaps with other related fields such as electronics , computer science , artificial intelligence , mechatronics , nanotechnology and bioengineering . Supervised learning : a category of machine learning in which the AI system starts by knowing the right answers by receiving a n input -output pair ; it must then adjust the algorithms so that the an swers are as accurate as possible from the existing dataset , meaning that supervised learning can calculate an out put when given a certain input . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 14 Trade secrets : a form of intellectual property that protects confidential information that may be sold or lic ensed . To be considered a trade secret , the information must be commercially valuable because it is secret , be known only to a limited group of persons , and be subject to reasonable steps taken by the rightful holder of the information to keep it secret , i ncluding the use of confidentiality agreements for business partners and employees . In the EU , civil protection of trade secrets is regulated by Directive ( EU ) 2016/943 on the protection of undisclosed know -how and business information ( trade secrets ) agai nst their unlawful acquisition , use and disclosure . Law enforcement varies depending on the criminal laws of each Member State . Unsupervised learning : a category of machine learning that processes a large amount of unlabelled data without an input -output configuration and uses algorithms to extract meaningful features needed to label , sort , and classify data in real time , without human intervention . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 15 Executive Summary Background In early 2019 , the European Union Intellectual Property Office ( EUIPO ) established an Impact of Technology Expert Group ( EG ) . The group is composed of experts with knowledge of and practical experience in monitoring the impact of new and emerging technologies on the infringement and enforcement of intellectual property rights . The EG follows a specific approach based on an adaptation of Lawrence Lessig ’ s ‘ Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace ’ theory ( the Code Theory ) , which describ es how human online activity is regulated by law , social norms , and the market , taking in to considerat ion the internet ’ s technical infrastructure ( referred to as ‘ code ’ ) . The Code Theory has been adapted by the EG in the sense that it believes all technologic al impact on intellectual property should be considered from four angles : the market ; the law ; the social context ; and the technology itself . Expert Group ’ s adaptation of Lessig ’ s Code Theory The approach followed in analys ing the impact of new technologies on IP can be described using the ‘ double -edged sword ’ metaphor shown in the figure below . Th e starting point is the consideration that the use of a particular technology either to infringe IP or to protect and enforce them presents , to some extent , the same features in each case . This metaphor also suggests that there may be weaknesses in the app lication of technologies on each side that can be exploited by the other . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 16 The ‘ double -edged sword ’ metaphor The EG developed a unique methodology called the ‘ Intellectual Property Tech Chain ’ , which is described in detail in its first report , publis hed in September 2020 , entitled ‘ Intelle ctual Property Infringement and Enforcement Tech Watch Discussion Paper 2020 ’ . According to this methodology , the development of any application follow s four steps : • exploration , i.e . assessing the technology to ascertain whether it could be used to infri nge or protect/enforce IP ; • conversion of the technology to enable the achievement of the identified goal ; • weaponi sation , i.e . finalising the application ’ s development ; • utilisation , i.e . actual monetisation or use of the application to infringe or protec t/enforce IP . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 17 The ‘ Intellectual Property Tech Chain ’ In 2021 , the EUIPO commissioned the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute ( UNICRI ) to carry out the first deep -dive research project applying this methodology in cooper ation with the Impact of Technology Expert Group . The current crime landscape was considered when drafting th is study . The yearly strategic Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment ( IOCTA ) report , produced by Europol ’ s European Cybercrime Centre ( EC3 ) , provide s an overview of the emerging threats and developments in the cybercrime landscape . In 2020 , the highest -priority threats included social engineering , ransomware , and other forms of malware . It is essential to consider the impact of the ‘ cyber - ’ element of cybercrime when analysi ng criminal activity , since it frequently has a bearing on nearly every a spect of this activity . In the recent IOCTA 2021 report , Europol listed the ransomware affiliate programs using supply -chain attacks to compromise the n etworks of large corporations and public institutions and deploy new multi layered extortion methods , overlayered mobile malware attacks , and distributed denial of service ( DDoS ) for ransom . Chapter 5 of this study will explain how these threats are also r elevant in the context of copyright and design s. The development and evolution of cybercrime must also be considered in conjunction with the misuse of AI , including in AI -facilitated IP crime . The emerging malicious use of AI can enhance the impact of cybercrime since it is able to perfect social engineering attacks at scale and , among others , it can be used : • for document -scraping malware to make attacks more efficient ; • to evade image recognition and voice biometrics ; STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 18 • to creat e ransomware attacks through intelligent targeting , evasion , and data pollution by identifying blind spots in detection rules ; • to improve blockchain capabilities in online crime . The relevance of addressing IP crime has also been raised as a priorit y in the current context . In May 2021 , the EU ’ s Council of Ministers included IP crime among the top 10 priorities in the fight against organised crime to be addressed in 2022 -2025 . On 26 May 2021 , the Council adopted the conclusions setting the 2022 -2025 EU priorities for the fight again st serious and organised crime through the European multi -disciplinary platform against criminal threats ( EMPACT ) . In this context , th is study aims to provid e an assessment of the impact of AI technologies on both the infringement and enforcement of copyr ight and design s. Methodology The purpose of this study is to analyse the impact of AI technologies on both the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s. These have much in common with the i nfringement and enforcement of other IPs ( e.g . tra de secrets , trade marks , and patents ) through the application of AI , but this study will not take these other types of IP specifically into consideration . This study is meant as a practical , practitioner -oriented tool to help understand the impact of AI a nd put th is impact into a broader perspective . To this end , 20 scenarios have been developed to demonstrate existing or potential misuse of AI technolog ies to infringe copyright ( and related rights ) and designs , as well as the use of AI to enforce these sa me rights . The focus of enforcement of the selected IP is the application of AI in the field of law enforcement . However , there are , and will be in the future , many relevant applications of AI that overlap or have many commonalities with voluntary enforcem ent measures , civil enforcement , and certain aspects of administrative enforcement . The data collection encompassed a variety of elements : a desk review study ; interviews and focus group discussions ; and case analysis . At the start of the project , the EUI PO facilitated contact with a broad group of experts ( including the Impact of Technology Expert Group ) , who were invited to contribute to and support the research . The researchers then contact ed other experts to supplement the information thus obtained . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 19 Generally , experts were identified based on their knowledge of and experience with AI technolog ies themselves , the copyright and design infringement and enforcement landscape , and ( in particular ) issues surrounding the application of AI in the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s. Many of the experts reviewed and commented on the methodology of the study , and all of them actively supported the research , including through participati on in group discussions and online interviews and , whenever possible , providing case studies . Key findings AI technologies have passed through different phases since the ir initial development , dating back to the late 1940s and early 1950s , but there is still no widely agreed -upon and precise definition of what AI is . It is commonly understood as a subfield of computer science focus ing on developing computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence . AI has various capa bilities , from sensing , reasoning , and acting to assessing and even predicting . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 20 AI has various subfields , each of which ha s its own specific aspects in addition to certain shared elements . These subfields pursue a number of operational objectives , including machine learning , natural language processing , computer vision , computer speech and expert systems . Quantum computing , although it is not necessarily linked to AI , could be used to enhance the capacity of AI applications , while explainable AI , encompassing a set of processes and methods , enables users to understand and trust the results generated by ML algorithms . Against this background , t he study found that there are multiple opportunities , drivers , limitations and concerns regarding the use of AI in infringement and enforcement of copyright and designs . There are several opportunities for AI to improve efficiency in detecting copyright and design infringements and in enforcing copyright and design rights , since it can be used to perform a number of different function s ranging from sensing , reasoning and acting to assessing and even predicting . Currently , the main areas of AI development are machine learning , natural language processing , computer vision , expert systems , and explainable AI . Explainable AI is currently receiving increased attention by e xperts and policy makers . Other technologies enhanced by AI , such as quantum computing , blockchain , 3D printing , generative design , cloud services , and robotics also have great potential . AI can identify and prioriti se risk s , instantly spot malware on a ne twork , guide incident STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 21 response , and detect intrusions before they occur . For example , machine learning stands out as a key AI subfield that can be used to develop law enforcement tools such as the analysis of large amounts of information to detect threats and identify social engineering bots , scanning of images to detect false pages or illicit content , improving automatic content recognition ( ACR ) tools , and providing insights to find infringement patterns . Natural language processing can be used to analys e and block cyberattacks like phishing , identify the behaviour of fraudsters , and create a correlation analysis aimed at promptly identifying infringements . Computer speech and computer vision are also successfully employed in this field . Some of the ir uses include pattern recognition to predict future infringements , detection of marketing of infringing goods , and the detection and analysis of fraudulent logos or other images . Quantum computing could be adopted to improve AI tools , enabling them to process larger amounts of data . For example , AI and quantum computing can be used by customs and law enforcement authorities to recognise patterns within large dataset s and identify similarities . Expert systems , on the other hand , can be used by law enforcement to decide which strategy is more adequate to protect a system from specific vulnerabilities , including those linked to copyright and design infringements . As for the drivers , the various capabilities of AI make it attractive for malicious actors . AI can emu late many acts performed by humans and in some instances can exceed human performance in terms of efficiency and scalability . Moreover , certain crimes – with the support of AI technologies – can be performed on a much larger scale , targeting thousands of v ictims simultaneously . As depicted by the double -edged sword metaphor , the same technologies can be used both by malicious actors and for enforcement purposes , including in the field of copyright and design s. Fraudsters and criminal groups employ or may employ the same AI techniques use d by enforcement agencies to overcome cybersecurity measures and evade detection . This is known as the ‘ AI/cybersecurity conundrum ’ : as AI matures and is increasingly used in the field of cybersecurity , the potential downside s of this technological advance increase as well . In this regard , adversarial machine learning could help to spot and to overcome cybersecurity measures , including breaking through defences and develop ing dynamic malware to evade detection . AI technologies can be used to make such attacks more efficient , as in the case of AI -supported password guessing and CAPTCHA breaking . Furthermore , natural language processing tools can be employe d to produc e deepfake music videos , and generative design -based tools can be used in the manufactur e of infringing copies . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 22 Finally , it is worth keeping in mind that there is always a human being behind any AI algorithm and its practical application vectors . Explainable AI , though it does not solv e all possible issues , could be used by law enforcement authorities as part of an increased use of innovative tools – including AI – in analysis and prediction , while at the same time better achieving the prerequisites of fairness , accountability and transparency . The use of AI in law en forcement and the judiciary should in any case always be subject to strong safeguards and human oversight through built -in human control . The current limitations of AI include , in particular : its dependenc e on a large amount of high -quality training data ; its inability to deal with long -tail problems ( i.e . the difficulty and cost required for AI to achieve strong performance at the ‘ long tail ’ of data distribution ) ; its limited versatility ; its dependenc e on specifi c application scenarios ; and the inherent biases of the AI ’ s developer . More powerful machine learning algorithms can learn complex non -linear relationships between input and output data , but to do so they require a large amount of quality data . Machines still need to understand the world through perceptual and cognitive learning in a more accurate manner , enabling them to simulate real-world scenarios through reinforcement learning to perceive information and then transform th at perceived information into abstract knowledge through attention , mem ory , and understanding . This might be achieved through the intersection , integration , and optimi sation of algorithms and the continuous improvement of academic study . In addition , notwithstanding the expanded use of innovation technologies in law enforceme nt , according to the interviews undertaken in the context of this study the actual use of these technologies by public authorities to enforc e copyright and design s is still generally limited . Furthermore , law enforcement and customs authorities will need t o continuously monitor the new technology landscape to ensure they are properly prepared and trained . Finally , the development and application of AI has raised some concerns related to ethic s , privacy and fundamental rights . As AI and related technologies are used to make determinations and predictions in areas of great importance such as combating criminality , including copyright and design related crime , AI has the potential to impact fundamental human rights in profound ways . AI algorithms are powered b y data collected and processed by technologies that increasingly surround us at every minute of our lives . Many experts argue that AI algorithms must be built to align with overarching human goals . The EU Parliament , in its recent Resolution of 6 October 2021 on artificial intelligence in criminal law and its use by the police and judicial authorities in criminal matters ( 2020/2016 ( INI ) ) , has clearly stated that ‘ AI should not be seen as an end in itself , but as a tool , with the ultimate aim of increasing human well - STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 23 being , human capabilities and safety ’ . As a result , the fundamental human right to privacy must be duly considered when data is collected by law enforcement authorities . Algorithms and AI should be ‘ ethical by design ’ , with no built -in bias , in a way that guarantees maximum protection of fundamental rights . The EU Parliament in the same resolution invites ‘ European stakeholders , including the Member States and the Commission , to ensure , through international cooperation , the engagement of partner s outside the EU in order to raise standards at international level and to find a common and complementary legal and ethical framework for the use of AI ’ . Policy makers are invited to be actively involved and to draw the legal boundaries within which these technologies are allowed to operate . Retroactive deconstruction of an algorithm may be required to assess the factors that influence a model ’ s predictions . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 24 1 Structure , background , and context of the study As an introduction to this study on the impa ct of artificial intelligence technologies on the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s , this chapter present s the study ’ s structure , as well as the background and overall context within which it was developed . 1.1 Structure and content o f the study The study comprises five chapters , two annexes and the bibliography . The present chapter describes the study ’ s background and context , starting from the current criminal landscape , which involves cybercrime and organised crim inal involvement i n IP crime . Chapter 1 also presents the ‘ Intellectual Property Tech Chain ’ methodology developed by the EUIPO ’ s Impact of Technology Expert Group , which is applied in the study , and the main elements of the EUIPO ’ s Strategic Plan 2025 ( SP2025 ) related to A I and its work in support of the European multi -disciplinary platform against criminal threats ( EMPACT ) . Chapter 2 outlines the study ’ s goals and target audience and presents its data acquisition and analysis methodology , including 20 fictional scenarios linked to two storylines concerning copyright and design s of physical products and digital content ; these scenarios illustrate the infringement and enforcement possibilities of AI . Chapter 3 introduces the background information relevant to understand ing the main technolog ical concepts used in the study . In addition , this chapter describes the main ‘ streams ’ and techniques of the technology that will be referred to in the fictional scenarios presented in Chapter 5 as possible infringement and enforcement tools . Finally , this chapter addresses the societal impact of AI technologies to help the reader understand the context in which these technologies operate or could operate in the future . Chapter 4 offers a bird ’ s -eye view of AI as applied in the infringem ent and enforcement of copyright and design s , focusing on various relevant AI technologies . The description of each technology aims to clarify its meaning and scope of application , in order to facilitate comprehension of the scenarios in STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 25 Chapter 5 . Alongsi de the ‘ streams ’ and techniques presented in Chapter 3 , these applications of AI illustrate its various elements and uses in combination with other tools . Chapter 5 presents 20 fictional scenarios related to the possible use of AI technologies and tools i n the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s. These scenarios are based on two storylines , one centr ing on physical products and another on digital content . Technolog ical tools were analysed for each scenario to provi de examples of the adopt ion of AI in both infringement and enforcement . The conclusion present s the k ey findings in terms of opportunities , drivers , limitations and concerns related to the use of AI in copyright and design s. Annex 1 contain s the list of experts who agreed to be interviewed and mentioned in the study , while Annex 2 provid es more in -depth information on the different aspects of AI technolog ies covered in the core text . 1.2 Current internet crime and artificial intelligence -supported crime threat landscape The cu rrent cybercrime landscape , and the role of artificial intelligence and new technologies in illegal activities on the internet , must be consider ed in assess ing these technologies ’ impact on the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s. AI and other n ew technologies represent opportunities for malicious actors , who can use them to facilitate and enhance their attacks , exploit new victims , and creat e more innovative criminal business models while reducing the chances of being caught ( 2 ) . The following c hapters of this study will describe in detail AI ’ s relevance to the field of IP and design infringement . Every year , Europol 's European Cybercrime Centre ( EC3 ) produces the Internet Organised Crime Threat Assessment ( IOCTA ) , focusing on emerging t hreats and developments in the cybercrime landscape . It is essential to consider the impact of the 'cyber - ' element of cybercrime in analys ing criminal activity , since it frequently has a bearing on nearly every a spect of this activity .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 26 In 2020 , the highe st-priority threats included social engineering , ransomware , and other forms of malware ; Chapter 5 of this Study will show how these threats are also relevant to copyright and design s. According to the IOCTA , cybercriminals have refine d their methods , maki ng their work available to others , for instance , through so -called Cybercrime -as-a-Service ( CaaS ) ( 3 ) . Criminal activi ty has in fact evolved significantly due to the supply of readily available data ( including personal and other sensitive information ) and the existence of a CaaS community helping criminals to carry out highly targeted attacks . In this context , data compromise is a central aspect of several threats . This is also true of copyright and design infringement . The development and evolution of cyb ercrime can also be considered in conjunction with the misuse of artificial intelligence , including in the AI -facilitated IP crime . In particular , the emerging malicious use of AI can enhance the impact of cybercrime . AI can undertake social engineering at tacks at a larger scale ; it can be used to make attacks by document -scraping malware more efficient ; and it can be used to evade image recognition and voice biometrics . AI -based ransomware attacks can perform intelligent targeting and evasion or data pollu tion by identifying blind spots in detection rules . Finally , AI can also improve blockchain capabilities in online crime . Law enforcement authorities , including those involved in the enforcement of IP and design s , face several challenges . T he ability of A I to upscale criminality without physical proximity , blurring jurisdiction and providing stronger tools for obfuscation and anonymi sation in the new criminal structures and methods , and the evolution of CaaS to offer more elaborate AI -supported services , in combination with decentrali sed blockchain solutions , are threats that need to be effectively addressed . In the recent IOCTA 2021 report , Europol emphasi sed that the current global pandemic has accelerated ongoing changes cybercrime , including innovation among cybercriminals , who have sought to capitalise on new opportunities . Among its key findings , Europol listed ransomware affiliate programs that use supply -chain attacks to compromise the networks of large corporations and public institutions and emplo y new multi -layered extortion methods , overlayered mobile malware attacks , and DDoS ( Distributed Denial of Service ) for ransom . Criminals also use the names of well -known Advanced Persistent Threat ( APT ) groups to scare their targets into complying with ra nsom demands . ( 3 ) Europol . ( 2021 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 27 Furthermore , IOCTA 2021 recogni sed that the pandemic continues to have a significant impact on the European online fraud landscape , where phishing and social engineering are still the principal vectors for payment fraud and investment fraud . However , business email compromise ( BEC ) and CEO fraud also remain key threats . In addition , dark web users are increasingly adopting anonymous cryptocurrencies . All these elements will be further analysed in the context of copyright and design s. The Eur opean Union Agency for Cybersecurity ( ENISA ) , in its 2021 ENISA Threat Landscape ( ETL ) annual report , confirm ed EUROPOL ’ s findings . The ELT identified the following primary threats : 1 ) ransomware ; 2 ) malware ; 3 ) cryptojacking ( 4 ) ; 4 ) email -related threats ; 5 ) threats against data ; 6 ) threats against availability and integrity ; 7 ) disinformation /misinformation ; 8 ) non-malicious threats ; and 9 ) supply chain attacks ( 5 ) . Cybercriminals are increasingly motivated by monetisation , including the monetisation of s tolen information through data auctions on the dark web and the increase d use of ransomware . Cryptocurrency continues to be the most common payout method for threat actors . Threats against data , frequently referred to as data breaches or data leaks , involve the release of sensitive , confidential , or protected data into an untrusted environment . One of the consequences of relevant threats against data that can be observed i s the fact that approximately 58 % of supply chain attacks were aimed at gaining acce ss to data ( predominantly customer data , including personal data and intellectual property ) . Compromise through phishing emails , and brute -forcing o f remote desktop services ( RDP ) remain , according to ENISA , the two most common ransomware infection vectors ( 6 ) . In 2021 , traditional DDoS campaigns have become more targeted , more persistent , and increasingly multi -vector , and have been amplified by the COVID -19 pandemic . The IoT is also used as a threat vector for DDoS . Attackers can build massive botnets to launch DDoS attacks or distribute malware ( 7 ) . While the threat of the criminal use and abuse of AI can be seen as overwhelming and far -reaching , it important to stress that th is technology also provides law enforcement authorities with potentially power ful tools , since it can enhance the current ly available tools by providing better data management for , inter alia , risk analysis , open -source intelligence ( OSINT ) techniques , and image and text ( 4 ) Cryptojacking is a type of cybercrime where a criminal secretly uses a victim ’ s computing power to generate cryptocurrency .

The current study will th erefore also present possi ble use s of AI technologies for the enforcement of copyright and design s. 1.3 IP crime among the top 10 priorities in the fight a gainst organised crime In Europe , t he fight against IP crime is also of great importance due to the involvement of criminal networks . In May 2021 , the EU ’ s Council of Ministers included IP crime among its top 10 priorities in the fight against organised crime ( 8 ) for 2022 -2025 ( 9 ) , which will be addressed through the European multi -disciplinary platform against criminal threats ( EMPACT ) . The 10 priorities that have been identified for 2022 -2025 are the following : 1 ) high-risk criminal networks ; 2 ) cyberattacks ; 3 ) trafficking in human beings ; 4 ) child sexual exploitation ; 5 ) migrant smuggling ; 6 ) drug trafficking ; 7 ) fraud , economic and financial crimes ; 8 ) organised property crime ; 9 ) environmental crime ; 10 ) firearms trafficking . EMPACT Priority 7 target s fraud , economic and financial crimes . It propos es , inter alia , ‘ to combat and disrupt criminal networks and criminal individual entrepreneurs involved i n IP crime and in the production , sale or distribution ( physical and online ) of counterfeit goods or currencies , with a specific ( 8 ) The United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime ( 2000 ) provides an internationally agreed upon definition of an organised criminal group as ‘ a group of three or more persons existing over a period of time acting in conce rt with the aim of committing crimes for financial or material benefit. ’ This defin ition was also adopted in the EU ’ s Council Framework Decision 2008/841/JHA of 24 October 2008 on the fight against organised crime .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 29 focus on goods harmful to consumers ’ health and safety , to the environment and to the EU economy ’ ( 10 ) . Through EMPACT , the EU has adopt ed an integrated approach to its internal security , involving measures that range from external border controls , police , customs and judicial cooperation to information management , innovation , training , prevention , and the external dimension of in ternal security . It began in 2010 , setting the EU ’ s law enforcement priorities , with a focus on serious and organi sed crime . It is an intelligence -led and EU Member State -driven cooperation instrument that allow s Member States , agencies , and other actors t o work closely to address key criminal threats , using tools such as law enforcement training and joint operation s to dismantle criminal networks and their structures and business models . EMPACT works with General Multi -Annual Strategic Plans ( MASPs ) acros s Common Horizontal Strategic Goals for all the Operational Action Plans ( OAPs ) that will be implemented within each plan . This approach aims to strengthen consistency and coherence among OAPs as well as the multi disciplinary and multi -agency approach . EMPACT continuously considers the role and impact of emerging technologies in its priority assessment . In this context , the EUIPO will be actively involved in supporting the implementation of this priority within the EMPACT framework ( 11 ) . 1.4 The EUIPO ’ s Impact of Technology Expert Group In 2019 , the EUIPO established an Impact of Technology Expert Group to discuss and monitor the influence of emerging technologies on the protection , infringement , and enforcement of intellectual property rights . The Expe rt Group ( EG ) follows a specific approach based on an adaptation of Lawrence Lessig ’ s ‘ Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace ’ theory ( 12 ) , which describes how human online activity is ( 10 ) EUROPOL ( 2021 ) .

Lessig ’ s Code Theory is applied by the EG in the sense that it believes all technologic al impact on IP should be considered from four angles : the market ; the law ; the social context ; and the technology itself ( see Figure 1 ) . Figure 1 – The EG ’ s adaptation of Lessig ’ s Code Theory The EG ’ s approach in analysing the impact of new technologies on IP can be described using the ‘ double -edged sword ’ metaphor shown in the figure below . The starting point is the consideration that the use of a particular technology either to infringe IP or to protect and enforce them presents to some extent the same features in each case . This metaphor also suggests that there may be weaknesses in the application of technologies on each side that can be exploited by the other ( 13 ) . ( 13 ) EUIPO ( 2020 ) .

According to th is methodology , the development of any application of a technology follow s four steps ( see Figure 3 below ) : • exploration , or assessment of the tech nology to ascertain whether it could be used to infringe or protect/enforce IP ; • conversion of the technology to enable the achievement of the identified goal ; • weaponisation , or finalisation of the application ’ s development ; • utilisation , or actual moneti sation or use of the application to infringe or protect/enforce IP .

The proactive approach refers to applications developed to achiev e a specific goal without respon ding to a specific threat . The reactive approach , on the other hand , refers to applications developed in response to a specific threat . In 2021 , the EUIPO commissioned the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute ( UNICRI ) ( 15 ) to carry out the first deep -dive research project applying th is methodology in cooperation with the Impact of Technology Expert Group . ( 15 ) The UNICRI team comprises Marco Musumeci , UNICRI Programme Manager , and three international consultants : Vittoria Luda di Cortemiglia , John Zacharia and Mariana Diaz Garcia . This team authored the study , with valuable contributions by the EUIPO ’ s Erling Verstergaard .

T he EUIPO ’ s Strate gic Plan 2025 ( SP2025 ) ( 16 ) aims to provide customer -centric services and contribut e to a stronger IP system , efficient enforcement , and better understanding of IP rights in a global and increasingly digital environment by building and promoting sustainable networks , thereby supporting competitiveness , innovation , and creativity in the EU . The SP2025 foresees three ‘ strategic drivers ’ . The first focuses on an ‘ interconnected , efficient and reliable IP system for the internal market ’ and the second is dedica ted to ‘ advanced customer -centric services ’ . The third , entitled ‘ dynamic organisational skill sets and an innovative workplace of choice ’ , includes a specific objective ( Goal 3.2 – Evolving with the Digital Era ) dedicated to innovation and artificial intelligence , represent ing a great opportunity for businesses .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 34 Goal 3.2 seek s further opportunities for the EUIPO to harness its current AI -based solutions in a wide variety of business cases , including formalities , classification , image search , goods and services comparison , and chatbots . To this end , machine learning , natural language processing and deep learning techniques will be employed . All these solutions will be described further in Chapter 3 . Quality control will be performed to avoid the most common pitfalls of machine learning implementation , namely discrimination , vulnerability to misuse , violation of privacy , failure to perform and lack of explainability ( 17 ) . 1.6 AI in criminal law and its use by the police and judicial authorities in criminal matters To conclu de this introductory chapter , it is important to emphasis e that the use of AI by police and judicial authorities is currently the subject of much debate in Europe . In October 2021 , the European Parliament issued a resolution on AI in criminal law and its use by the police and judicial authorities in criminal matters ( 18 ) . The resolution recogni ses AI ’ s strategic position and potential to generate subst antial benefits in terms of efficiency , accuracy , and convenience , and to increas e human well being , capabilities , and safety . However , it also emphasi ses the significant possible risks that it poses to fundamental rights and democracies based on the rule of law . One of the resolution ’ s central consider ations is the guarantee of fundamental rights and freedoms throughout the life cycle of AI and related technologies , especially during their design , development , deployment , and use . This should apply to the enforcement of the law under all circumstances . This perspective put s people at the centre , demanding an AI worthy of public trust that always works in the service of humans . The EU Parliament resolution also emphasises that AI systems should be designed so that they can always be shut down by a human operator . This needs to be accompanied by a clear model for assigning criminal responsibility for the potential harmful effects of AI systems , since regulatory provisions in this field must always maintain hu man accountability . The resolution emphasi ses that the use of AI in law enforcement may entail several significant risks to the fundamental rights of individuals , including : opaque decision -making ; various types of ( 17 ) EUIPO ( 2020 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 35 discrimination and errors inherent in th e underlying algorithm , which can be reinforced by feedback loops ; and risks to privacy and personal data , freedom of expression and information , the presumption of innocence , the right to an effective remedy and a fair trial , a nd individual freedom and se curity . In addition , AI systems used by law enforcement and the judiciary can be vulnerable to AI -powered attacks against information systems or data poisoning . For these reasons , the European Parliament highlights the importance of having AI systems that are safe , robust , secure , and fit for purpose , and that respect the principles of fairness , data minimisation , accountability , transparency , non discrimination and explainability . The issue of how to properly collect and present evidence of the use of AI is outside the scope of this study , as criminal law and procedure var y ( sometimes significantly ) among the different EU Member States in prescrib ing how investigators and prosecutors must collect and present electronic evidence . It is nonetheless importan t for investigators and prosecutors to keep in mind the issue of proper electronic evidence collection and presentation when AI is involved in a criminal copyright or design infringement case . Like other forms of electronic evidence , investigators must con sider how best to identify and preserve digital evidence establishing how a criminal has used AI to infringe copyright and design rights , and prosecutors must think strategically about how best to present this evidence properly and effectively in court to prove that a defendant has committed criminal copyright or design infringement . This process of identifying , preserving , and presenting electronic evidence can certainly be more challenging than it is with more traditional non -electronic evidence . Neverthe less , the challenges remain largely the same whether the electronic evidence relates to the use of AI or any other form of electronic evidence . For example , investigators and prosecutors will often have to work with digital -forensic experts regardless of t he type of electronic evidence in question . At the same time , investigators and prosecutors may have to identify and work with experts in the type of electronic evidence in question ( such as AI-related evidence ) as they build and prove their criminal copy right and design infringement cases . Therefore , investigators and prosecutors should keep abreast of the ways in which the emergence of new types of technology , such as AI , may impact how they collect electronic evidence of the use of this technology in a criminal investigation and present it in court during a criminal prosecution . 36 2 . Scope and methodology The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of artificial intelligence technologies and applications on both the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s. The study target s law enforcement officers , prosecutors , and judges , as well as policymakers , rights holders , and civil society , and is meant as a practical , user -friendly , and problem -oriented tool . It aims to be easily accessib le to an audience familiar with IP issues but without prior in -depth knowledge of AI technologies . For this reason , 20 different scenarios have been developed to illustrate possible copyright and design infringements using AI technologies , as well as the use of AI in the enforcement of copyright and designs . The scenarios have been devised to be well-suited for workshop discussion s , seminars and other means of capacity -building and networking . AI is an emerging and disruptive technology . It has a growing n umber of practical implications that will profound ly affect the protection , management , infringement , and enforcement of all types of IP . For the purposes of this study , the term ‘ infringement ’ cover s direct ly IP-infringing acts targeting copyright and des ign rights as well as similarly directed contributory and preparatory acts and other closely related illegal acts or criminal offences ( e.g . cybercriminal offences and money laundering ) . The following types of IP are the main focus of the study : • copyrigh t – digital content ; • copyright – applied art ; • copyright – other copyright -protected physical products ; • rights related to copyright – digital content ; • sui generis protection of databases – digital content ; • registered Community design s – products ; • registered Community design s – digital items ; • unregistered Community design s – products ; • unregistered Community design s – digital items ; • registered design rights in the European Union Member States ( EUMS ) – products ; • registered design rights in the EUMS – digital it ems . 37 The study deliberately uses examples of works that are undisputedly protected by either copyright or design rights to ensure that it focuses on the use of AI to facilitate infringement or enforcement of copyright and design rights . The following iss ues are outside the scope of the study : • substantive issues related to the protection of copyright and designs ; • questions about the examination of design applications ; • questions about documentation systems for unregistered rights ; • management of the rights in question ( e.g . individual and collective management of copyright and related rights ) . Nor does the study cover the topics dealt with in the study on copyright and new technologies by the Directorate -General for Communications Networks , Content and Tec hnology ( DG CNNCT ) ( 19 ) , such as ownership of works created with AI , or AI data used in AI mining . Significant effort ha s been made to ensur e that the study does not overlap with other research projects and initiatives . This ensure s that its results provid e an original perspective and will provide many readers with an eye -open ing survey of a technology that is growing quickly in importance for business es , consumers , and society as a whole . The study cover s the following technologies : • existing AI technolog ies and related applications ; • AI technologies and applications that are likely to be developed in the foreseeable future ; • quantum computing -related AI ; • combinations of AI and other emerging technologies ( e.g . blockchain and robotics ) ( 19 ) EC ( 2020 ) .

The UNICRI team carried out a preliminary thorough examination of existing reports and literature related to AI and IP infringement - and e nforcement -related issues , as a basis for the study . Two storylines and 20 scenarios in which AI is used for the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design For the assessment of the possible use of AI technologies and tools in copyright and des ign infringement and enforcement , the research team has developed twenty practical fictional scenarios related to two main storylines , one related to physical products and the other to digital content , which are thoroughly presented in Chapter 5 . The two s torylines developed by UNICRI are imaginary but have been developed based on actual cases or on situations that may become possible in the near future in light of current technological developments . • Storyline α concerns copyright and design s of physical products developed by a famous fashion company and their infringement and enforcement by a criminal group us ing AI to make their criminal activities more effective ; • Storyline b concerns copyright and design s of digital content developed by a famous digital media conglomerate , and their infringement and enforcement by a criminal group working online using AI technolog ies . The two storylines and the twenty fictional scenarios were used as basis for the interviews with experts . The infringements described in the current study are of such a scale and nature that in one or more EU Member States they would constitute serious offences and would most often be carried out by 39 organi sed crim inal groups ( 20 ) . In addition , in the context of the storylines and scenarios , enforcement specifically refer s to law enforcement authorities ’ efforts against serious and organi sed crim e. Discussions and interviews with experts The EUIPO Observatory ’ s Impact of Technology Expert Grou p and other experts have been actively involved in defining the scenarios and in the different phases of the research . Representatives from other departments of the EUIPO also supported the research . UNICRI and the EUIPO organised interviews and group dis cussions with the selected experts via video conference calls . Experts involved in the research who agreed to be acknowledged in the study are listed in Annex 1 . The activities shown in Figure 5 below were undertaken across four phases between March and November 2021 .

Introduction to artificial intelligence This chapter presents the main concepts and capacities of AI and an overview of its subfields . More in-depth information on the evolution of the technology , AI streams and layers , a nd capacities can be found in Annex 2 Additional information on AI ’ . This section explor es the technology , descri bing several concepts rel evant to AI which will be used in the followin g chapters when describing its applications in protect ing , infringing , or enforc ing IP . 3.1 What is artificial intelligence ? 3.1.1 The concept of AI Over the course of its evolution ( 21 ) , artificial intelligence has been defined in different ways ( 22 ) , but there is still no widely agreed -upon and precise single definition of the concept . AI is commonly understood as a subfield of computer science that focuses on the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that would normally require human intelligence ( 23 ) . These systems are designed by humans and , when given a complex goal , act in the physical or digital dimension by : 1. perceiving their environment through data acquisition , 2. interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data , 3. reasoning on the knowl edge , or processing the information , derived from this data and 4. deciding the best action ( s ) to take to achieve the given goal ( 24 ) .

In the context of this study , AI is understood as follows ( 26 ) : Definition of AI used in the study Computer code ( software and hardware ) that , according to algorithmic rules , dynamically adapt s as large datasets are processed with the aim of predicting phenomena and assisting decision -making . 3.1.2 . AI capacities AI can be seen as an attempt to simulat e certain human intelligence processes in computer systems , particularly learning , reasoning , planning , self -correction , problem -solving , knowledge representation , perception , motion , manipulation , and creativity ( 27 ) . In this regard , AI systems are primarily advanced learning systems . With the application of AI , a machine can learn to perform a tas k previously performed by a human with li ttle or no human intervention . Some of the techniques encompassed by AI include : advanced statistics -based machine learning algorithms and multi -task learning algorithms ; deep learning executed in a multiple layer n eural network ( a computer framework imitating the human brain ) ; and prediction models to support decision -making and other kinds of probabilistic reasoning that combine deductive logic with probability theory ( 28 ) .

Figure 6 – AI capacities 3.1.3 AI streams AI has been used in different areas , and can be divided into several streams depending on the respective system ’ s functioning . The various elements of AI can be combined to add numerous features to an application , or they can be used solely to perform specific tasks . Robotics and quantum computing are related technologies that are considered relev ant in the context of this study when used in combination with AI streams . At the foot of the pages in this section is a legend introducing a colour code for the different AI streams in question .

They can be defined as a series of instructions and rules that a computer must follow to complete an assignment . They can be used to handle and process data and perform ca lculations or act in various ways ( 29 ) . Algorithms are used in AI technologies to calculate and process data and to automate reasoning ; in the latter case they do not only follow explicitly programmed instructions but are designed to allow computers to lear n on their own from ( 29 ) ThinkAutomation .

Algorithms used in AI can be broadly divided into classification algorithms and those suited to other applications such as regression , ranking , and labelling , which separate subject variab les into various classes and then predict the class for a given input ( 31 ) . Algorithms enabl e the development of different AI tools that can be used to protect designs and other IP , as well as for enforcement purposes . Algorithms can enhance the capabiliti es of existing tools and expand their use to other areas . 3.2 AI subfields Artificial intelligence is divided in to various subfields , each of which has its own specific aspects in addition to certain shared elements and pursue s different operational obj ectives . The ma jor relevant subfields are summarised below to facilitat e understanding of the scenarios presented in Chapter 5 . ( 30 ) DeAngelis , S. F. ( 2015 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 45 Figure 8 – AI subfields 3.2.1 Machine learning ( ML ) Machine learning ֎ is a subfield of AI that focuses on the creation o f applications that learn from data and are able to progressively improve their accuracy ( 32 ) . This process allows the system to increasingly develop beyond the data and algorithms originally supplied to achieve independent development and learning based on previous experience gained in the same manner ( 33 ) . The initial algorithms used in the process of programming ML are the starting point for the development of new algorithms , and if the new algorithms prove more meaningful and efficient during the learning process , ( 32 ) IBM Cloud Educat ion .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 46 the system will continue to work with them independently ( 34 ) . ML has become one of the main elements used in AI to develop possible copyright and design protection tools for law enforcement , as explained in more detail in the scenarios presented in Chapter 5 . Some of the uses of ML for enforcement include analysis of large amounts of information to detect threats , identification of social engineering bots , scanning of images to detect f raudulent pages or illicit content , improving automatic conten t recognition tools , and providing insights to find infringement patterns . On the other hand , as will be mentioned in the same scenarios , ML can also be used for infringement . The technology can be used to learn from social media and create fraudulent profiles or imitate real ones , scan websites to identify price changes and popular products , develop smart phishing attacks , automatically eliminate watermarks , and identify patterns to exploit personal information . It can also be combined with computer vision to create f raudulent registration pages and invoices . The operation of ML follows four main steps : 1 . Firstly , the training data is prepared . This is a dataset representative of the data the ML model will process to solve the issue it is designed to addres s ( 35 ) . 2 . Secondly , an advanced training algorithm is chosen to create the model . 3 . Third ly , the model is trained to learn a specific task . Training the model means running data inputs through the algorithm to compare the output with the results it should have produced , adjusting it so it yield s a more accurate result , and repeating the process until the algorithm regularly returns the correct result ( 36 ) . 4 . Finally , the model is used with new data to test its accuracy and effectiveness over time ( 37 ) . Several d ifferent types of ML and ML models can be distinguished . • Artificial neural networks ( ANNs ) ( 34 ) Kreutzer , R. ( 2020 ) . Op . cit . ( 35 ) IBM Cloud Education . ( 2020 ) . Op . cit . ( 36 ) IBM Cloud Education . ( 2020 ) . Op . cit . ( 37 ) IBM Cloud Education . ( 2020 ) . Op . cit . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 47 Artificial neural networks are ML models that mimic the way the human nervous system analyses and processes information ( 38 ) . ANNs are the foundation of AI ; they address issues that would prove almost unsolvable by human or statistical methods , and have self -learning capabilities that allow them to generate better results as more data becomes available ( 39 ) . ANNs are based on the functioning of the human brain , with interc onnected ‘ neuron ’ nodes responsible for processing information by transmitting it towards ( inputs ) and away ( outputs ) from the brain ( 40 ) . Processing units act as the base that is fed with inputs and outputs , while inputs are the source from which the ANN l earns to produce the desired output ( 41 ) . Moreover , ANNs adopt a set of learning rules called ‘ backpropagation ’ , or backward propagation of error , to improve their output ( 42 ) . • Generative adversarial networks ( GANs ) GANs are generative models used in ML fra meworks that can create new data instances that resemble the training data ( 43 ) . They are algorithmic architectures that use two neural networks , pitting one against the other to generate new , synthetic items of data that can pass for real data ( 44 ) . GANs ar e widely used to generate images , videos , and voices ( 45 ) . They can create images that resemble real photographs of human faces even though they do not portray any real individual ( 46 ) . GANs are also known for their role in the generation of fake media conte nt , including the creation of ‘ deepfakes ’ ( 47 ) . A deepfake is a specific type of synthetic media in which an individual in an image or video is replaced with another ’ s likeness ( 48 ) ( 49 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 48 • Supervised learning In the supervised learning process , the AI system starts by knowing the right answers , and must then adjust the algorithms so that the answers are as accurate as possible given the existing dataset ( 50 ) . In this case , the algorithm ’ s objective algorithm is already known , and humans must identify each eleme nt of the input data and the output variables ( 51 ) . Therefore , the algorithm is trained on the entered data to identity the connection between the input and output data points ( 52 ) . This type of learning requires a small amount of training data and facilitat es training because the results of the model can be compared to real labelled results . Text and image classification are common applications of this process ( 53 ) . • Unsupervised learning Unsupervised machine learning processes a large amount of unlabelled da ta and uses algorithms to extract meaningful features needed to label , sort , and classify the data in real time without human intervention ( 54 ) . Unsupervised learning focuses less on the automation of decisions and predictions ( although in some cases it sti ll makes predictions , e.g . to predict the next word in a sentence ) and more on recogni sing patterns and relationships in data that humans would be unlikely to identify ( 55 ) . In unsupervised learning , the system does not have predefined target values . Theref ore , it must independently recogni se similarities and patterns in the data ( 56 ) . To achieve this , the algorithm receives unlabelled data in which it independently recogni ses a structure , enabling the identification of data groups that exhibit similar behavi our or similar characteristics ( 57 ) . • Reinforced learning ( 50 ) Kreutzer , R. ( 2020 ) . Understanding artificial intelligence : Fundamentals , use cases and methods for a corporate AI journey . Cham , Switzerland : Springer . ( 51 ) Kreutzer , R. ( 2020 ) . Op . cit .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 49 Reinforced learning is similar to supervised learning , except that the algorithm is not trained using sample data ; rather , it learns through trial and error ( 58 ) . The system must iteratively test solutions independently to discard and/or further develop them ; at the same time , this process is driven by ‘ rewards ’ for appropriate solutions and ‘ punishments ’ for unsuccessful approaches ( 59 ) . This approach is often adopted when only a small amount of traini ng data is available , when the ideal outcome can not be clearly defined , or when something can only be learned from interaction with the environment ( 60 ) . During the reinforced learning process , the algorithm automatically optimi ses its actions by constantly correcting itself ( 61 ) . • Deep learning ( DL ) Deep learning uses special ly design ed neural networks able to process a wider range of data resources . These networks requir e less human pre -processing of the data but frequently provide more accurate results tha n other ML approaches ( 62 ) . ‘ Deep ’ refers to the large number of layers in the neural network ( 63 ) . The algorithms used in DL are ANN s ( see below ) requiring large amounts of data that go through multiple layers of calculations ; they apply different weights a nd biases at each successive layer to repeatedly adjust and improve the results ( 64 ) . DL models are usually unsupervised or semi -supervised , and reinforcement learning models can also be DL models ( 65 ) . ( 58 ) IBM Cloud Education . ( 2020 ) . Op . cit . ( 59 ) Kreutzer , R.

Rather than interpret ing a text or speech based on its keywords , which was the previously used mechanical method , NLP adopts a cognitive approach by analysing the meaning behind those words ( 67 ) . It is therefore the branch of AI that allows computers to under stand , interpret , and manipulate human ( 66 ) Lopez Yse , D. ( 2019 ) .

NLP is a tool for content extraction , classification , machine translation , question answering , and text generation . Subsets of NLP include natural language understanding ( NLU ) , concerning machine reading comprehension , and natural language generation ( NLG ) , used to transform data into words understood by humans ( 69 ) . In addition , NLP m ay use ML and DL methods to effectively absorb and process unstructured speech and text dataset s ( 70 ) . As will be explained in Chapter 5 , NLP is also relevant for law enforcement , since it can analyse and block cyberattacks like phishing , identify the behaviour of fraudsters , and create a correlation analysis . NLP is also mentioned in Chapter 5 as a tool for infringement in ce rtain situations , such as the creation of text in fraudulent emails and communications and the replication of text to create fraudulent registration pages for goods or other official documents . There are several different application s of NLP . • Text-to-speech ( TTS ) Text-to-speech is a type of speech synthesis application that generate s a spoken audio version of the text in a computer document with the goal of rendering natural -sounding speech signals for downstream applications , including assistant devices such as Google ’ s Assistant , Amazon ’ s Echo , and Apple ’ s Siri ( 71 ) . • Speech -to-speech ( STS ) Speech -to-speech process es a speech input to generate another speech output , for example in translation applications or in digital personal assistants ’ question and an swer sequences ( 72 ) . • Text-to-text ( TTT ) ( 68 ) Overby , S.

AI is used in different areas related to the imitation of human speech , for example , speech recogniti on and translation ; furthermore , several speech recognition applications are powered by automatic speech recognition and NLP ( 77 ) . Automatic speech recognition is the conversion of audio to text , while NLP refers to the processing of text to determine its m eaning ( 78 ) . In Chapter 5 , the use of computer speech for infringement can be observed in the imitation of existing voices and designs . However , it can also be used for enforcement , for instance in identif ying online marketing of infringing products . 3.2.4 Computer vision Computer vision ֎ refers to the processing of signals that represent images , training computers to interpret and understand the visual world ( 79 ) . It follows three main steps : 1. the system acquires an image for analysis in real time through video , photos or 3D technology ; 2. it process es the image through a previously trained model ( 80 ) ; 3. it understands the image through an interpretative process ( i.e . it implements the model to perform a specific task ) in which an object is identified or classified ( 81 ) . Computer vision can be u sed in the segmentation of images for separate examination , advanced object detection , facial recognition , detection of the outside edge of an object or landscape for better identi fication of the content , pattern detection , image classification , and featur e matching ( 82 ) . Computer vision can provide various support tools for enforcement , as will be shown in the scenarios in Chapter 5 . Some of its uses include pattern recognition to predict future infringement , detection of ( 76 ) Horowitz , J. H. ( 2020 ) . Op . cit . ( 77 ) Horowitz , J. H. ( 2020 ) . Op . cit .

The use of computer vision for infringement is also described in the scenarios , as it can enable the copy ing of popular product designs , colo urs and shapes , and detect and replicate patterns in visu al anti counterfeiting technology . In addition , it can be combined with other technologies to create fraudulent registration s or invoices . Computer vision not only enable s systems to derive meaningful information from visual inputs , but also allows them t o take action or make recommendations based on that information ( 83 ) . Convolutional neural network s ( CNN s ) and DL are used for this purpose ( 84 ) . DL uses algorithmic models to allow the computer to teach itself about the context of visual data , while CNN s help the DL model to ‘ see ’ by dividing the images into labelled pixels ( 85 ) . The neural network iteratively assesses the accuracy of the predictions until the predictions start to come true , allowing the computer to recogni se images in a way similar to humans ( 86 ) .

Quantum comput ing is not necessarily linked to AI , but could be used to enhance the capacity of AI applications . Every computer application is composed of ‘ bits ’ in some combination of ones and zeroes ( 87 ) . An ordinary computer uses micro chips on which transistors act as switches that can either be in the ‘ off ’ position ( represented by a zero ) or the ‘ on ’ position ( represented by a one ) ( 88 ) . Quantum computers use ( 87 ) Katwala , A . ( 2020 ) . Quantum computing and quantum supremacy , explained . https : //www .wired.co.uk/article/quantum computing -explained . ( 88 ) Katwala , A .

Dataset s are becoming larger and more complex , placing considerable strain on current computer systems . A number of issues related to problem -solving and capability restrictions are expected to be solved in seconds through the use of quantum computing . Certain technologies , such as AI , and in particular ML , can benefit from progress in quantum computing ( 90 ) . At present , nearly all the industrial applications of AI are based on supervised learning , and are used for image re cognition or consumption forecasting . In the area of finance , AI and quantum computing can help improve fraud detection . Moreover , quantum computing -trained models could be used to detect patterns that would be almost undetectable with conventional equipme nt . Finally , the acceleration of algorithms could allow machines to handle high volume s of data ( 91 ) . In the scenarios in Chapter 5 , quantum computing is mentioned as a technology that could improve AI tools , enabling them to process larger amounts of data . For example , AI and quantum computing can be used by customs and law enforcement authorities to recognise patterns in large dataset s and identify similarities . On the other hand , the same capabilities can be used to improve tools used for infringement . ( 89 ) Katwala , A . ( 2020 ) . Op . cit . ( 90 ) Marr B . ( undated ) .

ESs are based on ‘ knowledge engineering ’ , in which knowledge about the specific domain is acquired from human experts and other sources ( 95 ) . The main feature of an ES is the accumulation of knowledge in its databases , from which conclusions are gene rated by the inference engine ( 96 ) . Areas of application include classification , diagnosis , monitoring , process control , design , scheduling and planning , and option generation ( 97 ) . Expert systems also provide valuable tools to minimi se the risks presented i n the scenarios in Chapter 5 , as they can help law enforcement authorities to decide which strategy is mo st adequate to protect a system from specific vulnerabilities .

XAI can be defined as AI that produces details or reason ing to make its functioning clear or easy to understand ( 99 ) . It describe s an AI model , in addition to its expected impact and potential biases ( 100 ) . Furthermore , XAI helps to determin e a model ’ s precision , fairness , transparency , and results in AI based decision making ( 101 ) . One of the challenges in the development and implementation of AI is that humans need to comprehend and retrace how the algorithm arrives at an output , a calculation known as a ‘ black box ’ , which is almost impossible to interpret ( 102 ) . Black box models a re derived directly from the data , and not even the algorithm ’ s creators can fully comprehend or explain what exactly the algorithm does or how it obtain s a specific result ( 103 ) . Full understand ing of how an AI -enabled system has arrived at a specific outp ut is extremely useful , since it can help developers to ensur e that the system operates as expected , which may be required if the system is to meet regulatory standards . Explainability may also be essential in allowing those affected by a decision to chall enge or change th e outcome ( 104 ) . XAI can be used in the scenarios in Chapter 5 to better understand the ML process es used in different tools and consequently to improve th ose tools . However , XAI can also be used by infringers to understand and improve their own tools . ( 98 ) IBM . ( n.d. ) . Explainable AI . https : //www.ibm.com/watson/explainable -ai .

The impact of AI on our society has had , and will in the near future have , far-reaching economic , legal , political and regulatory implications ( 107 ) . These new technolog ies will transform societies in areas such as safe transport , mobility , security , health , media content recognition , service quality , and employment ( 108 ) . The s ocial impact s of AI will clearly affect the economy and the labour force . The present study will focus on AI technologies ’ impact on crime , law enforcement and criminal justice , taking into account the relevant ethical and fundamental rights -related issues ( including data protection and privacy concerns ) . Further observations on these issues are provi ded in Annex . In the E uropean Union , the discussion around AI and its various implications is very lively and has resulted in a number of EU Parliament resolutions . At the global level , the United Nations has put in place a number of important initiatives related to AI ’ s role in sustainable development . While AI technologies may support breakthroughs in achieving the UN ’ s Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , they may also have unanticipated consequences that will exacerbate inequalities and negatively affect individuals , societies , economies and the environment ( 109 ) . 3.4 The EC ’ s proposal for AI regulation Finally , this chapter will conclude with an overview of current legal initiatives around AI in the EU . The European Commission is in the process of taking important regulatory steps in this field . The E U overall approach to AI aims to ensure that any AI improvements are based on rules that safeguard the functioning of markets and the public sector , and people ’ s safety and fundamental rights , as ( 106 ) DBI ( n.d ) .

In 2020 , the EC ’ s white paper on ‘ AI – A European approach to excellence and trust ’ set out policy options on promoti ng AI while addressing the risks associa ted with certain uses ( 111 ) . In 2021 , the EC published a proposal for a regulation laying down harmonised rules on AI . The proposal aims to develop an ecosystem of trust by proposing a legal framework for reliable AI , based on the EU ’ s values and fundamental rights , to give people the confidence to embrace AI and encourag e its development by businesses ( 112 ) . The proposed legal framework , which is still under discussion , addresses the risks posed by the various uses of AI systems while at the same time promoti ng innovation , recognising the need to preserve individual safety and fundamental rights without overly inhibiting AI innovation . To this end , a risk -based approach is suggested ( 113 ) . The gradation of risks is represented as a four -level pyramid : unacceptab le risk s , high risk s , limited risks , and minimal risk s ; further information is available in Annex . In 2021 , the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence 2021 Review puts forward a concrete set of joint actions for the European Commission and Member States on how to create EU global leadership on trustworthy AI ( 114 ) .

A bird ’ s-eye view of AI applied in infringement and enforcement of copyright and design This chapter will provid e a bird s-eye view of the various AI technologies that have been found relevant to this study . They are presented briefly , without technical explanation s of precisely how they are built or how they function ; rather , the purpose is to clarify their meaning and scope of application and allow a proper understanding of the fictional scenarios in Chapter 5 . The weaponisation and monetisation of AI also feature in the following sections , since the development of AI tools and their use both to protect and infringe IP can be observed in the subseque nt examples and scenarios . It is must be emphasised that AI and related technologies are tools . They are neither good nor bad in themselves . Rather , i t is the use of these technologies that determines whether they are beneficial or harmful . ‘ Technology is neither good nor bad ; nor is it neutral ’ ( 116 ) . The legend at the foot of the page links the different technologies presented in this chapter with the AI streams introduced in Chapter 3 . The listing of t echnologies below is not meant to suggest any rank ing in terms of frequency or seriousness . ֎֎ 4.1 AI-supported malware Malicious software , or ‘ malware ’ is software designed to carry out an unauthori sed process that will adverse ly affect the privacy , integrity , or accessibility of an information ( 116 ) Kranzberg M. ( 1986 ) . “ Technology and Culture ” , Vol . 27 , No 3 , July , pp . 544-560 . The Johns Hopkins University Press . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 65 system . This software commonly include s virus es , worm s , Trojan horse s , and other code -based entities that infect a host , as well as spyware and some forms of adware ( 117 ) ( 118 ) . The use of AI to improve the effectiveness of malware is still in an experimental phase , but its monetisation and weaponization are expected to increase in the near future : AI-supported and AIenhanced cyberattack s that have been studied are proof that criminals are already taking steps to broaden the ir use of AI ( 119 ) . Artificial Intelligence can be used maliciously to control malware in order to creat e more convincing spam , evade detection , and better adapt itself to each target ( 120 ) . Cybercriminals might be able to determine how AI-powered security software identif ies malware , enabling them to adapt t heir own software and easily evade detection . In some cases , the samples can be modified to trick the AI into flagging legitimate files as malware , triggering false positives ( 121 ) . AI-supported malware could be integrated in to a variety of techniques to enhance their negative impact : chang ing the malware ’ s behaviour and characteristics based on context , eliminating itself when it suspects it is being analysed , and performing malicious activities only on specified systems ( 122 ) . Furthermore , malware prog rammers could train security solutions that use ML to preserve certain malicious files or to produce false positives . Specifically , AI malware might be used to ( 123 ) : 1. solve the CAPTCHA authentication method ( Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart ) using ML ( 124 ) ; ( 117 ) For more information see CERN .

This last approach is kno wn as ‘ deep targeting ’ , which usually refers to techniques used in marketing to learn the behaviours , habits , and values of a person or group in order to create successful advertising campaigns ( 126 ) . As illustrated in the previous examples , cybercriminals c an use this end user behavioural analysis ( UBA ) to learn user conduct and blend into their targets ’ environment ( 127 ) . UBA technology searches for patterns of usage indicating unusual or anomalous behavio urs ( 128 ) . However , anti-malware security measures can a lso be improved by adopting AI tools such as ML . Beyond adding malware samples to security software , AI can also detect future versions and similar variants of the same malware , as it enables the evaluation , organisation , and condensation of threat variant s ( 129 ) . In this case , AI must be continuously supervised and adjusted by humans , since if the ‘ weave ’ of the neural net is too wide , malware may evade detection , and if it is too fine , the security solution may trigger false positives ( 130 ) . AI-supported mal ware is one of the infringement -related issues mentioned in the scenarios in Chapter 5 , due to its role in the use of fake identities in phishing attacks and the creation of false documents . The complexity of the attacks performed with AI -supported malware can itself be targeted by specialised law enforcement units using AI tools such as ML , as described in the scenarios .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 67 ֎ 4.2 AI cloud services Cloud computing refers to the process of storing and accessing data and other programs over the internet instead of the computer ’ s local hard drive ( 131 ) . Cloud computing services have increasingly become the target of attacks , as they store large amount s of company and user data , and some companies also use them to operate consumer services such as email and photo libraries ( 132 ) . Existing types of cloud application services include Infrastructure -as-a-Service ( IaaS ) , which allows the us er to pay for services based on usage , and frequently covers the rental of storage , networks , operating systems , servers , and virtual machines ( VMs ) ( 133 ) ( 134 ) . Another type is Platform -as-aService ( PaaS ) , which was created to facilitate web creation and mob ile app design by providing an inbuilt infrastructure of servers , networks , databases , and storage that is automatically updated and managed ( 135 ) . Finally , Software -as-a-Service ( SaaS ) is a type of cloud application service in which the cloud provider perfo rms management and maintenance tasks ( 136 ) . The role of cloud services in AI can be seen in t certain machine learning tasks such as batch processing , serverless computing , predictive analytics , and orchestration of containers ( 137 ) . Other AI services in this category include text analytics , speech , vision , and translation . Furthermore , the use ( 131 ) Griffith , E. ( 2020 ) .

This way , issues such a s the need to find the appropriate algorithm or the correct training model are eliminated ( 140 ) . The use of c loud services in AI can provide an additional mechanism to improve and facilitate use of the tools described in the scenarios in Chapter 5 , due to their role in the automation of various tasks . Conversely , however , the adoption of cloud services can also improve infringement tools that might be developed . ֎ 4.3 AI in generative design Generative design is a design exploration process in which designer s or engineers select specific goals to add to the generative design software , along with selected parameters including performance or spatial requirements , materials , manufacturing methods , and cost constraints ( 141 ) . After receiving the se inputs , the softw are analyses all the possible permutations of a solution to develop and suggest design alternatives . During this process , the software also tries and learns from each iteration to identify wh ich strategies and combinations work , and which ones do not ( 142 ) . In this way , AI in generative design can quickly produce a large number of concepts that are adapted to the project ’ s requirements . In traditional design , the process usually starts with a model based on an engineer ’ s or designer ’ s knowledge . However , in generative design , design parameters are ( 138 ) For more information see : Botelho , B . ( 2018 ) .

Generative design allows the creation of precisely optimi sed and customi sed design solutions and can solve various engineering challenges , such as how to make product components lighter , stronger , or more cost -effective ( 144 ) . Generative design has great potential in the development of tools that improve and facilitate the design process ; however , as described in Chapter 5 , it can also be used for infrin gement when adopted by criminals . ֎֎֎ 4.4 AI in robotics An industrial robot is an automatically controlled , reprogrammable , multipurpose manipulator , prog rammable in three or more axes , which can be either fixed in place or mobile for use in industrial automation ( 145 ) . In general , a robot is any machine that can be u sed to perform complex actions and tasks automatic ally ; specifically , robotics relates to the automation of physical tasks ( 146 ) . Robotics can integrate some sub-fields of AI : for example , ‘ smart robots ’ adopt ML to improve the ir performance progressively ( 147 ) . Robots that incorporate AI are usually able to automate far more tasks than purely robotics -based technologies ( 148 ) . The autonomy of a robot in its surroundings can be classified into different subdivisions such as perceiving , planning , and executi ng ( i.e . manipulating , navigating , and collaborating ) ( 149 ) . One of the main objectives of using AI in robotics is to optimise the ( 143 ) Formlabs . ( n.d. ) .

In the scenarios in Chapter 5 , AI in robotics is mentioned as a means of optimi sing the mass production of infrin ging products and the processes in their supply chain . The benefits of adopting AI in robotics could also be used by infringers to develop tools to automate certain tasks . However , it is also a valuable tool for future improvements in the general security of the manufacturing process , including the creation of unique visual identities for products to identif y original goods . ֎֎ 4.5 Smart devices and AI A ‘ smart device ’ is a context -aware electronic device capable of performing autonomous computing and connecting to other devices through a wire or wirelessly to exchange data ( 151 ) . Therefore , smart device technology may be applied to various objects such as simple sensor nodes , home appliances and smartphones ( 152 ) . Smart devices are essential for the development of other technological advances such as the Internet of Things ( IoT ) and smart cities . The key characteristics of AI as used in smart devices are context -awareness , device connectivity and autonomy ( 153 ) . ‘ Context -awareness ’ is the ability of a system or one of its component s to obtain data about its environment at any moment and adapt its behaviour accordingly . ‘ Autonomous compu ting ’ refers to a device or devices that carry out tasks autonomous ly without the direct control of the user , while ‘ device connectivity ’ refers to a device that can connect to a data network ( 154 ) . In other cases , such as the integration of AI in the IoT , a pplications include components like smart ( 150 ) Andreu Perez , J. , Deligianni , F. , Ravi , D. , & Yang , G. ( 2017 ) . Op . cit .

The combination of AI and the IoT also allows systems to be predictive , prescriptive , and autonomous . The continuous evolution of emerging app lications will enable IoT sensors to collect a vast amount of data , while AI can aid in deriving intelligence to devis e smarter applications for a smarter world ( 156 ) . Smart devices may in the future be part of the infrastructure used in the technology prese nted in the scenarios in Chapter 5 , since it equips regular devices with additional capabilities , increasing the technology ’ s potential . However , smart devices could also be employed by infringers . ֎֎֎֎ 4.6 AI-enhanced supply chain Artificial intelligence is also increasingly being used to improve supply chain operation s and make them more cost-effective through its integrat ion into supply chain management solutions and related management information s ystems to enhance automation and provide better visibility into static , real -time data ( 157 ) . In addition to implementing fully automated decision -making , AI systems can adapt diverse types of cognitive computing to improve cooperation between artificial and human intelligence ( 158 ) . Furthermore , AI based tools can help to automate other stages in the supply chain , such as demand forecasting , production planning , and predictive maintenance ( 159 ) . AI-driven tools can be adapted to diverse aspects of the supply ch ain , including inventory management , to analyse and interpret datasets ; warehouse administration ; worker and material ( 151 ) Liaqat , S. , Ullah , S. , Dashtipour , K. , Zahid , A. , Ars had , K. , Assaleh , K. , & Ramzan , N.

On top of this , AI will drastically transform supply chain decisions by using ad vanced analytics and modelling techniques to help decision -makers evaluate alternatives against complex and dynamic threats and constraints ( 161 ) . Among its other uses , AI can be used in adaptive robotics , processing Internet of Things ( IoT ) device informat ion and a large amount of structured and unstructured data to help robots learn and make autonomous decisions ( 162 ) . Other AI appli cations , such as natural language processing tools , have been develop ed to process human speech and react accordingly . Predicti ve analytics are being used in the fields of responsiveness , inventory and network optimi sation , preventative maintenance , and digital manufacturing ( 163 ) . Complex coordination performance can be achieved using search and pattern recognition algorithms , whic h are designed to analyse real -time data , enabling supply chains to respond to machine -generated , augmented intelligence while increasing visibility and transparency ( 164 ) . Visibility refers not only to the internal aspects of the supply chain , but also to visibility among partners , which allows collaborative decision -making ( 165 ) . ML might also be used in making baseline forecasts for new products , identifying changing demand behaviours , optimi sing inventory levels , and managing product life cycle s ( 166 ) . It might apply algorithms to large operational data feeds to identify insights that enable the tracking and prediction of supply chain disruptions , recommending alternative actions in unexpected circumstances such as transport disruptions ( 167 ) . In other areas su ch as manufacturing , AI -based collaborative robots can perceive the ir environment and move safely around human s work ing alongside them in production ( 168 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 73 The adoption of AI in the supply chain can improve its general management and security . In the scenar ios in Chapter 5 , expert systems are used to optimi se and , in some cases , automate the decision -making process in the supply chain . These scenarios also show how A I can be used in the supply chain for infringement . For example , AI in robotics can be used t o optimi se the mass production of infringing products and the processes in their supply chain . ֎֎ 4.7 AI in 3D printing The 3D printing or additive manufacturing ( AM ) process begins with a digital file , in which the item to be printed is using either 3D printing software or a 3D scanner . This digital file is then exported to a 3D printer , which uses ded icated software to assemble the digital model into a physical object by building liquid material up in layers that then harden until the finished object emerges . ( 169 ) .3D printing makes it technically possible to replicate nearly any object , with or without the authori sation of those who hold the rights to it ( 170 ) . There are various possible benefits of 3D printing for innovation -intensive companies . It allow s them to reduce their overheads when creating , designing , and testing new items or improving existin g ones . In addition , the technology can be used to avoid paying for expensive prototypes , since it can quickly and cheaply produce multiple iterations of complex components using in-house 3D printers ( 171 ) . 3D printing is a complex process , and AI could impr ove it considerably and make it even more efficient . The combination of AI and 3D printing could lead to new applications of the additive manufacturing technology , and more ( 172 ) . ( 169 ) Malaty E. , Rostama G. ( 2017 ) , 3D printing and IP law .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 74 AI can be used in 3D printing as part of machine vision and machine learning systems . A multi -material inkjet 3D printer can use a vision system that extensively scans each layer of the object while it is being printed to correct errors in real time ; at the same time , an ML system can use that information to predict the warping beh aviour of materials and create more accurate final products ( 173 ) . Machine learning can be used in additive manufacturing in several ways , including creating design s for 3D printing , tuning material s , optimising process es , carrying out in situ monitoring , and providing c loud service s and cybersecurity ( 174 ) . Moreover , ML data -driven models based on the understanding of the physical processes involved in 3D printing is essential , since these processes can then be optimis ed using incomplete or partial information ( 175 ) . These data-driven models can also outperform timeconsuming physics -based modelling and detect anomalies during in -process monitoring for quality control . In addition , ML affects other elements of 3D printing , such as the design and fabrication proce sses , qualification , and logistics ( 176 ) . Customs agencies ’ scanning processes could be improved by implementing 3D and penetration scanners adapted to large objects , or by applying nanotech . Customs inspections could also focus on inspecting , detecting and controlling the distribution of the most popular 3D printing materials , such as plastic pellets . Shipping of these materials is nevertheless expected to drop as the world adopts a ‘ circular economy ’ paradigm where materials are recycled and sourced locall y. Nanocodes could be integrated into CAD files and used to track 3D -printed objects , allowing authorities to determine a product ’ s authentic ity easily ( 177 ) . AI in 3D printing is a technology with potential in different areas , including in sensitive situati ons such as th ose described in the scenarios in the following chapter . However , it can also be used by criminals to facilitate the creation of infringing goods . ( 173 ) Winn , Z . ( 2019 ) .

The main features of blockchain include ( 179 ) : • immutability : there is a p ermanent record of transactions , and o nce a block is added , the transaction record can not be altered ; • decentrali sation : the blockchain is s tored in a file that can be acces sed and copied by any node on the network ; • consensus : each block on the blockchain is independently verified independently by validating consensus models ; • transparency : the full transaction history is available , since any party can access the blockchain an d audit transactions . The combination of AI and blockchain technology can be mutually beneficial . Both AI and blockchain use data in diverse ways and are particularly useful in processing and analysing a large amount of data using different tools ( 180 ) . Both AI and blockchain act upon data in various ways ; therefore , their combined use takes the manipulation of data to new levels . At the same time , the integration of ML and AI into blockchain , and vice versa , can strengthen blockchain ’ s underlaying architect ure and enhance the capacity of AI .

In this case , the ledger in blockchain can record all data and variables invol ved in ML decision -making ( 181 ) . Specific applications of AI and blockchain ( 182 ) can be observed in the following areas ( for more information , see Annex ) : • increasing smart computing power ; • creating diverse dataset s ; • data protection ; • data moneti sation ; • ensuring trustworthy AI decision -making . The use of blockchain and AI can be seen in some of the scenarios in Chapter 5 , in which the technology is used to protect unique identifiers and other relevant product informat ion , and to protect registered designs in databases , which can then be shared with law enforcement . However , this combination of technologies can also be used for infringement , for example in AI-based cyberlockers , online -based data hosting services that p rovide remote file -storing and file -sharing services for various types of files and data within a secure storage architecture ( 183 ) , and AI -supported blockchains that can evade detection .

Copyright and design infringement and enforcement scenarios This chapter will show how AI technologies and tools may be weaponi sed to facilitate copyright and design infringement , as well as how law enforcement may use these technologies to detect or defend against such infringement . These competing uses of AI are a nalysed below through fictional scenarios elaborated by the research team . These scenarios reflect the ‘ Intellectual Property Tech Chain ’ cycle , in which the exploration of AI as a technology is used as a base from which to analyse the use of that technolo gy in develop ing an application ( ‘ weaponisation ’ ) to achieve a goal ( ‘ monetisation ’ ) , whether this is infringement or enforcement . Each scenario is based on a thorough analysis of international references on the topic and was discussed with several intern ational experts and with the members of the ad -hoc supporting Expert Group ( see Annex 1 List of experts and stakeholders involved in the studyAnnex ) . However , t he 20 scenari os only cover examples of potential uses of AI for infringement and enforcement and are not exhaustive . To illustrate more clearly how AI tools can be used in practice for infringement or enforcement of relevant IP , two main storylines were created : one concerning physical products and the other involving digital content . This structure divides the 20 scenarios into two groups of 10 , one group for each storyline . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 78 The two storylines are fictional , 184 but have been developed based on existing situations or s ituations that may be on the horizon given the pace of current technological developments . In particular : • Storyline α concerns the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of physical products ( see paragraph 5.1 Storyline α : infringement and enforcement of physical product copyright and design s ) ; • Storyline b concerns the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of digital content ( see paragraph 5.2 Storyline b – infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of digita l content ) 5.1 Storyline α : infringement and enforcement of physical product copyright and design s This section analyses the use or potential use of AI technologies in 10 scenarios involving the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of physical products . Storyline α , described below , provides the context for the se scenarios . toryline α : a European clothing , accessories and cosmetics company and the organi sed crime group that seeks to infringe the company ’ s copyrights and design rights . A well -known European clothi ng , accessories and cosmetics company , Marcoriana Vittaria ( MarcVit ) , has developed a new clothing line called ‘ Artsters ’ that takes original artistic expressions and places the m on never -before -seen designs for shirts and dresses . This 184 Since the storylines and relevant scenarios are fictional , their content may not be applic able or realistic in all jurisdictions , and will depend o n the specific mandate and role assigned to law enforcement and other authorities involved in IP enforcement . S STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 79 new Artsters clothi ng line will be marketed to young adults and hipsters in brick -and-mortar stores , and online through M arcVit ’ s own retail website and through e -commerce platforms . A sophisticated organi sed crim inal group called ‘ OMD ’ has learned that M arcVit plans to laun ch its new clothing line , and OMD intends to make and to sell its own infringing version of Artsters products . This storyline will be examined through the following 10 scenarios : 1. theft of copyrightable work or design under development 2. design registration fraud 3. mass production of copyright and design -infringing goods 4. importation of copyright and design -infringing goods 5. physical market ing of copyright and design -infringing products – infringer -controlled shop 6. physical market ing of copyright and design -infringing products – third-party -controlled shop 7. trade dress infringement 8. online marketing of copyright and design -infringing products – infringer controlled e -shop 9. online marketing of copyright and design -infringing products – sales on third -party marketplace s ( surface web ) 10. online marketing of copyright and design -infringing products – sales on third -party marketplaces ( dark web ) . 5.1.1 Theft of copyrightable work or design under development OMD has learned from a Marcoriana Vittaria ( M arcVit ) insider that MarcVit plans to launch its new Artsters clothing line in 6 months . OMD intends to use AI technologies to steal M arcVit ’ s copyrightable artwork and innovative shirt and dress designs while they are still under development and , importantly , before M arcVit has the chance to make the Artsters clothing line available to consumers . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 80 To accomplish this goal , OMD uses AI to conduct reconnaissance to identify who it perceives as the weakest and best -placed employee most likely to be duped by a phishing email , such as the executive assistant to the Chief Executive Officer ( CEO ) of MarcVit . OMD then uses AI to optimi se a spear phishing attempt to obtain the CEO ’ s email login and password . Once OMD has the ability to send and receive emails from the M arcVit CEO ’ s email account , it sends an email to the head of M arcVit ’ s design team to obtain the designs for the new Artsters clothing line . OMD also uses another tactic . It has obtained AI-based software from a Crime-as-a-Service group that allows the user to generate any statement using an almost perfect ( ‘ deepfake ’ ) copy of someone ’ s voice . Using this software , OMD generates a deepfake version of the CEO ’ s voice and leaves a voicemail with MarcVit ’ s design team lead asking her to email the new Artsters designs to an emai l account under OMD ’ s control . OMD then stores the stolen designs on an encrypted hard drive . For its part , MarcVit is concerned about criminals who may seek to steal its original artwork and new shirt and dress designs before the Artsters clothing line i s released for sale . For this reason , M arcVit is looking for ways to work with law enforcement to use AI as an enforcement tool to prevent the pre -release theft of its new clothing line . OMD ’ s efforts are successful , but law enforcement investigates the c ase and executes a search warrant to obtain OMD ’ s encrypted hard drive . Law enforcement then uses AI -based technology to break the encryption on OMD ’ s hard drive and retrieve the files containing the stolen M arcVit Artsters designs . AI tools used for infr ingement : ֎֎֎ • Reconnaissance is an AI -supported machine learning technique ( see • • 3.2.1 Machine learning ( ML ) ) that learn s from social media profiles , in this case by analy sing the communication style of the execut ive assistant to the CEO of M arcVit . By collecting this data STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 81 using such an AI tool , OMD c an weaponi se ML to create an alias of an individual trusted by MarcVit . • AI technologies can be weaponised to make phishing , hacking and brute force attacks more efficient . For example , natural language processing ( see 3.2.2 Natural language processing ( NLP ) ) can be adapted to create text , including coherent paragraphs . This NLP generated text can then be used to create false ema ils and written communications based on existing information , which OMD could obtain either from open -source data or by scanning the email communications of the CEO ’ s assistant and the CEO . • Even if the phishing attempt fails , AI -supported hacking , AI -supp orted password guessing , and AI-supported CAPTCHA breaking can easily be used to predict the correct password and enable OMD to enter the CEO ’ s email account . This AI technology can also be weaponised to predict updates to passwords . • Deepfakes of someone ’ s voice ( like the CEO ’ s voice in this scenario ) can be generate d by AI generative adversarial networks ( see • • 3.2.1 Machine learning ( ML ) ) . • Machine learning algorithms and computer speech ( see 3.2.3 Computer speech ) can also be used by OMD to imitate the CEO ’ s voice , thereby mi sleading the M arcVit designer . Deep neural networks , in particular , can be used to recogni se patterns in speech . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎ • Machine learning , and in particular supervised learning , can be converted into a functional application by law enforcement to break the encryption used by OMD . In addition , deep learning algorithms , specifically convolution neural networks ( CNN ) , might be used to classify encryption STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 82 schemes and solve some of the limitations of ML such as the ability to perform an accurate cryptanalysis ( 185 ) . • In addition , M arcVit could fortify its cybersecurity efforts with AI by using ML to quickly analyse millions of e vents and identify many different types of threats : for instance , NLP -enabled filters can classify and analyse emails to block phishing attacks . This information can then be provided to law enforcement in support of their investigation . • AI bots could also be employed by M arcVit to crawl the web to help identify and detect social engineering bots that are targeting M arcVit . These AI bots are self -learning software applications that are programmed with natural language processing and machine learning tools . In the framework of a targeted investigation , a specialised law enforcement department could employ a similar tool and approach . 5.1.2 Design registration fraud Two types of design registration fraud scenarios are presented below . 5.1.2.1 Design regis tration fraud where the registration itself is fraudulent MarcVit intends to register the original shirt and dress designs that will eventually be included in its Artsters clothing line . However , after stealing MarcVit ’ s original shirt and dress designs , OMD hopes to fraudulently register the designs as its own with a national intellectual property office ( IP Office ) . OMD intends to use AI technologies to ‘ trick ’ the IP Office into believing that MarcVit ’ s original designs were actually created by OMD . ( 185 ) Pan , J . ( 2017 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 83 However , the IP Office plans to use AI technologies of its own to identify and stop fraudulent design registrations . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎֎ • Generative adversarial networks and computer vision tools ( see 3.2.4 Computer vision ) can be weaponi sed by OMD to produce a fake appplication for registration , replicating very similar applications filed by M arcVit and others in order to trick the IP Office . In particular , a natural language processing tool could replicat e the text of the original applications . Generative modelling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that automatically acquir es information about regularities or patterns in input data to generate new examples that were based on the o riginal information ( 186 ) . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎ • Machine learning can be used by the IP Office to create a system that detects if someone is attempting to re -register a previously registered design . GANs could also be trained to determine if a part or parts of several original designs are being combined to create a spurious ‘ new ’ design . • AI-supported blockchain ( see AI and Blockchain can be used by the IP Office to protect the information in a registrati on system from vulnerabilities . In fact , blockchain ’ s cryptography and immutability provide an additional security layer . • In general , intellectual property offices responsible for national design registrations can u se deep learning and convolutional neural networks to analyse and recognise visual imagery in order to ( 186 ) Brownlee , J .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 84 scan shapes and patterns for similarities . The model could be optimi sed to identify infringement even if the image is taken from a different angle . 5.1.2.2 Design registration fraud where the registration invoices are fraudulent MarcVit registers its original shirt and dress designs with a national IP Office ( “ IP Office ” ) . When the time comes for MarcVit to renew its design registrations , MarcVit must pay a renewal fee to the IP Office . Know ing this , OMD sends MarcVit an invoice that looks like it came from the EUIPO , but includes a payment address that OMD controls , so that OMD , rather than the IP Office , receives MarcVit ’ s re registration fee . The IP Office has learned about this type of d esign registration fraud scheme and uses AI technologies to anticipate when certain design registrants , like MarcVit , are being targeted by groups like OMD . It warns MarcVit and other registrants of OMD ’ s fraud scheme and reiterates the proper address to w hich OMD should send the re -registration fees . MarcVit makes the information available to law enforcement . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎֎ • Machine learning with pattern recognition and computer vision tools can be used by OMD to produce a fake re -registration invoice virtually identical to the original issued by the IP Office . • Natural language processing can be weaponised by OMD to create text that resembles an authentic invoice or other ‘ official ’ document . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎ • NLP-enabled filters can classify and analyse emails received by MarcVit to block phishing attacks . This information can be shared by MarcVit with the IP Office , which can then increase STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 85 its security measures , and with law enforcement , to support the investigation s against the organised criminal group . 5.1.3 Mass production of copyright and design -infringing goods MarcVit intends to mass produce its Artsters clothing line so it can be distributed on a global scale in 6 months . M arcVit is concerned that infringer s may produce copyright and design -infringing versions of their new line before the y are released to the public . OMD wants to use AI technolog ies , including AI -supported robotics , to optimi se its own illegal manufacture of infringing versions of the copyr ight-protected artistic works and unique clothing designs that make up MarcVit ’ s Artsters clothing line . MarcVit has alerted law enforcement to its concerns , and law enforcement intends to use AI technologies to stop criminal groups like OMD from mass -producing infringing copies of the Artsters clothing line . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎֎ • Generative design -based tools ( see Error ! Reference source not found . can be weaponi sed by OMD to more efficiently mass -produce infringing copies of the Artsters clothing line . • AI in robotics ( see AI in robotics can be u sed to optimi se the mass production of the Artsters products and the processes in their supply chain . • OMD could also use neural -style transfer techniques to create additional designs that replicate MarcVit ’ s original designs . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 86 AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎ • A platform can be developed using deep learning and convolutional neural networks ( CNN ) to analyse and recognise visual imagery in order to scan shapes and patterns for similarities . This model could identify infringement even if OMD present s an image taken at a different angle to avoid discovery by less advanced AI tools . • AI-supported blockchain can also be u sed by M arcVit to protect the registered designs in a common database , maintained by rights holders , providing a reliable tool to store informati on that can be shared with law enforcement in support of the investigation against OMD . • Machine learning tools can be then adopted to quickly process and classify the data , which can then be shared with law enforcement authorities investigating the case . 5.1.4 Importation of copyright and design -infringing goods OMD intends to sell its infringing versions of MarcVit ’ s Artsters clothing line all over the world . To accomplish this goal , OMD will have to find a way to avoid customs authorities in the count ries to which it will export its infringing goods . OMD will use AI to evade customs inspections and avoid seizure of their infringing goods . Specifically , OMD hopes AI will help it : • identif y and create shell corporations in different countries , so customs authorities will not know that OMD is behind the imports of infringing goods ; • engage in ‘ port shopping ’ whereby OMD choose s ports where customs authorities are least likely to seize OMD ’ s infringing goods ; • optimi se its conceal ment of the infringing goods in shipping containers ; • find the best trade route between its illicit factories and ports of entry . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 87 The c ustoms authorities , meanwhile , use AI to identify the real importer of infringing goods behind the shell corporations and expose importers engaged in ‘ port shopping ’ . The c ustoms authorities also use AI software to scan shipping containers for hidden infringing goods . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎ • OMD can weaponise machine learning to create a system that identifies the quickest trade route betwe en its illicit factories and ports of entry , choose s ports , and helps to conceal infringing goods in containers , limiting the risk of being detected by customs authorities . The system is constantly updated . • OMD can also weaponise expert systems ( see 3.2.6 Expert systems ( ESs ) ) to optimi se the decision -making process it uses for its supply chain . • Adversarial machine learning can be u sed by OMD to evade detection . Specifically , OMD can implement this AI -based techniq ue to change trade routes and optimise its concealment of infringing copies of M arcVit products . Adversarial ML is a technique that can be weaponi sed to deceiving ML models designed to detect the illegal activities of an organi sed crim inal group such as OMD . For instance , OMD could u se adversarial ML techniques to provide deceptive input data , or ‘ false flags ’ , to cause a malfunction in the ML model being used by customs authorit ies , making it generate inaccurate information . • To use adversarial ML effectiv ely , OMD would have to have extensive knowledge of customs authorities ’ use of AI to detect infringements . If an ML model is used by law enforcement or customs authorities , OMD could use an ML model extraction attack to obtain information on its functionin g. This ‘ reverse engineering ’ strategy could be u sed to identify and potentially even reproduce the neural network ( 187 ) . ( 187 ) Tramèr , F. , Zhang , F. , Juels , A. , Reiter , M.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 88 AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎ • ML pattern recognition tools can be used by customs authorities to identify risk indicators related to the importation of IP -infringing goods . • In more complex cases , customs and law enforcement authorities can potential ly use quantum computing in AI ( see 3.2.5 AI quantum ) to recognise patterns in large dataset s and identify similarities ( e.g . specific characteristics of shipments to predict infringement ) . The processing power of quantum computing could enable t he analysis of a large amount of data , at a regional or even global level . • Expert systems [ see 3.2.6 Expert systems ( ESs ) ] can be used to decide wh ich strategy and vulnerabilities are mo st appropriate to the situat ion . 5.1.5 Physical market sale of copyright and design -infringing products – infringer -controlled shop MarcVit uses AI to generate unique visual anti -counterfeiting technology on the labels of its Artsters clothing line , so customers can use M arcVit ’ s app to scan and confirm that what they are buying in markets and elsewhere is authentic . M arcVit periodically changes this visual anti -counterfeiting technology to make duplication more difficult . OMD hopes to use AI technolog ies to replicate and track cha nges to M arcVit ’ s visual anti -counterfeiting technology so that OMD can successfully sell its infringing goods in stores that OMD controls . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 89 MarcVit is sharing data about its AI -generated visual anti -counterfeiting technology with law enforcement , so natio nal authorities can use their own AI to detect OMD ’ s fakes when they investigate infringer controlled stores . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎ • Pattern recognition , computer vision and/or machine learning can be used by OMD to detect and replicate the patterns in the visual anti -counterfeiting technology . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎ • AI-supported blockchain ( see AI and Blockchain could be adopted by M arcVit to create and secure a label , code , or image that would enable its clients to verify the authenticity of a product , and which the company can shar e with law enforcement authorities investigating the case . Once it is independently verified by national investigators , this would also provide important evidence for the prosecutor to present in court . • Machine learning can be adopted in the creation of the visual identity that will be protected . Law enforcement will be able to identify OMD ’ s infringing copies using computer vision tools . 5.1.6 Physical market sale of copyright and design -infringing products – third-party -controlled shop MarcVit strictly manages the wholesale prices that it charges t hird-party controlled stores for its Artsters clothing line . M arcVit will charge different wholesale prices in different countries . To select prices for its infringing versions of Artsters clothes that are just below M arcVit ’ s wholesale prices , OMD uses A I to track when MarcVit ’ s prices change and how they vary from country to country . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 90 To combat these efforts , MarcVit shares its sensitive pricing data with law enforcement so national authorities can use their own AI to develop a price comparison tool that will detect infringing Artsters goods based on price . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎ • OMD can weaponis e machine learning and natural language processing to analyse the different prices of Artsters clothes in different countries and track the changes in these prices , consequently adjust ing its marketing policy . AI tools used for enforce ment : ֎֎ • Law enforcement can u se machine learning to create its own platform that works as a price comparison tool . • Law enforcement can implement deep learning tools to obtain insights into infringement patterns in order to detect and prevent the crime . • Expert systems ( see 3.2.6 Expert systems ( ES s ) ) can be developed to create an interface that use s the generated data to analyse patterns and determine which decisions could prevent future criminal activities . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 91 5.1.7 Trade dress infringement To accompany its Artsters clothing line , MarcVit has launched an Artsters cosmetics line that includes shapes and colours for the cosmetics containers that are not functional but unique , distinctive , and difficult to replicate . As with the Artsters clothing line , OMD will use AI to try and infringe the unique shapes and colours of MarcVit ’ s Artsters cosmetics containers and then sell them in stores and online . MarcVit is providing data to law enforcement on the components of the unique colours o f the Artsters cosmetics containers , so law enforcement can use its own AI to distinguish the authentic colours from attempts by groups like OMD to infringe them . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎ • OMD can weaponis e computer vision to identify and replicate the unique colours and shapes of the new Artsters cosmetic s line . • AI can be integrated into robotics [ see AI in robotics to improve the manufacturing p rocess , enabling OMD to create the infringing copies in an easier and faster way . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎֎ • Law enforcement can implement computer vision technology to identify the unique colours and shapes of the new Artsters cosmetic s line and distinguish them from OMD ’ s infringing copies of MarcVit ’ s trade dress . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 92 • Deep learning -based optical character recognition ( OCR ) tools can identify and distinguish infringing copies of the Artsters cosmetic s line sold online from the authentic products . • Web crawlers automated with AI can find patterns in the data ( e.g . domain names , content of websites with fakes , websites or products with similar names , or Javascript ) used by OMD to market infringing goods . Web crawling is a procedure in which data on we b pages is indexed using a program or automated script by copying pages for processing , which are then indexed by a search engine ( 188 ) . One of the main objectives of a crawler is to understand the content of a website . Law enforcement can apply machine learning ( ML ) technology to identify the unique underlying patterns of websites , including change s in their structures over time . • Finally , law enforcement can use natural language processing to analyse users ’ behaviour and the content they share to identify t he fraudsters . 5.1.8 Online marketing of copyright and design infringing products – infringer -controlled e -shop MarcVit markets and sells its Artsters clothing line online through its own retail website and through e commerce platforms . OMD uses AI to scan M arcVit ’ s online listings of shirts and dresses in the Artsters clothing line to identify the most popular Artsters clothes and then uses this information to sell infringing versions of the se products on OMD -controlled e -shops .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 94 • ML can be used to break the encryption used by OMD . Deep learning algorithms , specifically convolution neural networks ( CNN ) , might be used to classify encryption schemes and solve some of the limitations of ML , such as the ability to perform an accurate cryptanalysis . • Machine translation in natural language processing can also aid in the transl ation of websites and identify infringing content in other language s. 5.1.9 Online marketing of copyright and design -infringing products – sales on third -party marketplaces ( surface web ) MarcVit markets and sells its Artsters clothing line online throug h popular third -party e -commerce platforms . OMD uses AI to scan M arcVit ’ s online listings of Artsters shirts and dresses and identify M arcVit ’ s most popular clothes . OMD then uses this information to sell infringing versions on popular third -party e comme rce platforms . National product safety authorities and other law enforcement authorities purchase and use third -party AI enabled products to : ( 1 ) identify third -party sellers such as OMD group members who attempt to sell infringing products and ( 2 ) take down listings for infringing products . In this way , authorities identify OMD members who are infringing M arcVit ’ s copyright and design rights . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎֎ • Machine learning , computer vision and natural language processing can all be weaponi sed by OMD to scan websites and identify the most popular designs , which it will later infringe and sell online .

On the dark web , OMD only accepts cryptocu rrency as payment . Law enforcement hires computer forensics experts or creates its own ‘ cyber patrol ’ unit that speciali ses in cryptocurrency to analyse OMD ’ s cryptocurrency transactions and identify members of the group . Law enforcement also uses AI too ls to find similarities between OMD -affiliated users selling infringing Artsters clothes on different platforms on the dark web and , if possible , track such sellers across dark web and surface web platforms . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎ • Machine learning ( ML ) and computer vision tools can be used by OMD to scan websites and identify the most popular Artsters designs , which will be later copied and sold to the public on the dark web . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎ • A cyber patrol unit could be in volved in the investigation , making full use of advanced technologies including AI tools . In many EU countries , as well as in countries outside Europe , specialised law enforcement units or ‘ cyber patrols ’ are trained to conduct investigations against serio us crimes conducted using the internet and the dark web . These units also investigat e counterfeiting and piracy cases .

In particular , supervised ML can identify the cryptocurrency cluster and assign it a category to help identify controlling entities . Deep learning and neural networks can be used for latent representations on a graph or network structure . • AI can also use graph analysis to ‘ follow the money ’ by detecting correlations between addresses on the blockchain . 5.2 Storyline b – infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of digita l content This section will analyse 10 different scenarios concerning the infringement and enforcement of copyright and design s of digital content , based o n storyline b below . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 98 toryline b : a multinational media conglomerate producing a variety of digita l media and the organi sed crim inal group that seeks to infringe the conglomerate ’ s copyrights and design rights . A multinational media conglomerate , Mottanna , produces a variety of digital media , including music , movies , television broadcasts , software , a nd video games . Mottanna markets its popular digital content all over the world . A sophisticated online organi sed crim inal group called the InterGalactics , or ‘ the IGs ’ , is one of the most successful online infringers and distributors of copyright -protect ed digital works . This storyline will unfold through the following 10 scenarios : 1. hacking media accounts 2. computer icon / virtual commodit y infringement 3. social media offences 4. sales of hacked media accounts on the dark web 5. media sharing platform offences 6. virtual/gaming world offences 7 . P2P and BitTorrent 8. live streaming – sports broadcast link aggregator ( advertising -based ) 9 . IPTV crime – unauthori sed access to subscription -based IPTV service 10. training an AI application . 5.2.1 Hacking media accounts Two types o f media account hacking scenarios are suggested in this section . S STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 99 5.2.1.1 Hacking movie streaming media accounts Members of the InterGalactics purchase a database of existing movie streaming service customers and use th is information to execute an AI -base d brute force attack to hack the accounts of these customers and stream movies without authori sation . Law enforcement uses AI -based machine learning to track changes to IP addresses , MAC addresses , content selection and other non -human behavio ur on the movie streaming service accounts to identify accounts that are under the IGs ’ control . Law enforcement also uses AI bots to crawl the web to identify online attempts at social engineering . AI tools used for infringement : ֎ • AI technologies can be employed by the IGs to hack databases through brute force attacks and AI-supported password guessing . The same technologies , along with AI -supported CAPTCHA breaking , could be used to hack the user accounts found in the hacked databases . • Although malware does not necessarily require the use of AI , AI -enabled technologies could be weaponi sed by the IGs to create more sophisticated malware that can imitate trusted system components and deceive movie streaming account users into providing their login information . • Machine learning can be used to carry out ‘ smart ’ phishing attacks , where a baseline of data exclusive to the user being targeted is used to make the phishing attack look more legitimate and authentic . Machine learning can be further misused by organi sed crim inal groups like the IGs to learn patterns and exploit other personal information . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 100 AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎֎ • Law enforcement can use deep learning tools to identify online attempts at social engineering . • Convolutional neural networks ( CNN ) for image and pattern recognition can be used for the same purpose by law enforcement . • A machine learning -based system could be developed to scan images and identify fake login pages , phishing behaviours , or other suspicious activit ies . Computer vision , natural language processing , and machine learning could recognise these activities and block them . These AI tools would be able to carry out real -time scanning of inbound links , using visual indications to determine the authenticity of a login page . 5.2.1.2 Hacking music streaming media accounts The InterGalactics upload infringing copies of Mottanna ’ s sound recordings t o music streaming services using song titles that are confusingly similar to Mottanna ’ s actual song titles . The IGs claim that they are the owners of the sound recording copyright and therefore entitled to the royalties for streams of their pirated version of Mottanna ’ s sound recordings . The I Gs ’ goal is to increase the number of streams of these pirated sound recordings and thereby maximi se the royalties they can receive for these streams . The I Gs then use AI to : • hack into and take over actual accounts o n music streaming services to play/stream their pirated versions of Mottanna ’ s sound recordings that the y had previously uploaded on these services • create free trial accounts with music streaming services for the sole purpose of streaming/playing their pir ated version s of Mottanna ’ s sound recordings • artificially inflate the number of streams of their pirated version s of Mottanna ’ s sound recordings on music streaming services by waiting more than 30 seconds before replaying the stream s of the songs STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 101 Law enf orcement uses AI -based pattern recognition technology to monitor the misuse of music streaming media accounts to identify and to track the accounts that have been hacked and the IG members who control the hacked music streaming accounts . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎֎ • AI-enabled malware can be u sed by hackers to identify potential vulnerabilities in the music streaming service , infect the service with malicious code , and then gain access to a music streaming service account in order to use existing accounts on the service at a later time . The attack is not immediate , but rather is triggered by specific actions at a certain time . This approach can maximi se the impact of the attack , since it would not necessarily raise suspicion at first . • AI can be used to create mal ware that imitate s trusted system components , which could improve stealth attacks . In this case , hackers could use AI malware programs to automatically learn the services ’ computation environment , patch update lifecycle , and preferred communication protoco ls , as well as the moments whe n the systems are least protected . • The IGs can also use AI -enabled bots to automate the creation of free accounts on the music streaming services and automat ically replay the songs th ey previously uploaded for more than 30 se conds , so that each replay generates royalties . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎ • Machine learning could be used to model and monitor users ’ behaviour , raising an alert if there are any anomalies . The same technology could detect infringement patterns to identify larger networks of IP infringers . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 102 • AI can detect duplicate copies of so und recordings on the service containing suspect ownership data , and copyright owners can help law enforcement identify which uploads are authentic and which are infringing . 5.2.2 Computer icon / virtual commodity infringement One of Mottanna ’ s top art ists is giving a virtual 3D concert on a popular Mottanna gaming platform . Mottanna sells tens of thousands of tickets to fans who will attend the virtual concert using their avatars . The IGs create an avatar of their own and use it to sell virtual hats an d T-shirts bearing the Mottanna logo and an image of the Mottanna musician for EUR 1 per virtual item of clothing without Mottanna ’ s authori sation . Law enforcement purchases AI that identifies the IGs ’ avatar as well as the unauthori sed use of logos that are identical or very similar to Mottanna ’ s logo . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎֎֎ • The IGs can weaponis e machine learning and computer vision tools using Mottanna ’ s logos to produce new and infringing images : neural networks can produce images similar to a specific image , such as the one developed by Mottanna . This includes colour alteration and pixeli sation of images . Pattern recognition , as well as text , video , and audio recognition tools , can be used to create a new item . • The IGs can also create AI -based bots to test the commercial viability of their infringing virtual commodit ies and then ( if viable ) to promote them . AI bots are self -learning bots programmed with natural language processing and machine learning . The initial stage of training and build ing STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 103 an AI bot takes a long time , but once weaponised and u sed during training , they are highly efficient in terms of time and costs ( 189 ) . • Adversarial machine learning can be weaponi sed by fraudsters to overcome detection . This technique could be used by the IGs to change how they present their infringing cop ies online and evade detec tion . To accomplish this , IP infringer s would first illegally obtain extensive knowledge about authorities ’ use of AI to detect infringement . Using this stolen information , fraudsters would then implement adversarial machine learning to identify and circum vent the authorities ’ detection patterns . • If law enforcement uses an ML model , a n ML model extraction attack could obtain information on its functioning . This “ reverse engineering ” strategy could be used to identify and potentially reproduce the neural ne twork ( 190 ) . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎֎ • Computer vision or pattern recognition applications can be used to detect the specific logo used by the IGs on their avatars or digital items . • Neural networks can be used by the authorities to find images similar to a specific image through pattern r ecognition . Convolutional neural networks can be used for image and pattern recognition . • NLP can search for specific information on a website , and exploratory analysis ( mathematical analysis ) can be adopted by law enforcement to find correlations in datas ets .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 104 5.2.3 Social media offences Members of the InterGalactics have successfully developed AI that seems to perfectly impersonate the voices of popular singers and musicians who have signed to Mottanna ’ s music label . These voices then appear to sing ‘ samples ’ of copyright -protected songs composed by other artists . The IGs seek to incorporate these impersonations into ‘ deepfake ’ music videos . The IGs have also successfully used social engineering to hack into the social media accounts of Mottanna ’ s singe rs and musicians . The IGs hope to legitimi se their deepfake videos by broadcasting them on the musicians ’ hacked social media accounts and later moneti sing or selling copies of the deepfake videos elsewhere online . Law enforcement works with third -party companies to develop AI that can distinguish between a musician ’ s true voice and an impersonation . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎֎֎ • Generative adversarial networks and deep learning can be weaponi sed by the IGs to create the imitation ‘ samples ’ of mus ic videos of singers signed to Mottanna . • Social engineering is a type of hacking carried out through human interactions , whereby an attacker uses psychological manipulation that lead s innocent people to make mistakes and unwittingly reveal information that they should not ( 191 ) . AI can be used for social engineering through voice cloning , deepfakes , and natural language processing phishing bots that could improve the hacking techniques used on Mo ttanna ’ s singers and musicians .

Now the y intend to u se AI to identify the best dark web forums to advertise the sale of the stolen credentials used to hack the accounts . The IGs also will try to use AI to build up the ir reputation on dark web for ums to maximi se the sale of the stolen credentials . The IGs t arget their marketing of the stolen credentials to operators of dedicated music piracy websites and pre -release networks who intend to use their access to these accounts ( and the private direct messages they contain ) to look for and to obtain copies of sou nd recordings before they are commercially released . Law enforcement uses AI to find and track the IGs ’ attempts to sell the stolen credentials across different forums on the dark web so authorities can conduct a coordinated takedown of all the IGs ’ attem pted sales . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 106 AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎֎ • AI-supported internet bots can be weaponis ed by the IGs to look for the d ark web forums that are most likely to allow the m to advertise the sale of the stolen credentials on the dark web and elsewhere . • The IGs are in possession of directories contain ing links to hidden services that exist on the dark web as well as on the surface web . They implement web crawling tools to identify where to post their advertisements . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎֎ • Deep learning -based optical character recognition tools can be used by law enforcement to track the IGs ’ attempts to sell the credentials that the IGs stole . This AI tool could also be combined with natural language processing . • Convolutional neural networks for image and pattern recognition can also be used to track the IGs ’ attempts to sell the credentials they stole . • Finally , NLP that looks for specific information on a website , or exploratory analysis ( mathematical analysis ) , can be adopted to find correlations in dataset s. 5.2.5 Media sharing platf orm offences Two types of media sharing platform offences are described in the following two scenarios . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 107 5.2.5.1 Uploading deepfake music videos The InterGalactics make copies of deepfake music videos they have created using AI technolog ies and upload th em to online video services , hoping to make money from the online advertising that the se deepfake videos generate . Law enforcement uses AI -enabled text -based and content -based pattern recognition and image recognition technology to identify the deepfake videos and automate the takedown of the IGs ’ infringing uploads . AI tools used for infringement : ֎ • Generative adversarial networks can be weaponi sed by organi sed crim inal groups operating online , such as the InterGalactics , to create deepfake music video s. AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎֎ • AI-improved algorithms can detect if music is copyright protected : computer vision programs can recognise if the image has been uploaded before . AI software can also analyse photos and videos , providing a signal ( a ‘ confidence score ’ ) about whether the material is likely to have been artificially created . • Computer vision can a nalys e the sequence of images in the video . • Web crawlers can find patterns ( e.g . domain names , content of websites with fakes , similar names , Javascript ) that show that the IGs are behind the deepfake videos . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 108 • Machine learning , and in particular deep learning -based fingerprinting of media content , could also be used by Mottanna as a precautionary measure . The fingerprint data could be shared with law enforcement to identify infringing music videos and support takedown orders . The fingerprinting technique can be adopted by content -sharing platforms to identify the unauthori sed use or monetisation of copyright -protected content , as well as to apply specific policies defined by content rights holders , including blocking ( 192 ) . • Convolutional neural networks can also be used for image and pattern recognition . • NLP that looks for specific information on a website , or exploratory analysis ( mathematical analysis ) , can be used by enforcement authorities investigating the case to find correlations in dataset s to show that that IGs are behind the uploaded deepfake videos . 5.2.5.2 Unauthori sed streaming of movies and sports broadcasts The InterGalactics use AI to automate the unauthori sed streaming and online distribution of copyright protected Mottanna movies and sports broadcasts over popular media sharing platforms . Law enforcement uses AI -based image recognition to identify the type of stream ed or distr ibuted content and quickly determine which content belongs to Mottanna and other copyright owners . Once identified , law enforcement can also use AI to automate the takedown of the IGs ’ infringing streams and seize the servers used to distribute infringing copies of Mottanna ’ s copyrighted content online .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 110 5.2.6 Virtual/gaming world offences The InterGalactics have developed ‘ cheats ’ for Mottanna ’ s massive online gam ing platform that the IGs then sell to Mottanna ’ s most competitive customers , who can then use those cheats to ‘ steal ’ ( i.e . copy without authori sation ) virtual items ( copyright -protected code ) that they would otherwise have to earn or pay for in the game , in order to gain a competitive edge against their opponents . The IGs use AI to identify vulnerabilities in the game to maximi se the effectiveness of these illegal cheats and , in turn , how much the y can charge Mottanna ’ s customers for the cheats . Law enf orcement use AI -based machine learning to distinguish and identify those Mottanna customers who are using cheats , which will then facilitate identifying the IGs member who sold th ose cheats . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎ • Machine learning and compute r vision can be weaponi sed by the IGs to infringe a videogame copyrights by modifying the game ’ s colours , icons , video , or audio . • Natural language processing and machine learning bots can be used to sell articles online . • AI-supported hacking could allow the IGs to obtain the access keys to Mottanna ’ s online gaming platform . They could h ack servers or obtain second -hand keys from online resale markets for this purpose . ML can be weaponi sed to target and circumvent authentication and identity validation , in cluding voice and visuali sation -based hacking attempts . • Mottanna ’ s skins in the game can be imitated with the help of computer vision tools . • IGs could even develop AI -empowered bots to use as mules during an illegal transaction in the game to cover the ir tracks . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 111 AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎֎ • Computer vision and text recognition can identify similar images , names , and content across the internet , especially on marketplaces and gaming platforms , as in this scenario . • Convolutional neural networks could alternatively be employed by law enfor cement for image and pattern recognition . • AI algorithms can efficiently deal with large amounts of data through pattern recognition ( 193 ) . AIsupported big data analysis can identify suspicious behaviours globally , for example , if new accounts have been cre ated by an app . ML can then compare existing user accounts to other s to distinguish those that have been detected as suspicious , or that have suspicious or unusual patterns . • Law enforcement could implement an AI -enabled tool to analyse player s ’ behavio ur – such as their moves , trades , and playing times , and the time between their logins and logouts – to distinguish between real players and bots . 5.2.7 P2P and BitTorrent -like applications The InterGalactics members often use tool s to share infringing cop ies of Mottanna ’ s movies efficiently and anonymously among themselves . In particular , they use AI to develop and run a decentrali sed file -sharing network , called IGFlix , that is similar to existing P2P networks , but more fragmented in its distribution of packets than typical BitTorrent or P2P technology . This file -sharing network is connected to a cryptocurrency blockchain , enabling the IGs to sell premium IGFlix accounts ( i.e . user accounts with privileges ) and anonymously pay rewards to members who occasi onally upload infringing content to IGFlix .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 112 The IGs also use AI to quickly circumvent the technological protection measures that Mottanna uses to prevent unauthori sed access and copying of its copyright -protected movies . Law enforcement uses AI -based patt ern recognition technology to find common patterns between members of the IGs , users of the IGFlix peer -to-peer technology , and cryptocurrency transactions occurring on the associated blockchain . Finding these patterns will help them establish which member s of the IGs are distributing infringing copies of Mottanna ’ s movies . AI tools used for infringement : ֎֎ • AI-supported blockchain [ see AI and Blockchain ] can be weaponi sed by the IGs to evade detection by Mottanna . • AI and machine learning could also eliminate digital dots and digital watermarks that Mottanna adds t o its copyright -protected movies to track the distribution of unauthorized copies of its movies online . • Generative adversarial networks could also be used to incorporat e certain effects into livestreams to prevent automatic content recognition by adding n ew logos , removing original logos , watermarks , and fingerprinting , or enhancing content . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎֎ • Mottanna can use an image watermarking system based on deep neural networks . Data could be shared with the law enforcement to help investigations . • Machine learning - or deep learning -based fingerprinting of media content can also be employed for the s ame purpose . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 113 • AI-supported big data analysis can analyse suspicious behaviours and find patterns to promptly detect the distribution of infringing movie copies on the P2P network and dubious transactions on the cryptocurrency blockchain . • Convolutional neural networks can be used for image and pattern recognition . 5.2.8 Livestreaming – sports broadcast link aggregator ( advertising -based ) The InterGalactics members are big fans of Mixed Martial Arts ( MMA ) , so they use AI to create a link aggregator that f inds and posts all the links that other groups have created so other MMA fans can watch Mottanna ’ s MMA programming for free . The IGs generate revenue from advertising on the website where it posts the aggregated links . To combat these efforts , Mottanna has developed an AI of its own that automates the generation of requests for notice -and-takedown orders . For its part , law enforcement has developed AI to quickly generate requests for dynamic and live blocking orders . AI tools used for infringement : ֎ • Machine learning can be weaponi sed by the IGs to identify and scan the most popular and most relevant websites and social media and then suggest infringing links to Mottanna ’ s MMA programming . ML can then also find and automatically extract the links to infringing streams , before reposting them on the IGs ’ own website . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 114 AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎֎֎ • Machine learning can be employed by law enforcement officials to increase the efficiency of an automatic content recognition tool . This refers not onl y to the recognition of images and videos , but also to the content ’ s audio footprint . • Expert systems could be employed by law enforcement authorities to generate requests for dynamic and live blocking orders . • A platform could be develo ped using deep learning and convolutional neural networks to analyse the content of the website and detect patterns . The data thus gathered could enabl e law enforcement to predict future infringements and detect links between infringing websites so they can take down mirrors of blocked websites more easily and create a blacklist of infringing sites . • The marketing of the infringing streams can also be tracked by using computer vision to identify the content and its similar ity to the original content . 5.2.9 IPTV crime – unauthorised access to subscription -based IPTV service Members of the InterGalactics want to offer access to Mottanna ’ s copyright -protected television programming without having to pay the subscription fee for this service . Therefore , they develop and sell an AI-enabled IPTV application ( or ‘ app ’ ) that custom ers can buy and then download onto their smart televisions . The IGs ’ IPTV app circumvents Mottanna ’ s technological protection measures , enabling purchasers to avoid paying for Mottanna ’ s television subscr iption and watch all of its television programming for free . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 115 Mottanna works with law enforcement to develop AI software that analyses the behavioural patterns of Mottanna ’ s television viewers to identify those who have failed to pay a subscription . They a lso develop AI that identifies whe ther Mottanna ’ s copyright -protected programming is being streamed using the IGs ’ IPTV app . AI tools used for infringement : ֎ • The IGs could weaponis e an AI -enabled machine learning tool to identify the protection measures Mottanna has applied to its IPTV service to break into the system and gain access to its IPTV content . Circumvention methods are then shared with the IGs ’ app customers in an adaptive way , so that they can access Mottanna ’ s service without paying . • The IG s could also u se AI tools to identify broken links or streams with lag spikes and then reroute the source of the stream or forward a working link to the IPTV service customers . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎ • Convolutional neural networks can allow Mottanna to ( 1 ) track the tools the IGs have created to offer illicit access to copyright -protected content and ( 2 ) collect data for behavioural analysis , all of which can then be shared with law enforcement for their investigati on . • ML can also analyse the behavioural patterns in users ’ account activity to recognise unknown users or unusual consumption patterns , such as account details being used in several locations within a short period . This would also enable the detection – either retroactive or predictive – of any correlation or pattern in the IGs ’ infringement method s. • The IGs ’ marketing of the infringing services can also be tracked using computer vision to identify the content and its similar ity to the or iginal content . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 116 5.2.10 Training an AI application The InterGalactics want to create an AI application that successfully impersonates one of Mottanna ’ s most successful musical artists . To train this AI application , the IGs make infringing copies of dozens of the artist ’ s most popular sound recordings and feed th is data into the AI application . Based on the data ( i.e . the infringing copies of the artist ’ s sound recordings ) , the AI ’ s artificial neural network can create near perfect copies of the artist ’ s vo ice . The IGs can in turn use these copies to create and sell deepfake music videos of other artists ’ songs without authori sation , violating those artists ’ copyright as the composers of these songs . Mottanna works with law enforcement to develop AI that no t only determine s when a music video is using a fake copy of an artist ’ s voice , but also identif ies the AI application that was ‘ trained ’ to generate the fake copy . AI tools used for infringement : ֎ • Generative adversarial networks can be weaponi sed by the IGs to recognise successful artists and impersonat e a specific artist ’ s voice . AI tools used for enforcement : ֎֎ • Law enforcement can use convolutional neural networks to identify the AI applicat ion that the IGs trained to generate the fake artist ’ s voice and create their deepfake s. 117 Conclusions The findings of th is study allow some general conclusions based on existing AI technologies and their current application s in the infringement and en forcement of copyright and design s of both physical products and digital content . It examined those technologies that – based on the current pace of technological advancements – will plausibly be used for the same purposes in the near future . The use and t ransformation of AI was analysed using the ‘ Intellectual Property Tech Chain ’ , from the exploration of the existing and developing subfields and tools , through the conversion of the technology to adapt to certain goals and the develop ment of specific appli cations at the weaponisation stage , to the monetisation stage , in which AI is used to protect , enforce or infringe IP . In conclusion , the results regarding the use of AI in the infringement and enforcement of copyright and designs can be summarised under the headings ‘ Opportunities ’ , ‘ Drivers ’ , ‘ Risks ’ , and ‘ Concerns ’ . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 118 Figure 15 – AI and copyright and design infringement and enforcement Opportunities AI can perform a number of different functions , ranging from sensing , reasoning and acting , to asse ssing and even predicting . Currently , the main areas of development are machine learning , natural language processing , computer vision , and expert systems . Explainable AI is a nother field that is currently receiving increased attention from experts and pol icy makers . Other technologies that can be enhanced by AI , such as quantum computing , blockchain , 3D printing , generative design , cloud services , and robotics , also have great potential . AI can identify and prioriti se risk s , instantly spot malware on a net work , guide incident response s , and detect intrusions before they occur ( 194 ) . ( 194 ) Balbix ( n. d. ) . Using Artificial Intelligence in Cybersecurity https : //www.balbix.com/insights/artificial -intelligence -incybersecurity/ . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 119 As described in the scenarios presented in Chapter 5 , machine learning has become one of the key AI subfields in the develop ment of possible tools for law enforcement in the field of copyright and design protection . Some of the most common uses of machine learning for the enforcement of copyright and design include analysi ng large amounts of information to detect threats , identif ying social engineering bots , scanning images to det ect false pages or illicit content , improving ACR tools , and providing insights to find infringement patterns . Natural language processing can analyse and block cyberattacks like phishing , identify the behaviour of fraudsters , and create a correlation ana lysis to promptly identify copyright and design infringements . Computer speech and computer vision can also be successfully employed in this field . Some of the ir uses include pattern recognition to predict future infringements , detectin g the marketing of i nfringing goods , and detecti ng and analysi ng fraudulent logos or other images . Quantum computing could improve AI tools , enabling them to process larger amounts of data . For example , AI and quantum computing can be used by customs and law enforcement autho rities to recognise patterns in large dataset s and identify similarities . Expert systems , alternatively , can be used by law enforcement to decide which strategy is more adequate to protect a system from specific vulnerabilities , including those linked to c opyright and design infringement . Customs and l aw enforcement authorities should continuously monitor the new technology landscape to ensure their preparedness to use new tools that may support identifying , limiting and investigating IP violations . Finall y , it is worth keeping in mind that there is always a human being behind any AI algorithm and its practical application vectors ( 195 ) . Explainable AI , although it does not solv e all possible issues , could be used by law enforcement authorities to increase the use of innovative tools – including AI – for analysis and prediction , while at the same time helping to achiev e the prerequisites of fairness , accountability and transparency . The use of AI in law enforcement and the judiciary should in any case always b e subject to strong safeguards and human oversight ( 196 ) , through built -in human control ( 197 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 120 Driver s On the infringement side , fraudsters and criminal groups involved in copyright and design infringement employ , or could possibly employ , the same AI techn iques use d by enforcement agencies in order to overcome cybersecurity measures and evade detection . This is known as the ‘ AI/cybersecurity conundrum ’ ( 198 ) : as AI matures and is increasingly used in the field of cybersecurity , the potential downsides of this technological advancement increa se as well . Adversarial machine learning can help to spot and overcome cybersecurity measures in place . AI can be trained to break through defences and develop dynamic malware to evade detection . Phishing , hacking and brut e force attacks do not have to involve AI , but AI technologies can evidently be employed to make such attacks more efficient , as in the case of AI -supported password guessing and CAPTCHA breaking . AI-enabled malware can be used to conceal malicious codes i n benign applications – an attack triggered by specific actions or at a certain time , which can maximi se the impact of the attack without raising suspicion . Natural language processing tools can be used to produce deepfake music videos , and generative design-based tools can aid in the manufacturing of infringing copies . In addition , pattern recognition , computer vision and/or machine learning can detect , eliminate , or replicate the patterns of anti counterfeiting technologies ( like digital dots and digita l watermarks ) . Limitations AI as a tool still faces certain limitations , including , in particular : its dependenc e on a large amount of high-quality training data ; its inability to deal with ‘ long tail ’ problems ; its limited versatility ; its dependenc e on specifi c application scenarios ; and the inherent biases of its developer .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 121 More powerful machine learning algorithms can learn complex nonlinear relationships between input and output data , but to do so they require a large amount of quality data . Machin es still need to understand the world perceptual and cognitive learning in a more accurate manner , enabling them to simulate real -world scenarios through reinforcement learning to perceive information ; they can then transform the perceived information int o abstract knowledge through attention , memory , and understanding . This might be achieved through the intersection , integration , and optimi sation of algorithms and the continuous improvement of academic stud ies . Further developments could improve AI ’ s creative abilities , its general -purpose use , and its understanding of objects in the world . The a ccessibility of comput ing power is another current limitation : quantum computing , for instance , is still not widely available . Finally , although the use of innova tive technologies in law enforcement is increasing , according to the interviews for this study , their actual use in the enforcement of copyright and designs is still generally limited . It is clear , though , that AI can help companies , IT experts and law enf orcement to identify and mitigate risks and threats , predict attack vectors , block and take down infringing sites , and try ‘ to shrink the attack surface instead of constantly chasing after malicious activity ’ ( 199 ) . Experts involved in the study underlined the need for increased awareness o f technological developments and continuous training of law enforcement and customs authorities on the ways AI tools can be used for infringement and for enforcement . Concerns As AI and related technologies are used to m ake determinations and predictions in areas of great importance , such as combatting copyright and design infringement , AI has the potential to impact fundamental human rights in profound ways . AI algorithms are powered by data collected and processed by t echnologies that are increasingly surrounding us , in every single minute of every person ’ s life . As a result , the fundamental human right s ( 199 ) Gant V. ( 2018 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 122 of privacy and data protection must be duly considered when data is collected by law enforcement authorities . AI incr eases the possibility that mass surveillance will become more widespread . The international debate concerning its impact on fundamental human rights , and more generally on the ethical aspects of AI , is very lively . Nevertheless , the experts highlight ed that use of AI in the justice system also presents many opportunities to figure out how to effectively use it without violating individual privacy and affecting fundamental rights . Explainable AI could also ensure that authorities can clarify to the court ho w the algorithms work , and which dataset s they work on . Concerns regards the potential dual use of AI technologies , as depicted in the ‘ double -edged sword ’ metaphor mentioned in Chapter 1 , suggest that there can be weaknesses in each side ’ s application of technologies that can be exploited by the other . Many experts argue that AI algorithms must be built to align with overarching human goals . The EU Parliament , in its recent Resolution of 6 October 2021 on artificial intelligence in criminal law and its use by the police and judicial authorities in criminal matters ( 2020/2016 ( INI ) ) , has clearly stated that ‘ AI should not be seen as an end in itself , but as a tool , with the ultimate aim of increasing human well being , human capabilities and safety ’ ( 200 ) . As a result , the fundamental human right to privacy must be duly considered when data is collected by law enforcement authorities . Algorithms and AI should be ‘ ethical by design ’ , with no built -in bias , in a way that guarantees maximum protection of fundament al rights . The EU Parliament , in the same Resolution , th erefore invites ‘ European stakeholders , including the Member States and the Commission , to ensure , through international cooperation , the engagement of partners outside the EU in order to raise standa rds at international level and to find a common and complementary legal and ethical framework for the use of AI ’ ( 201 ) . Policy makers are invited to be actively involved and to draw the legal boundaries within which these technologies are allowed to operate . Retroactive deconstruction of the algorithm could be required in order to assess the factors that influence a model ’ s predictions . ( 200 ) European Parliament ( 2021 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 123 The proposed new EU regulatory framework on AI , currently under discussion , is intended to ensur e that AI systems used in t he EU market are safe and respect existing law on fundamental rights and values . Further consideration s may arise if or when the text is approved by the Parliament . In conclusion , great investment is flowing into AI research and development along with machine learning technologies , and this trend is predicted to continue over the next years . Therefore , the availability and use of these tools and technologies , for both legal a nd illegal purposes , can be expected to increase . A wide range of AI -related tools and technologies are currently or potentially in use in copyright and design infringement and enforcement . There is clearly a need for better understanding , increased awareness and enhanced capacities on the part of all stakeholders , including policymaker s , IP protection entities , companies and law enforcement authorities .

Even in periods of reduced activity in this field ( the so -called ‘ AI winters ’ ) , the technology never regressed , but previous achieveme nts were in fact consolidated , preparing for the next ‘ boom ’ phase . Figure 16 - Phases in AI History STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 145 The Birth of AI - the Golden Age ( 1940 -1974 ) The initial stage of development took place from the 1940s to 1974 and is known as the ‘ Golden Age of AI ’ . Artificial intelligence was born as a field of scientific study in 1956 , when the term was coined at a conference organised at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire , US . The Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence ( 202 ) was initially cre ated to discuss the simulation of learning or any other feature of intelligence by a machine . This included automatic computers , i.e . those programmed to use language , neuron nets , self -improvement , abstractions , randomness , and creativity , or to grasp the theory of the size of a calculation ( 203 ) . Before the term was formally coined , several technologies and theories related to the future development of AI originated in the post -World War II period . One of the most relevant examples is the creation of the Turing test ( or ‘ imitation game ’ ) by Alan Turing in 1950 , wh o proposed a model to validate whether a computer or other machine can be programmed to behave intelligently to the extent that it can convinc e a human that it too is a human ( 204 ) . Other mileston es in the evolution of AI were : Marvin Minsky ( 205 ) and Dean Edmonds ’ first artificial neural network in 1951 ( 206 ) ; the first transistor computer , introduced by IBM in 1955 ; the creation of the first AI language ( IPL-II ) by Allen Newell , J. C. Shaw and Herber t Simon in 1955 ( 207 ) ; the invention of the first scientific programming language ( Formula Translator or FORTRAN ) by John Backus in 1956 ( 208 ) ; and the development of MANIAC I ( Mathematical Analyzer , Numerical Integrator , ( 202 ) For more information see : Dartmouth ( n.d ) .

The study of AI took a multidisciplinary approach even before the development of concrete AI tools , being influenced by disciplines such as psych ology , mathematics and statistics , philosophy , and linguistic and communication theories ( 210 ) . Technology advanced in different areas , especially in relation to the storage , capability and affordability of computers and the improvement of algorithms , which could be seen in the presentation of the General Problem Solver computer by Newell and Simon ( 211 ) and the natural language processing computer program ELIZA by Weizenbaum ( 212 ) ( 213 ) . The successful development of these technologies , and advocacy by research ers , contributed to the flourishing of AI and the funding of AI research by government agencies such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) ( 214 ) . Research in t he Golden Age was mainly based on logic -based problem -solving approaches . Howeve r , between 1966 and the early 1970 ’ s , the limitations of AI had already become clear when machine translation did not provide the expected results , and the connectionist approach was abandoned ( 215 ) . The First AI Winter ( 1974 -1980 ) This initial stage of g rowth was followed by a period known as an ‘ AI winter ’ , which occurred from 1974 to 1980 . The early successes encountered several obstacles , which eventually led to a period ( 209 ) Anderson H. ( 1986 ) . Metropolis , Monte Carlo , and the MANIAC .

The First AI Winter was caused by several factors , including the ca pacity of computers at the time and a number of disappointments in regard to machine translation . The publication of the Lighthill report ( 216 ) in 1973 concluded that AI researchers ’ promises concerning the technology ’ s development were exaggerated , which p rovoked cuts in government funding , first in the United Kingdom and later in the rest of Europe and the United States ( 217 ) . As in the case of other technologies , the AI Winter was a result of initial excitement caused by overinflated promises by developers , unrealistic ally high expectations on the part of end-users , and extensive promotion in the media ( 218 ) . Renewed hope for AI ( 1980s ) The field of AI was revived in the 1980s , when an increase in funding and the expansion of the algorithmic toolkit reignit ed interest in the technology ( 219 ) . During this period , s everal relevant advances were achieved , such as the populari sation of deep learning techniques that enabled computers to learn from previous experience . In 1982 , Hopfield revived the concept of the recurrent artificial neural network with the Hopfield neural network ( HNN ) ( 220 ) , which also provides a model for understanding human memory . In 1986 , Hinton , Rumelhart and Williams published the backpropagation training algorithm , which train ed a neural netw ork through a method called a chain rule ; this means that after each forward pass through a network , backpropagation performs a backward pass while adjusting the model ’ s parameters ( 221 ) . Furthermore , Edward Feigenbaum introduced expert systems , which mimick ed the decision -making process of a human expert ; in this case , the program would ask an expert in a field how to respond in ( 216 ) For more information see : Lighthill , J .

These technological advances were accompanied by other circumstances that increased the flourishing of AI in this period . In 1982 , the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry ( MITI ) launched the Fifth Gene ration Computer Systems ( FGCS ) initiative with the objective of revolutioni sing computer processing , implementing logic programming , and improving artificial intelligence . The high level of investment in the technology ’ s development by the Japanese governm ent ( USD 400 million between 1982 and 1990 ) led to an increase in investment by other actors , such as the British government ( 223 ) . Despite these efforts , the project did not have the expected results . Other important factors included the found ing of the American Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence ( AAAI ) ( 224 ) in 1979 , and the organi sation of conferences on related topics , which enhanced the visibility of AI . Moreover , the commerciali sation of AI , especially of expert systems , contribut ed to increased interest in the technology . Expert systems were created by surveying experts using ‘ if-then ’ rule sets and were implemented in fields like financial planning , medical diagnosis , geological exploration , and microelectronic circuit design ( 225 ) . However , as with the initial period of hype regarding AI ’ s potential , the fact that the technology did not achieve the expected results in a short period led to another era of stagnation . Second AI Winter ( 1987 -1993 ) The Second AI Winter occurred from 1987 to 1993 , when another decrease in funding adversely affec ted AI research : interest on the topic declined when it could not meet unrealistic expectations ( 222 ) Anyoha , R.

The expert systems that had been one of the main sources of interest in previous years started to show their limitations ; in particular , many AI -related tasks were too complicated to de sign rules around them manually , and systems for vision and speech recognition contained too many edge cases ( 226 ) . During these years , many AI companies closed , and attendance at the AAAI conference significantly diminished in 1991 . Similarly , a decrease in the publication of AI-related articles was observed , starting in 1987 and reaching a nadir in 1995 ( 227 ) . AI Booms ( late 1990s -ongoing ) In the 1990s , advances in computation power and storage generated new funding and interest in AI ( 228 ) . In this decade , several developments facilitated AI ’ s next period of flouri shing . In 1995 , the Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity ( A.L.I.C.E ) was created by Richard Wallace . Based on Joseph Weizenbaum 's 1964 ELIZA program , it was able to hold basic conversatio ns with humans . During this period there were other major advances in all areas of AI , with significant demonstrations in machine learning , intelligent tutoring , case -based reasoning , multi -agent planning , scheduling , uncertain reasoning , data mining , natu ral language understanding and translation , vision , virtual reality , games , and other fields ( 229 ) . The 1990s saw other relevant events that demonstrat ed the development of AI . The COG Project at MIT ( 230 ) made significant progress in building a humanoid robo t , while IBM created the chess -playing computer Deep Blue , which defeated world champion Garry Kasparov ( 231 ) . In 1997 , the speech recognition software Dragon Naturally Speaking was launched by Dragon Systems to be ( 226 ) Schuchmann , S. ( 2019 ) . Op . cit . ( 227 ) Schuchmann , S. ( 2019 ) . Op . cit .

In the same year , Dr. Cynthia Breazeal developed the robot head Kismet at MIT ( 232 ) , which was able to recogni se and display emotions ( 233 ) . In 1995 , Cortes and Vapnik published the current standard for the support vector machine , a system for mapping and re cogni sing similar data through classification and regression analysis , while in 1997 Hochreiter and Schmidhuber developed the long short -term memory ( LSTM ) for recurrent neural networks ( 234 ) . Both contributions were essential for the evolution of deep learn ing . The se advances w ere possible due to improvement s in processing and storage capacity , which had previously been the main limitation in achieving the expected results ( 235 ) . The increased development of AI -related technologies after the 1990s was due to the interaction of many factors and drivers , particularly the exponential development in the performance of IT systems and technologies based on them , the advance of digitali sation and demateriali sation into more and more areas of value creation , and incre asing connectivity between objects , processes , and human beings . In time this has led not only to the development of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) ( 236 ) but to an Internet of Everything ( IoE ) ( 237 ) . Gordon Moore explained this phenomenon in what became known as Moore ’ s Law ( 238 ) , which describes the exponential growth of integrated circuits by estimating that the speed and memory of computers doubles every year . These doublings are currently occurring at ( 232 ) Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) ( 2001 ) . MIT team building social robot .

AI became more complex at the beginning of the 21st century , with an approach centred on developing tools that c an interact and cooperate with people . The humanoid robot ASIMO ( Advanced Step in Innovative Mobility ) ( 240 ) , which could perform basic interactions , was presented by Honda in 2000 . AI was also commerciali sed in items for daily use , such as the robotic vacuum cleaner Roomba in 2002 . In 2001 , Doug Laney proposed the ‘ Three Vs of big data ’ : volume , velocity and variety . In 2005 , O ’ Reilly published ‘ What is Web 2.0 ’ , thereby populari sing this term , which was devised to differentiate the post -dotcom bubble World Wide Web , with its emphasis on social networking , usergenerated content , and cloud computi ng , from that which came before ( 241 ) . Machine reading was also refined with the improvement of the autonomous understanding of text . After that , AI technolog ies started to become more accessible for everyday use . In 2010 , Apple introduced the intelligent p ersonal assistant Siri in its iPhone 4 S , followed by Amazon ’ s intelligent personal home assistant Alexa in 2014 . Machine -learning chatbots also became a common tool for customer service . In 2014 , the chatbot Eugene Goostman passed the Turing test for the f irst time , convincing 33 % of the judges that it was human ( 242 ) . Advancements were observed in other areas of AI research . In 2016 , the Google DeepMind Challenge Match showcased the computer Go program AlphaGo ’ s defeat of the world ’ s best Go player , Lee Se dol . AlphaGo was later programmed to play against itself using a trial -and-error pattern , which led to the creation of an improved version of AlphaGo Zero that trained itself faster and was able to beat the original AlphaGo by 100 games to 0 ( 243 ) . ( 239 ) Quantum computing is essentially harnessing and exploiting the laws of quantum mechanics to process information . A traditional computer uses long strings of “ bits , ” which encode either a zero or a one . A quantum computer , on the other hand , uses quantum bits , or qubits .

The improvement in sensors and the reduction in their cost has also contributed to the growth of AI , and resulted in enhance d research in core AI areas such as natural language processing , autonomous vehicles and robotics , computer vision , and languag e learning . 2 Definitions of AI throughout its history But what is AI ? To date , there is no widely agreed -upon and precise definition of the concept . As mentioned in the main part of the s tudy , AI is c omputer code ( comprising both software and hardware ) that dynamically adapts according to algorithmic rules while processing large datasets to predict phenomena and assist decision -making . Over the course of AI ’ s history , numerous definitions have been given of what ‘ AI ’ actually means . While the term ‘ artificial intelligence ’ has entered common parlance and is widely used , there is no single definition of AI that is universally accepted . Some define AI loosely as a computeri sed system that exhibits behaviour commonly thought of as requiring intelligence . Othe rs define AI as a system capable of rationally solving complex problems or taking appropriate actions to achieve its goals in whatever real -world circumstances it encounters ( 245 ) . The term 'artificial intelligence ’ was coined by Professor John McCarthy in 1955 , who defined it as ‘ Machines behaving in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving ’ ( 246 ) . The following box showcases the changing definition of AI over the years since the term was invented . ( 244 ) OECD ( 2019 ) , Op . cit .

Albus , 1991 ) ( 248 ) ‘ The main idea unifying theme is the idea of an intelligent agent . We define AI as the study of agen ts that receive precepts from the environment and perform actions . Each such agent implements a function that maps percept sequences to action . ’ ( S. Russell et P.

An AI system is a machine -based system that can , for a given set of human -defined objectives , make predictions , recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments . ’ ( OECD , 2019 ) ( 252 ) ‘ Artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems are software ( and possibly also hardware ) systems designed by humans that , given a complex goal , act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition , interpreting the coll ected structured or unstructured data , reasoning on the knowledge , or processing the information , derived from this data and deciding the best action ( s ) to take to achieve the given goal . AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model , a nd they can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions . As a scientific discipline , AI includes several approaches and techniques , such as machine learning ( of which deep learning and reinforcement lea rning are specific examples ) , machine reasoning ( which includes planning , scheduling , knowledge representation and reasoning , search , and optimization ) , and robotics ( which includes control , perception , sensors and actuators , as well as the integration of all other techniques into cyber -physical systems ) ’ ( Independent High -Level Expert Group on AI set up by the European Commission , 2019 ) ( 253 ) ‘ Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is a discipline of computer science that is aimed at developing machines and systems that can carry out tasks considered to require human intelligence , with limited or no human intervention . ’ ( WIPO Conversation on IP and AI , 2020 ) ( 254 ) 3 Additional technical insights into AI ( 251 ) European Commission .

Algorithms can enhance the capabilities of existing tools and expand their use to other areas . Different alg orithms are used for different purposes . The Naive Bayes algorithm ( 255 ) has a group of prior probabilities ( calculated with previously gathered data ) for each class . Once data is provided , it updates these probabilities to constitute a posterior probability ( 256 ) . Another category is the decision tree algorithm , which belongs to the family of supervised machine learning algorithms ( 257 ) and resembles a flowchart where nodes represent the test on an input attribute and branches represent the outcome of the test . Similarly , the random forest algorithm ( 258 ) , is a ML algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique and can be used for classification as well as for regression problems in ML . It acts as group of trees , where input dataset is subclassified and fed into various decision trees to finally average all outputs ( 259 ) . In the same category , support vector machines ( SVM s ) ( 260 ) are mostly used in classification problems . SVM s classify data using a hyperplane , ensuring that the space between the hyperplane and support vectors is maxim al , whereas a K Nearest Neighbours ( KNN ) ( 261 ) – one of the simplest machine learning algorithms based on the supervised learning technique – uses multiple data points divided into classes to predict the class of a new sample data point ( 262 ) . Regression algorithms ( 263 ) are another type of supervised machine learning algorithm , used in AI to predict the output values based on the input information points in a database ( 264 ) . Some of the main applications of these algorithms include pre dicting stock market price s and forecasting weather , ( 255 ) Ray S.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 156 among others ( 265 ) . Algorithms in this category include l inear regression algorithms that measure genuine qualities by taking into account consistent variables , which is achieved by identif ying the best linear-fit relationship in a dataset among independent and dependent variables ( 266 ) . Other examples are the Lasso regression algorithm ( 267 ) , which – like other regression algorithms – obtains the subset of predictors that minimi ses prediction error for a respo nse variable ; the logistic regression algorithm ( 268 ) for binary classification ; the multivariate regression algorithm ( 269 ) used when there is more than one predictor variable , and the multiple regression algorithm , which appl ies a combination of linear regre ssion and non -linear regression algorithms using multiple explanatory variables as inputs ( 270 ) . Finally , t o complement the information in Chapter 3 , it may be add ed that international studies and literature on the topic divide AI systems into three main ca tegories , two of which are currently only hypothetical . 1 . Artificial narrow intelligence ( ANI ) is the current state of the technology , also known as applied AI . It is designed to accomplish a specific problem -solving or reasoning task . It can not replicate t he versatility of a human mind , but is able to generalise pattern recognition such as by transferring knowledge learned in the field of image recognition to speech recognition tasks ( 271 ) . 2 . Artificial general intelligence ( AGI ) , also called ‘ strong AI ’ or ‘ deep AI ’ , refers to a machine with general intelligence that is able to mimic human intelligence while greatly improving upon it , intelligence to solve problems that go beyond the resolution of specific tasks . AGI can think , understand , and act in a way tha t is indistinguishable from that of a human in any given situation . ( 265 ) DeAngelis , S. F. ( 2015 ) . Op . cit . ( 266 ) DeAngelis , S. F.

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 159 4 Overview of AI technologies ’ impact on the economy and labour market As mentioned in the study , AI has profound implications for indivi duals , societies , economies , and the environment . The EU Parliament , in its resolution of 6 October 2021 ( 277 ) , has underlined that , whil e innovati ve technologies in general , and AI in particular , hold extraordinary promise , with the potential to generate su bstantial benefits in efficiency , accuracy , and convenience for the European economy and society , they also pose a number of challenges and threats to fundamental rights and democracies based on the rule of law . At the global level , the United Nations has put in place several important initiatives related to the role of AI in sustainable development . While it is widely acknowledged that AI technologies may support breakthroughs in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , they may also have unanti cipated consequences that will exacerbate inequalities and negatively impact individuals , societies , economies and the environment ( 278 ) . The UN Secretary -General has underlined the need to ensure that AI becomes a force for good . The UN systems ’ work on the ethics of AI builds on a long history of engagement with ethical concerns related to the development and use of information and communication technologies ( ICTs ) . In discussing AI , it is importan t to briefly mention the impact that these technologies are having today and may have in the future on the econom y and the labour market . 4.1 Impact on the economy A lot has been written concerning AI ’ s impact on the economy , and the debate is ongoing . A report published by the McKinsey Global Institute ( 279 ) attempts to simulate AI ’ s impact on the world economy . According to th is simulation , AI has the potential to deliver additional global economic ( 277 ) European Parliament ( 2021 ) .

A number of factors , including labour automation , innovation , and new competition , have an impact on AI-driven productivity growth . Micro factors , such as the pace of adoption of AI , and macro factors , such as a country ’ s global connectedness or labo ur-market structure , both contribute to the size of th is impact . With regard to the impact on the supply chain , the McKinsey study reports that 61 % of executives have observed decreased costs and 53 % increased revenues as a direct result of introducing artificial intelligence into their supply chains . The World Economic Forum highlights the impressive advance in AI technologies in recent years , boosted by exponential increases in computing power and by the availability of massive amounts of data , from software used to discover new drugs to algorithms used to predict our cultural interests ( 280 ) . Technological innovation will also increase the efficiency and productivity of the global supply chain , as transportation , logistic and comm unication costs all drop . On the other hand , a s artificial intelligence systems are introduced into our core infrastructures , the risks posed by errors and blind spots increase . 4.2 Impact on labour The profound business transformation caused by the qui ck , efficient and accurate processing of large amounts of data will greatly affect employment and labour . With regard to the labour market , experts worldwide concur that AI will certainly cause our workforce to evolve . Automation and early -stage AI systems are already changing the nature of employment and working conditions in multiple sectors . AI tools , for instance , can limit errors caused by human fatigue and improve the efficiency and accuracy of work . Some have emphasised the loss of jobs to machines , although other sources underline that other jobs will be created . In this case , the concept of ‘ collective intelligence ’ would combine the accumulated knowledge of a group of people with the use of AI . ( 280 ) World Economic Forum ( 2016 ) . Op . cit . STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 161 The McKinsey study suggests that around 30 % of globa l working hours could be automated by 2030 ( 281 ) , AI can help by taking over repetitive or dangerous tasks from employees , who in turn can focus on the types of work that require a more strategic or analytical approach . However , this also requires the retrai ning of the existing workforce at a certain level ( 282 ) . Moreover , many AI predictive statistics applications call for data input that requir es extensive manual labour to prepar e ( 283 ) ; this is in contrast to the idea that AI can make sense of disorganised dat a . At the same time , technological advances could yield greater inequality , particularly in labo ur markets . As automation substitutes for labo ur across different economic sectors , the displacement of workers by machines m ay exacerbate the gap between retu rns to capital and returns to labo ur . On the other hand , it is also possible that the displacement of workers by technology will , in aggregate , result in a net increase in safe and rewarding jobs . This may give rise to a job market increasingly segregated into ‘ low-skill/low -pay ’ and ‘ high -skill/high -pay ’ segments , which in turn could lead to increased social tensions ( 284 ) . In parallel , there is likely to be increased demand for experts in designing and delivering training on AI solutions . 5 Overview of the main AI-affected a reas relevant for the study For the purpose of this study , three areas in which AI technologies have a significant impact are particularly relevant : crime , law enforcement and criminal justice . Across these last two areas , ethical , fundamental rights and privacy concerns are clearly at stake . ( 281 ) McKinsey Global Institute ( MGI ) ( 2017 ) .

The various capabilities of AI described in Chapter 3 make it attractive for malicious actors . AI can emulate many act ions performed by humans , and in some instances can exceed human performance in terms of efficiency and scalability . With AI , certain crimes can be performed on a much larger scale , targeting thousands of victims simultaneously ( 285 ) . It is clear that , as AI technolog ies expand in capability and deployment , so too do the risks of criminal exploitation ( 286 ) , as described in the scenarios presented in Chapter 5 .

AI as a tool for crime : criminals use the capabil ities described in the study ( see 3.2 AI subfields ) to facilitate their criminal actions in the real world , such as the production and sale of copyright and design -infringing goods or digital content ; AI prediction technologies are used to forecast the behaviour of people or institutions to discover and exploit vulnerabilities ; AI generated fake content or videos is used to dece ive and extort , etc . Chapter 4 provides a wide range of scenarios regard ing copyright and design infringements of both physical products and digital content . 2 . AI systems targeted by criminals : circumventing protective systems to commit a crime ( e.g . CAPTCHA breaking , detecting and removing digital watermarks , etc . ) ; evading detection or prosecu tion for crimes already committed ; or making trusted or critical systems fail or behave erratically in order to cause damage or undermine public trust . 3 . AI as context for a crime : a number of fraudulent activities are based on the victim ’ s belief that a particular AI functionality is possible , even though it is not , or that it is possible , but not actually used in the fraud ( 287 ) . A single crime may fall into two or three of the above categories simultaneously : an attack on an AI system is often carried out using another AI system , while the fraudulent simulation of non -existent AI capabilities might be executed using other existing AI technologies . Moreover , it is worth emphasis ing that while a various limits and barriers are being introduced with regard to the legitimate use of AI technologies , these are of course not relevant for criminals , who are going to exploit the capabilities of these innovative tools without any legal , ethical or other limit s , and ultimately tak e advantage of the respect for these limits that society legitim ately require s on the part of law enforcement and other authorities .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 164 5.2 Impact on law enforcement and criminal justice The wide range of existing legitimate AI applications include s systems for crime prevention and detection . A I tools analy se sounds , objects , faces , and DNA and uncover digital traces of crimes . AI is also being developed to predict and prevent crime , and not merely detect what has occurred . There are several tools available or under development in numerous juris dictions to inform initial sentencing , parole , and decisions regarding post -release monitoring and rehabilitation ( 288 ) . As AI and related technologies are used to make determinations and predictions in high -stakes domains such as criminal justice and law e nforcement , they have the potential to impact basic fundamental rights and liberties in profound ways . AI will enhance the uncovering and investigation of criminal activities . Facial recognition and fingerprint technology are increasingly be ing used . Mass surveillance is also more and more possible . The UNICRI -INTERPOL report ‘ Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Law Enforcement ’ analyses the contribution AI and robotics can make in policing ( 289 ) and examines use cases at var ious stages of development b y national law enforcement authorities , demonstrating that the use of AI in this context is a present reality ( 290 ) . Some interesting examples of AI use cases for law enforcement include the following : 1. autonomously research ing , analy sing and respond ing to requests for international mutual legal assistance ; 2. advanced virtual autopsy tools to help determine cause s of death ; 3. forecasting where and what type of crimes are likely to occur ( predictive policing and crime hotspot analytics ) to optimi se law enforceme nt resources ; ( 288 ) Korean Institute of Criminology , International Center of Comparative Criminology ( 2018 ) .

The recent Frontex report ‘ Artificial Intelligence -Based Capabilities for the European Border and Coast Guard ’ provides insights into the current landscape of AI -based capabilities in border security through a number of case studies , as well cross -cutting barriers and enablers for future AI adoption ( 292 ) . Law enforcement and border guards should continuously monitor the new technology landscape to ensure preparedness to appropriately respond . Moreover , as is widely discussed at international level , law enforcement authorities and the criminal justice system should ensure fairness , accountability , transparency and that the use of AI is effectively communicated to the publ ic . Experts highlight that the use of AI in the justice system also presents many opportunities to figure out how to effectively use it without violating an individual ’ s privacy ( 293 ) . With regards to criminal justice , numerous examples can be found of judi cial systems making use of AI tools in criminal proceedings . According to international studies on the topic , AI is currently employed in the US , for instance , to assess the risk of future unwanted behavio ur by an accused person ( e.g . commit ting a new crim e or the same crime , or failure to appear in court ) ( 294 ) . Some countries also use automated risk assessment tools in the criminal justice system , though their use may be questioned . In fact , some technological solutions , such as those for estimating a crimi nal ( 291 ) UNICRI , INTERPOL ( 2018 ) . Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Law Enforcement , Op . cit . p. v.

In fact , d ata reflect the social , historical and political conditions i n which they were created and collected . AI systems ‘ learn ’ based on the data they are using . This , along with many other factors , can lead to biased , inaccurate , and unfair outcomes . The quality and quantity of data is th erefore essential in limiting poss ible bias ( 295 ) . In addition , human control over the final decision must always be ensured . In this context , in December 2018 , the European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice ( CEPEJ ) of the Council of Europe adopted the ‘ Ethical Charter on the Use of Artificial Intelligence in Judicial Systems and their environment ’ ( 296 ) , which encompasses the following five principles : 1. principle of respect for fundamental rights : ensure that the design and implementation of artificial intelligence tools and services a re compatible with fundamental rights ; 2. principle of non -discrimination : specifically prevent the development or intensification of any discrimination among individuals or groups of individuals ; 3. principle of quality and security : with regard to the proces sing of judicial decisions and data , use certified sources and intangible data with models elaborated in a multi -disciplinary manner , in a secure technological environment ; 4. principle of transparency , impartiality and fairness : make data processing methods accessible and understandable , and authorise external audits ; 5. principle of ‘ user control ’ : eschew a prescriptive approach and ensure that users are informed actors and in control of the choices made ( 297 ) .

STUDY ON THE IMPACT O F ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE INFRINGEMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT AND DESIGN 167 5.3 Ethical , fundamental rights and privacy concerns All of the above points raise an increasing number of ethical , fundamental rights and privacy concerns . The ongoing debate is very lively globally as well as within the EU . As mentioned above , AI algorithms are powered by data that are collected and processed by technologies that increasingly surround us at every minute of our lives . This process raises privacy and ethical concerns . Explainable AI could allow authorities to clarify to the court how the algorithms work , and which dataset s they are work ing from . Many experts argue that AI algorithms must be built to align with overarching human goals . The EU Parliament , in its Resolution of 6 October 2021 on artificial intelligence in criminal law and its use by the police and judicial authorities in cr iminal matters , clearly stated that ‘ AI should not be seen as an end in itself , but as a tool , with the ultimate aim of increasing human well -being , human capabilities and safety ’ ( 298 ) . It also stresse d that algorithms and AI should be ‘ ethical by design ’ , with no built in bias , in a way that guarantees maximum protection of fundamental rights ( 299 ) . Therefore , regulatory agencies shall be actively involved and fix the legal boundaries within which these technologies are allowed to operate . Retroactive deconst ruction of the algorithm could be required to assess the factors that influence a model ’ s predictions . At first , it was thought that regulation could control the way AI is used : open letters were sent to government s with long lists of signatories attached , asking for regulation to be enacted . This approach has failed to bear fruit . More recently , the focus has been on developing ethical principles to guide the development of AI -enabled solutions . These principles are useful indications of what we expect fr om AI ( and what we wish to avoid ) , but they are not enough , as they fall short of describing how particular solutions should adhere to them .

AI algorithms must be built to align with overarching human goals . The debate is still open and will necessarily evolve with the evolution of technology . With regard to citizens ’ fundamental rights and the avoid ance of potential liability , the use of AI in law enforcement should ensure that it respect s the following key guiding principles . • Responsibility : ensure the availab ility of measures to redress adverse individual or social effects of an algorithmic decision system , and designate a person responsible for the timely remedy of such issues . • Fairness : the use of technology should not breach rights such as the right to due process , the presumption of innocence , freedom of expression , and freedom from discr imination . • Accountability : a culture of accountability must be established at an institutional and organi sational level . • Transparency : the path taken by the system to arrive at a certain conclusion or decision must not be a ‘ black box ’ . • Explainability : the decisions and actions of a system must be comprehensible to human users ( 301 ) . 6 AI Regulation in the European Union In 2020 , the EC ’ s white paper on ’ AI - A European approach to excellence and trust ‘ ( 302 ) set out policy options for promoti ng AI while add ressing the risks associated with certain uses . In this context , the proposed regulatory framework on AI has the objective s of ensuring that AI systems used in the EU ( 300 ) Evans -Gree nwood P. , Hanson R. , Goodman S. , and D.

In April 2021 , the European Commission publishe d the first proposal for a legal framework on AI , namely the draft Artificial Intelligence Act ( 304 ) . This proposed AI Act addresses the risks stemming from the various uses of AI systems while at the same time promoting AI innovation , to find a proper balance between the need to preserve individual safety and fundamental rights without overly inhibiting AI innovation . To this end , the draft AI Act envisages a risk -based approach that prohibits specific unacceptable uses of AI , heavily regulates some other uses entailing significant risks , and encourages the adoption of codes of conduct regard ing uses of AI that present limited or no risk ( 305 ) . The gradation of risks is represented using a four -level pyramid : unacceptable risk s , high risk s , limited risks and minimal risk s. ( 303 ) European Commission . ( 2021 ) . Op . cit .
