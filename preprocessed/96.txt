transparency development design algorithms transparent practices use caution global community risk might increase inequality justice fairness considerations adequately addressed themes appear intertwined theme responsibility promotion transparency justice seems postulate increased responsibility accountability side makers deployers argued transparency ethical principle per rather proethical condition enabling impairing ethical practices principles proethical nature transparency might partly explain higher prevalence compared ethical principles notable current guidelines place significant value promotion responsibility accountability yet emphasize duty stakeholders involved development deployment act integrity mismatch probably associated observation existing guidelines fail establish full correspondence principles actionable requirements several principles remaining uncharacterized disconnected requirements necessary realization codes related outnumber related beneficence appears current community moral obligation preventing harm takes precedence promotion good fact partly interpreted instance negativity bias general cognitive bias give greater weight

principles could promoted responsible innovation issue trust addressed less one third sources tackles critical ethical dilemma governance determining whether morally desirable foster public trust several sources especially produced within private sector highlight importance fostering trust educational activities smaller number sources contend trust may actually diminish scrutiny undermine societal obligations possibility would challenge dominant view ethics building public trust fundamental requirement ethical relative thematic underrepresentation sustainability solidarity suggests topics might currently flying radar mainstream ethical discourse underrepresentation principles particularly problematic light fact deployment requires massive computational resources turn require high energy consumption environmental impact however involve negative effects digital infrastructures also possibility harnessing benefit ecosystems entire biosphere latter point highlighted report

sustainability solidarity appear strictly intertwined though poorly represented compared principles numerical data indicate emerging convergence around promotion ethical principles thematic analysis paints complicated picture critical differences principles interpreted well requirements considered necessary realization results show different often conflicting measures proposed practical

contrasts emerge requirement avoiding harm costs balancing risks benefits furthermore noted evaluations lead different results depending whose optimized actors resolved divergences tensions may undermine attempts develop global agenda ethical despite general agreement ethical significant divergences emerge within guidelines ethical furthermore uncertainty remains regarding ethical principles guidelines implemented challenges implications science policy technology governance research ethics policy level urge increased cooperative efforts among governmental organisations harmonize prioritize agendas effort mediated facilitated organisations harmonization desirable however come costs obliterating cultural moral pluralism therefore fundamental challenge developing global agenda
