Authors Francesco Molinari - Independent Researcher Colin van Noordt - Tallin University of Technology Lorenzino Vaccari - Independent Researcher Francesco Pignatelli - European Commission , Joint Research Centre Luca Tangi - European Commission , Joint Research Centre 2 Abstract Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) is a peculiar case of General Purpose Technology that differs from other examples in history because it embeds specific uncertainties or ambiguous character that may lead t o a number of risks when used to support transformative solutions in the public sector . AI has extremely powerful and , in many cases , disruptive effects on the internal management , decision -making and service provision processes of public administration . O ver the past few years , the European Union and its Member States have designed regulatory policies and initiatives to mitigate the AI risks and make its opportunities a reality for national , regional and local government institutions . ‘ AI Watch ’ is one of these initiatives which has , among its goals , the monitor ing of European Union ’ s industrial , technological , and research capacity in AI and the develop ment of an analytical framework of the impact potential of AI in the public sector . This report , in parti cular , follows a previous landscaping study and collection of European cases , which was delivered in 2020 . This document first introduces the concept of AI appropriation in government , seen as a sequence of two logically distinct phases , respectively named adoption and implementation of related technologies in public services and processes . Then , it analyses the situation of AI governance in the US and China and contrasts it to an emerging , truly European model , rooted in a systemic vision and with an empha sis on the revitalised role of the member states in the EU integration process , Next , it points out some critical challenges to AI implementation in the EU public sector , including : the generation of a critical mass of public investments , the availability of widely shared and suitable datasets , the improvement of AI literacy and skills in the involved staff , and the threats associated with the legitimacy of decisions taken by AI algorithms alone . Finally , it draws a set of common actions for EU decision -makers willing to undertake the systemic approach to AI governance through a more advanced equilibrium between AI promotion and regulation . The three main recommendations of this work include a more robust integration of AI with data policies , facing the is sue of so -called “ explainability of AI ” ( XAI ) , and broadening the current perspectives of both Pre Commercial Procurement ( PCP ) and Public Procurement of Innovation ( PPI ) at the service of smart AI purchasing by the EU public administration . These recommen dations will represent the baseline for a generic implementation roadmap for enhancing the use and impact of AI in the European public sector . 3 Foreword This report is published in the context of AI Watch , the European Commission knowledge service to monit or the development , uptake and impact of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) for Europe , launched in December 2018 . AI has become an area of strategic importance with the potential to be a key driver of economic development . AI also has a wide range of potential social implications . As part of its Digital Single Market Strategy , the European Commission put forward in April 2018 a European strategy on AI in its Communication `` Artificial Intelligence for Europe '' . The aims of the European AI strategy announced in th e communication are :  To boost the EU 's technological and industrial capacity and AI uptake across the economy , both by the private and public sectors  To prepare for socio -economic changes brought about by AI  To ensure an appropriate ethical and legal f ramework . In December 2018 , the European Commission and the Member States published a “ Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence ” , on the development of AI in the EU . The Coordinated Plan mentions the role of AI Watch to monitor its implementation . Subsequently , in February 2020 , the Commission unveiled its vision for a digital transformation that works for everyone . The Commission presented a White Paper proposing a framework for trustworthy AI based on excellence and trust . Furthermore , in April 202 1 the European Commission proposed a set of actions to boost excellence in AI , and rules to ensure that the technology is trustworthy . The proposed Regulation on a European Approach for Artificial Intelligence and the update of the Coordinated Plan on AI a im to guarantee the safety and fundamental rights of people and businesses , while strengthening investment and innovation across EU countries . The 2021 review of the Coordinated Plan on AI refers to AI Watch reports and confirms the role of AI Watch to sup port the implementation and monitoring of the Coordinated Plan . AI Watch monitors the European Union ’ s industrial , technological and research capacity in AI ; AI -related policy initiatives in the Member States ; uptake and technical developments of AI ; and A I impact . AI Watch has a European focus within the global landscape . In the context of AI Watch , the Commission works in coordination with Member States . AI Watch results and analyses are published on the AI Watch Portal ( https : //ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch_en ) . From AI Watch in -depth analyses , we will be able to understand better the European Union ’ s areas of strength and areas where investment is needed . AI Watch wil l provide an independent assessment of the impacts and benefits of AI on growth , jobs , education , and society . AI Watch is developed by the Joint Research Centre ( JRC ) of the European Commission in collaboration with the Directorate -General for Communicat ions Networks , Content and Technology ( DG CONNECT ) . This document specifically addresses the following objective of AI Watch : ” To provide an overview and analysis of the use and impact of AI in public services ” . Particularly , it is a follow up to the f irst-year activities of AI Watch1 towards the investigation of the effective uptake of AI in the public sector , that goes beyond the piloting phase . As such , it builds on the knowledge gained after the collection of 230 AI use cases from EU ( Member States and A ssociated States ) national , regional and local government officially presented in July 2020 . This output has received extensive feedback from policy experts and practitioners , notably in the 2nd peer learning workshop with MS representatives held on S eptember 29th , 2020 ( van Noordt & Pignatelli , 2020 ) . While additional field research activities are now under way ( including an EU wide survey and case specific interviews ) , in order to take full stock of that knowledge , this report elaborates on the evidence gathered so far and makes additional reflections on the common characteristics and the critical aspects observed in most real life cases . In so doing , the concept of AI appropriation , i.e. , t he union of adoption and im plementation phases , in government is introduced , defined as a sequence of two logically distinct ( and sometimes recurring or 1 https : //ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur -scientific -and-technical -research -reports/ai -watch -artificial -intelligence -public -services 4 alternating , rather than linearly consecutive ) phases , respectively name d adoption and implementation of related technologies . Keeping the two phases separate surely holds heuristic value , confirm ed from the preliminary outputs of field activities . Moreover , it provides support to drawing several policy relevant implications , touching on both strategic directions introduced by a previous Science for Policy report of the AI Watch serie s ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) : “ governing with AI ” on the one hand , and “ governing AI ” on the other . In the first direction , the key question is to determine whether and under which conditions AI appropriation can become supportive of a durable and positively impact ful transformation of EU public processes and services , in line with the provisions of the Tallinn Ministerial Declaration on eGovernment . This requires a more advanced equilibrium between AI promotion and AI regulation going beyond the experimental nature of many ob served cases . In the second direction , a number of challenges are associa ted with AI implementation and use in government , which have been outlined by several theoretical and empirical research studies and are summarised in this report . The comparison with the US and China leads to highlighting the basic and distinc tive elements of a truly European governance model of AI . A governance model which could overcome the fragmentation of the EU GovTech market and set out the conditions for reconciling ethical values with technology adoption and implementation . The latter r eflections , among others , will be further extended and integrated with another forthcoming AI Watch publication , and will be shaped in the form of a proposed policy roadmap for securing the transition to an AI enabled and digital ly transformed government in Europe . 5 Executive summary The present document is structured in six Sections : here we summarize the main take -aways for the reader . In Section 1 ( Background and vision ) , a brief overview is provided of the research and policy state of the art behind this report and the whole AI Watch initiative . The narrative starts by considering AI as a General Purpose Technology , due to its distinctive features of pervasiveness , fast pace of diffusion , and innovation spawning tendency , which are also common to other e xamples of general purpose technolog ies in history . However , being a family of emergent , numerous and diversified technologies ( not to speak about the proliferation of custom solutions ) AI also holds traits of uncertainty and ambiguity , which require multi ple rounds of experimentation before a solution is adopted and may generate issues or delays in the materialisation of expect ed impacts from its implementation and use . These traits make the adoption and implementation of AI more complex and different from the adoption and implementation of “ conventional ” Information and Communication Technology ( ICT ) . In fact , in t he EU public sector , despite the good number of early adopters from various national ( and regional , and city ) governments , AI-enabled public sec tor innovation – not to say , transformation – often appears as the result of several concurrent elements , which are barely technological in essence . These include legal , organisational , work force-related , environmental , ethical or societal aspects that are often overlooked by a perspective embedded in technology determinism . The crucial relevance of most of those elements for the success or failure of AI solution implementation has started to be noted in the empirical search activities of AI Watch . To fit t hese considerations into a realistic representation of the Public Sector environment , the proposed approach is systemic : it take s into account the whole multi -layered and networked operational scenario , exploring the complex interactions among actors , proc esses , decisions and behaviours . This approach is necessary for research that goes beyond the an alysis of some individual , pilot AI project s. Section 2 ( Definitions and concepts ) introduce s the notion of AI appropriation as one of the overarching contribu tions of this technical report to wards developing an analytical framework of the potential impact of AI . Appropriation usually comes as the result of two consecutive ( though often cyclically recurring ) and conceptually distinct phases , which are name d adop tion and implementation of related technologies2 . With some preliminary confirmation from the just started field study work at AI Watch , the existence of a gap is highlighted between the phase where AI is tested and evaluated for potential use in public se rvice , and the phase where its injection and adaptation transform s the service ( and its provider ) more or less permanently . This gap is noteworthy for two reasons : first , qualitative analysis of a considerable number of known AI cases has shown that they successfully completed the phase of adoption but then found a number of unexpected issues right in the phase of implementation , which led to a total dismantling of the initial technology deployment . Second , any analytical framework for assessing the impact potential of AI in government would miss a crucial component if it only focuse s on AI adoption rather than also on implementation through service transformation and interoperability . In th e latter phase , which some authors also call technology “ institution alisation ” or “ instrumentalisation ” , the AI component is permanently embedded in the functioning model of the public sector organisation . This may ha ve been done in ways that ultimately affect , and are affected by , the broader context the organisation belo ngs to : thereby including , but not being limited to , collaboration with other agencies and bodies and the genera tion of perceived value for public service beneficiaries . The main research question behind this report is how European public policy can and sh ould contribute to a higher fraction of AI implementation efforts to go beyond technological and organi sational pilots developed in very specific contexts . Section 3 ( Lessons from the US and China ) makes some steps beyond the rhetoric al argument that Euro pe is falling behind the US and China in a techno -economic “ AI race ” , coming to the encouraging conclusion that under the perspective of AI governance , the EU gap does not seem to be as huge as shown by other metrics , such as number of companies or amounts of investment . Indeed , one of the main conclusions from th is comparison with the US and China is the common lack of policy focus on the actual appropriation of AI 2 ( McKinsey , 2020b ) defines adoption as the decision of an economic entity to invest in AI technology – as distinct from the decision to integrate it into the organizational processes , which is close to our understanding of AI implementation . 6 technologies in the practice of government . Europe might be in a favourable position to counteract earlier and more extensively . However , t wo main conditions need to be met : — First , unlike several eGovernment benchmarking exercises of the past , the demand side – or the observed benefits of AI implementation to service beneficiaries , the EU citize ns and businesses – should receive a similar ( if not higher ) level of attention than the supply side of AI . This is to avoid a mere count of AI solutions successfully trialled out , but never having become ( permanently ) used or still experiencing problems i n terms of scalability or interoperability . — Second , a systemic approach to facilitating AI in the eGovernment should be adopted ; setting out an AI governance vision that can be shared by all EU Member States , but also Regional and ( major ) City government s. Defining a common strategic direction will facilitate reciprocal exchange and continuous learning from the best available experiences of AI take -up . The section conclude s with a slightly different declination of the known concept of European “ exception alism ” , and by detecting the “ weak signs ” of an emerging , truly European model of AI governance . The model is rooted in EU intergovernmentalism , acknowledging the peculiarities of the “ business of government ” 3 and looking at the infrastructural elements o f AI development and deployment in the public sector , not just as a collection of preconditions for implementation , but also as targets of a n embryo nic shared agenda for enabling “ governance of AI , with A I ” . Section 4 ( Challenges to AI implementation in th e EU public sector ) follows the above line of reasoning and raises a number of relevant challenges to the attention of policy makers at EU , national , regional and local levels , willing to engage in and contribute to the proposed direction of AI governance : — The f irst of these challenges is the gener ation of a critical mass of public investments in AI , nominally allowed by the endowments of the upcoming Digital Europe Programme . Two main risks might hamper this challenge : the dispersion of financial resources across multiple and heterogeneous projects ( possibly also duplicating similar efforts in different countries ) and the inadequate rooting , or embedment , of the newly developed solutions in the practice of EU public administration ( p ossibly preventing the p rojects to go beyond adoption and into implementation ) . — A second policy challenge is making high quality datasets available , interoperable , and continuously updated , maintained and published , that are required for the training and adaptation of all types of AI algorithms ( supervised , unsupervised , reinforced ) and more generally for the progress and sharing of benefits of government digitalisation in all EU countries . In doing so , the risk might be to have “ wells of excelle nce ” on case selected based on the data underlying AI-enabled solution , surrounded by “ deserts of exclusion ” . In other words , the risk might be to qualify the AI solution and select the best ones based on the quality of underlying data excluding elements li ke the relevance and innovativenes s of the technological innovation . — A third has to do with attracting young tech talents in public administration and widely improving the literacy and skills of existing staff , particularly in the most “ peripheral ” public bodies and agencies with respect t o the ongoing trends . This may sound paradoxical , as the challenge of making innovation happen by introducing a comparatively complex technology might itself be better suited to attract competent and smart staff. ” But , in fact , the reverse is also true , th ough probably more difficult to explain : without adequate digital capabilities available in -house , some governments may not even be able to replicat e the most success ful use cases they come to know about by adapting already developed AI solutions to their specific site requirements , since ensuring successful appropriation of AI requires digital skills as well . This can be particularly unfortunate given the technological and organisational singularity of solution s discussed before . — A fourth group of challen ges is associated with the changing concept of legitimacy for those governments making more decisive steps towards AI implementation . The design of AI systems may lead to developers taking political decisions with limited oversight from public managers and elected officials , not to mention the citizens or other stakeholders ( “ Input legitimacy challenge ” ) . Especially in delicate or complex tasks , such as the award of competitions , some controversial decisions taken by opaque 3 In the remainder of this report , we will consistently use the word “ business ” to make reference , without distinction , to the core activities of a private or Public Sector organisation . In the latter case , we will also speak of th e “ business of government ” , an expression that should be rather familiar to researchers in public administration : see e.g . the book by Kessler & Kelley ( 2000 ) or the homonymous research centre by IBM ( http : //www.business ofgovernment.org/ ) . 7 machine algorithms in the place o f human beings can be more difficult to justify , and even lead to prosecut ion and sanction s for law infringement ( “ Throughput legitimacy challenge ” ) . — Moreover , and as shown by the field evidence gathered in the context of AI Watch so far , when moving from controlled to real life condition s of operation , the use of some AI systems may induce unexpected and unwanted consequences to the internal equilibria of an organisation or the surrounding environment , including some external stakeholders , while at the sa me time not significantly outperforming previous working methods or decision -making approaches ( “ Output legitimacy challenge ” ) . — Finally , the diffused implementation of user centric mechanisms for service transformation , particularly at the local level , in line with the eight fundamental principles of the Tallinn Declaration on eGovernment , is posed as a complementary requirement to achieving a sustained organisational change in the public body or agency involved in AI implementation . Section 5 ( Policy implications ) draws some lessons from the previous discussion and proposes a set of common actions for EU decision makers willing to undertake the systemic approach to AI governance towards a more advanced equilibrium between AI promotion and regulation i n the public sector . The EU ’ s AI strategy has at its heart the high level objective of b alancing regulation and uptake , through the establishment of ecosystems of excellence and trust between parties , hence the correct balance shall be pursued . The underly ing idea is that if AI innovation could generate common and shareable assets for many European ( at least national and regional ) public bodies and agencies , the formation and development of a new wave of AI start-ups participating in the GovTech arena would gain momentum , overcoming the fragmentation of the EU single market which is more prominent than in the US and China . We believe this argument should make an integral part of our analytical framework for impact assessment of AI implementation and use in t he European public sector . Starting from these considerations , three main suggestions or recommendations come to the forefront4 : — Stronger integration of AI with data policies ; — Facing the issue of so -called “ explainability of AI ” ; and — Broadening the current perspective s of both Pre-Commercial Procurement ( PCP ) and Public Procurement of Innovation ( PPI ) at the service of smart AI purchasing by the EU public administration . Section 6 ( Conclusion and way forward ) summarizes the key arguments made throughout the report and relates them to the upcoming work in AI Watch for the public sector during the year 2021 . In particular , we highlight the crucial importance of co -design , and therefore user and stakeholder engagement in public service transformation proces ses , as an alternative way to negotiate the scope and purpose of AI enabled innovation and therefore achieve reconciliation between ethical values and technology shaping . In this perspective , our proposed analytical framework for AI impact assessment – apart from highlight ing the need to reinforce four feedback loops ( design , adoption , implementation and use ) that materialise across its dynamic phases – paves the way for a sound integration of people , alongside algorithms , data and computing power , in the c ommonly accepted definition of AI : therefore , its implementation may n ever be completely successful if it is only done “ for ” the people , but needs to be achieved together “ with ” them . 4 These recommendations will be the starting point for a more in depth analysis that will result in a roadmap and an extensive list of recommendations towards the adoption of AI in the Public Sector . Those results will be part of the next report within the AI Watch . 8 1 Backgro und and vis ion This introductory Section is structured in three parts . The first ( “ Research background ” ) provides a brief overview of the global problem tackled , which is to explore the conditions for AI to produce durable transformative effects in the EU -27 public sector organisations adopting and implementing it . The second part ( “ Policy background ” ) frames this technical report within the scope of the AI Watch for the public sector initiative of the European Commission and in continuity with its work schedule . The third and final part ( “ What this report is about ” ) introduces the vision behind the proposed analytical framework for assessing the AI impact potential in EU government - which is to ignite and support a process of systemic learning among public sector experts and practitioners - and briefly outlines the con tents of the following five Sections of this report . 1.1 Research background AI is a portmanteau word standing for a collection of technologies that mimic or improve the capacities of the human brain – including perception , reasoning , and action ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) . The term is not new , as it holds a long history , dating back to the post -WWII period . However , it gained popularity and widespread diffusion at the turn of the millennium , with the progress in the so -called data economy5 ( the real “ fuel ” of AI ) and the exponential growth of computing power ( the “ engine ” of AI ) allowing the generation and validation of more and more complex algorithms and the emergence of promising applications in a variety of business domains . For its positive impacts on total factor productivity at the firm and industry level , AI is more and more defined as the General Purpose Technology of the 21st century ( Bassetti , Borb on Galvez , Del Sorbo , & Pavesi , 2020 ) . According to the economic literature ( Jovanovic & Rousseau , 2005 ) , the three distinctive features of a General Purpose Technology , which are s hared by e.g . the steam engine at the dawn of the industrial revolution and electricity at the beginning of the 20th century , are : pervasiveness , meaning that the technology is used in vast amounts of applications - as , for instance , electricity is used fo r heating and lighting , but also as a fuel for cars and trains ( Korzinov & Savin , 2016 ) ; fast pace of diffusion , facilitated by its cross -sectoral nature , wit h various different industries at the same time taking benefit from productivity improvements as well as influencing technological adoption in other , related industries ( Andergassen , Nardini , & Ricottilli , 2016 ) ; and finally an innovation -spawning tendency in terms of new produ cts and services , which unfolds and gains momentum across time ( Cantner & Vannuccini , 2012 ) . However , if we borrow part of the definition of emerging technology by Rotolo et al. , ( 2015 ) , “ its most prominent impact … lies in the future and so in the emergence phase [ it ] is still somewhat uncertain and ambiguous ” . Such uncertainty and ambiguity are magnified by the fact that th e specific AI technologies ( not to speak about custom solutions ) are so numerous and diversified that only by narrowing the focus on each of them it would be possible to assess their actual time to market ( Girasa , 2020 ) . Said differently , multiple rounds of experimentation are required before an AI solution is adopted and this may generate issues or delays in the materialisation of the expected impacts from its implementation and use . While the potential of AI is great , it is far from straightforward that this promising technology gets applied in the public s ector . Current examples of AI used in public services show that there are many different underlying factors and conditions to ensure the adoption of these technologies , starting from ensuring data access to develop AI models up to generating end -user accep tance ( Desouza , Dawson , & Chenok , 2020 ) . AIenabled public sector innovation is however the result of several concurrent elements , which are barely technological in essence ( van Noordt & Misuraca , 2020b ) . These includ e legal , organisational , workforce -related , environm ental , ethical or societal aspects that are often overlooked by a perspective embedded in technology determinism . Public sector organisations must be ready or , at least , should strive to strongly advance in all such aspects before they can start developing or using AI to maximize its potential and minimize related risks . Unfortunately , these other requirements are often overlooked , with most resources going to technological development . This is not the best choice , as the state of digitalization in the public sector across the European Union , from the central administration down to the local administrations , still 5 https : //eur -lex.europa.eu/content/news/building_EU_data_economy.html 9 requires significant progress in all aspects , and not only technological , in order to benefit the most from the potential of AI . Current trials a nd experiments involving AI in government now and soon are likely to determine to which extent they are going to drive the digital transformation of Europe ’ s public administration . In fact , as also highlighted by recent publications of the JRC , there is st ill very little knowledge about the effects and consequences of the use of AI technologies within public administration ( Barcevičius et al. , 2019 ; Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) . Empirical work is very scarce on how developed AI solutions work in practice and whether they are obtaining intended results successfully , which is crucial for establishing a common knowledge base to share best practices among public administrations across borders . While there have been mentions of successful pilots with AI in the public sector , it remains challenging for public bodies to integrate these solutions into the day -to-day operations of the administration . If this remains difficult , it could be that successful pilots of AI halt after a time , due to the end of funding , lack of personnel to ensure continu ity or other causes , thus wasting the opportunity to have a sustainable and positive im pact on the business of government . The challenge of overcoming ‘ ever -pilots ’ or ensuring integration in regular work practices is not new in public sector innovation , but critical to harness the potential benefit of AI for the time being . This challenge is not unrelated to the discourse on AI as General Purpose Technology , because the diffusion of AI technologies in the public sector can certainly contribute to the modernisation of European public administration , but also support the emergence of industri al “ champions ” in this key technological domain , potentially able to play the role of pan -European service providers . In fact , compared with the US and China , the value of the European market for GovTech solutions – which AI empowered government applicatio ns are part of – is only a small fraction according to available estimates However investments are expected to grow in the next years . Before the Covid19 crisis , a study from the Polish Economic Institute report s that the European expenditures on new techn ologies for public administration are in the range of €22 billion per year , about 6 % of global demand , though expected to treble until 20256 . Moreover , a recent publication by the JRC ( Dalla Benetta , Maciej , & Nepelski , 2021 ) report s that the AI investments for the European public sector account for 41 % of total AI investments in 2019 . This includes outlays on AI education as well as the adoption of AI technologies by the public sector . Compared to 2018 , in 2019 AI investments in the EU grew by approx imately €2.1-2.5 billion ( 39 % ) . If growth will remain constant , by 2025 the AI investments will reach €22.4 billion . Hence it will surpass the target , set at € 20 billion . On the supply side , a very similar proportion was found in global GovTech deals ( only 7 % compared with 85 % in the US ) according to the Founders Intelligence think tank7 . It is quite likely that this situation has remained unchanged during the pandemic , also in light of the low propensity to spend on ICT R & D of the EU public sector , which will be supported with ev idence in Section 4 of this report . 1.2 Policy background To gain better visibility of the above issues , in December 2018 the European Commission launched a dedicated initiative denominated “ AI Watch ” . The initiative is a monitorin g tool of the progress and achievements of the Coordinated Plan on the Development and Use of AI “ Made in Europe ” ( European Commission , 2018a , 2018b , 2021b ) . A specific activity within AI Watch deals with AI in the public sector and , i n a recently published study ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) , presented the results of a first exploratory mapping of the use of AI in EU national , regional , and local government bodies and agencies . An inventory of 230 ( and counting ) interesting cases of AI adoption was built , covering all 27 EU Member States , as well as Norway , Switzerland , and the UK . Also , a narrow focus was set on eight i llustrative examples , highlighting the problems and perils of AI implementation . In particular , the findings from case histories revealed that the ethical , societal and organisational/HR implications of AI use in government should be a matter of high conce rn for prospective adopters , notably because of the difficulty of predicting impacts in full when relevant decisions are taken . Another important piece of evidence was that not only the technologies but also their uses were 6 Source : https : //polandin.com/42532388/govtech -market -in-europe -to-treble -by-2025 -polish -think-tank 7 Source : https : //medium.com/founders -intelligence/govtech -is-europe -missing -out-again -7815251e4617 10 rather diverse and the respectiv e maturity levels quite heterogeneous . This result prevented the authors from drawing too general conclusions in terms of usefulness , sustainability , and cost -benefit comparison . Finally , the geographical spread and thematic s cope of reported cases were often wide , but also unevenly distributed across Member States , government functions8 , and tiers of public administration . This was probab ly due to the use of secondary sources , of heterogeneous nature , for data collection , which hindered comparability to a great extent . Additionally , the collection also included several proofs of concept and temporary experimental trials , not only permanent embeddings in the realm of public service ( or policy ) , showing the importance of keeping up the distinction between “ adoption ” and “ implementation ” of AI . Moreover , a few specific cases , mentioned as running at the time of first gathering , were later found to have been discontinued because of various reasons , including significant criticism received from the general public , pressure from adversarial political forces or even executive orders from local courts of criminal justice . Further , the AI Watch for the public sector study included a “ deep dive ” into eight detailed case histories , which confirmed that the ethical , priv acy and social responsibility related concerns associated with the concept of “ trustworthy AI ” , as first introduced by the High Level Expert Group on AI ( HLEG ) appointed by the European Commission9 were fully grounded . Even if the evidence obtained in the study was an early exploration of the underlying ( still largely unknown ) universe of EU public sector organisations , the study proposed a taxonomy based on 10 “ AI typologies ” , not with the ambition of systematizing a fast-evolving domain , but with the more practical intention of mapping the potential uses of this technology , as detected from the inside of the application cases . Despite all the mentioned limitations , a number of findings are noteworthy from that study , which constitute s a sort of starting po int for this follow -up publication . These include : — A hands -on demonstration of the increasing importance gained by AI in the EU -27 public sector10 , both in support of existing processes and services – with an eye on efficiency , effectiveness and quality – and of their digital transformation into radically new ones ; — The experimental nature of many , potentially highly impactful , but still waiting to be validated or finalised , thematic applications ; — The huge diversity of used technologies and related solutions , still in search of a critical mass for permanent establishment at government site and of a credible scalability pathway for EU - ( or national - ) wide diffusion or replication11 ; — Widespread awareness of the role of public policy to promote and facilitate , but also regulate and manage AI implementation in the practice of government , as witnessed by the concurrent emergence of national strategies – though at different speeds – in almost all EU Member States ; and — The need was highlighted to develop a socio -econom ic impact assessment framework , looking beneath the surface of the supposedly unequivocal benefits of AI take -up in government . 1.3 What this report is about In continuity with this work schedule , this publication aims to develop an analytical framework of th e impact potential of AI in government . It does so by elaborating further reflections on available evidence – 8 These were defined according to the COFOG functional classification of government originally developed by the OECD in 1999 an d published by the United Nations , see : https : //unstats.un.org/unsd/classifications/Family/Detail/4 , which is well established in statistical research and practice . However , it should be borne in mind that such a “ b usiness oriented ” definition of activities of public relevance leaves room for the inclusion ( although only in few cases , such as in healthcare ) of a number of entities that are not actually gove rned by public law . 9 https : //ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/high -level-expert -group -artificial -intelligence 10 The analysis and database of cases also included evidence from non -EU countries such as Norway , Switzerland and the UK . 11 With all possible caveats related to the sampling mechanism , a relative prevalence was spotted in the observed cases of the f ollowing AI applications : Chatbots , Intelligent Digital Assistants , Virtual Agents and Recommenda tion Systems – followed at some distance by Predictive Analytics , Simulation and Data Visualisation . 11 also from third parties – as well as other noteworthy elements of the previous AI Watch for the public sector study . The latter also included a su rvey of national AI strategies and the inputs gathered from EU Member States at a first Peer Learning Workshop held in February 202012 , which was followed by a second edition in September 2020 , the results of which are separately reported by another JRC pub lication ( van Noordt and Pignatelli , 2020 ) 13 and are taken into account as inputs for the reasoning attempted here . Our starting assumption , better elaborated in Section 2 of this report , but still lacking firm empirical evidence in support , is that a successful appropriation of AI brings with it a higher level of complexity than “ conventional ” ICT . Said differently , the chances that ( other things being equal ) a private or e ven public sector organisation may plan and execute successfully and in a given time all the steps belonging to the adoption and implementation process are lower in the case of AI than ICT , with a greater likelihood of interrupting , stopping of reiterating some step . In particular , for public administrations , the following key analytical , but also very pragmatic questions arise : what kind of evidence is available about the successful implementation of AI in public administrations ? Which are the immediate re sults and longer -term outcomes/impacts ? How long did it take to materialise that evidence ? How many resources ( financial , human , etc . ) has been used ? To fit this analysis into a realistic representation of the surrounding environment , the proposed approach is systemic : that is , it recognises that in order to understand the dynamics and potential impact of AI in such an important part of society as government , it will be necessary to go beyond the study of individual pilot site results and look at the broade r interaction of actors , processes and decisions/behaviours as they occur in a multi -layered and networked operational scenario . Learning must be systemic , because of the complexity of the European policy scenario , far higher than the corresponding US and Chinese systems analysed in Section 3 , but also because of the need of singling out and widely sharing the most successful experiences of AI appropriation , in order to make them replicable and scalable in other EU public administration contexts . To grasp these opportunities in full , the thesis of this report is that the sustainable implementation of AI in public services is a key element for the uptake of A I in public services . In order to reach this sustainable use of AI , specific attention should be devo ted to the appropriation process , defined in the report as the sum of adoption and implementation . As the first step in that direction , Section 4 proposes a reasoned list of the crucial challenges that the EU public sector is fa cing at all levels on the way towards a diffused adoption and implementation of AI in its daily practice . Section 5 – the last before the conclusions – proposes a set of common actions for EU decision -makers willing to undertake the systemic approach to A I governance towards a more advanced position between AI promotion and regulation in the public sector . Such a position is primarily suited at the level of coordination between the European Commission and the Member States . The concluding Section 6 summa rizes the key arguments made throughout the report and relates them to the upcoming work in AI Watch during the year 2021 . It also presents the first version of the analytical framework for AI impact assessment in the public sector , which is associated with a number of testable implications for future field work , both with in AI Watch and outside it . In the coming months and years , adequate finance will be mobilised to support the experimental deployment of AI solutions in the EU public sector . This is enco uraging , however , it remains of tantamount importance that these resources are finalised to a human -centric reshaping of government practice in Europe and that the introduction of AI enabled components in processes and services becomes pervasive at all adm inistration levels , including across the country borders . 12 https : //knowledge4policy.e c.europa.eu/ai -watch/ai -watch -peer-learning -workshop -ai-use-impact -public -services_en 13 For a full overview of the current situation at EU level the reader can consult the following URL : https : //knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/ai watch/national -strategies -artificial -intelligence_en 12 2 Definitions and concepts This Section gathers most of the concepts acting as theoretical foundations of the proposed analytical framework of AI impact assessment in government . In particular , three main messages are delivere d to the attention of EU experts and practitioners , to start materialising the “ systemic way ” of policy -oriented learning introduced in the first Section of this report : — The a nalysis and evaluation of the impact potential of AI in government should not stop at the phase of adoption , but continue up to includ ing the outputs and outcomes of the implementation phase . These two phases jointly constitute what we name technology appropriation in general , and AI appropriation specifically . See the following paragraph 2.1 for more details ; — For the success of AI appropriation , “ context matters ” , in all its aspects , which are not necessarily only technical ( e.g . they may be also legal , societal , or organisational ) and add to the requirements of the expected users of the newly introduced solutions . See paragraph 2.2 for an in-depth discussion ; — While evidence is being gathered from individual AI case studies in terms of benefits and drawba cks , a systemic learning approach should be followed , enabling public policy , at EU and Member State levels , without forgetting the Regional and ( at least the major ) City governments14 , to build the conditions for AI take-up trials to be truly transformativ e for the public sector , leaving the status of technological and organisational singularities . How to achieve this goal is presented in the final paragraph 2.3 of this Section . 2.1 From adoption to implementation : the process of AI technology appropriation Technology is broadly considered as a social construct , resulting from the convergence of the needs , tensions , ideas and actions ( even contradictory sometimes ) of human beings and social groups ( Pinch & Bijker , 1984 ) . However , technology is also known to shape the course of societal life , if not determining it , for the various aspects it touches and affects , which may well include cultural practices and interpersonal relations – as the examples of personal computing ( Robinson , Barth , & Kohut , 1997 ) , mobile phones ( Ling , 2010 ) and social media networks ( Simplilearn , 2016 ) convincingly demonstrate . These two opposite perspectives used to be contrasting each other , however , in the past few decades they have evolved into a unitary vision that speaks in terms of co-construction of technology and society ( Feenberg , 2010 ) . Government – meant as a group of people with the authority to rule a community , depending on whether professionally or politically engaged – is also part of society . It can exercise power in various ways , as outlined above . Because of its larg e purchasing power ( public procurement accounts for almost 25 % of GDP in Europe ) , government can pull innovation to market and it can also be a prime mover , or a leader when it comes to technology change . In doing so , the fundamental act igniting the process is a public purchase , realised according to the rules of public procurement : “ of innovation ” , if the case applies , or traditio nal procurement . Put this way – i.e . with government seen as an integral part of societ y , and having the possibility of initiating or supporting the adoption and diffusion processes ( Rogers , 2010 ) of novel technologies , particularly those with the stamina of positive and widespread impacts on the population – the vision of technology and society being reciprocally co -constructed gains two more analytical dimensions . On the one hand , g overnment uncovers an additional policy instrument promptly available , that is public procurement , which can be used to accelerate or redirect technological change in the local or global environments ; for example , towards sustainability ( United Nations , 2017 ) . On the other hand , by introducing more and more technologies in its own area of operation , government inevitably transforms itself and the way it delivers value to other societal actors – such as citizens and businesses , but also the policy makers and civil servants who work within it15 . The th eory ( and practice ) of technology adoption in government has a long history and plenty of evidence is now available , including controversial endeavours and unachieved goals . Quite interestingly , Vedung ’ s original discourse on policy instruments was motivat ed by a perceived lack of understanding – more than twenty years 14 In facts , s everal regions have their own AI strategy and some cities are in the forefront with respect to AI adoptio n. See for example the DT4REGIONS projec t : https : //openlivinglabdays.com/enacting -digital -transformation/ 15 A specific field of research and practice is digital transformation of government ( Hinings , Gegenhuber , & Greenwood , 2018 ) , which has gained prominence in the recent academic debate . However , we prefer using the more generic concept of technology adoption and implementation , to align better with some of our reference sources ( Jennie Carroll and Andrew Feenberg , above all ) and also t o include non-digital technologies ( Barley , 1986 ; Delaney , Timbrell , & Chan , 2008 ) in the picture we are trying to draft herein . 13 ago – on the tools that could be used by public decision -makers willing to interfere with the course of societal actions ( Vedung , 1998 ) . Usually , such interference is referred to as governance ( Hufty , 2011 ) : a topic widely studied , and practised , over the past decades , in all its possible articulations ( actors , stakeholde rs , territories , goals , needs , processes , even supportive technologies ) . There is one major exception : the problems and perils of technology implementation . Technology implementation comes right after the adoption phase and describes the transformative imp acts of the permanence of that technology in the body of the organisation . Keeping adoption and implementation conceptually distinct brings advantages16 . The most important is to highlight the existence of a gap that is connatural to any process of technolo gy appropriation17 . This gap separates the phase where innovation is tested and evaluated for potential use from the phase where the underlying , technology enhanced product or service process is permanently affected and transformed into something different than what it used to look like before . Figure 1 . Technology appropriation disentangled . Source : JRC , own elaboration . The existence of this gap , which is made evident in Figure 1 by the frac ture between the two halves of the rectangle , is even more clear if we read the ( exemplary ) list of tasks belonging to each of the two phases . There is little overlap if any at all . However , the most important thing is that the global process of appropriat ion may well become cyclical – that is , with its two phases of adoption and implementation alternating and repeating across time , in the framework of the same business application . This is because there is no guarantee that even a successful ending of a te chnology trial – particularly in , but not limited to , public sector organisations – will immediately and almost automatically yield the embedment of the corresponding technology , as it was trialled , in the daily operation of that organisation . Echoes of this distinction between adoption and implementation can also be retrieved in the organisational literature stream initiated by James March ( 1991 ) when describing the fundamental tension – determined by the scarcity of available resources – between exploration “ captured by terms such as search , variation , risk taking , experimentation , play , flexibility , discovery , innovation ” and exploitation , “ including such things as refinement , choice , production , efficiency , selecti on , implementation , execution ” . 16 Similar to the ones introduced by the taxonomy propos ed by ( Vedung , 1998 ) . 17 By this term , we roughly point at the union of adoption and implementation , also bearing in mind that individual and group us ers of a certain technology after it is embedded in an organisational setup make changes to both the technology and the environm ent , which inevitably feed back into both steps of the singled -out process ( Barley , 1986 ; Carroll , 2004 ) . 14 Whatever direction the organisation takes is unsatisfactory : exploration without exploitation may look like an unjustified investment of time and efforts in knowledge development or acquisition , while exploitation without exploration brings with it a number of risks related to a superficial appraisal of the convenience of that specific knowledge appropriation for the good functioning and long -term survival of the organisation18 . The suggestion from Levinthal & March ( 1993 ) is therefore to find a proper balan ce between the two , a goal that is however far more easily stated than achieved . Two major modes of balancing out have been highlighted in the literature , both termed ambidexterity to signify the capacity of an organisation , including a government body or agency ( Choi & Chandler , 2015 ) , to play on both fronts successfully . In particular , structural ambidexterity occurs when a private or public entity manages to create distinct subunits or working teams , each specialising in either exploration or exploitation activities ( Gupta , Smith , & Shalley , 2006 ) . We could think of something comparable in those public sector organisations having distinct offices for – say – IT support or procurement and service operations . On the other hand , sequential ambidexterity takes p lace when organisations alternate exploration with exploitation phases across time ( Tushman & O ’ Reilly , 1996 ) . This brings us back to the cyclical nature of technology appropriation outlined in Figure 1 above . Reflecting on the conceptual distinction and actual gap between adoption and implementation is vital when it comes to new and innovative technologies – such as AI , the main subject of this report . In fact , innovative technologies have the potential to bear huge transfo rmative implications , even though those implications remain largely unknown , due to conceptual confusion between the two phases and the presence of few , anecdotal information available on the implementation phase . Unfortunately , and as witnessed by anothe r JRC Technical Report ( Bruno , Schiavone Panni , Marchetti , Molinari , & Valente Covino , 2020 ) analysing more than 150 pilot experiments of public service digitalisation : “ The propensity of pilot owners to share results and lessons learned in a structured manner is q uite limited and this adds noise to the evaluation of scalability potentials , not to mention the difficulty of defining reliable reuse or transfer pathways involving other public sector organisations than those in the original pilots . This lack of informat ion is particularly undesired in case of new and emerging technologies , such as blockchain or Artificial Intelligence , which naturally lend themselves to being trialled in very similar – yet never too much – pilot contexts , thus increasing the risk of ‘ rei nventing the wheel ’ – i.e . of duplication , if not proliferation , of limited size experiments ” . In fact , even the analysis done within AI Watch over a meaningful number of AI cases known has shown that many projects successfully completed the adoption phase before finding some unexpected , yet critical , issues . This happened often in the phase of implementation and it led to a partial or total dismantling of the initial technology deployment . Typical issues were legal issues , biased recommendations , staff res istance and some others . The reasons for such a failure are certainly manifold , depending on the case specificities , but they can probably be reconnected to the observed gap between the first and the second phase of technology appropriat ion . Indeed , payin g utmost attention to adoption is well justified by the predominantly experimental nature of current AI solutions , which are hardly consolidated in standard product s or service s that can be purchased off-the-shelf and installed without further elaboration and adaptation . However , the need for experimentation , in our opinion , should also include the way public administration and its external environment are transform ed after the implementation of AI , as well as the immediate and deferred ( mostly non-technolo gical ) consequences of that transformation . As a matter of fact , the complexities and peculiarities of public service requirements at all levels – local , regional , national – are so binding that each success story can be described with a complex appropriat ion process that goes far beyond a mere transfer of an AI solution already operational in the private sector . Although we are still missing supporting evidence , we hypothesize that the level of direct engagement of public buyers with private suppliers in t he co -design , experimentation and refinement of AI prototypes was comparatively higher than the hypothetical benchmark of installing an IT solution already available off -the-shelf . On many occasions , the “ power ” of AI was not leveraged with a full -blown so lution , but through the more nuanced and 18 An appraisal which usually consists in extrapolating from explorations undertaken elsewhere ( in the case of public administra tion this is often the private sector ) . 15 subtle insertion of AI technology elements – such as the capacity to analyse data , to propose answers , or to interact with human beings – into a specific stage of the service delivery process . A considerable number of cases allegedly never went beyond the trial or piloting phase . In a few instances , the decision to “ go live ” was reverted because of unexpected complications or negative impacts on society , human rights etc . This makes a “ plug and play ” AI solution difficult to be successfully implemented in a government context : the best way to ensure success is the realisation of several rounds of multidisciplinary testing , refinement and validation prior to final technology embedment . 2.2 Putting AI innovation in context : the proposed analytical framework Figure 2 is an idealistic representation of the scope of the evaluation . Given a certain collection of technologies , for instance , those globally termed “ AI technology families ” in the collection on the left-hand side ; their appropriation inside an organisation usually starts with the creation of a subset of potentially suitable technologies . Figure 2 . The proposed analytical framework . Source : JRC , own elaboration . How technology choice is executed depends on several factors , the influence of which is highlighted by the use of arrows . We know that the previous study ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) clustered AI technologies according to three main research and application strands , name ly Perception , Reasoning and Action . “ Perception stands for the capacity of an intelligent machine , be it a pie ce of software or a robot , to understand ( give meaning to ) the signals coming from the external world - such as images , either still or in motion , and sound , e.g . music or speech . ( … ) Reasoning is … the goal to replicate/improve a human being ’ s capacity to analyse and draw inferences from the data and information received from the external world . ( … ) Action [ points at ] a wide variety of application domains … both in software industry … and in hardware manufacturing ” . The technology chosen is expected to be a combination of technologies belonging to one or more strands that are suitable for the purpose . Hence , k nowing wh ich strand should be selected is the first move towards the choice . The choice is expected to be subsequent to an analysis of user require ments ( the elaborated needs of people inside and outside the organisation , who are going to be affected by or engaged in the future use of the AI 16 solution ) : . It is extremely important to scrutinize the needs of the users to see where the automation of perception , reasoning or action ( or a combination of the three ) are desirable . Finally , this exercise does not happen in a vacuum , but is or can be influenced by a number of contextual factors , i.e . crucial aspects of a public sector organisation ’ s operational environment other than the specific needs and requirements that the chosen technology promises to fulfil . Contextual factors may include for instance : the nature of the service or process at hand , peer pressure from other organisations or a specific endor sement of technology change from key stakeholder groups . The following table provides a tentative list of such influential factors , the relevance of which is now being empirically assessed through direct interviews with AI Watch for public sector case owne rs . Table 1 . Tentative list of contextual factors . CATEGORY EXAMPLES POLITICAL FACTORS Elected officials endorsing the experimentation of that technology and/or its embedment in the administrative or policy processes ORGANISATION AL FACTORS Support by the top and/or middle management and/or the frontline staff involved in the technology trial and/or the permanent implementation of its results inside the organisational structures INFRASTRUCTURAL FACTORS Availability of supporting d atasets or IT equipment within the organisation adopting or implementing that technology innovation DEMAND RELATED FACTORS Needs expressed by third parties , i.e . other public organisations and/or their users interacting with the one engaged in technology acquisition TECHNICAL FACTORS Response to user needs offered by that technology and complementarity /interoperability with other IT solutions already in place of the same or similar kind SUPPLY RELATED FACTORS Integration of an external IT partner with functional expertise or specific capacity of the IT staff internal to the organisation FINANCIAL FACTORS Availability of adequate , “ ad hoc ” funding to the project and/or the embedment of its results in the current business practice LEGAL FACTORS A clear f ramework incentivising technology innovation , early re solution of data privacy and/or security aspects , other legal or regulatory requirements ETHICAL FACTORS Expected/actual and especially unwanted consequences of technology implementation to people , social groups , the environment etc . DOMAIN FACTORS In addition to the factors listed above , there could be various other factors , more fragmented and partially overlapping , which are dependent on the specific application domain ( e.g . Health ) and also on the specific geographic location ( e.g . cultural factors ) Source : JRC , own elaboration . During the adoption phase ( see Figure 1 ) both the user requirements and ( some or all of ) the aforementioned contextual factors oper ate , and to a great extent interoperate with each other , along the familiar sequence of steps normally associated with new technology experimentation : solution design , technical development , testing and val idation . These steps are visualised by a set of sm all vertical rectangles , of diminishing height because of the “ narrowing down ” process that usually starts from an initial range of options or alternative designs and prototypes to reach the final status of tested and validated technology deploy ment . Howev er , experience shows that any adopted technology rarely survives as such to the phase of implementation , as defined in the previous paragraph 2.1 – i.e . a situation that is no longer experimental , but close to permanent take -up of the newly developed solution in real use contexts . In fact , it is quite likely tha t during and because of usage , aspects related to human behaviour come to the surface , which were not planned by the developers ( Bagozzi , 2007 ; Bailey & Barley , 2019 ) . More generally , and as shown in the right part of the above p icture , the first use of a technology solution inevitably leads to check its actual performance against 17 the user requirements and the contextual factors considered as most influential on its choice and initial configuration . This may lead to a variety of a lternative outcomes , including dismissal ( Option 1 ) , confirmation without revisions ( Option 2 ) , or a reiteration of the design -development -testing -validation process , to achieve a different type of custom solution ( Option 3 ) . This variety of outcomes is mi rrored by the evidence gathered in the AI Watch cases mentioned in ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) and probably also reflects the field expe riences of most readers of this report . For the purposes of this report , which are related to the delivery of an analytical framework for assessing the impact potential of AI in government – indeed , one of the main expected outputs of the AI Watch for the public sector activity as a whole – the discussion should highlight three important implicatio ns : 1 . The f irst use of an AI solution is c rucial to refine or perfect its initial deployment . Probably more so because of the highly experimental nature of AI and t he absence of suitable “ plug and play ” applications not need ing further customisation . However , it is not easy to achieve first use in controlled conditions within real or realistic public sector environments , and this may be an obstacle for a more diffuse d take -up of AI in government ; 1 . Relevant user requirements , for shaping AI adoption , should not only reflect citizen and business needs in terms of service transformation but also extensively include governmental actors , from civil servants using the newly introduced solution in their daily work to managers responsible for service delivery and held accountable for its quality , transparency , etc . ; 2 . Alongside requirements , contextual factors are also very important . These are not only technical or infrastructur al but legal , societal , organisational , ethical etc . Roles and accountability have to be assigned and defined appropriately . A tentative list is provided in Table 1 above and their consideration as potential drivers or barriers should accompany both phase s of the AI appropriation process , i.e . not only adoption ( or exploration ) but also implementation ( or exploitation ) . When looking at context systematically , however , the first allowance to be made is its uncontrolled variability across time . This means th at the same contextual factors may change , or act differently in relation to the same AI appropriation process , including because they are influenced by the appropriation process itself . For example , in a related study , De Nigris et al. , 2020 described the connection between AI take -up and Covid19 in terms that can be paraphrased as follows : in many EU countries , the curve of newly adopted AI solutions in healthcare has become almost as exponential as the contagion curve itself . Despite the absence of systematic field evidence , we can speculate that the unusual pressure ( both in terms of time and scope ) from the external and unforeseen circumstances related to the pandemic among other effects has forced many national authorities in charge of public health care to take a fresh look at the datasets they were already in possession of , as well as increasing th e amount of funding available and allowed for more risk taking . For sure , the huge amount of potentially useful ( if not vital ) but till then unexploited information demanded a totally new approach to data handling and sharing , which was to be made compatib le with the changing user requirements , as forced by the emergency situation . Put in this way , fighting the data overload issue and increasing the quality of intelligence may have been the two most relevant needs fulfilled by choosing AI as a technological solution . Nevertheless , there is more : proceeding from adoption to implementation , healthcare users may have started to create new datasets or trial new uses of data that weren ’ t considered relevant in the former , indubitably quieter and more predictable , scenario . On the one hand , this new data may have acted as a solid justification for continuing the use of that solution . On the other hand , it would require a supplement of reflection on the compliance with all the contextual aspect s ( above all ethical a nd legal factors ) . Whether that could be the start of one of those massive imitation and emulation processes that are well known in the organisational learning literature ( DiMaggio & Powell , 1983 ) through which innovation becomes widespread in the public sector it is too early to say . What can be anticipated is that its materialisation woul d most likely need a supplement of result analysis , strategic planning and maybe concerted action among the EU and Member States . Also , in light of this example , however , it seems indispensable to include the implementation phase – which other authors cal l technology “ institutionalisation ” or “ instrumentalisation ” – into the scope of AI impact evaluation . During that phase , the use of an algorithm or any other developed component becomes permanently 18 embedded in the functioning model of the public sector or ganisation , in ways that ultimately affect , and are affected by , the broad er context the organisation belongs to . This can also include interoperability with existing datasets and services , creation of new AI -enables services , and collaboration with other agencies and bodies in the generation of perceived value for public service beneficiaries . 2.3 What can we learn ? Towards a systemic view of AI appropriation in the public sector The broadened analytical perspective proposed in this Section has two major imp lications in terms of the evaluation approach . The first is to transcend the consideration of AI as a technological singularity , i.e . something that came out of the blue and the organisational or societal impacts of which can not be controlled for ( Vinge , 1993 ) . The second is to overcome the specular appraisal of AI as an organisational or service singul arity , based on the assumption that success ( or failure ) , of a certain AI technology appropriation , is irredeemably related to the specific conditions framing that process , and those conditions are unique and will never be replicable in different locations . Overcoming this aspect means going beyond the narrative of a single , unique case ( Schon , 1983 ) , looking at “ what works for whom and in what circumstances ” ( Tilley , 2000 ) . This implies starting the analysis and evaluation of a case with the goal to describe and generalise the changes that occur in a public sector organisation – and in the broader context , it belongs to – as a result of AI appropriation . Mapping these changes ca n help qualify the anecdotal evidence extracted from the cases analysed by the AI Watch for the public sector activity so far , in terms of lessons learned and suggestions for improvement , scalability potential or avoidance of duplicate efforts . Positioned as they are at the stage of implementation , rather than adoption , of AI technology in government , the cases mapped deep dive into the “ black box ” of public service redesign , reengineering , and restructuring – in one word , innovation . And any innovation is either pervasive , or ubiquitous , outside and inside an organisation , or can not even be named as such ( Bachman & Bozzone , 201 1 ) . This report goes exactly in this direction , and more research is still to come within the AI Watch . Of course , some of the changes brought about may be negative , rather than positive . Just a mention of the known challenges , and often barriers and con straints , related to ICT ( not only AI ) take-up in government is enough to show that the devil is really in the details . Nevertheless , the learning aspect may concern which new regulatory initiatives or investment programmes are most appropriate to enhance the positive and reduce the negative consequences of transform ing the business practice of the public bodies or agencies involved . However , at this stage , the information already available from previous studies is too qualitative and anecdotal and it is ma inly looking at specific case studies . Therefore , in the remainder of this report , we will focus on what public policy should learn from th e available collection of cases ( including failure stories ) in such a way to make learning as systemic as the nature of the cases themselves seems to suggest . In his seminal article , Evert Vedung ( 1998 ) introduced a popular taxonomy of policy instruments , suggesting that research on their functioning , effectiveness and impacts was still in its infancy at the time : — Regulation ( “ Sticks ” ) , which obliges people and organisations to a certain proactive behaviour against the threat of a penalty or punishment ; — Incentives ( “ Carrots ” ) , mostly of economic or financial nature , although subsequent evidence has suggested that ot her influential ‘ nudges ’ should be considered , such as reputation and confidence/trust ( Reisch et al. , 2017 ) ; — Persuasion ( “ Sermons ” ) , the defining property of which is the use of rational arguments to motivate certain patterns of behavioural change . Accor ding to Vedung , but also common sense , the “ degree of constraint intended by the policymakers ” declines from “ Sticks ” to “ Carrots ” and from “ Nudges ” to “ Sermons ” . This leaves the issue partly unattended of which degrees of freedom societal actors are left with ( or keep for themselves ) by each instrument ; including in , but not limited to , the exercise of innovation and use of technology in real life application domains . However , the role government can play is much broader , particularly in relation to diffus ing digitalisation processes , which 19 have influence not only on the technolog ical change but also on the very evolution of societ y ( of which , public sector transformation is a part ) . Analysing the possible roles the Public Sector can play in the diffusion of AI , we can borrow from a taxonomy Borrás and Edler ( 2020 ) have suggested for the area of Smart Cities . In fact , research on smart cities is closely related to research on AI , above all because local government is one of the greatest producers of big data – the fuel of the AI engine – worldwide ( Allam & Dhunny , 2019 ) . Six of the 13 roles identified by Borrás and Edle r ( 2020 ) are directly pertinent to an AI implementation process : — Facilitator of some change dynamics autonomously initiated by the private sector ( European Commission , 2011 ) ; — Lead user and co -designer of particular solutions to public needs , technology supported ; — Direct initiator of p rojects for the transformation of the targeted ( governed ) community/constituency ; — Promoter of third -party solutions that need to be experimented in a real or realistic environment ; — Enabler of societal engagement , thus encouraging the participation of activ e stakeholders in defining the direction of change ; and — Gatekeeper , thus regulating access and fruition of public spaces , resting under its ownership , by other involved actors . The existence o f these roles acknowledge s the existence of a broad network of a ctors that revolve around AI implementation . This network include s both governmental and non -governmental actors . The latter deserve specific attention . In fact , those are actors external to the governmental body but their collective and individual behavio urs contribute to the achievement of the desired ( or unexpected ) outputs and outcomes . This element is often highl ighted in the various cases of AI appropriation . This is one of the possible meanings that can be attributed to the distinction introduced by the previous study ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) between “ governing with AI ” and “ governing AI ” . In fact , these are not two separate and d istinct policy lines , but simply two sides of the same coin , with the important , additional element constituted by the already highlighted importance of the context in which operations are taking place , described and generat ing their implications . This vi sion is not new and has recently gained even more visibility and momentum . Two examples may suffice to demonstrate this . First , the OECD Observatory of Public Sector Innovation , after reviewing national AI strategies , concluded that the most robust ( and th erefore useful ) ones are those holistic and systems focused – i.e . that “ encompass all the various level of government and are attuned to structures and systems within the public sector that AI can influence or are trialled within . They are also considerat e of the interactions of other sectors and stakeholders ” ( Santos & Héang , 2019 ) . Second , in a recent JRC Technical Report on Projecting Opportunities for I Ndustrial Transitions ( POINT ) , AI is considered an industrial theme of growing global importance for the EU Regions and Member States engaged in re fining or extending the priorities of the respective Smart Specialisation Strategies ( S3 ) , in preparation for the next multi -annual financing period of the Structural Funds 2021 -2027 . In accordance with criterion No . 6 of the enabling condition of Good Gov ernance , appropriate actions to manage the industrial transition are those “ that harness cross -portfolio complementarities ( e.g . between ministries and between levels of governance ) and cross -stakeholder coordination ( e.g . between businesses and broad cons tituencies of consumers/users ) ” ( Pontikakis et al. , 2020 ) . Already in 2018 , however , the EU as a whole , rather than individual countries or regions , was identified as the ideal dimension for coordination of AI adoption and implementation policies , especially in , though not limited to , the public sector . This is one of the key commitments of the Declaration of Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence19 , signed by all Member States , which also embraced the sharing of best practice examples 19 https : //ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/eu -member -states -sign-cooperate -artificial -intelligence 20 in procuring and using A I in government , as well as in open data development and deployment . The connection between AI , Open Data and public sector digitalisation is also documented in the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence20 and the European Data Strategy21 – both issued on th e same day in February 2020 by the new Von der Leyen Commission . As usual , a strategic direction is the first element of any viable policy . Now it certainly is the case that at a high political level the directio n is very clear : quoting the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence – A European approach to excellence and trust ( European Commission , 2020d ) , “ the Commission is committed to enabling scientific breakthrough , to preserving the E U ’ s technological leadership and to ensuring that new technologies are at the service of all Europeans – improving their lives while respecting their rights ” . This directi on is also widely shared among the EU Member States , all of whom – including Norway , Switzerland and UK – are among the signatories of the Declaration of Cooperation on AI adopted on 10th April 2018 and reconfirmed with very few deviations within the National AI Strategies as also indicated by the Coordinated Plan on AI ( European Commission , 2018b ) and its recent review ( European Commission , 2021a ) . When it comes to AI in government , however , the picture becomes fuzzier . As Misuraca and van Noordt ( 2020 ) pointed out in their overview of state of the art , a “ sermon based ” approach seem to prevail in those EU countries that are taking action to stimulate the use of AI in public policies and services . Soft po licy instruments abound , such as awareness raising campaigns , calls to improve data quality , and employee training initiatives . However , and with some exceptions , their inspiration does not seem to go beyond considering public administration ’ s role as inst rumental to ( and maybe peripheral in ) achieving the European goal of value laden and ethically responsible AI development and deployment . As a matter of fact , public administration is not identical to any other potential ( corporate ) adopter of AI that is already active in th is market . Hence AI appropriation should not be pursued , however , by the mechanical transposition of technologies that worked well ( or at least seemed to work well ) in the private sector , despite the fact that AI takes on the distinctiv e features of a General Purpose Technology : pervasive , fast -paced in its diffusion , and innovation spawning . In fact , the distinctive traits of public administration in general , and the EU public sector specifically , are so peculiar and influential that the diffusion of AI technologies evidently follows alternative pathways , which must be understood first , and then coherently acted upon . 20 COM ( 2020 ) 65 final .

Here after a quick comparison with US and China , we highlight that a lack of policy focus on the actual level of appropriation of AI technologies in government is common to all , though the EU might be in a mor e favourable position to counteract this limitation earlier and more extensively . Specifically , paragraph 3.1 outline s , as a general and common issue to the three regions , that very little information is currently available on A I take -up and use in the respective Public Sector , and to a great extent also private sectors . Then , the next two paragraphs 3.2 and 3.3 briefly report about known initiatives – in the US and China , respectively – to stimulate the use of AI solutions in public administration . Finally , paragraph 3.4 wraps up the previous discussion and proposes to translate the systemic approach in terms of policy challenges and implications , thus introduc ing the reader to the contents of the following two Section s. 3.1 The terms of the techno -economic race In the discourse about AI development , a global race between the US , China and the EU is often mentioned as ongoing ( Craglia et al. , 2018 ) . International comparisons in terms of private investments , research and education projects , market applications and other metrics related to AI development are often mentioned within this discourse . Moreover , t here is a great interest to identify the big players in the AI field , as it is believed that successful AI companies can bring substantial economic ( and geopolitical ) benefits . This is consequent to considering that AI bu siness models tend to have a ‘ winner takes all -effect ’ ( Makridakis , 2017 ) : successful AI services tend to have more users involved in their use , which in return bring s more data to the company owning the service , allowing for further optim isation of the initial AI system and gaining further advantage on the competition . One of the most common ly mentioned metrics is the size of private investments into AI the three regions can record . McKinsey has estimated that the US holds by far the lead in this ranking , with around 20 times higher value than Europe between 2012 and 2018 . In China , private in vestments have also increased rapidly in the last few years , leading to approach the US performance quite closely now ( McKinsey , 2019 ) . Since 70 % of global AI investment comes from private companies , this is a significant gap government funding is inadequate to cover . In addition to having th is large volume of investment , the US is also home to many of the large st technology companies who are also able to gather large quantities of data from people all over the world , which can be used for further developing their AI app lications ( Craglia et al. , 2018 ) . Europe , instead , has far less venture and public capital invest ed in GovTech solutions , which makes it challenging for EU start -ups to access adequate resources and grow . Some countries , indeed , have been allocating more finance recently , such as the UK , Germany and France , which has turned the UK already into one of the top five global markets for AI investments . However , in the Southern , Easte rn and the smalle st European countries far fewer investments in AI have materialised in general . This points at another anomaly in the comparison with the US and China , with the EU not only lagging behind significantly in terms of private sector investment but also suffering from an unequal distribution among its Member States . This could mean that , over time , gaps between European countries might widen and lead to furthering the unequal distribution of potential benefits from AI uptake in their societies ( Shearer , Stirli ng , & Pasquarelli , 2020 ) . These findings are further supported by a related analysis of techno -economic segments conducted at AI Watch ( De Prato et al. , 2019 ) . This showed that overall most AI play ers are located in the US with a high number of firms involved in AI development . According to this analysis , the US is strongly represented in all thematic areas of AI , such as Computer Vision , Robotics and Automation , Natural Language Processing and others . Additionally , the report shows that China closely follows the US in terms of a number of active AI players , with many specializing in Computer Vision , Machine Learning and Connected and Automated Vehicles , and has the highest number of governmental and research institutions involved in AI . The EU also takes a strong role worldwide , but mostly in research . The analysis also shows that few AI companies in the EU file for patents and many of them are quite young compared to the US and China . Among the pos sible reasons for this performance , the principal seems ( McKinsey , 2019 ) to point at the lack of human resources in the domain , low levels of employment in the ICT industry , a structural lack of innovation propensity in the private sector and the existence of only a limite d number of tech 22 hubs in Europe . Moreover , there are also some US-based c ompanies entering the EU market where there is only a limited number of EU players . In particular , this phenomenon is observed at the local level o the take-up of local digital twins by cities . While the EU lags behind in terms of private sector investment , the European academic sector is much stronger . For more than 20 years , t he most influential academic papers on AI have come from European research institutions ( McKinsey , 2020a ) . However , the AI Index 2019 reports t hat authors of AI publications from the US gain more citations than the EU ’ s and China ’ s academic publications ( Perrault et al. , 2019 ) . The reverse side of AI development is uptake . Here international compa risons are less easy because very little information is available worldwide about the use of AI in companies and public sector organizations . A few surveys have identified and measure d the propensity to adopt AI in businesses , but especially China is not represented in them . Additionally , not all surveys use comparable methodologies or give general results for the entire region . Often the components of the technology families are not clearly described , there can be different understandings of what AI is or is not , the sophistication of used analytical techniques is varying and the purpose for which AI is adopt ed is vaguely defined . Thus , it remains difficult to compare adoption rates , specialisations and purposes for adoption . As an example , a global stud y done by McKinsey in 2020 shows that 50 % of respondents adopted AI in at least one business function ( McKinsey Analytics , 2020 ) . That ratio was in fact lower than the year before , with 58 % of the respondents doing so in 2019 . A closer look , however , shows th at this difference is explained due to a slight change in the survey question . So , AI adoption was considered to be more or less equal to last year across the different regions , showing that there was not a large differen ce between the US , China and the EU . Similarly , a survey done by the firm Cognilytica in January 2020 reported that 40 % of industry respondents were currently implementing at least one AI project or plan . Their findings highlight ed that companies from the US were more actively engaged in the short term than in both the EU and China , which seem to have more propensity for the long term ( Cognilytica , 2020 ) . The EC also carried out a survey among companies to assess their propensity to adopt AI technologies ( European Commission , 2020c ) . This found out that 42 % of EU-27 enterprises are using at least one AI technology . However , a similarly sized group of 40 % of respondents stated they did not use AI nor intended to do so in the following two years . Technology wise , no AI family has a particularly high uptake , as the Figure below shows . 23 Figure 3 . Propensity to adopt AI acros s EU-27 enterprises . Source : ( European Commission , 2020c ) . Larger enterprises are more than two times more likely to become adopters of AI compared to smaller and medium si zed enterprises , which shows that many smaller organizations do not have the current resources to exploit these technologies to achieve corporate value . Additionally , there is a big gap between the reported 42 % of companies using AI technologies , and the f act that when asked about specific families , the adoption rates are much lower . For instance , only 3 % of enterprises declared to be using sentiment analysis and 13 % AI for anomaly detection and process optimization . One of the reasons may be a different un derstanding of what AI is and is not : the respondents may make another mental association when asked about AI rather than its specific applications , a difficulty already noted in empirical research on AI ( Krafft , Young , Katell , Huang , & Bugingo , 2019 ) . Finally , EU entrepreneurs report significant obstacles limiting AI adoption , such as the lack of skills within existing staff a nd the costs of implementing AI technologies from scratch within their organizations . This lack of information concerning firm level adoption is similar , possibly even more scarce , in the case of government . Despite the fact that more information is avail able about the proposed governance strategies and initiatives with regards to AI , as documented in overviews such as ( Cath et al. , 2018 ; Craglia et al. , 2018 ; van Noordt & Misuraca , 2020a ) , very little information is available on the ( current prospective ) use of A I in EU public administration . The s ame goes for US and China , not to mention that similar comparability problems would emerge in the case of survey data . In fact , most of the comparisons between the EU , China and the USA regarding the use of AI by governm ents seems solely based on strategic policy document analysis or intentions of use – rather than actual deployment . In the following two paragraphs , a brief overview of initiatives undertaken by the US and Chinese governments to stimulate the use of AI in the public sector is provided . 24 3.2 Stimulating the use of AI in the US government In the US , the Federal Government has been designing initiatives to develop trustworthy AI for government services , aligned with the constitution and the creation of nation al value . Several Federal agencies have already been using AI for various purposes , such as processing grant applications , checking for compliance , improving of nautical charts , predictive maintenance and more . Indeed , a first mapping of the federal use of AI technologies showed 142 uses of AI in the most significant federal a gencies ( Engstrom , Ho , Sharkey , & Cuéllar , 2020a ) . These solutions are reported to make the government more responsive , effective , and efficient . Th us , the US administration plans to continue expand ing the use of AI in the public sector . The Federal Administration also noted that there are talent and workforce challenges limiting the increased use of AI in government . Therefore , it is looking into how to leverage expertise from the private sector to develop strate gies to increase organizational trust in adopt ing AI . In addition , some federal agencies are exploring new approaches to hire , train and retain existing workers with new skills to innovate government practice with AI technologies ( The White House , 2020a ) . Sharing expertise and best practice with AI is seen as an important mechanism to discover meaningful use cases and re -use existing applications . Thus , several hubs have been established in a number of federal agencie s. In the General Services Administration , the AI C enter of Excellence has been established to assist in developing AI solutions , but also help organizations in assessing their AI readiness ( GSA Centers of Excellence , 2020 ) . Similar ly , the Department of Defence has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre in order to execute the AI strategy of the institution . This acts as a central hub to accelerate organizational adoption of AI . Lastly , the Department of Energy has established an Artificial Intelligence a nd Technology Office to coordinate activities among various administrations ( The Whi te House Office of Science and Technology Policy , 2020a ) . Naturally , it is essential to improve building citizen s ’ trust in the use of AI in government through a proper governance approach . Thus , in an executive order signed in December 2020 , the Federal Government has put forward a number of principles AI in the government should adhere by during design , development , acquisition and usage ( The White House , 2020b ) . Similarly to the EU proposals on an ethical AI use , these principles include AI being : — Lawful and respectful to the American values . — Purposeful so that the benefits significantly outweigh the risks . — Accurate , reliable , and effective in line with the purpose it was used for . — Safe , secure , and resilient so that any malicious exploitation c an be avoided . — Understandable , so that its ways of operation and outcomes can be understood by experts in the same subject matter . — Responsible and traceable , so that the roles and responsibilities of people are well ass igned . The whole process of design , development , acquisition and use , its inputs and outputs , should be documented and made traceable . — Regularly tested against these principles to ensure that performance and outcomes are consistent with their intended use . — Transparent , so that agencies can disclose relevant information to stakeholders in accordance with the law . — Accountable , so that agencies can be held accountable for implementing and enforcing safeguards of AI . In 2021 , a roadmap will be published with policy guidance to support the implementation of these principles across various agencies so that their AI use is consistent with the order . In addition , an inventory will be prepared by each agency with their AI use cases to improve interagency coordinati on and the implementation of the use and reuse of AI . It is planned to have th is collection of inventories to be made public to the extent it is possible having in mind applicable law and policy constraints . Furthermore , the Presidential 25 Innovation Fellows program will establish an AI track with the aim to attract experts to help with the design , development , acquisition and use of AI in government , so as to increase the level of AI expertise in federal government ( The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy , 2020b ) . Under the new Presidency of Biden , the use of AI by the Federal Government remains one of the key strategic pillars in advancing on trustw orthy AI in government . Work is ongoing to support and coordinate the use of AI in Federal administrations , mostly through the CSA AI Center of Excellence which has been introduced before . In January 2021 the National AI Initiative 22 has been launched , whi ch aims to have the USA lead the world in the development and use of AI in the private , but also the public sector . Federal agencies seem to be tasked with a leading role in contributing to both facilitating AI development and uptake of AI across society . Application areas of importance in this initiative are agriculture , environment , financial services , healthcare , national security and defence , science , transportation , infrastructures , weather forecasting and the COVID -19 pandemic . The National AI Initiat ive is coordinated and supported by the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative Office , located in the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy . The State or lower levels of public administration in the US seem to be investing far less into the development and adoption of AI , although strong statements can not be made , due to a lack of empirical research on the topic . To support innovation at the local level , another important initiative under the Presidency of Biden focuses on local governme nt : in the Infrastructure Plan proposed during his campaign , President Biden promised to launch a yearly USD 1 billion competitive gr ant programme to help five cities pilot new planning strategies and Smart City technologies that can serve as models for th e country . Some U.S. cities seem to be waking up to the technology . Despite that , s urveys show that many State administrations in the US do not seem to be ready for the next level of digital transformation . A 2019 survey conducted among IT executives of the 45 State agencies sh owed that only 1 % of them have achieved broad AI adoption . Most AI adoption is merely in the Proof of Concept or Piloting phase . It is not yet being used in the core government processes ( Center for Digital Government , IBM , & NASCIO , 2019 ) . One of the key reported challenges is that core enablers of AI adoption , such as organisational readiness , have not made progress in recent years . The aforemen tioned survey shows that the most significant barriers to AI adoption at the State level is an outdated legacy IT infrastructure , poor organizational culture and lack of relevant skills . In fact , two -thirds of the respondents to that survey respectively highlighted that ( 72 % ) d id not have a ny policy in place regarding the responsible use of AI and ( 60 % ) did not have a n actionable framework to evaluate the risk s of AI implementation . While th e survey was conducted before the announcement of the federal princ iples and actions described before , it shows the importance of diffusing governance principles for AI across multiple levels of public administration – including those who are less likely to have the needed resources to invest heavily into AI . What the cur rent state of AI deployment is on the municipal level is currently not known , as no study or survey could be found which assesses the diffusion of AI at this level of government . Finally , there is mixed support in the US public opinion to the development of AI according to a survey of Americans . Support for developing AI varies between different subgroups , with those who are male , with a higher income or a computer background being more likely than women and people with lower education or income . However , Americans show little confidence in governmental organisations to manage the development and use of AI technologies . Instead , they place greater trust in technology companies us ing AI for the best interest – although , there was not a majority of Americans placing a ‘ great deal ’ or ‘ fair amount ’ of trust in any kind of institution . Finally , this does show that many Americans may be apprehensive of the deployment of AI by government institutions , likely to cause some trust issues if the technology gets rushed or is deployed opaquely ( Zhang & Dafoe , 2019 ) . Trust in government heavily correlates with citizens approval of government use of AI , although it varies on a case by case basis ( Carrasco , Mills , Whybrew , & Jura , 2019a ) . 22 https : //www.ai.gov/strategic -pillars/applications/ # National -Security -and-Defense 26 3.3 Stimulating the use of AI in the Chinese government Recently t he Chinese government plans for AI use in government services included a number of highly controversial initiatives , especially from a European perspective , such as the Social Credit System ( see below ) or the setting up of invasive surveillance systems using AI technologies to monitor minority groups . These initiatives aside , the Chin ese AI strategy is also focused on improving public services and governance through the help of AI technologies . Thus , public sector organisation s are exploring actively AI projects to address real -life problems . In 2017 , the Chinese State Council release d the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan which has been acting as a unifying document for China ’ s various AI objectives . This document lays out the importance of developing AI in various Chinese sectors , including public administration . However , other central government policies also stimulate public sector digitalisation , providing a favourable environment for exploring the use of ICT and AI in many application domains ( Chen , Ran , & Gao , 2019a ) . A common misunderstanding is that th e national AI strategy is pushed heavily from the top ; in fact , the Plan is not a directive , but more a wish list , where the lower levels of government are expected to play a vital role to take forward the actual transformation of society through AI ( Roberts et al. , 2020a ) . The nation al strategy seems to focus more on technological development , whereas experimentation and pilots are expected to be stimulated at the local level . Some local governments indeed have taken the frontrunner role and implemented AI going far beyond the current national AI policy , but also sparking some controversies . For example , cities are starting to adopt smart city initiatives , creating digital twins23 . There , tech giants are tasked with creating open innovation platforms to boost local innovation ecosystems . Partnerships with smaller companies or start -ups are argued to be less prevalent , which clearly differs from the European approach ( Elliott , 2020a ) . Although much more research is needed to understand how AI applications are deployed in the Chinese public sector , despite the great emphasis on develop ing AI for the provi sion of public services , the applications used in China are not described as being cutting edge or high ly sophisticat ed technology . Instead , their strength lies in the integration of various systems and capability to quickly scale up – about the same as mentioned for the AI currently in use in the US administration ( Engstrom , Ho , Sharkey , & Cuéllar , 2020b ) . Moreover , the actual delivery of AI -enabled public services seems to be mostly due to large technology companies favoured by the central government . An overview of AI development in China can not exclude one of the main flagship programmes of the Chinese government : The Social Credit System . This is an overarching policy initiative that aims to make individuals , businesses , legal institutions , and government more trustworthy by aggregating public data and improving Chinese law enforcement ( Creemers , 2018a ) . Sharing of data across various public sector departments is used to evaluate how someone is likely to comply with legal and contractual obligations , so as to improve the civic virtue of the population . The programme , however , has been perceived as an Orwellian government nightmare , by the Western media in particul ar , as some local governments and private companies have been experimenting with the use of social scoring based on the data collected in the city and other administrations . However , some do highlight that the Western view on China is incomplete , as the So cial Credit System faces many barriers in implementation , and the scoring still mostly relies on administrative documents , rather than including behavioural and third -party data – as these initiatives often fail to materialise ( Drinhausen and Brussee , 2021 ) . However , in areas where ( local initiatives of ) the Social Credit System have been implemented a negative score can have significant consequences for citizens , such as limiting crediting , banning travels , or being exclud ed from using private services . T hose with higher scores can for example gain discounts on public transport or priority access to government services . It is to be noted that according to some researchers , these initiatives are regarded as experimental and not directly related to the centr al government ’ s strategic plans . In fact , most of the cases lack technical sophistication and are still based on pen and paper at the moment ( Roberts et al. , 2020b ) . Furthermore , the opacity of AI affects the effectiveness of the Social Credit System as a 23 J.Watts KPMG https : //www.amcouncil.com.au/membership/special -interest -group/data -in-asset -manag ement/100001 -shanghai -gets-adigital -twin.html 27 whole , as citizens need to learn and understand how the decisions taken by the machine work so they can act accordingly . Without this extra transparency , social control may be strongly limited as it is not possible to define what the machines see as ‘ correct ’ behaviour ( Creemers , 2018b ) . However , even recently , the Social Credit System is regarded as a disjointed mix of pilots , and large gaps remain in data completeness and data transfers across Chinese public administrations . Despite existing implementation gaps , recent initiatives placed forward by the Chinese government show to resolve data governance challenges , and in the roadmap for a ‘ rule of law society ’ , the social credit system is a key instrument to do so ( Reilly , Muyao Lyu , and Robertson , 2021 ) . The use of AI in China for security and policing purposes is advanced . There has been a lot of investments and government effort s to apply AI technologies for security or counterterrorism purposes , with especially widespread surveill ance being put in place in the Xinjiang region to track the local Uyghur population ( Roberts et al. , 2020b ) . As the underlying ideology of social engineering and transformability of individuals through social control is unlikely to change , it is likely that the Social Credit System will develop further and existing challenges related to data sharing will be resolved ( Creemers , 2018b ) . Citizens in China do indicate the highest level of support for government applications of AI ( Carrasco , Mills , Whybrew , & Jura , 2019b ) , but not much additional information exists with regards to their perspective on government ’ s AI deployment to ‘ reward and punish ’ citizens based on actions taken . Despite the fact that the Chinese government is exploring and deploying even more controversial surveillance technologies , there are still legal and ethical challenges for the in troduct ion of AI in the public sector , just like in the EU and US . Concerns such as who is to be held accountable when governments base their decisions on AI or when something goes wrong are plaguing Chinese ad ministrations just as much . Civil servants state their concerns on whether the AI systems can be regarded just as legitimate as human beings or lead to unfairness in public service delivery , especially to vulnerable groups ( Chen , Ran , & Gao , 2019b ) . In this respect , China has also been working on the adoption of AI ethical principles and frameworks , which seem to align with global discussions and principles ( Elliott , 2020b ) . In 2019 , a Chinese expert committee released 8 recommendations that should be ad opted during AI dev elopment ( Laskai & Webster , 2019 ) : — Harmony and friendliness : Enhancing the common well -being of humanity should be the objec tive of AI since the beginning and thus should conform to human values and morality . Adequate security safeguards should be put in place to avoid potential abuse . — Fairness and justice : The development of AI should promote fairness and justice , the rights a nd interests of stakeholders and promote equality of opportunity . This should be done by raising the level of technology and eliminating bias and discrimination . — Inclusivity and sharing : All AI should promote green development and be environmentally frien dly , promote inclusive development by ensuring social divides should be removed and avoid data or platform monopolies . — Respect privacy : Personal privacy and individual ’ s rights should be respected and protected during AI development . — Secure/safe and cont rollable : AI systems should improve their transparency , explainability , reliability and controllability continuously to make them more trustworthy . This includes that the safety and the security of AI systems are strong . — Shared responsibility : Social resp onsibility among developers , users and other parties should be strong , and thus should follow relevant regulation s , ethics , and norms closely . An AI accountability mechanism should be established to clarify the different stakeholder ’ s responsibilities . People should have the right to know and comprehend potential risks and impacts . — Open collaboration : Exchanges and cooperation across disciplines , regions , organizations , and others should be encouraged for the development and governance of AI . International dialogue should be followed to promote the formation of an international governance framework , standards and norms , with full respect of each country ’ s principles and practices . 28 — Agile governance : The natural laws of AI development should be respected , bu t the search for new ways to develop AI and resolve risks should be encouraged . Potential future risks of AI should be anticipated to ensure that AI moves in a direction beneficial for society . Despite the similarit ies with the European and American ethic al principles , China is expected to place a stronger emphasis on social responsibility than individual rights in the interpretation of these principles . At the moment , most of these ethical norms and standards are limited to the statement of high-level pri nciples , although there are emerging debates on how to raise data protection and privacy standards as well as ethic al compliance , and a new regulation has recently been introduced in that sense , although with many exceptions for governments and state -endor sed companies ( Roberts et al. , 2020b ) . How the se ethical system s will be put into action , given the different interpretations in the EU , US and China , will help clarify where si milarities and differences in governance approaches to AI in the public sector do exist ( Elliott , 2020b ) . 3.4 Key take -aways As mentioned before , only a few studies about the use of AI in government services in the US and in China have been conducted , which makes the lack of comparable field research even more evident than for the private sector ( see e.g . Sousa et al . ( 2019 ) . Apart from the controversial cases of adoption , AI applications already in use that are highly successful may neither be shared publicly nor have gained much research attention ( Elliott , 2020b ) . This poses limitation s on the possibility of understand ing where and how AI solutions are deployed for enhancing government capacity , but also , what the practical effects are of their us age and reuse . Globally speaking , we can conclude that there seems to be an enormous gap between used metrics to track and me asure the comparative progress in AI investment and academic research , and the reality of AI deployment in public service s and processes24 . With this caveat , the gap in AI take -up in the public sector between the EU , US and China does not seem to be as gre at as shown by other metrics , which focus on research and investments , although it is too early to make strong conclusions due to the severe lack of data on this topic . Federal or national administrations seem to be implement ed far more policies and initia tives to make their organizations ready for AI , although more time is needed to assess if and how they will be successful in stimulating AI uptake . Conversely , both local governments and SMEs seem to be plagued by similar implementation barriers , which lim it the diffusion of AI where it may gain a significant impact . As noted for the micro and small enterprises from the private sector , it looks like the limited size and quality of IT endowments and skills prevent public administration in all three regions from making significant steps towards digitalization in general and AI enabled service transformation in particular . This lack of expertise and hands -on experience in using AI in government is also likely to limit the public sector ’ s ability to govern the d evelopment of AI in society with coherent public polic ies . In this perspective , there can be opportunities for the three regions to learn from their respective experiences with the promotion of AI and decide if and how to replicate each other ’ s success sto ries – while understanding that policy and cultural differences may limit the extent to which AI can be developed and/or adopted in the other regions . However , this should not be meant as an invitation to start measuring which region uses more AI and which less , as this metric by itself would say very little about the impact and the public value gained from the use or reuse of this technology . The deployment of AI per se should not be a target , but always take into consideration the needs of the citizens an d the opportunities for better public service . The mere headcount of AI solutions successfully trialled out but never become permanently used or still experiencing problems in terms of scalability or interoperability should not be considered as a relevant success indicator . In other words , t he risk should be avoided that too much policy and research attention is put on the supply side of AI -enabled innovation in public administration , without considering the demand side , a common tendency in eGovernment com parisons ( Savoldelli , Codagnone , & Misuraca , 2012 ) . 24 In the forthcoming LORDI ( Local and Regional Digital Indicator Framework ) will provide further improved framework to measure take -up of digital technologies at sub -government level , see https : //living -in.eu/ 29 Howev er , the key lesson learned from this comparison is that despite the rhetoric that Europe is falling behind the US and China in the “ AI -race ” , there is room for an EU initiative aimed at reinforcing appropriation of AI technologies in the practice of govern ment , which aligns with the “ systemic way ” of policy -oriented learning introduced in the previous Sections of this report and may substantially reverse the outcomes of benchmarking trends and developments in th e public sector domain . To grasp these opportu nities in full , the thesis of this report is that the sustainable implementation of AI in public services is a key element for the uptake of A I in public services . In order to reach this sustainable use of AI , specific attention should be devoted to the ap propriation process , defined in the report as the sum of adoption and implementation . This approach aims at preventing the appearance of unwanted and unforeseen effects . This thesis was probably implicit already in the suggestion made by Misuraca and Noord ( 2020 ) to take distance from the slippery narrative ( or simply the trap ) of AI exceptionalism , reconsidering it as a phenomenon that is not “ immune to existing governan ce structures , policies and laws ” , and requires more than a mere extension of existing national rules and multilateral agreements to be successfully managed . Along the same line of thought , we propose to re -elaborate the concept in a more positive ( and enc ompassing ) fashion , by reaffirming the primacy of a European exceptionalism – a controversial notion in the eyes of the constitutionalists ( Bradford & Posner , 2011 ; Nolte & Aust , 2013 ) , less so of the economists ( Rifkin , 2004 ) . In the domain at hand , this primacy should be broken down in ( at least ) three concurrent and qualifying directions , all of them pointing at a more advanced equilibrium between AI promotion and regulation in the EU public sector : — Focusing on the fundamental ly distinctive traits of the functioning of government organi zations and acknowledging their peculiarities : transparency and accountability to the constituencies , efficiency and effectiveness in functioning , fairness and discretion in decision making , and focusing on creating public value – even when participatory o r shared . This can also mark a difference , as th is Section 3 has show n , between the European governance model and its global competitors such as the US and China ; — Aiming to devise and tackle the “ challenges ” of AI development an d deployment in the public sector , as a collection of preconditions , in terms of methods and tools for nation - and EU -wide implementation , but also elements of a first embryo of a “ governance of AI , with AI ” shared agenda . Section 4 will analyse a considerable number of those challenges in some detail ; — Enhancing the goal of policy convergence among EU Member States on how to govern the contrasting forces behind the emergence and pervasiveness of the AI phenomenon , driving them to a synthesis in which the whole is more than the sum of its parts . In this endeavour , the most distinctive elements of the “ European intergovernmentalism ” ( Moravcsik , 1993 ) might prove useful : a union of equals , united in diversity , a preference for non -binding policy rules and the allowance for different speeds of compliance , as epitomised by the Open Method of Coordination25 . In Section 5 we will propose a set of policy actions that belong to this logic . Among them , as we will argu e , public procurement of innovative AI solutions would play a decisive role , going even further beyond the known advantages – widely explored by both literature and practice – in terms of “ smart purchasing ” in and by government bodies and agencies . 25 The open method of coordination may be described as a form of ‘ soft ’ law . It is a form of intergovernmental policy -making that does not result in binding EU legislative measures and it does not require Member States to introduce or amend their laws . https : //eur lex.europa.eu/summary/glossary/open_method_coordination.html # : ~ : text =The % 20open % 20method % 20of % 20coordination , introduce % 20 or % 20amend % 20their % 20laws . 30 4 Challenges to AI implementation in the EU public sector This Section overview s a number of systemic challenges which can be relevant for the attention of policy makers at EU , national , regional and local levels , willing to engage in and contribute to the propos ed direction of AI governance , integrating promotion and regulation more effectively . Paragraph 4.1 points at the generation of adequate funding for the public sector organisations engaged in AI adoption . This funding should be nominally supplie d by the upcoming Digital Europe Programme , but can also be hampered in practice by two main risks : dispersion of financial resources across multiple and heterogeneous projects ( possibly duplicating similar efforts in different countries ) and inadequate rooting , or embedment , of the newly developed solutions in the practice of public administration , possibly from different “ tiers ” and locations , including across national borders . Then paragraph 4.2 identifies a second policy challenge i n making quality datasets and infrastructures diffusely available , interoperable , and continuously updated and maintained , for the needs of the novel AI algorithms and more generally for the progress and sharing of benefits of gover nment digitalisation in all EU countries . In turn , paragraph 4.3 also taking stock of a discussion done in the previous Section 3 in comparison with US and China , outlines the third challenge of attracting young tech talents in public administration and widely improving the literacy and skills of existing staff , particularly in the most “ peripheral ” public bodies and agencies ( from Southern and Eastern Europe as well as the smallest sized EU Countries ) . Then paragraph 4.4 associates a fourth group of challenges to an evolving concept of legitimacy for those governments making more decisive steps towards AI implementation . Finally , paragraph 4.5 focus on e nabling user -centric services with and by AI and , to do so , describes how the goal of public s ervice transformation , particularly at the local level , can and should be aligned with the eight fundamental principles of the Tallinn Declaration on eGove rnment , to achiev e sustained organisational change in the public body or agency involved in AI implementation . 4.1 Looking for a critical mass of AI investment The Europe 2020 strategy adopted in 201026 set the long -standing objective to devote 3 % of EU Gross D omestic Product ( GDP ) to Research and Development – the so -called R & D intensity . According to the latest evidence from Eurostat27 , Member States have increased their spend ing on R & D during the 2008 -2018 decade by about 0.,3 GDP points , however without reach ing the target . In fact , R & D intensity in the EU -27 stood at 2,18 % in 2018 , while it was 1,87 % in 2008 . Compared to other major economies , it is about the same ratio as in China ( 2,14 % ) but lower than the OECD average28 ( 2,38 % ) , the United States ( 2,82 % ) , J apan ( 3,28 % ) and South Korea ( 4,53 % ) . In nominal terms , the EU spend ing on R & D in 2018 – that is , what statisticians call Gross Domestic Expenditure on R & D ( GERD ) – was close to €294,5 billion , or about €660 per inhabitant . Only 1/9 of that amount – roughly 0,24 % of EU-27 GDP – can be attributed to the government sector , a ratio that remained constant all along the decade , as the graph below shows . During the same period , the R & D intensity of the higher education sector increased by 10 % ( corresponding to about 0,05 % of GDP ) but only during the first two years , then stagnated at a twice as high level as in government ( 0,48 % of GDP ) . Taken together , universities and public administration have not increased their annual R & D spend above €220 per inhabitant ( at 2018 prices ) over the past 10 years . However , it is noteworthy that such level in proportion to GDP is comparatively higher in the EU than in the US , Japan and China , and only lower than in South Korea . In fact , the 2018 public R & D intensity ( summing up government and university spend ing ) was 0,72 % of EU -27 GDP , but only 0,66 % in the US , 0,63 % in Japan , 0,49 % in China , while it was 0,83 % in South Korea29 . Meanwhile , R & D expenditure of the private , non -profit sector has remained negligible ( only 0,01 % of GDP across the decade ) . Therefore , almost the entire growth in the R & D intensity between 2008 and 2018 has stemmed from additional investments of th e EU-27 business enterprise sector , as Figure 4 clearly exhibits . 26 http : //ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/european -semester/framework/europe -2020-strategy_en 27 Eurostat , Statistics Explained .

Gross Domestic Expenditure on R & D by sector of performance , EU -27 , 2008 -2018 ( % relative to GDP ) . However , according to the 2015 e dition of the OECD Frascati Manual30 , the contribution of the public sector to national R & D can also be measured through Government Budget Allocations to R & D ( GBARD ) 31in a given year . This alternative approach is still in its infancy but promises to be more informative than recording the intramural spend ing of government units , because it rules out what is reimbursed by a third party , such as a public grant , or repaid through a loan , which allows setting a specific focus on government ’ s autonomous investment capacity ( notably financed by taxation ) . On the other hand , there is a likely overestimate of yearly spend ing because both the capital and current costs are included therein , with multi -annual projects being attributed to the year ( s ) in which they are bud geted ( Eurostat , 2020 ) . This overestimate is partly or fully offset by the f act that local government funds and the budgets of public corporations are currently not included in the calculation . Another aspect of interest of such an alternative approach is that data on public funding of ICT R & D is also made available as part of the global budget figure . This includes the support to all ICT -related R & D spend ing in every sector of the economy , including the NACE rev.2 industry entitled “ 84 Public Administration and Defence . Compulsory Social Security ” – the closest proxy available to what we name d the business of government . Roughly speaking , this is what the national government allocates for ICT research and development for its own purposes . To get an impression of the size of this budget allocation , the following table compares EU -27 with the US across the same decade 2008 -2018 as above . Figures are calculated in millions of current Euros PPS32 and also shown in proportion to total GBARD for the same year . Comparable data for China , Japan and Korea are not available ( Mas et al. , 2020 ) . 30 http : //www.oecd.org/i nnovation/inno/frascati -manual.htm 31 National public funding to transnationally coordinated R & D is defined as the total budget funded by the government ( central , regional , local ) , as measured by GBARD directed to transnational public R & D performers and t ransnational public R & D programmes 32 PPS stands for Purchasing Power Standards . It is a sort of artificial currency used to make the US and EU GDP comparable in v olume only , i.e . not considering the effect of price differences between countries . Euros are current for the year , i.e . the price differences due to the phenomenon of national inflation are still operating between years . 32 Table 2 . EU-27 vs . US Public Budget Allocations to ICT R & D in Government ( millions of current EUR PPS ) 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 EU-27 180,30 156,89 140,11 105,59 85,97 86,96 90,33 86,79 74,95 98,16 95,44 % 3,6 % 3,0 % 2,6 % 1,9 % 1,6 % 1,6 % 1,6 % 1,5 % 1,3 % 1,6 % 1,5 % US 1130,8 7 1253,9 4 1318,7 6 1223,2 1 1142,0 2 1014,1 1 1007,6 6 997,87 995,61 1011,1 2 1024,6 3 % 15,1 % 15,9 % 18,5 % 18,7 % 16,4 % 16,2 % 15,7 % 14,6 % 13,9 % 14,7 % 14,0 % Source : PREDICT 2020 dataset ( https : //ec.europa.eu/jrc/sites/jrcsh/files/government_budget_allocations_for_ict_rd_predict2020.zip ) . In every single year after 2010 , the a mounts budgeted for in -house ICT R & D investments by EU -27 ( national and regional ) governments have been less than one tenth of the corresponding ones in the US33 . Summing up by row , the cumulative contribution of the EU -27 public sector to its own ICT R & D h as been €1,2 billion in 11 years , or about a quarter of Euro per inhabitant , per year compared with more than €12 billion in the US , almost 3,5 Euros per inhabitant34 , so very low in comparison . Indeed , little can be said about the comparative quality of pu blic spend ing or the return on the respective investments , but these figures reflect the reality we should be starting from in our discourse on the EU public sector ’ s capacity to transform itself by the ap propria tion of innovative digital technologies , not ably including AI amongst them . Moreover , t o ignite a true embedment process of novel ICT – hence also AI solutions - in the public administration in Europe , making their initial adoption diffused and permanent , beyond the mere and localised experimentatio n of promising ( but sometimes also “ fancy ” ) innovations , a dedicated injection of financial resources is indispensable35 . Just as an example , the proposed budget for the entire Digital Europe programme is in the range of €7,5 billion in 7 years , thus of com parable size to the gap outlined in Table 2 above . In particular , the estimated allocation for AI is about €2,2 billion in 2021 -2027 . G iven the starting levels of R & D spend outlined above , the expected impacts of those extra resources – in terms of lever , if not also return on investment – can be quite significant even in the short to medium term , especially when combined with additional investment . In this framework , the key question for the authors of this report is not whether adequate finance will supp ort the experimental deployment of AI solutions in the European public sector for the years ahead . Evidently , this can be assumed as a matter of fact , including of an order of magnitude – right now , unpredictable in its future size – sufficient to generate transformative impacts . Instead , our matter of concern are the infrastructural conditions and the systemic mechanisms to be exploited by policy makers willing to make sure that successful AI innovations introduced by early adopters from specific EU countr ies ( and regions , and cities ) become permanently embedded in the business of government and really pervasive at all administration levels – according to the legal competences of public bodies and agencies and having in mind the political discretions of man agers and elected officials – within and particularly across the EU national country borders . We consider this question both timely and justified by evidence . Quite surprisingly , research in this area is moving its first steps , almost as if the evaluation of those enabling or preventing factors did not deserve a systematic ( and most probably systemic ) approach . The remainder of this Section constitutes a contribution in that direction . 4.2 Data quality , availability and interoperability One of the most fundamen tal requirements of AI is data . By definition , AI relies on access being ensured to the “ right ” kind of data on which to perform its analyses , and which in most cases is augmented by the results of the analyses themselves . For many Public Sector organizati ons though , fulfilling this re quirement i s a challenge , due to a variety of obstacles in obtaining data of the quality and format they require . 33 As it is known , EU -27 and the US ( and China ) are all about the same size in terms of GDP expressed in Purchasing Power Standar ds ( PPS ) . In 2017 they were representing 16 % , 16,3 % and 16,4 % of the world GDP , respectively . See Eurostat news release 84/2020 , The 2017 results of the International Comparison Program . China , US and EU are the largest economies in the world . Latest data May 2020. https : //ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/portlet_file_entry/2995521/2 -19052020 -BP-EN.pdf/bb14f7f9 -fc26-8aa1-60d4 -7c2b509dda8e 34 These figures change little if we move to constant prices , using a deflator for the expenses reported in Table 2 for both EU -27 and US . 35 These were also the conclusions of the 2nd peer review workshop of the AI Watch for the Public Sector initiative , held on 29th September 2020 , with MS representatives . See van Noordt and Pignatelli ( 2020 ) . 33 A key obstacle lies in existing data infrastructure and organisational capabilities within the public sector . As the strength of AI come s from the data it is “ trained ” on , the need for a resilient , high -quality and accessible data infrastructure is crucial ( Harrison et al. , 2019 ) . However , not all government bodies or agencies have adequately digitalized their internal operations and services in the past decades , which leads to a significant gap between the ambition of using novel AI technologies and the organizational readiness to do this ( European Commission , 2020b ) . Thus , while AI innovation may bring great benefits to public sector m odernisation , the less prepared public organization and agencies may have the remarkable difficulties in achieving implementation . Another related obstacle lies in the fact that sometimes no data on service delivery can be combined with available external data . Indeed , some of the successful experiments of AI in the public sector – such as the City of Helsinki ’ s analysis of citizen feedback at its offices36 - succeed in combin ing external with internal performance data in order to grasp new insights into how routine operations influence certain contextu al factors . Naturally , if no or just too scanty internal evidence is available because of the digital immaturity of a public sector organization , most of those insights will be lost , as only external data will be available for analysis . Thus , public sector organizations that are genuinely interested in implement ing AI in their operations must find ways to manage at the best their priorities , not leaving behind required improvement to the current level of digiti zation , aiming to ensur e that all evidence about service is digital by default . This should not be seen as a barrier to entry , though , but more as an opportunity to fasten digital transformation of government finding AI adop tion as an additional stimulus . Of course , while AI ’ s potential can accelerate the digital transformation efforts of public administration and ensure they include data governance as targets , it is likely that additional efforts are still required to ensure that the maximum for AI is gain ed from ongoing and past digitalization . In fact , the digitalization of public processes requires good data governance , allowing the generation of reliable and useful sources for later analys es . Buildi ng a strong data governance system in public sector organization s has been highlight ed as one of the most impactful element s on the development of trustworthy AI and consolidati on of take-up by the end -users ( Janssen , Brous , Estevez , Barbosa , & Janowski , 2020 ) . Fortunate ly , several EU governments have already transformed many of their services and digitized most of the previously analogue information reservoirs . For a further advancement of AI in the Public Sector , it is now to be considered crucial to improve the quality and accessibility of their datasets . As also highlighted in a previous study , Member State AI strategies normally dedicate attention to improving both the data quality as well as its accessibility ( van Noordt , Medaglia , & Misuraca , 2020 ) . Despite these efforts , there are still many barriers to opening , sharing , and reusing data belonging to different public sector organizations . This should probably be one of the next step s in the data curation process . Scholars have highlight ed the barriers to making government data openly available to the general public – ranging from poor interest or data litera cy of civil servants , limited endorsement from middle or to p managers , legal barriers , institutional constraint s related to regulation or policy , or supply bottlenecks such as lack of financial resources or of a technical infrastructure suitable to publish data on ( Janssen , Charalabidis , & Zuiderwijk , 2012 ) . Most of these barriers are also common to data sharing with other organisations . But there is more : data available in an open format may often be of poor quality or too heterogeneous , which makes it difficult to extract the information embedded in it ( Hellberg & Hedström , 2015 ) . Alternatively , shared data i s often ‘ pre -processed ’ , removing much of the information and limiting re -use by other actors ( Lämmerhirt , Rubinstein , & Montiel , 2017 ) . Finally , evidence from the Global Op en Data Index comparing the publications of government data worldwide shows that it is often difficult to find the “ right ” data online , due to the high number and variety of websites , platforms and protocols . As a consequence , while there is an ongoing tre nd to feed AI with big data by external sources , limited evidence is available on how open or 36 See among others AI experiments ( in Finnish ) , https : //digi.hel.fi/projektit/helsinki -tekoaly -kokeilut/ 34 shared data in public administration assist AI development and deployment ( Janssen , Konopnicki , Snowdon , & Ojo , 2017 ) . In that direction , the forthcoming D ata Spaces Initiative37 will enable new data sharing scenarios . The need for interoperable data sources also applies to the deployment of the Internet of Things ( IoT ) , which generates data that is often used in urban projects together with AI . Some large European cities have been frontrunners in deploying sensors and IoT devices to support public service delivery and gaining real -time insight s into a variety of urban processes . However , the deployment of sensors is still far from mainstream ( ElHaddadeh , Weerakkody , Osmani , Thakker , & Kapoor , 2019 ) . Thus , future developments in IoT should consider the analytical possibilities offered by a synergy with AI technologies . One of the best ways to ensure compatibility between IoT sensor data and other sources is through achieving full interoperability of government systems ( Kankanhalli , Charalabidis , & Mel louli , 2019 ) . Thus , grasp ing the opportunities of AI and IoT together may be an accelerator for public administration as a whole to finalise its digital transformation . A recent phenomenon , noted by some researchers ( Klievink , Van Der Voort , & Veeneman , 2018 ) , is the creation of ad-hoc , informal and small sized partnerships where government actors work together with other public or private acto rs to exchange data related to solv ing a public challenge38 . Such collaborations are regarded as promising examples of a new governance instrument , apt to generate value out of various datasets and to obtain new capabilities or create new public services . In that direction , it is worth mentioning the effort made by OASC ( Open & Agile Smart City ) through the definition of MIMs ( Minimal Interoperability Mechanisms ) . MIMs ’ objective is to provide the technical foundation for procurement and deployment of urban data platforms and end-to-end solutions in cities and communities worldwide39 Despite the potential , however , research has highlighted that extending such inter-organizational collaborations to AI development and adoption is not straightforward due to the need for interoperability between different data sets to ensure data integration , but also to organizational , legal , and political factors restricting the scope of such partnerships . In a recent study , fears with regards to privacy and cybersecurity in data sharing are shown to lead to the risk that AI projects get halted . It is therefore crucial for public organizations to introduce ways to share data in a secure and trustworthy manner ( Campion , Gasco Hernandez , Jankin Mikhaylov , & Esteve , 2020 ) . Arguably , to ignite a diffused interest in collaborative data sharing among public and private actors , new and well-functioning data ecosystems need to be developed . As the value in many of the se collaborations lies in the exchange and combination of several datasets ( e.g . required to train AI models ) , which were previously not made available by public administration , there is a lot of potential in ensuring that digital technology take up also o ccurs in local businesses and citizens40 . The more digitalization occurs in the nearby ecosystem , the more data is likely to be available for potential AI projects involving the public sector . Naturally , these data ecosystems need to be developed in such a way as to protect citizens ’ rights and meet the public good ( Calzada & Almirall , 2020 ) . While some pilots of AI can take place in digital ly immature environments , data governance foundations should be established in all layers of government before AI is really scaled up across services and across borders . Particularly , public bodies and agencies should treat open data programmes according to an ecosystemic approach : combining both policy initia tives for building reliable data infrastructures as well as the engagement of relevant stakeholders ( Dawes , Vidiasova , & Parkhimovich , 2016 ) . Ensuring that different actors establish connections , relations and understand each other ’ s needs is key to create a trustworthy and thriving local da ta ecosystem prone to improve with time . Initiatives such as the EU Digital Innovation Hubs can reinforce and strengthen these ecosystems , and most importantly , allow public sector organizations to harness the innovative spirits of businesses and citizens 37 https : //digital -strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/strategy -data 38 See the JRC DigiTranscope on B2G data sharing models , the B2G data sharing workshops and the forth coming Data Act , 39 https : //mims.oascities.org/ 40 See forthcoming Data S pace for Smart C ommunities , https : //digital -strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/expert -workshop -common -european smart -communities -data-space 35 to come up with promising solutions to pressing local issues41 . Digital Innovation Hubs has played a key role in stimulating and implementing regional and local innovation strategies . Inde ed , they can also be excellent training organizations for advancing the internal use of AI in the public sector ( European Commission , 2021c ) . This requires their further establishment and diffusion across the EU and those already in place should be expanded with additional resources to stimulate public sector innovation using AI as well . 4.3 Talent attraction and skill improvement The aim to develop and use AI in government organizations may , however , encounter issues if not accompanie d by a similar interest in boosting the AI skills , litera cy and awareness of civil servants . Many public bodies and agencies have great difficulty in obtaining tech talents and governing and evaluating their internal ICT systems ( Mergel , 2019 ) , though knowing that an adequate s killset is crucial for any digital transformation process ( Mergel , Edelmann , & Haug , 2019 ) . For digital transformation projects involving AI , the lack of expertise is even more crucial . It is often mentioned that capacities are missing within public sector organizations both for developing AI and for work ing with it , understand ing its strengths and limitations . As a result , m ost AI professionals tend to flock to the private sector where the benefits , also in terms of recognition , are sig nificantly higher ( Wirtz , Weyerer , & Sturm , 2020 ) . Therefore , invest ments in training and capacity building , but also talent attraction are required to ensure that every public sector organisation can have access to the right capabilities to develop and use AI , as well as young AI professionals seeing government as a concr ete possibilit y of career advance ment . However , a vision is also needed about which and how AI should be used so that the training can be developed accordingly . As also highlighted in a recent AI Watch workshop ( van Noordt & Pignatelli , 2020 ) actions are ongoing on the national administrative layer to raise awareness , train civil servants and establish knowledge hubs – such as data labs – where AI resources are shared across different departments o f the administration . Howe ver , lower tiers of government may require ad hoc initiatives to ensure they too have access to relevant AI resources . Without such interventions , the public sector may become increasingly dependent on external AI consultants , with evident risks of vendor lock-in and transparency threats due to the limited understanding o f how AI affect s the internal operations of government and perhaps to the additional inflexibility to change if something goes wrong ( Andersen , Lee , & Henriksen , 2020 ) . It is also likely that , without adequate digital capabilities and skills within the public sector , some bodies or agencies may face significant difficulties in adopting the AI solutions successfully de ployed elsewhere or just replicating some case studies with the needed adaptations . To build an effective governance framework , skills and competencies should extend as much to governance “ with AI ” as to governance “ of AI ” ( Kuziemski & Misuraca , 2020 ) . Such lack of governance capacities does not only prevent or limit AI innovation in individual government bodies and agencies , but also at regional level , with the recurrent paradox that the lack of capacity i s predominant i n the regions that would need them most because they fail to catch up ( Muscio , Reid , & Rivera Leon , 2015 ) . In fact , the Covid19 crisis revealed that the geographical spread of online availability of public services , internet access and digital literacy in Europe is not as broad as imagined . Despite the improvements , even recently made , strong differences stil l exist between rich , poor , urban and rural areas ( European Committee of the Regions , 2020 ) . While public administration has been to some extent forced to digitalise some processes and work practices due to Covid19 , it remains unclear whether these trends will lead to a mor e profound reform and therefore require the attraction of further expertise and expertise on organisational and process reengineering . Indeed , w orking remotely and having gained an expanded network capacity can not be considered a full digital transformatio n while many non -value -adding processes still remain the same without redesigning organisational activities and roles proactively ( Gabryelczyk , 2020 ) . 41 For more information regarding the Digital In novation Hubs part of the Digital Europe Programme , see also : https : //ec.europa.eu/digital single -market/en/digital -innovation -hubs 36 4.4 Input , throughput , and output legitimacy of AI use There has been much research on identifying various ethical concerns related to deploying AI as there are indeed a number of issues potentially arising from the way AI operates ( Dignum , 2018 ) . For government deployment of AI , this brings specific risks , among which the following particularly stand out ( Dwivedi et al. , 2019 ; Mittelstadt , Allo , Taddeo , Wachter , & Floridi , 2016 ) : — Producing u nfair outcomes , as AI al gorithms can amplify some discriminatory biases already present in societies . This can result in AI bas ing decisions or recommendations on human factors , which is against the rule of law to consider , such as gender , race , o r sexuality . Even when certain sensitive data is omitted from the learning process , AI can still amplify hidden biases in the data through proxies such as postal codes for marginal or troublesome urban neighbourhoods . The actions taken by AI systems are on ly as good as the data they are based on . . This require s a full awareness of the quality and possible limitations of the data used to feed the AI system . Particularly when dealing with marginalized groups , public bodies and agencies using AI should always avoid having these systems worsen existing inequalities in societ y rather than helping resolv e them . — Increasing the opacity of decisions , due to the “ black box ” nature of some AI algorithm s. Despite some recent advancements in explainable or interpretabl e AI , most AI systems in certain cases remain inaccessible , overly complex , self organising , not sufficiently transparent , which makes it incomprehensible why AI suggested or took certain decisions . This also limits the ability of public administration to justify the decisions taken by the AI systems , monitor and correct them . This lack of transparency and accountability of AI-informed or enabled decisions bring s not only ethical but also legal and political consequence s , as citizens may have difficulties in accepting and enforc ing the decisions taken by their governments . In that sense , the Amsterdam42 and Helsinki43 AI Registr ies for transparency purpose s are good example s in the direction to explicit communicate and explain where AI is deployed and how auto matic decision s are taken , describing clearly potential opacity when is the case . — Threat ening the privacy of citizens unduly is also a risk , as most AI systems require significant amounts of ( personal ) data to perform accurately . This introduces two types of issues , the hiddenness of the real extent ( and possible severity ) of data collection practices and the unwanted knowledge gained from data analysis . As the example , also highlighted as a risk in the GDPR , of merging public with restricted or even anony mised data shows , the k nowledge produced through analysi ng various linked sources is at risk of reveal ing highly private or sensitive information which citizens arguably would not want to have disclosed ( Janssen & van den Hoven , 2015 ) . In addition , the continuous deployment of various AI systems t hat monitor and track people could establish some form of Big Brother government , reducing trust in public administration and the legitimacy of democratic power . — Promoting an “ algocra cy ” scenario , that is a subtle and extreme form of technocracy , whereby machine algorithms , rather than AI empowered people , collect informatio n , take actions and administer the rules of a State . In that sense , further investigations are ongoing in order to explore in which cases there is a real need for such complex and self -organizing algorithms . Paradoxically , this potential algorithm -based governance system , instead of amplify ing and enabling human involvement in public processes , tends to restrict it , inducing further limitation s of citizen opportunities to participate in decision making ( Danaher , 2016 ) . These risks may pose huge challenges to the legitimacy of public sector organizations . On the one hand , AI technologies are seen as improving the outcomes of policymaking and governmental operations by making t hem more effective and efficient . On the other hand , AI itself could severely undermine the legitimacy of governments in three di stinct areas , namely Input gathering , Throughput generation , and Output delivery ( Starke & Lünich , 2020 ) . 42 Amsterdam AI Registry : https : //a lgoritmeregister.amsterdam.nl/en/ai -register/ 43 Helsinki AI Registry : https : //ai.hel.fi/en/ai -register/ 37 Figure 5 . Key challenges to government legitimacy by AI adoption . Source : JRC , own elaboration . Firstly , the input legitimacy of government is challeng ed because the design of the AI systems require s developers to make political decisions that may be difficult to detect or correct at a later stage ( Mulligan & Bamberger , 2019 ) . There is often limited political or citizen oversight in the design and deployment of “ where , when , and how ” AI systems get used in government services . As also shown by the “ DigiGov ” study , citizens are watchful when their personal data is used – sometimes without thei r awareness or explicit approval – by private sector organizations asked to work with public administration in the development of AI systems ( Barcevičius et al. , 2019 ) . Similarly , most marginalized groups risk being insufficiently involved or represented in digital transformation processes , leading to bias es and false ( e.g . using sentiment analysis in social media as a proxy for public support soft political decision making across society as a whole ( Giest & Samuels , 2020 ) . Not considering the political context and t he wishes of some categories of citizens while using AI may thus severely reduce the input legitimacy of governments . Secondly , the throughput legitimacy of government may be reduced when decisions become increasingly more difficult to scrutinize or explai n ( Burrell , 2016 ) . The level of opacity with which some AI systems make certain decisions and the uncertainty on how the ir decisions are made could greatly diminish citizen trust in public administration . Civil servants themselves , when complex tasks get au tomated , may have the impression that the fairness of the procedure gets threatened44 . Fully replacing people in tasks that used to rely on human skills may thus lead to a lack of perceived fairness . Only for tasks that are regarded as simple and less compl ex , AI may be preferable , although the outcomes of implementation should be examined on a case by case basis and require careful deliberation ( Nagtegaal , 2020 ) . In addition , it may always be possible that during the development or the deployment of AI , some laws get broken due to the data collection practices , unwarranted data sharing or the infringement of citizen s ’ privacy rights ( Meijer & Thaens , 2020 ) . Altho ugh indispensable , legal safeguards m ight be regarded as unwanted obstacles during the development of AI systems , which would thus lead to unlawful use of AI . Consistently with this , the risk must be reduced as much as possible . Moreover , the level of risk is different with respect to the area of application for example areas like environmental monitoring and climate adaptation are expected to have fewer privacy related issues . Thirdly , the output legitimacy of government may be harmed when the AI systems a re not functioning as good as expected . As mentioned before , the recommendations and decisions taken by AI may be heavily biased or flawed due to poor development or unproven performance in complex social settings . Often , AI 44 Good practice may be the Amsterdam Fair AI contract clauses , wh ere clauses are automated by the development of the so -called Fair AI MIM ( Living -in.eu ) . 38 systems hardly work as well in real life conditions 45as they do in controlled environments and make more errors tha n expected ( Bailey & Barley , 2019 ; Coiera , 2019 ) . Alternatively , the performance of using deep learn ing or other opaque machine learning methods in the development of AI systems may only have a slightly better predictive accuracy compared to less complex and more transparent techniques such as regression analysis using only a handful of variables ( Dressel & Farid , 2 018 ; Salganik et al. , 2020 ) . Furthermore , the development and governance of AI systems may require significant organisational resources which may be overlooked at first , thus ultimately limiting the cost reductions AI was supposed to bring to the organisa tion . Having many , expensive and opaque algorithmic systems the performance of which is unclear may in fact reduce the effectiveness of government dramatically ( Andersen et al. , 2020 ) . 4.5 Enabl ing user-centric services with and by AI AI is often used for increasing the quality of public service deliver y and a large number of application s are under development in this area . Indeed , the main objectives of introducing the AI in governments ’ services relate to : a ) improve internal processes ; b ) enhance and enabling faster policy -making mechanisms , and c ) improve the participation and experience of citizens and business users when using public services ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) . This is a set of operational targets , which support the political commitment that the EC established at the EU level on significant priorities towards ensuring high quality , user -centric digital public services for citizens and seamless cross -border public services for businesses . This vision is reflected in the eight fundamental user centricity principles as defined by the Tallinn Declaration on Digital Government46 . User-centricity counts on new digital technologies , and therefore also on AI , for strengthen ing trust in governments . In particular , they focus on increasing transparency , responsiveness , reliability , and integrity of public governance . A direct consequence of that is the need to embed the discussion on AI with the discussion on user -centric services : governments have to pl ace citizens at the centre of public services and governance and AI can and should support this challenge . For doing so , a stream of research on AI in the public sector should look at how to connect user centricity and service design principles with AI . T his section is giving evidence to this stream and set s the ground for further research in the field . As a brief background , user centricity challenge relates directly to tackling the issue of low satisfaction with public services and distrust in governmen t and public administration . This may be because of delays in fully embrac ing digitalisation of public services , or surviving biases and discriminations in making them accessible , or lack of transparency , reliability or accountability during and after deli very . Moreover , with ICT skills becoming more widespread across generations , the global expectations in terms of technolog ical performance and capacities may also increase , which is not always joined , however , by concurrent improvements in usability featur es , particularly to the benefit of the less expert groups . The reasons could be found also in the customisation phases that bring from the user -centric principles to the user -centric operative services . User engagement procedures must be contextualised in the territory on which the service will act and on the target users . The first attempts of using new digital technologies for enhancing user-centric services may be found at the local level , thanks to the efforts made within the smart cities . The smart cities phenomenon is increasingly seen as far more than simply endowing an urban area with some technological infrastructure , rather as the creation 45 There is a forthcoming AI Testing and Experimentation Facilities to further sustain the development and deployment of AI . https : //digital strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/activities/testing -and-experimentation -facilities 46 The 2017 “ Tallinn Declaration on Dig ital Government ” provides eight clear principles Member States should commit to , with the purpose of redesigning public services around the user needs . These principles have been translated into a sort of additional “ rights ” for citizens , who should expect to : digitally interact with their administration ; find accessible , secure and available services ; experience a reduction of the administrative burden ; receive services that are fully delivered online ; being empowered and engaged in proposing new ser vice i deas and suggestions for improvement ; being removed of any barriers and incentivised to the use of digital services ; protected in their personal privacy sphere and allowed control of their data ; enabled to activate redress and complaint mechanisms . 39 of a place where citizens live in a smarter way and allocate their time and resources more efficiently and productively . This kind of lifestyle change alter s citizens ’ perspective of the world and promote shifts in their behaviours and expectations , in particular , towards urban services . Moreover , with the level and intensity of demand becoming higher , service au tomation proves vital to alleviate pressure on government ’ s delivery capacity and continue enhancing the quality of urban experience . Many European cities have already realised the importance of user centricity . Howe ver , a systematic collection of success stories is still missing47 . Cities have the ambition to support service ( re ) design with clear insights on the specific profiles of prospective beneficiaries and their aspirations in terms of quality and performance , u p to the point of letting citizens and businesses participate in the development and validation of the new digital public services that are expressly tailored on their needs . Actors in these stories are , therefore : the general public , city networks ( partic ularly for interoperability and scaling ) , regional and local government bodies and policymakers , innovation and technology hubs , living labs , science parks , university incubators , civil and social rights activists , not for profit associations etc . Yet , it is still often difficult to reach various groups of citizens and businesses through digital public services only . And the relationship between empowerment and outreach is unavoidably two -way : while the removal of pre-emptive barriers and constraints to the use of electronic services does influence diffusion , their persistence as user centricity issues may negatively affect the digital transformation and therefore the trustworthiness and accountability of governments ( European Commission , 2019c ) . As a general remark , following the trend already ongoing on user centricity , it is important that implementation of user centricity principles in AI appropriation start s at the local level . As for general service redesign , cities should let the users participate in the appropriation of AI and , more generally , have always a careful eye on the eight fundamental user centricity principles when approaching the introduction of AI . We can assume that AI solutions only designed and implemented following the user centricity pr inciples can at full potential , for example , help reduce the administrative burden , support in resolving resource allocation problems , take up complex tasks , and deal with the heterogeneity and complexity of data sources . However , its inner nature and influential role in transform ing government action and interacti on with its stakeholders can also enabl e the enhancement of user centricity in the next generation of public services , ( especially ) at the local level . Accordingly , authors such as ( Barbero et al. , 2016 ; Ferro , Loukis , Charalabidis , & Osella , 2013 ; Fredriksson , Mubarak , Tuohimaa , & Zhan , 2017 ) highlight that big data analytics , algorithms , and machi ne learning , provide a number of advantages to governments throughout the entire policy cycle . User centricity challenges and opportunities can be detected also by looking at the phases of the policy cycle . Firstly , in the phase of agenda -setting , the implementation of AI may significantly increase the effectiveness of citizen participation through refined ways of annotating and grasping their feedback through sentiment analysis , crowdsourcing and physical or virtual ( even including augmented reality or virtual r eality ) co-creation sessions . Secondly , human -machine interaction has the potential to enhance efficiency , effectiveness and accuracy of policy making , also in the direction of better user centricity of the resulting services . For instance , predic tive analytics may indicate the priority of focus ing more on prevention , instead of just reacting , to crises and other societal problems . Or a more faithful handling and representation of service usage data may assist in developing more targeted , personali sed interventions and even ‘ nudges ’ to beneficiaries . These approache s have been applied in healthcare , environmental and traffic management48 , education and other social services of general interest . Thirdly , progress in user centricity requires a “ sustai ned organisational change ” in the involved public body or agency . This change has been defined as “ altering existing organisational practices , changing organisational processes and/or tasks of government staff ” ( Misuraca , 2012 ) . Such requirement is in line with the most accredited vision of user centricity as a mindset , rather than an organisational status to be reached ; an 47 Ongoi ng efforts funded by the EU include the Co -Val dashboard ( https : //www.co -val.eu/dashboard/municipalities ) and the Designscapes geo database of urban innovation initiatives ( http : //designscapes.eu/funded -initiatives/ ) 48 see DUET ( digital twins ) H2020 project or LEAD ( H2020 project ) on digital twins in urban mobility . 40 approach to be followed , for instance in service ( re ) design and delivery , rather than the specific methods and tools enabling it ; and a collection of moving target s , depending on the interim progress made so far and also on the evolving expectations of citize ns and businesses in terms of service quality , usability and trustworthiness . Starting from the assumption described above , and t aking Figure 2 ( from Section 2 ) for approaching AI appropriation in the Public Sector , user centricity principles can be enabled in the process of AI appropriation at the governmental level through a variety of service s co-design and participatory activities . It appears that the AI itself is an enabling technology for user cent ricity and it could be included in the cyclic process that brings to the AI appropriation maturity . Table 3 offers a bird ’ s eye view of this conceptual scheme . In detail , column 1 refers to single phases of the proc ess of AI appropriation , column 2 provides a list of activities paving the way to the implementation of user centricity processes and , finally , column 3 suggests the most relevant AI typologies supporting the mentioned activities . Table 3 . User centricity cultivation within the process of AI appropriation . PHASES OF AI APPROPRIATION ACTIVITIES FOR ENABLING USER CENTRICITY SUPPORTIVE TYPES OF AI USER REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS Perform quantitative and qualitative studies , such as surveys a nd interviews to understand citizens ’ needs and identify which of those should be ( re ) addressed with the help of new or revised , AI -enabled public services Natural Language Processing , Text Mining and Speech Analytics Tools ANALYSIS OF CONTEXTU AL FACTORS Complement available evidence with e.g . fresh environmental or perception data generated through interacting with the stakeholders who are to be served Predictive Analytics , Simulation and Data Visualisation Applications NEED ANALYSIS AND TECHNOLOGY CHOIC E Build rough prototypes to pre -test related ideas for sustainability and scalability , and iterate if needed Chatbots , Intelligent Digital Assistants , Virtual Agents and Recommendation Systems SERVICE ( RE ) DESIGN AND ( RE ) DEVELOPMENT Generate insights and create new service concepts and processes based on the above findings All of the above SERVICE TESTING AND EVALUATION Balance quantitative and qualitative measures to assess performance and impact on users All of the above CHECK AGAINST CONTEXTUAL FACTO RS Craft stories , share experiences , describe successful cases and lessons learned – also to inspire actions of other administrations in a logic of scalability and reuse Predictive Analytics , Simulation and Data Visualisation Applications CHECK AGAINST US ER REQUIREMENTS Refine ideas and gather feedback from stakeholders to deliver better services that will be adopted by citizens Natural Language Processing , Text Mining and Speech Analytics Tools Source : JRC , own elaboration . All these activities belong to a human -centred approach that is transformative of the way governments engage with prospective beneficiaries to gather their pre-emptive insights and offer better responses to their needs and requirements . In so doing , people are p ositioned at the centre of public service transformation , across all steps from ideation to prototyping to validation . This can contribute to achieving user centricity in AI -enabled public services and also leads to increased citizens trust and an enhanced resilience of the socia l and economic systems ( Alzahrani , Al -Karaghouli , & Weerakkody , 2017 ) . Finally , and by no means surprisingly , user centricity principles can be more effectively guaranteed if sound achievements are also ensured for the previously outlined challenges in terms of e.g . skills im provement , data availability and accuracy , interoperability of datasets and processes as well as , more generally , increased sharing and collaboration propensity among administrations . 41 5 Policy implication s This Section draws some overall suggestions that s et the ground for identifying a list of policy implication s from the previous discussion . With a high -level approach , we made the first attempt to support EU decision makers that are willing to undertake the systemic approach to AI governance towards a mor e advanced equilibrium between AI promotion and regulation in the public sector . This equilibrium should be redefined at the predominant space of high -level coordination between the European Commission and the Member States , that is the macro level . Accor dingly , the next three paragraphs formulate as suggestions or recommendations : 1. a stronger integration of AI with data policies , to face the issue of the so-called “ explainability of AI ” ( Arrieta et al. , 2019 ; Vilone & Longo , 2020 ) 2. to broaden the current perspectives of both Pre-Commercial Procurement ( P CP ) and Public Procurement of Innovation ( PPI ) at the service of smart AI purchasing by the EU public administration49 . As reported at the beginning , the main goal of the entire report was to set the theoretical ground on which future research can build a precise and detailed list of recommendations . For this reason in this Section will contain only , some bounded high-level suggestions that shall and will be detailed in further researches that are conducted within the AI Watch . Hence , the three policy impl ications reported are the direct result of the analysis reported in the previous chapter and aim at being neither exhaustive nor extremely detailed or refined . 5.1 In search of a critical mass for the “ champions ” of AI for government In Section 3 of this report , an attempt at benchmarking EU with US and China was made in terms of the respective performance s of their governance systems in framing , promoting , and regulating the use of AI solutions within the public sector . While the sc arcity of comparable data , other than merely anecdotal or qualitative evidence , impedes any definite judgment on the real degree of AI take -up at the different tiers of administration , it seems quite reasonable to affirm that this is a key dimension of the global techno economic race too . In fact , the economic implication s of a growing demand for AI solutions in any sector and country – above and beyond the gains in productivity and efficiency of the appropriation “ pioneers ” – include the formation and growth of a wave of specialised technology providers or the consolidation of the existing or emerging national industry players in that domain . Making a compar ison of the demand side of the three markets is made – as far as government is concerned , but more g enerally in all sectors where digital solutions can be successfully deployed – it is necessary to concede that Europe is at disadvantage , compared to the US and China , because of the relative fragmentation of the European GovTech market , and the need to ad just solutions based on the national contexts . ( Probst , Pedersen , Lefebvre , & Dakkak -Arnoux , 2018 ) . However , i f one looks at the supply side of the AI industry , assuming that the trends of globalisation of the pre Covid19 e ra will be to a great extent resumed in the coming years , it would seem quite logical for European firms born after the successful deployment of some technologies in Europe to become more competitive and start serv ing US or China based clients with their original and innovative products and services . In deed , there is already a wide set of AI solutions experimented in many domains that could be rather easily scaled from a single/local experimentation site to multiple/global business locations . Of course , various aspects of market segmentation would still be operational , in cluding language barriers : it may be the case that automatic speech to text services in Croatian language underperform those working in English , or that analysing the sentiment of social media posts may not be as great as a business in Malt ese as in French or Spanish . Even so – as highlighted by a quick look into the growth pathways of IT “ giants ” such as Facebook , Google or Twitter – a number of technological , as well as commercial synergies , could be exploited irrespective of the language spoken in the countries the se AI innovators are operating in . Discussing the most appropriate policy measures to promote the growth in market size and internationalisation of European AI industry would obviously exceed the scope of this report . However , the important poi nt here is that there may be another way of tackling the same issue , particularly for government -oriented AI solutions . 49 the forthcoming EU Adopt AI programme is expected to offer a support to this 42 This is to promote the reuse and transfer of AI implementation best practice examples , starting from those within the same EU country , then analysing the conditions for their replication in other EU countries , up to the possibility of identify ing a new generation of cross -border or pan-European public services that leverage AI as a common enabler . In fact , while a number of value -adding AI solutions successfully t rialled so far seem to refer to specific digital infrastructures , datasets and service delivery environments , others are agnostic with respect to the domain of application . This is the case of AI tools such as automatic translato rs or transcri bers which , once developed and tested , can be effectively re-used in different situation s without the need for further adaptation . For example , the European Commission recently launched an online machine translation service called eTranslatio n50 , which is available to registered EU users free of charge . Other AI prototype s that have proven useful in specific context s may require little effort to be extended to similar or related ones . Another example is a solution recent ly develop ed in the Neth erlands to interpret handwritten documents , such as those stored in historical archives , and convert them into a digital format . Such use of AI could also prove helpful for government bodies and agencies still rely ing on paper exchange with some service be neficiaries , rather than adopt ing a “ natively digital ” approach , which the organisation might not yet be ready . After digiti sing and analysing the files through AI , new applications could become viable , leading to further insights to act upon . While such examples look reasonable to follow and expand further , for many reasons they are not representative of the current scenario in the EU public administration . In fact , with all the caveats suggested by all-too-scanty empirical evidence , the following two ( clusters of ) barriers seems to prevail at the moment : — The “ AI for government ” supply side seem s comparatively less market -ready than the broader GovTech industry it belongs to . This may not necessarily be due to a lack of technology maturity ( low TRL ) , altho ugh this could be perceived to some extent if we tried to disentangle the generic categorisation of AI typologies – such as Machine Learning or Robotic Process Automation – into their individual components showing high grades of heterogeneity in terms of t ime to market . Our impression is that such heterogeneity hides a more general issue , which is related to a comparatively higher difficulty in gaining a critical mass of commercial applications of a certain AI technology , which is a prerequisite to turn the latter into a commercially viable and attractive product or service . — While several collections of developer tools exist indeed , such as Google ’ s AI Hub51 , Amazon ’ s AWS52 , Microsoft ’ s AzureML53 , Cognitive Services54 , and ML.Net Model Builder55 , or IBM Develop er56 and Watson57 , it is rather unusual that a “ plug and play ” solution can be immediately adopted as it is taken from off -theshelf . Instead , in order to achieve a satisfactory degree of AI appropriation in a public service environment , a supplement of loca l configuration and custom installation is usually needed , which leads to additional `` pains and perils '' during onsite experimentation . The latter is witnessed by the significant number of case histories gathered in the AI Watch collection , which do es not s eem to have ever left the `` ongoing project '' status , due to unexpected problems that emerged during the transition from adoption to implementation . Conversely , from an overview of the various GovTech startup and business listings that are published from time to time in the US58 , in Europe59 , and worldwide60 , the reality emerges of many “ champions ” of AI for government – i.e . bearers or inventors of a cutting -edge technology , which is now available to the public buyer – not selling the AI application as such , but only as a component of a broader solution , which is supposed to fulfil the domain - and context - related requirements of the business case ( s ) it addresses . Moreover , the ERASMUS Data Analytics Centre ’ s study identified that one of the main obstacles to sc aling up smart city digital solutions was - and still is - the lack of interoperable , standards -based platforms61 that would allow public administrations to manage large amounts of data from heterogeneous 50 https : //ec.europa.eu/info/resources -partners/machine -translation -public -administrations -etransl ation_en 51 https : //aihub.cloud.google.com/ 52 https : //aws.amazon.com/free/machine -learning/ ? nc1=h_ls 53 https : //azure.microsoft.com/en -us/services/machine -learning/ # product -overview 54 https : //azure.microsoft.com/en -us/services/cognitive -services/ 55 https : //dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/machinelearning -ai/ml -dotnet/model -builder 56 https : //developer.ibm.com/technologies/artific ial-intelligence/ 57 https : //www.ibm.com/watson 58 Such as https : //www.govtech.com/100/2021 59 Such as https : //view.publitas.com/public -1/the -european -govtech -150-the-startups -driving -europes -govtech -revolution/ 60 Such as https : //aithority.com/ait -featured -posts/100 -emerging -govtech -startups -you-should -know -about/ 61 See : https : //www.rsm.nl/about -rsm/news/detail/14476 -smart -cities -need-to-trust-technology -and-data-quality/ 43 data sources . Compared with the private sector , government has a more heterogenous range of business needs to fulfil , which are inextricably related to the contextual factors presented in Paragraph 2.2 . Additionally , even within the same country or region , therefore under a common legal system , the organis ational , process - and service - level peculiarities outnumber the commonalities among public bodies and agencies , which makes every AI appropriation quite often a single case . This is witnessed by a number of global surveys of the “ AI maturity ” of ( usually large sized ) organisations from various industries , including the public sector . With this term , which is broken down in different ways depending on who has carried out the survey , the implication is made that every organisation follows a sort of learning and capacity building process , which will ultimately lead it to make strategic use of AI in its processes and therefore to grasp all the benefits and impacts from implementation . For example , according to a 2021 survey of the Boston Consulting Group62 , the Public Sector has the second highest share of organisations that are not AI mature ( only the Consumer industry fares worse ) . Quite reasonabl y , this is explained by the prevalence of AI applications that interface human beings , as users or beneficiaries , rather than fabrica tion processes or B2B transactions . A previous research by Capgemini , released in mid -202063 , showed that only 9 % of surveyed government bodies and agencies had been successful in going beyond the stage of pilot or small -scale deployment o f AI , compared to 27 % in life sciences and – surprisingly enough – 21 % in retail and 17 % in consumer products . It remains very difficult ( and mission critical ) to define a prompt and clear scalability pathway for the “ average ” AI for government applicatio ns . According to the Boston Consulting Group , this pathway should consist of 10 % introduction of algorithms , 20 % of new technologies and 70 % of embedment of AI into the existing business processes and ways of working64 . In practice , it is not very frequent that public sector organizations invest twice as much in people and processes as they do in AI algorithms and technologies . We add to this that current best practice examples of AI implementation and use in the EU public sector are not easily retrievable o r accessible65 . While many government organizations are indeed conducting experiments , there is no clear stocktaking of the different initiatives , also to avoid the replica of similar or identical failure stories . Therefore , it proves difficult to know whic h AI works , which does not , which contributes to societal goals and which threatens public confidence ( AlgorithmWatch , 2020a ) . More proactive sharing of results , both good and bad , from the use of AI in public services or policies , should be encouraged , such as the establishment of AI repositorie s as initiated by the Cities of Amsterdam , Helsinki and Nantes , which are already sharing which AI they are using and for which purposes ( Floridi , 2020 ) . Expanding this initiative could help both citizens , as well as other city governments , see what AI really is about and what value it can bring to them . This calls for the creation of a ( probably federated ) repository of good practice examples , widely accessible to potential adopters , less focused on the AI tools having the potential of being implemented locally66 , and more on the characteristics of the public sector envi ronments that would be surrounding them . Further to the above , even the AI innovation projects , which were not successful , should be openly shared outside the organizational borders . Often , such projects are not made public – unless they had been negatively covered in the press , see for example ( AIAAIC , 2021 ) - which limits peer learning across other organizations , increasing the odds of the same mistakes occurring again in another project . This goal should be part of a broader cultural transformation of the EU public sector , in the direction of considering failure as an integral component of any systematic approach to innovation , and even more than so , a precondition for success ( Stamm , 2018 ) . One important reason fo r failure is that AI should not be deployed just because it is possible to use it . While experimentation on proofs of concept should be encouraged , active deployment of AI should always be aimed at solving a relevant service requirement and creating public value67 . ICT-enabled innovation in the public sector can not be disconnected from end user 62 https : //www.bcg.com/publications/2021/the -four-stages -of-responsible -ai-maturity 63 https : //w ww.capgemini.com/research/the -ai-powered -enterprise/ 64 See https : //www.bcg.com/capabilities/digital -technology -data/artificial -intelligence 65 See DT4REGIONS project The DEP will also call for the creation of AI catalogues in cities ( AI catalogues of AI -enabled solutions ) . 66 For example , in a collection like https : //www.thedevmasters.com/ai -tools 67 See AI 4CITIES pre -commercial procurement of AI -enabled solutions by 6 cities for reducing GHG emissions ( https : //ai4cities.eu/ ) 44 needs and expectations , which might lead to unintended and negative consequences ( Benbunan -Fich , Desouza , & Andersen , 2020 ) . If too little consideration is given to this aspect during AI implementation , this could lead to a signif icant backlash by citizens , reducing trust in the administration as well as future AI projects . Given the tendency of many AI systems to make ( significant ) errors , and the opacity of AI ’ s decision support mechanisms , the opportunity of AI to achieve effici ency gains should be measured against other public values such as accountability , resilience and inclusiveness . More generally , a culture of innovation within EU public administration should be encouraged . While there are still many unknowns with regard to the effects and potential of AI in government contexts , this should not be a barrier to trying out ( small ) experiments and seeing what benefit they could provide to the administration . Staff who work with policy issues daily are likely to have innovative ideas on how to improve public services , but often do not have the opportunity to work on these ideas . A risk - and innovation - adverse culture , limiting public management support or funding , may be one of the root causes why innovation in the public sector does not occur . However , for stimulating the use of AI in the public sector , such a culture should be widely diffused ( in the sense of Everett Rogers , 2010 ) . In this respect , initiatives such as the Experimentation Accelerator in Helsinki could be replicated in other administrations . This is a new programme where internal civil staff are encouraged to come up with innovations utilizing AI , which can be experimented in a relatively short time with limited funding.68 Naturally , this goes hand in hand with improving the digital skills and literacy of civil staff . Therefore , internal training programmes on using data , both generalist as well as specialist , should be encouraged and introduced to ensure that all public bodies and agencies have access to the capabilities needed for adopting AI and using AI in their organizations . To conclude , apart from any further opportunity offered to EU service providers by the ongoing or upcoming AI governance initiatives in the US and China , only scalability of the most successful applications delivered by the European GovTech “ champions ” can lead Europe to fully grasp the benefits of AI implementation . Scaling AI is a complex task though , requiring far more than a one -off experimentation in real or realistic environments . In the following three sections , we highlight a set of policy initiativ es , some of which have already been initiated , that we see as particularly apt to counteracting the two clusters of barriers introduced above . Quite interestingly , most of the m would not duplicate , but simply add to or qualify the contents of the national AI strategies monitored by AI Watch and overviewed in a previous JRC Science for Policy report ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) . What would ma ke a real difference is the systemic approach , already introduced in Section 3 as part of a truly European AI governance model , based on a tight collaboration between the European Commission and Member States ( possibly also incl uding Regional and large sized City governments ) . Should this collaboration not materialise in full , the EU might be exposed to the risk of proceeding with AI innovation in the public sector in an uncoordinated manner69 , as the experience of Covid19 tracing apps during the pandemic crisis has shown . According to a recent study by IFRI , the French Institute of International Relations ( Tonon , 2020 ) , the persistent lack of an effective European strategy for the GovTech industry in general , and for AI in government specifically , might result in a permanent advantage to Chinese and American actors , which benefit from governmental support both at home and abroad . On this aspect , leverage towards a more coordinated approach to the defini tion of AI-related standards at the EU level can support European growth . However , and despite the lack of comparable empirical evidence in the US and China , our qualitative view is that the peculiarities and heterogeneities of the public sector are recurr ent phenomena also in those countries , which are therefore experiencing similar difficulties to the EU in making AI scalable therein . Therefore , our tentative conclusion – much in the same way as we put it in Section 3 with rega rd to AI governance in general 68 This is an initiative by the city to encourage employees to come up with experiments using AI and scale workable solutions , s ee also : https : //www.hel.fi/uutiset/en/kaupunginkanslia/helsinki -develops -experiment -activities -with-artificial -intelligence 69 EC DG CONNECT has recently formally relaunched a Member States ‘ Expert group on Artificial Intelligence and Digitalisation of Businesses ’ . This expert group will specifically focus on AI .One of the main tasks of the group will be to follow -up and implement ation of the actions proposed in the Coordinated Plan ( including for the public sector ) , https : //ec.europa.eu/transparency/expert -groupsregister/screen/expert -groups/consult ? lang=en & groupID=3795 45 – is that the gap between Europe , the US and China , in terms of critical mass for active national “ AI for government champions ” , potentially able to play as global service providers , has chances to be filled in , provided the negative influence of market fragmentation and lack of policy coordination is neutralised . 5.2 Tackling data availability and quality as an example of market failure As discussed in Section 4 , it seems rather uncontroversial that m ost AI technologies – including those developed for and/or deployed in the public sector – find their rationale and justification in the need to handle large volumes of data , of various nature and sources , with a speed or sophistication or simply coverage it would be impossible to reach when only using human reasoning and computing capacity . Indeed , one of the key drivers of “ next generation AI ” ( aka Artificial Superintelligence see Bostrom ( 2014 ) and Yamp olskiy ( 2015 ) is exactly the expectation that the growing proliferation of data generated on the fly in all sectors of individual and community life c ould not be successfully managed , interpreted and turned to the common good without the use of powerful AI algorithms and other c omputing , sensing and visualisation techniques that outperform the sheer possibilities of fered by our brain and senses . In this context , it seems more than a bit of a paradox that the top EU industry players , gathered under the umbrella of the so -called Big Data Value Association ( BDVA ) , presenting itself as “ the private counterpart to the European Commission to implement the Big Data Value PPP program ” , point at the fundamental lack of “ cross sectoral , unbiased , high -quality and t rustworthy data ” to unleash the potential of AI innovation in Europe and beyond ( BDVA , 2019 ) . If such a lack is evident in industry , one could easily imagine an even worse situation in the public sector . Despite some 20 years of open data policies , initiatives and exa mples of good practice in Public Sector Information ( PSI ) disclosure , there remains room for improvement of open government data sets . The situation can well be summarized in the following quote from the 2017 edition of the Open Data Barometer : “ Government data is usually incomplete , out of date , of low quality , and fragmented . In most cases , open data catalogues or portals are manually fed as the result of informal data management approaches . Procedures , timelines , and responsibilities are frequently uncle ar among government institutions tasked with this work . This makes the overall open data management and publication approach weak and prone to multiple errors ” ( World Wide Web Foundation , 2017 ) . In a recent paper , ( Concilio & Molinari , 2021 ) propose to look at this situation as a textbook example of market failure – a concept borrowed from the economy – as the existing framework of incentives to PSI disclosure is evidently not compelling enough to accompany public bodies and agencies across the whole lifecycle of data publication , maintenance , continuous update , and quality assurance , improving the data sharing paradigm . The implications of such lack of incentives are even more substantive if one consider s the case of an AI solution that uses , but also adds new data to the original set by a continuous machine inte lligence and decision -making process . Knowing how sensitive the decisions of a n algorithm can be to changes of the underlying PSI structure , we can probably realise how seriously the concerns of BDVA should be taken – before it gets too late . As a matter o f fact , the February 2020 Communication on “ A European strategy for data ” ( European Commission , 2020a ) proposed a roadmap of investments and policy measures aimed at the creation of a European -governed data sharing space : a sort of “ sin gle market for data ” , open to the integration of sources from all over the world , but complying with the European principles and rules of privacy , security , safety and ethics . The Communication was followed by a public consultation , which highlighted the i mportance of making every PSI that possibly holds commercial value available free of charge , without restrictions and accessible via Application Programm ing Interfaces ( APIs ) 70 . Then in November 2020 , the Commission adopted a propos al for Regulation on dat a governance71 ( the so called Data Governance Act ) , which is now under discussion at the E uropean Parliament . The proposal buil t on 70 See https : //data.europa.eu/en/highlights/data -governance -act-open-data-directive 71 https : //ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/proposal -regulation -european -data-governance -data-governance -act 46 an Impact Assessment exercise , stating that the limited amount of data sharing may be caused by insufficient trust and cultur e , by a lack of structures and processes conducive to the collection and reuse of PSI , or by technical obstacles to the reuse of data for the common good . Feedback on the Data Governance Act was received until early February 2021 , with the participation of 149 EU organisations72 . The vision of both policy documents – the Communication and the Regulation proposal – is to intervene with concrete actions at the EU level , without interfering with , and possibly building on or facilitating the concurrent developme nt of sectorial strategies carried out by the Member States . Using the taxonomy of policy instruments from Vedung ( 1998 ) recalled in Section 2 , we can suggest two distinct approaches to inspire those actions , one more based on “ sticks ” , the other on “ carrots ” : — The opportunity of the Data Governance Act might be grasped to impose – rather than simply recommend – the refinement and update of existing data ecosystems as well as their federation as proposed by the GAIA -X proje ct and AISBL73 . Particular attention should be paid to predefin ing and implementing the rules of interoperability ( in the broadest sense , thus including the cultural , the semantic as well as the legal and organisational dimensions , alongside the technical o ne , as per the European Interoperability Framework – EIF ( European Commission , 2017b ) 74 . — As proposed by Concilio and Molinari ( 2021 ) , forthcoming , a simpler in tervention – to be coordinated at the European level , but not necessarily ruled centrally75 – might take the form of provi ding direct subsidies to regional and local governments engaged in disclosing and maintaining their own datasets clean , updated and acc essible over time . Moreover to push the supply ( PS ) to meet demand ( businesses ) , focusing the effort on opening and maintaining the most usefu l and high value PS datasets . In so doing , the negative externalities of the aforementioned market failure could a t least be reduced , if not fully compensated for . It seems quite obvious that the two options are neither fully new nor incompatible with one another . Particularly the former proposal echoes the European Commission ’ s view to create common data spaces differentiated by domain , such as for the EU Green Deal supported by the Digital Europe Programme , granting a pivotal role to climate -neutral and smart cities and communities ( European Commission , 2019b , 2020a ) . Another similar initiative is the Covid19 Data Portal76 , which was launched in April 2020 to bring together and share relevant datasets to accelerate coronavirus research . In a similar vein , we might think of building a federation of local government datasets with a specific orientation to promoting AI enabled services according to a reuse logic . Federations of datasets can be for example obtained by reinforcing the use of web standards ( W3C , 2009 ) and by the permanency of both data sources and technical enablers such as APIs ( Grzenda & Legierski , 2019 ) . The latter one , in particular , is expected by both data providers and application developers , also and primarily to develop AI applications that need to access big volume s of data in a fast , updated and reliable way . API -based access becomes the only choice for some AI applications when near -real-time data streams are exposed . In particular , high volume , variety and velocity data , requires API -based exposition rather than a file download . Indeed , the ability to use and design APIs is one of the key competencies identified in a study on open data value capability architecture ( Zeleti & Ojo , 2017 ) , rewarded by the Open Government Data Portal Index ( OGDPI ) proposed by ( Thorsby , Stowers , Wolslegel , & Tumbuan , 2017 ) and recently recognised as one of the key enablers of digital government ( Boyd , Vaccari , Posada , & Ga ttwinkel , 2020 ) . The research w ork made at the JRC has also emphasized the potential of API ’ s for digital government and includes additional recommendation s on how to improve the use of APIs across Europe . 72 For more informatio n see https : //ec.europa.eu/info/law/better -regulation/have -your-say/initiatives/12491 -Data-sharing -in-the-EUcommon -European -data-spaces -new-rules- and https : //data.europa.eu/en/highlights/high -value -datasets 73 https : //www.data -infrastructure.eu/GAIAX/Navigation/EN/Hom e/home.html 74 This was also recognised as a priority in the Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence ( European Commission , 2018 ) which r equired actions to make datasets more easily accessible in practice and facilitate aggregation by adopting the “ des ign and implementation of interoperable data and meta -data formats as well as the deployment of standardised Application Programming Interfaces ( APIs ) ” . 75 For instance , one of the pillars of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility ( RRF ) is about digitalisa tion of public administration . See https : //ec.europa.eu/info/business -economy -euro/recovery -coronavirus/recovery -and-resilience -facility _en . In turn , the AI White Paper ( European Commission , 2020d ) predicts that “ to stimulate private and public investment , the EU will make available resources from the Digital Europe Programme , Horizon Europe as well as from the European Structural and Inv estment Funds to address the needs of less - developed regions as well as rural areas ” . 76 https : //www.covid19dataportal.org/ 47 A feasibility study of either intervention excee ds the scope of this report but could be easily drafted and made accessible to all EU stakeholders for consultation and contributions in the very short term . As both options are not necessarily linked to AI requirements , so that released datasets may prove to serve broader scopes , an idea might be to “ start small ” and make an inventory of the kinds of dataset reused in AI in some active locations ( or specifically indicated in existing data catalogues such as the European Data Portal77 ) and suggest them for p ublication in others . On this direction is moving the Data Space for Smart C ommunities initiative , with the objective of setting up a governance s tructure for data sharing , with a focus on t he most useful data . What ever the direction is taken , we would lik e to stress here the vital need for integrating the EU level agenda for AI development and deployment with a firmer consideration of data policies and their implementation prospects , having in mind that for many reasons , the Member State level may not be t he most appropriate one to promote data sharing in a harmonious and effective manner . This would be the first in a row of three proposed instantiations of our concept of “ European AI policy exceptionalism ” . 5.3 Emphasising AI explainability as another key fac et of accountability The idea of explaining to lay people – be they the purchasers or the end users of an AI solution – the inner logic of its learning or inferential algorithm s has always been around as a parallel research thread to the mainstream thinki ng and is normally referred to as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence ( XAI ) . This is not a marketing or trust building feature , however . Scholars engaged in XAI research have highlighted a number of crucial dilemmas , which might be more easily solved by opening up the “ black box ” of machine reasoning and making it fully transparent and interpretable in its design and ways of operation . Such dilemmas includ e the trade -off between accuracy and simplicity of the functional descriptions of an AI system ( Bernease , 2019 ) , the so -called “ infobesity ” ( information overload ) versus selective use of info rmation according to the interests or preferences of target stakeholders ( Przegalinska , 2019 ) , and the reasonableness of a n AI model ’ s predictions contrasted with the effective power of disruption of the underlying patterns of logic ( Gilpin et al. , 2018 ) . As far as Europe is concerned , the principle of AI explainability has gained recognition after the entry into force of the GDPR – the EU/EEA General Data Protection Regulation , No . 2016/679 – in May 2018 . Articles 13 ( 2 ) ( f ) , 14 ( 2 ) ( g ) , and 15 ( 1 ) ( h ) of the GDPR require s data controllers to provide data subjects with “ confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her are being processed , and , where that is the case , access to the personal data ” as well as to specifi c information about “ the existence of automated decision -making , including profiling , referred to in Article 22 ( 1 ) and ( 4 ) and , at least in those cases , meaningful information about the logic involved , as well as the significance and the envisaged conseque nces of such processing for the data subject ” . In brief , this set of articles imposes notification duties on data controllers “ to ensure fair and transparent processing ” whenever AI solutions are in use that have fully or partly automated decision -making or user profiling . Moreover , the data subjects enjoy a right to access , not only the personal data created throughout AI processing , as long as it pertains ( although as a derivative ) to their own profiles , but also a supplement of technical information conc erning the purpose , nature and modalities of th is innovative way of data elaboration . Whether these legal provisions should be considered as the introduction of a new “ right to explanation ” or the recognition of a pre -existing right has been widely debate d among jurists and philosophers ( see e.g . Selbst and Powles , 2017 for a discussion ) . Whatever the opinion one may want t o express , the substance of the problem is clear : not only are data subjects entitled to receive that supplement of information , but its contents must be “ meaningful ” – i.e . sufficiently detailed and specific to motivate an action , or reaction , from their side . And the nature of such possible ( re ) action is well described in Article 22 ( 3 ) of the GDPR providing that when automated decision -making is contractually necessary or consensual , certain safeguards for data subjects must apply , including “ at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller , to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision ” . This is because according to Article 22 ( 1 ) data subjects “ have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on au tomated processing , including profiling , which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her ” . Article 22 ( 2 ) – ( 4 ) specifies the limited circumstances whereby automated decision -making is permitted , and caters for different safeguards 77 https : //data.europa.eu/en 48 so that data subjects can effectively exercise their own “ rights and freedoms and legitimate interests ” . Finally , the non -binding Recital 71 reaffirms that safeguards for data subjects “ should include specific information to the data subject and the right to obtain human intervention , to express his or her point of view , [ and ] to obtain an explanation of the decision reached after such assessment and to challenge the decision ” . To summarise , the emphasis given by the GDPR to safeguard the “ rights and freedoms and legitimate interests ” of data subjects when AI solutions are in place has certainly contributed to supporting the case of AI explainability . However , this is only part of the story . Indeed , depending on the complexity as well a s the novelty of the AI solution compared with the state of the art , the data controller itself is likely to suffer from the same lack of “ meaningful information about the logic involved ” as its data subjects . This would inevitably impact the users of th e solution , be they employees at the same organisation that delivers an AI enabled public service or direct beneficiaries of that service or simply external stakeholders to the service environment , thus formally deprived of the safeguards introduced by Artic le 22 of the GDPR78 . Omitting to consider this broader set of stakeholders is a severe limitation because they belong to the target community of administrative accountability - the ability of government to give a satisfactory account of the use of power an d resources , including , and though not being limited to , AI in public service . If no proper account can be given of the way certain decisions are taken by AI - because some of the dilemmas the XAI literature has singled out are actually in operation – how can the legal obligations to accountability be properly addressed ? More generally speaking , if some of the obstacles to making machine reasoning fully transparent and interpretable materialise at the stage of solution development , what are the implications for the purchasing process itself ? Should it be stopped or complemented by an extra round of reflection and evaluation , before – rather than after – the final solution has gone in to operation ? We conclude this subsection by stressing that despite some re cent attempts at systematising the XAI research domain , “ there are still important scientific issues that must be tackled . Firstly , there is no agreement among scholars on what an explanation exactly is and which are the salient properties that should be c onsidered to make it effective and understandable for end -users , in particular non -experts . Secondly , the construct of explainability is a concept borrowed from Psychology , since it is strictly connected to humans , and it is also linked to other constructs such as trust , transparency and privacy . Thirdly , this concept has been invoked in several fields , such as Physics , Mathematics , Social Sciences and Medicine . All this make its formalisation and operationalisation a non -trivial research task ” ( Vilone & Longo , 2020 ) . Direct financial support from the EU to a dedicated , inevitably multi -disciplinary , research agenda on such topics , would give a tremendous impulse to a knowledge -based approach to AI implem entation that we recognize and refer to as the second core instantiation of our proposed concept of “ European AI policy exceptionalism ” . Such support would be fully in line with the provisions of the 2019 Communication on ‘ Building Trust in Human Centric Artificial Intelligence ’ , setting out as principles that “ processes and data sets used must be tested and documented at each step such as planning , training , testing and deployment . This should also apply to AI systems that were not developed in -house but acquired elsewhere ” and that “ it is important to log and document both the decisions made by the systems , as well as the entire process ( including a description of data gathering and labelling , and a description of the algorithm used ) that yielded the deci sions . Linked to this , explainability of the algorithmic decision -making process , adapted to the persons involved , should be provided to the extent possible . Ongoing research to develop explainability mechanisms should be pursued . In addition , explanations of the degree to which an AI system influences and shapes the organisational decision -making process , design choices of the system , as well as the rationale for deploying it , should be available ( hence ensuring not just data and system transparency , but a lso business model transparency ) ” . ( European Commission , 2019a ) 5.4 Fully exploiting the degrees of freedom allowed by Innovative Public Procurement According to a DG GROW study ( European Commission , 2017a ) only 1,7 % of the contract awards in EU28 dated between 2009 and 2015 saw the involvement of a successful bidder that was not located in the same country 78 See al so forthcoming EU Digital Principles ( DG CNECT D2 ) 49 as the contracting authority and was not domestically owned . In terms of value , the figure was 3 % of all contracts between €1.000 and €200 million documented on the Tenders Electronic Daily ( TED ) database . However , the same percentages increased considerably , up to 21,9 % and 20,4 % respectively , when the successful bidder was based in the same country as the contracting authority but was a subsidiary of a foreign company . Compared with the private sector , import penetrat ion , or the share of goods and services purchased from other countries than where the buyer resides , was estimated to be 10 % lower in the EU public sector . That was only an average , however . In fact , the study showed that at the product level , import penet ration was actually more often higher in the public than in the private sector , while the opposite was true for services , and especially for crucial government functions like security , public administration and defence , social security , education and healt h. These five functions alone represented over 58 % of public sector purchasing at the time and were all heavily tilted towards domestic purchasing . To some extent , this result was unsurprising as the provision of services is more likely to be dependent on geographical proximity and language barriers . Beside s this , there are maybe also security and privacy concerns about the subject involved that holds /stores the data and about where the data are stored ( especially if it involves personal data ) For instance , 75 % of contracts awarded in the Republic of Ireland to non -Irish companies were won by UK bidders and 69 % of the Slovakian ones by Czech firms . Furthermore , certain services are inherently non tradable since they can not be produced and delivered in separ ate locations . The conclusion was therefore that in the aggregate , the nature of what is purchased prevails on any other source of domestic bias on the part of contracting authorities . The implications of AI take -up for the practice of procurement – especi ally in the private sector – have already been noted and commented on by many observers before . Based on a quick survey of the grey literature worldwide , the most prominent impacts and benefits are those shown in Table 4 . With the needed adjustments , it is possible to argue that they also apply to the corresponding phases of a public procurement process . 50 Table 4 . AI-supported public procurement .

( 2016 ) , ( f ) Meulen ( 2017 ) . Source : JRC , own elaboration . In this scenario , the instrumental rela tions between AI and procurement can become relevant in two distinct directions : 1 . To support the execution of public tender procedures on the one hand , by using AI technologies within the procurement process . With such terms as “ cognitive procurement ” or “ procurement 4.0 ” , the ongoing trend is highlighted towards an increasing availabili ty of AI resources in support of the purchasing process . However , and to paraphrase the conclusions of a comprehensive study by ( Meulen , 2017 ) , it is not advisable that all p rocurement phases embrace AI immediately and at the same time . Despite the plethora of success stories one can hear about , a feeling to be resisted is the “ fear of missing out , causing a ‘ big bang ’ adoption approach ” . In fact , not all technologies have the same level of maturity , and several organisational factors may condition implementation , including the skills and experiences of procurement staff . Therefore , a time frame of 6 to 12 months should be allowed for even the simplest solutions to generate the ir positive impacts . More complex technology investments such as AI supported market intelligence , contract drafting and authoring , and bid evaluation , among others , should be prioritized in an arc of 12 to 18 months . 2 . To promote or accelerate the penetrat ion of AI in government , by using innovative procurement methods as a way to facilitate the introduction of AI within governments Some of the documents or reports monitored by AI Watch do include invitations to contracting authorities to adopt AI solutions to improve the efficiency , timeliness and transparency of tender procedures . In France , the report entitled “ For a meaningful Artificial Intelligence : Towards a French and European strategy ” by the 79 See upcoming Ado pt AI programme that will consider increa sing take up of AI in the Public S ector and in the procurement process itself 51 Parliament Member and mathematician Cédric Villani80 analy sed how AI could support public procurement in enhancing its existing workflows . In the UK , the House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence report entitled “ AI in the UK : ready , willing and able ? ” estimated savings of £4bn a year by the exte nded use of AI across government departments81 . In Belgium , the AI4Belgium program paving the way for a concerted national strategy highlighted the need for SMEs and contracting authorities to closely collaborate on projects related to the redesign of publi c procurement processes82 . Also , the Norwegian government representatives who responded in early 2020 to an AI Watch survey did mention the scenario of enhancing procurement processes using AI technologies , making them more inclusive , accessible , fast and r obust . Finally , Malta was developing at that time a template for the procurement of emerging technologies ( including AI ) and would enact a training and awareness programme for civil servants in order to equip them with the required AI related skills ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) . Does this mean that until we reach a standard way of offering AI services to public administration ( e.g . in the c loud – one of the additional priorities of the European Data Strategy Communication ) there will be no future for AI beyond time limited and resource constrained experimentation ? Not necessarily , in our opinion . The reason for this is that apart from the oc casional participation in R & D and innovation projects , government bodies and agencies do not have a single way to purchase AI , but at least two : — What we can name “ Traditi onal Procurement ” – i.e . oriented to products and services that are well established on their market of reference , the technical specifications of which can be clearly and fully described in the public tender documentation , and the competition for which can be based on the best price quality ratio , also referred to as MEAT ( Most Economical ly Advantageous Offer ) . In case the product , service or process bought is simply new to the public procurer , we can say innovation is not even purchased per se – as we can assume that someone else has already implemented it before – but for the positive ou tcomes it brings to the organisation , for instance , because it enables similar or even better services delivered to the general public at reduced unit costs ; — And “ Innovation Procurement ” , or “ Procurement of Innovation ” – where the above characteristics can be relaxed to some extent . According to an acknowledged definition ( European Commission , 2018 ) , this term refers to any purchasing process that targets one or both of the following aspects : the process of innovation ( such as research and development of pr oducts , services or processes , which do not exist yet on the market ) and/or the outcomes of innovation ( a product , service or process that is new to the market or simply new to the public procurer ) . In the first instance , the public sector organisation act s as a buyer of R & D services . In the second instance , as an early adopter of third party ’ s R & D results . Involving small sized enterprises that can work agile on new AI solutions certainly require s the use of innovative procurement schemes . Such use should be encouraged to facilitate more start -ups and smaller businesses to work together with public administration at all levels . Around this topic , t he EC has recently published a study 83on the uptake of emerging technologies in public procurement , which pres ented potential use -cases for AI in public procurement , set up an online repository of projects and gave recommendations for the next steps . A major impulse to Innovation procurement was given by the modernised EU framework ( based on the Directives 2014/23 /EU , 2014/24/EU and 2014/25/EU ) , which introduced or reinforced the possibility of using a negotiated procedure for the adaptation of existing or readily available solutions of particularly complex nature , and/or the technical specifications of which canno t be established with sufficient precision . In these circumstances , the competitive procedure with negotiation or the competitive dialogue can be used . Alternatively , if the market does not offer a satisfactory solution or an adaptation of existing solutio ns is unlikely to meet the needs of the public buyer , R & D services can be procured to develop a tailor -made innovative solution and/or a set of detailed technical specifications to enable t raditional procurement of the respective products , services or processes . That is the case where an innovation partnership or a pre-commercial procurement procedure 84can be initiated . 80 Available at https : //www.aiforhumanity.fr/pdfs/MissionVillani_Report_ENG -VF.pdf 81 See https : //publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld201719/ldselect/ldai/10 0/100.pdf 82 See https : //www.ai4belgium.be/wp -content/uploads/2019/04/report_en.pdf 83 See https : //ec.europa.eu/growth/single -market/public -procurement/digital/emerging -technologies_en 84 See project example AI4CITIES pre -commercial procurement of 6 cities ( https : //ai4cities.eu/ ) 52 Whatever the approach chosen , the essence of Innovation procurement is to introduce elements of formal negotiation between the buyer and t he supplier ( s ) , before , rather than after , the materialisation of an offer and the award of the same ( usually according to the MEAT principle ) . This together with the fact that obviously a solution being purchased in this way is relatively far from the mar ket and/or generically or partially described by the available technical specifications , makes Innovation Procurement the preferred or recommended way of purchasing AI in government . Thanks to such negotiation , the public buyer can , to a great extent , transfer most of the AI implementation risks from the delivery ( or contractual ) to the bidding ( or pre -contractual ) phase . In other words , rather than first selecting the supplier and the solution based on precarious elements of evaluation , and then jointly undertaking the definition of the technological , organisational , and service level configuration of the post-implementation scenario , multiple solution options and the respective suppliers can be made to compete with one another , based on their capacity to fulfil the stated objectives for the AI initiative in full . There are of course differences between the various Innovation procurement procedures in terms of scope and purpose of the negotiation ( s ) they admit . For example , in the competitive procedure wit h negotiation , the public buyer has a more precise idea than in the competitive dialogue of the nature and characteristics of the solution envisaged . Or in the innovation partnership the negotiation is made before making a price for the entire set of R & D a ctivities and the delivery of a full blown solution , while in pre -commercial procurement a stepwise process is followed , never ending with a final purchase of a commercial result but anyway leading to the definition of multiple viable configurations of the same target product or service . In any case , the conclusion is that all these Innovation procurement procedures , if properly carried out , go well beyond the known advantages – widely explored by both literature and practice – in terms of “ smart purchasing ” in and by government bodies and agencies . With specific reference to AI , they can enable a more prudent and reflective approach to implementation , which promises to overcome or at least reduce the likelihood of some of the challenge s outlined in Section 4 in relation to the experimental nature of those solutions . Unfortunately , and with a bit of paradox , not the same attention has been spent so far on the way governments might allocate their financial resources to buy AI soluti ons according to Innovative Procurement rules – in the EU countries , the 2014 procurement directives and the national legislation transposing them – than on the likely impacts of AI on the public procurement processes . Two partial exceptions are : — The UK Cabinet Office ’ s Guidelines for AI Procurement85 , issued on 8 June 2020 , and — City of Amsterdam ’ s contract clauses for procuring T rustworthy AI , and — The WEF - World Economic Forum ’ s - AI Procurement in a Box toolset , also released in the same month86 . Furthermo re , the reference to public procurement ( of innovative , but also tradit ional goods and services ) as a valuable engine for AI to become more widespread is present the White Paper on Artificial Intelligence with the action 6 about the “ Adopt AI Programme ” ( European Commission , 2020e ) and in most policy orientation papers , including from the OECD ( Berryhill , Heang , Clogher , & McBride , 2019 ) , the World Economic Forum , CEPS ( Renda , 2019 ) , and PWC for the European Commission ( forthcoming ) 87 . However , if we look at the issue in perspective , it would be highly beneficial for a variety of reasons to pursue a joint promotion initiative at EU level of both Innovation Procurement and AI in the Public Sector , highlighting the reciprocal benefits and particularly the extra degrees of f reedom allowed by a correct use of the former in a view to appropriately implementing the latter . Part of this initiative should certainly be the sharing of existing good practice s on AI purchasing from e.g . the already identified ( from the AI Watch team ) case studies , if not a wide capacity building programme – 85 https : //www.gov.uk/governmen t/publications/guidelines -for-ai-procurement/guidelines -for-ai-procurement 86 https : //www.weforum.org/reports/ai -procurement -in-a-box 87 Source : https : //ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/benchmarking -national -innovation -procurement -investments -and-policy frameworks -acros s-europe 53 concerted with the Member States – to increase and diffuse the competencies and capacities of “ smart AI purchasing ” within the EU national , regional and local public sector bodies and agencies . Finally , and as a derivative , we might envisage the creation of a freely available collection of technical tools and maybe templates of tender and negotiation documents , as for example of Amsterdam , turned into a guidance document ( re -usable ) has been alread y being standardised across the Netherlands , to facilitate the implementation of AI solutions under controlled conditions . However , a similar booklet to the UK and WEF examples provided above would already be a ( non -minimalistic ) start of the process . With the above , we have exhausted our proposed shortlist of three instantiations of the concept of “ European AI policy exceptionalism ” . Now the time to move to the end of this short journey . 54 6 Conclusion and way forward This Section is composed of three concept ual blocks . Paragraph 6.1 proposes to create the conditions for establish ing a more advanced equilibrium between AI promotion and regulation , to go beyond the predominantly experimental nature of many observed cases , which can o nly be considered technological and organisational singularities . Paragraph 6.2 focuses on the ethical dimension of AI and the possibility for government bodies and agencies to conceive and become “ first testers ” of trustworthy AI principle s. Paragraph 6.3 concludes with a summary of the key arguments made throughout the report and relates them to the upcoming work in AI Watch for the Public Sector activities during the year 2021 . 6.1 Governing with AI in the Public Sector During the Covid19 pandemic , interest in AI has not lessened . In particular , as shown in a recent JRC publication ( De Nigris et al. , 2020 ) its great potential was acknowledged to assist clinical research , ensure better compliance with quarantine obligations and contact tracing requirements , measure and predict mobility behaviours and virus diffusion t rends . Moreover , due to the restrictions accompanying the lockdown , AI has been regarded as a key technolog y to tackl e and cop e with the associated changes in work , study and life practices ( Naudé , 2020 ) as well as to tackle environmental challenges ( monitor , react , pr edict ) The enthusiasm on harnessing the benefits provided by a responsible and trustworthy use of AI has therefore stayed very high on the policy and media agenda . Some countries , like Estonia , had committed to introducing at least 50 working AI applications in the Public Sector by the end of 2020 ( Government of the Republic of Estonia , 2019 ) , which has been successful ly achieved . First , AI reposi tories have been introduced in some EU cities . This highlight the extremely important role of transparency when approaching AI . The obscurity of algorithms is something that public administrations have to take into account , not only for their internal ethi cal judgments but also for clarify ing to citizens and firms how the algorithm is used and why and to what extend the algorithm is trustable . For this , publicly available repositories , inventories or registers of AI in use at public administrations is a nec essary starting point for providing transparency , explanations and trust in the use of AI in government . Second , the possible role of Digital Innovation Hubs has been considered to bring together various actors , share knowledge and best practices . This is fostering the systemic approach on AI where different competences should be brought together for the appropriation of an AI solution by public administrations , by bringing the local AI ecosystem together and sharing best practices in both developing and a pplying AI within the organisation . Covid19 has also interfered – negatively this time – with the pace of development of some of the cases from EU ( MS and AS ) national , regional and local government presented in July 2020 by the AI Watch for the Public Sector initiative ( Misuraca and van Noordt , 2020 ) . With the focus now being narrowed down on the most inspiring ones , which are further explor ed through an online survey88 and specific interviews with the case owners , a preliminary conclusion is that not only the AI technologies , but also their uses are rather diverse and the respective maturity levels , geogra phic quite heterogeneous . Finally , th e geographical spread and thematic scope of reported cases were indeed wide , but also unevenly distributed across Member States , government functions , and tiers of public administration . Apart from the obvious limits of representation of this quantitative analysis , a comparison with the US and China points at a lower level of integration of the various systems and applications , and therefore a less pronounced capability to quickly scale up . However , the situation in terms of AI take -up rates and diffusion of consolidated technologies doesn ’ t seem much different from Europe , particularly looking at local public administration and the smallest sized bodies and agencies . What is really worrisome is the fragmentation of the EU single market for GovTech solution s in general and AI -enabled specifically , which is more prominent than in the other countries and should be overcome by a supplement of policy coordination among the key European stakeholders . 88 https : //ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/IA -of-AI-public -sector 55 Such coordination should operate at three distinct , “ ecosystemi c ” levels : European , national /regional and organisational . — At the European level ( i.e . the predominant space of coordination between the European Commission and the Member States ) the aggregation of existing experiences and good practice examples should b e oriented at creat ing the next generation of AI enabled public services and processes - inspired by value creation and human centricity principles - the technological roots of which could be made common , and the respective instantiations interoperable by default ; thus , turning the limited technology maturity of AI and the correlated need for experimentation , from a barrier into an opportunity for the accelerated digital transformation of the entire EU government . — At the national /regional level ( i.e . the Member State area of legal and jurisdictional competence , but also recommended cooperation between Member and Associated States , as stipulated by the Coordinated Plan on AI ) shared resources and collaboration spaces should be established - including e.g . leg al and administrative sandboxes , data repositories , etc . - to promote the instantiation of processes of reuse and scaling ( up/out/deep ) of individual take-up cases recognised as excellent or simply replicable with the needed adjustments , in other national or multi -national Public Sector environments . — At the organisational level i.e . ( where punctual or singular AI solutions are adopted and implemented in the specific Public Sector environments ) the generation of new success stories in digital transformatio n of existing public services or p rocesses should be enhanced by appropriate public procurement guidelines , capacity building and training initiatives89 of Public Sector staff , data literacy programmes for adults and students , reforms of administrative and legal instruments , etc . With more and more government bodies and agencies utilising AI , or planning to do so , the issue of financially supporting Public Sector demand is also very relevant . Compar ed with the EU with the US government budget allocations to ICT R & D – which AI experimentation or innovation is part of – Europe needs to regain order of magnitude in terms of PPS ( Purchasing Power Standard90 ) expenditure . Just to give three examples : — The European Commission ’ s reported investment on AI in the ( stil l ongoing , in terms of funded projects ) Horizon 2020 programme for R & D and innovation has been in the range of €1,5 billion having the entire economy as the target91 , thus including , though not being limited to , public administration as an application field . — Further to that , the new Digital Europe Programme ( DEP ) which aims to build a diffused infrastructural and knowledge capacity for AI in Europe , complementing other EU programmes such as Horizon Europe for research and innovation and the Connecting Europe Facility for digital infrastructure , originally proposed a budget of €2,2 billion92 – still waiting for a final definition in the approved Multiannual Financial Framework 2021 -2027 – for opening up the use of AI in both the private and the public sectors . — Finally , Artificial Intelligence and Human Machine Interfaces are already in the scope of a Thematic Smart Specialisation Platform co-led by the Emilia -Romagna Region and the National government of Slovenia since May 201893 . Although the scope of the S3 Platform seems currently limited to promoting the deployment of a few demonstrative cases in the AI field , it seems reasonable to predict that such partnership will grow up and consolidate even further in the new programming period 2021 -2027 , including a possible extension to government case studies94 . 89 DT4REGIONS will develop training material and MOOC to help regions implement AI . 90 https : // ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics -explained/index.php ? title=Glossary : Purchasing_power_standard_ ( PPS ) 91 https : //ec.europa.eu/info/research -and-innovation/research -area/industrial -research -and-innovation/key -enabling -technologies/artificial intelligence -ai_en 92 https : //ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/europe -investing -digital -digital -europe -programme 93https : //s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ en-US/w/interregional -partnership -for-smart -specialisation -on-artificial -intelligence -and-human machine -interface 94 Curren tly it includes 2 Member States and 10 NUTS -2 Regions , namely : Emilia -Romagna and Autonomous Province of Trento ( IT ) , Slovenia ( SI ) , Baden -Württemberg ( DE ) , Navarra ( ES ) , North -Brabant and East Netherlands ( NL ) , Salzburg ( AT ) , Hungary ( HU ) , Provence -Alpes -Cote d'Azur and Auvergne -Rhone -Alpes ( FR ) , Örebro -lan ( SE ) . 56 Thus , in their mul tiple roles of early adopters , promoters and facilitators , not only rule setters and supervisors , EU governments at all levels and in all Member States , regions and cities can do a lot to make AI Innovation far more widely impactful than a technological or organisational singularity . Having in mind the conspicuous heterogeneity of the EU national strategies for AI established until now , it is probably important to reach a broader consensus on a set of common actions that could be conferred to the EU regulat ory or soft coordinating level , in order to promote a more harmonised approach to AI implementation in public administration , cutting across the country differences and valorising the peculiar aspects of the Public Sector as a whole . Conversely , innovation policies of Member States and Regions should not stay focused on stimulating the deployment of AI per se , without considering that such technologies may not be the answer for each and every issue related to service improvement or transformation . However , there have been important achieve ments that could be regarded as crucial to ensure that the challenges of Public Sector digitalization are being overcome , and that could serve as inspiration to use AI sustainably and durably . To help systematize the curr ent scenario analysis and point at credible directions for improvement , another , ongoing activity of AI Watch will be a collection of policy recommendations taking the shape of a n EU-wide roadmap for securing the transition to AI enabled and digitally tran sformed government . 6.2 On governing AI in the Public Sector Governing AI is as relevant as a policy issue as using it for government or governance related purposes . Especially in the EU , this issue has been answered in terms of an ethical approach to the deve lopment and deployment of such technologies in operating environments . The High -Level Expert Group on AI published a set of 7 key requirements in order to ensure that AI is trustworthy ( High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence ( HLEG ) , 2019 ) . Through the Assessment List for Trustworthy AI ( ALTAI ) 95 , developers and deployers of AI can assess by themselves whether their solution s are in line with these principles ( High -Level Expert Group on AI ( HLEG ) , 2020 ) . The assessment list is intended for use by a multidisciplinary team of people , each having specific competen cies on the various requirements . It is expected that by following the Assessment List , organizations implementing new AI systems or applications can identify associated risks and consequently act to minimize or even avoid th em . The Assessment List is made with flexibility in mind and encourages organizations to further develop the guidelines to fit into their specific sector as well . Such guidelines and requirements are also key to include within AI Procurement procedures , as key risks of AI could be mitig ated already at the start , during and following the completion of procurement processes . A related , though not completely clear concept is Ethical AI . Great progress has been recently made in igniting a worldwide debate on this topic , although the various stakeholders have slightly different interpretations of it . AlgorithmWatch keeps an inventory of all published AI ethical guidelines , which is currently including more than 160 different publications from all over the world ( AlgorithmWatch , 2020b ) . Previous research had analyse d 84 ethical AI documents published by various business es , NGOs and ( international ) governmental organizations , highlight ing that some principles such as tra nsparency , fairness , justice , and responsibility were quite common in all . However , not a single one of th ose principles was found in all of the scrutinised documents ( Jobin , Ienca , & Vayena , 2019 ) . Despite this , many governments worldwide have issued policy documents highlighting the n eed for ethical AI ( European Parliamentary Research Service ( EPRS ) , Scientific Foresight Unit ( STOA ) , 20 20 ) . This is also the case of most national strategies of EU countries monitored by the AI Watch initiative and has been highlighted by the recent “ Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence ( Artificial Intelligence Act ) ” 96 . The development and deployment of ethical AI applications could involve governance challenges in the Public Sector . These are made more serious by the commitment of public administration to be accountable , not only for its decisions and decision -making mechanisms but also for the – anticipated or unwanted – societal implications of moving from the realm of AI experimentation to the permanent embedment of AI solutions in 95 https : //futurium.ec.europa.eu/en/european -ai-alliance/pages/altai -assessment -list-trustworthy -artificial -intelligence 96 https : //digital -strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal -regulation -european -approach -artificial -intelligence 57 processes and services . This poses the question of whether more concrete and ope rationalised ethical AI guidelines could be proposed and tested first within a public administration environment , for example within “ regulatory sandboxes ” 97 and with AI Testing and Experimentation Facilities . Such a question is not easy to answer . For exam ple , self-attributed guidelines could possibly be designed by an external panel of experts ( such as the HLEG on AI ) and then be used by government bodies and agencies in relation to the service to be delivered . An alternative option would be to rely on som e of the ( even too many ) templates and blueprints that can be retrieved in the state of the art . There are also ongoing standard setting efforts , for example at IEEE , which are reported about by ( European Parliamentary Research Service ( EPRS ) , Scientific Foresight Unit ( STOA ) , 2020 ) . However , we think it is more likely that in different countries and layers of public administration ( e.g . cities or regions ) the preference would go towards developing their own guidelines rather than using those made available by other Public Sector organisations . In which case , apart from the issue of finding adequate resource s to support the activity , the risk of proliferation of approaches and interpretations would still become apparent . Moreover , this does not assure that involved staff would understand and operationalize these guidelines in an intended way . Therefore , it is crucial for governments to anticipate how guidelines will be worked with and whether the users of those guidelines have the appropriate expertise and capacity to apply them . For example , Digital Innovation Hubs should be able to support public administrat ions with procurement and be multipliers of useful templates and processes . This echoes the discourse made in this report on the crucial importance of specific training and cultural transformation of civil servants involved in AI development and deployment . 6.3 Main insights from the report towards an analytical framework for evaluating AI impact in government To conclude , Figure 6 summari zes and offers a visual representation of the key arguments made throughout this report . Those ar guments can be considered as the first attempt at an analytical framework for eva luating AI impact in government . Figure 6 . Analytical framework for AI impact assessment . Source : JRC , own elaboration . 97 https : //digital -strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal -regulation -european -approach -artificial -intelligence 58 The four analytical dimension s of the framework include : design , adoption , implementation and use of AI solutions in the Public Sector . Let ’ s now comment on them in turn : — During the design phase , a key contextual element to borrow is the need for explainable AI . This has been already discussed in Paragraph 5.3 as well as in the previous one . The main potential benefit , also self reinforcing in case the feedback loop acts in the right direction , can be grasped in terms of accountability for th e government body or agency engaged in this exercise . There can be other relevant aspects of course , but the idea is to focus on the most important ones . Note that the discourse previously made on AI can be fully recovered here . Finally , a testable implica tion is that whenever explainable AI is given emphasis to , the level of accountability ( however measured ) increases , both within the same and between different public sector organisations . — During the adoptio n phase , the principles of trustworthy AI find ap propriate room . Indeed , this is the locus of experimentation , where technology is tested and evaluated for potential use . Again , some of the arguments made in paragraph 6.3 – especially on the importance of co -design together wi th end users and stakeholders – can and should be referred to here . A testable implication can be that the more services are co-created , the better their “ smart ” alignment with Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence ( ALTAI ) 98 requirements – where smart means that the benefits would largely outnumber the critical aspect s of ethical compliance . — During the implementation phase , as it is known from the definition and analysis provided in Section 2 , the main expectatio n is to permanently embed the AI innovation into the involved government body ’ s or agency ’ s business practice . Therefore , a strong recommendation coming from the external context is to make this innovation user centric , as far as the associated digital pub lic services are concerned . In so doing , the chances of transforming the “ business of government ” in a visibly durable and sustainable fashion should probably be enhanced . This can also be the testable implication of this feedback loop : the more user centr ic is the AI enabled services while in operation , the more pervasive and radical will be the transformation of government practice . — During the use phase , citizens and businesses enjoy the benefits and suffer from the criticalities of AI enabled public proc esses and services . Here the known concept of co-production should be made applicable so that beneficiaries are actively and seamlessly engaged in co -delivering ( and perhaps , also co -evaluating ) the promise of government transformation . This is expect ed to contribute to legitimising public administration in the eyes of its reference stakeholders and therefore enhance the level s of confidence and trust within the constituency . Based on the currently too immature stage of most AI applications in the state of the art , it is doubt ful that sufficient empirical evidence exists to support this testable implication . However , this stream of field research would also contribute to answering the broader question of whether AI innovation improves or undermines governmen t ’ s democratic legitimacy . How the future of AI -enabled innovation in government is going to look like depends in our opinion largely on the four analytical dimensions outlined above , and if the related feedback loops are reinforced and in which direction ( i.e . as “ virtuous ” or “ vicious ” cycles ) in the coming years . In fact , history tells us that the Public Sector ’ s digital transformation has not proceeded as linear ly or predictabl y as it is often mentioned , but in a more complex and full of ups and downs way , depending on a variety of contingent factors ( Barcevičius et al. , 2019 ) . In this situation , what we propose to do in the future analysis is to start with this analytical framework and to integrate it with the known definition of AI , which also the White Paper has made its own ( see European Commission , 2020e , p. 2 ) , with the following simple , yet clear -cut statement : AI is not only about algorithms , data and computing power , but also about people . Therefore , its implementation may n ever be completely successful is only done “ for ” the people , but needs to be done together “ with ” them . This attitude will probably help break the ultimate barrier preventing the inclusion of governm ent in the range of the downstream industries affected by the concurrent adoption and widespread implementation of AI as a General Purpose Technology , driven by the convergent attitude of multiple actors – both public and private – who use it as an input t o enhance the performance ( however defined , but without excluding ethical and societal compliance ) of the respective application environments . 98 https : //digital -strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/assessment -list-trustworthy -artificial -intelligence -altai-self-assessment 59 Based on the results illustrated in this report , f uture work will be dedicated to use the analytical framework conclusions in the development of a generic implementation Roadmap for the use of AI in the Public Sector and to increase a diffused human -centric and value -creation oriented AI deployment in the European Public Sector and may possibly serve as a concrete in put to the Better Regulation package99 . 99 https : //ec.europa.eu/info/law/law -making -process/planning -and-proposing -law/better -regulation -why-and-how_en 60 List of abbreviations AI Artificial Intelligence AIA Algorithmic Impact Assessment API Application Programming Interface AS Associated State ( s ) BDVA Big Data Value Association COFOG Classification Of the Functio ns Of Government EEA European Economic Area EU European Union GBARD Government Budget Allocation for R & D GDP Gross Domestic Product GDPR General Data Protection Regulation GovTech Government Technology GSA General Services Administration HLEG High Level Expert Group ICT Information and Communication Technology IoT Internet of Things JRC Joint Research Centre MEAT Most Economically Advantageous Tender MS Member State ( s ) NACE Nomenclature statistique des Activités économiques dans la Communauté Européenne OECD Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OGDPI Open Government Data Portal Index PCP Pre-Commercial Procurement POINT Projecting Opportunities for INdustrial Transitions PPI Public Procurement of Innovation PPS Purchasing Power Standard ( s ) PSI Public Sector Information 61 Q & A Questions and Answers R & D Research and Development RFI Request For Information RRF Recovery and Resilience Facility S3 Smart Specialisation Strategy SDGs Sustainable Development Goals TED Tenders Electronic Daily TRL Technology Readiness Level UN United Nations WEF World Economic Forum XAI eXplainable Artificial Intelligence 62 List of figures Figure 1 .
