Advances in computing and network capabilities bring substantial benefits in efficiency , convenience , and perform ance for individuals , organizations , and society . Applications , services , and infrastructure depend on the reliability and security of these systems . What allows society to reap the benefits of computing and interconnectivity also opens the digital ecosy stem to potential adverse consequences . These can result from unanticipated events and interactions , or deliberate attacks , with consequences that range from inconvenient to devastating . The significance of these consequences raises the stakes for the secu rity of computing and network systems . The following set of principles is intended to elaborate essential qualities for secure computational environments , based on sound scientific and technical foundations . While the complexity and rapid evolution of co mputational environments – including infrastructures , devices , applications , and information – will continue to present new and unanticipated challenges , these broad principles provide a strong basis for security . 1 . Trustworthiness : Computing and network s ystems should be worthy of trust . Trustworthiness entails the safety , security , reliability , dependability , performance , and survivability of the system . 2 . Integrity : Technical , physical , and administrative mechanisms should be available to protect against information manipulation that alters or masks the intended use . 3 . Confidentiality : Technical , physical , and administrative mechanisms should be available to safeguard access to and distribution of protected information . Access to protected information shoul d be limited to authorized entities and users . 4 . Availability : Technical , physical , and administrative mechanisms should be available to ensure that information and resources are usable and accessible to authorized entities and users . 5 . Manageability : Computi ng and network systems should be responsive to configuration and patching by intended users without impacting functionality , safety , or security . 6 . Transparency : Device , software , and service vendors are encouraged to disclose to their consumers the informat ion needed to effectively manage personal , organizational , and societal risks . 7 . Accountability : Entities should be held accountable for the information they manage and process and for providing appropriate security protections for that information . 2 8 . Holism : A layered approach to the ubiquitous computing and network infrastructure should address systems architecture , hardware , operating systems , communications and application software , and other components that comprise user environments . 9 . Requirements based : Establishment of an explicit statement of goals , derivative requirements , and the processes needed to fulfill them is critical to security planning and operation . Ongoing risk management programs that identify risks , and assess and respond to system vulne rabilities using accepted and known frameworks and standards , are essential building blocks of secure systems .
