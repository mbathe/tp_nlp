America ( Español ) Blogs Ethics : a vital part of responsible AI deployment April 13 , 2021 Steve Harris , Digital Transformation Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is considered by many to be one of the great transformative technologies of all time . It 's already present in virtual assistants , chatbots , risk assessments , network operations and more . Future possibilities are both huge and cause for potential concern . AI systems could one day drive us around , do our laundry , paint portraits , monitor cities for safety and security and even fight wars . But should they ? AI describes the processing abilities that mirror cognitive functions associated with humans . This typically involves learning , language comprehension , sensory capabilities , analysis , decision making and problem solving . Our reasons for pursuing AI include improving efficiency , driving down costs and accelerating research and development . According to IDC , worldwide business spending on AI was expected to reach $ 50 billion in 2020 and exceed $ 110 billion in 2024 . IDC found that retail and financial services were the biggest current investors in AI tools but expects media and the public sector to be the largest spenders by 2023 . IDC posits that AI will be `` the disrupting influence changing entire industries over the next decade . '' As with so many digital tools in the past couple of decades , the technology has developed at a much faster rate than the legislation to regulate it . Governments have very little oversight of AI , allowing private companies to use AI for determinations about people 's health and medicine , credit ratings , employment and even criminal justice with little to no state supervision . In 2020 , the Black Lives Matter protests in the U.S. prompted Microsoft , Amazon and IBM to announce that they would no longer give police departments access to their facial recognition technology . The tech companies cited concerns that AI is still prone to errors in recognizing people of color as unfair discrimination . Concerns cover three core areas There are three primary areas where AI ethical concerns occur , according to political philosopher Michael Sandel , Professor of Government at Harvard University . These are privacy and surveillance , bias and discrimination , and the role of human judgment . `` Debates about privacy safeguards and about how to overcome bias in algorithmic decision-making in sentencing , parole and employment practices are now familiar , but are certain elements of human judgment indispensable in deciding some of the most important things in life ? '' says Sandel . What is an appropriate response to these challenges for technology companies ? How do you ensure there are not structural biases or discrimination built into these systems ? There needs to be a discussion that is much broader than just the functional capabilities of AI . It needs to address the ethics of how and where AI is used from a human perspective . It is important to acknowledge that regulation or oversight must encompass the whole value chain : you ca n't regulate companies and not governments , or some users and not others . To be ethical means to cover every instance and usage of AI . From vendors developing the technology to governments and enterprises deploying it to consumers and citizens affected by it . Take steps to create an ethical AI policy The more AI takes a bigger role in decision making , the more ethical concerns are likely to arise . It 's a snowball effect . According to Benjamin Hertzberg , Chief Data and Analytics Officer Research Team at Gartner , `` Public concerns about AI dangers are warranted . An external AI ethics board can help embed representation , transparency and accountability into AI development decisions . '' If governments are struggling to keep pace with AI advances , then industry self-regulation could be a solution . Gartner has proposed that an external AI ethics board should be based around three key learnings : representation , transparency and accountability . AI ethics boards need to be entirely transparent and have all the information necessary to make informed recommendations on developing AI projects . In addition , when they make recommendations , stakeholders need to respond to them promptly and publicly . This highlights that your organization or initiative is committed and accountable when it comes to AI . The process must be absolutely independent , whether setting standards , measuring compliance or potentially punishing transgressors . Responsibility also comes from within While external AI boards are a useful step , they are not all that can or should be done . AI must be developed ethically and responsibly , and stakeholders and project owners can commit to other approaches to achieve that . Honesty also counts : it is OK to admit that ethical AI is a hugely complicated task and that you might need help to ensure your organization gets it right . In France , Orange Group works with Impact AI , an organization that pulls together stakeholders from private companies , public entities , research institutes and educational partners . It addresses two core AI objectives : ethical and social challenges and innovative projects for tomorrow 's world . Orange also participates in several forums and think tanks working along similar lines , including Digital Society Forum , Impact AI , and Global Network Initiative ( GNI ) . Furthermore , Orange recently became the first company to be awarded the GEEIS-IA label , recognizing its commitment to non-discriminatory HR processes and promoting diversity in AI professions . AI can be the future but must be ethical There is a significant trust factor inherent to the future of AI . Citizens are trusting governments to use AI responsibly , and consumers are trusting corporations to use AI ethically . If we do not start on a path that builds AI ethically , the implications further along the journey will grow exponentially . If data is biased to begin with , errors will be compounded down the road as algorithms go on learning from initially flawed data . Companies and governments must take an ethical approach to AI if the world is to reap its benefits fully . Orange recently created a data and AI ethics council , comprising 11 independent experts , which will develop ethics guidelines for the responsible use of data and AI at Orange and monitor its implementation within the Group 's entities .
