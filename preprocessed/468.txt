storage decentralised swiss ser vers used information exchanged via secure connection processes specially certified points patients easily make health data available research wish page orientation toward autonomy means giving users sufficient informational selfdetermination recommendations provide customers highly usable tools making consent decisions data usage purpose develop intuitively plausible necessary forms informed consent allow users adapt revoke consent later circumstances allow enable granular preferences regarding pur pose data processing enabling customers release certain data research contexts example different levels consent web platform delivers information medical research specific pathologies social networking opportunities services patient groups collects analyses commercialises user data also uses personalised recommendations key platform functionality attractiveness business model platform make anonymised personal patient data available pharmaceutical companies recruiting patients trials new drugs partner industry university researchers behavioural research attitudes towards therapies end company provides different levels consent patients consent data used recommendations without data shared industry users review consent sharing preferences time information easily reached patient dashboard users decide stop sharing data industry time previously shared anonymised data withdrawn personal data locked moment consent electronically revoked page open data new business models large transport service provider decides make data collects avai lable third parties secondary use free charge dable form open data aim support creative market participants developing new attractive information service offerings hoped promote new

restrictions appropriate use data companies use information provide information need assess data origins restrictions use page transparency requires ensuring informed consent achieved simplest clearest accessible way possible recommendations find simple ways explain data collect privacy policy use customer data purpose results expect use summarie ways explain key points terms con ditions work companies create new standards readable derstandable terms conditions example photographer photographer offers special event personal photo shoots along various options purchasing resulting images general terms conditions gtc stipulate photos made available customers digitally via external online service provider customers load photographer keep photos one year order processed customers may reorder prints also right use photos advertising purposes specific website posters copyright remains photographer customer would like receive information general terms conditions photogra pher respond request follows otographer delivers gtc customer contract concluded summarises purposes data used promises use data purposes otographer informs customer delete photo graphs order completed customer wishes place another order prints explicitly asks customer whether may use photographs advertising purposes finally photographer ensures external online service provider adheres rules regarding handling data particular using data purpose informs customer accordingly page accountability recommendations designed ensure use data collected third parties responsible manner recommendations product depends data companies make sure data collected ethical manner use data untrusted sources acquire data partners transparent data collec tion practices restrictions associated use data example monetisation social network data pharmaceutical company considers buying data web platform providing social networking opportunities patient groups pharmaceutical company obtains information data collection practi ces web platform data obtained way purpose data collection link industry including monetisation data transparently openly communicated user pharmaceutical company acquire data platform use services page data storage management basic ethical orientations harm avoidance recommendations harm avoidance step intended help ensure damage done stored data recommendations implement appropriate cyber security measures apply consistently across forms data storage develop contingency plans minimize extent damage event data breach define rules deletion data aim reducing risk damage unauthorized access example health data cloud health data analytics company develops customised data collection analytics tools large hospitals company provides hospitals cloud ser vice host data allowing hospitals focus patient care outcome improvement order guarantee hospital necessary cyber security data analytics company implements highest standards cyber secu rity commits strict compliance standards hospitals data accessible select employees software company using authentication employees trained recognise social engineering attacks page data storage management justice justice requires enabling customers use data benefit third parties common good recommendations support customers effectively using right data portability enable customers easily receive use data provided anonymised applications example data donation company collects processes customers personal data order provide services wants make easier customers donate data wish valuable purposes example research projects public administration projects reusing data company also wants contribute digital sustainability following measures could useful setting information management system company platform allows company customers manage personal data themsel ves includes particular option download lected data form export systems establishing technical interface information management sys tems data escrow platforms company clients make personal data directly available service providers page recommendations related autonomy intended ensure data storage management pose risks privacy customers
