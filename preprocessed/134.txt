AI has become an area of strategic importance with potential to be a key driver of economic development . AI also has a wide range of potential social implications . As part of its Digital Single Marke t Strategy , the European Commission put forward in April 2018 a European strategy on AI in its Communication `` Artificial Intelligence for Europe '' COM ( 2018 ) 237 . The aims of the European AI strategy announced in the communication are : ● To boost the EU 's techn ological and industrial capacity and AI uptake across the economy , both by the private and public sectors ● To prepare for socio -economic changes brought about by AI ● To ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework . Subsequently , in December 2018 , the E uropean Commission and the Member States published a “ Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence ” , COM ( 2018 ) 795 , on the development of AI in the EU . The Coordinated Plan mentions the role of AI Watch to monitor its implementation . AI Watch monitors Europe an Union ’ s industrial , technological and research capacity in AI ; AI -related policy initiatives in the Member States ; uptake and technical developments of AI ; and AI impact . AI Watch has a European focus within the global landscape . In the context of AI Wa tch , the Commission works in coordination with Member States . AI Watch results and analyses are published on the AI Watch Portal ( https : //ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch_en ) . From AI Watch in -depth analyses we will be able to understand better European Union ’ s areas of strength and areas where investment is needed . AI Watch will provide an independent assessment of the impacts and benefits of AI on growth , jobs , education , and society . AI Watch is developed by the Joint Research Centre ( JRC ) of the European Commission in collaboration with the Directorate ‑General for Communications Networks , Content and Technology ( DG CONNECT ) . This report addresses the following objectives of AI Watch : Developing an overview and analysis of the European AI ecosystem . 2 Acknowledgements The following researchers constitute the panel of experts that provided valuable comments and useful critiques for this work ( in alphabetical order ) : Virginia Dignum ( Umeå University and High Level Expert Group on AI ) , Anders Jonsson ( Universitat Pompeu Fabra ) , Henrik Junklewitz ( Joint Research Centre 's Cyber & Digital Citizens ' Security Unit ) , Ramón López de Mántaras ( Artificial Intelligence Research Institute ( IIIA -CSIC ) ) , José Orallo ( Valencian Research Institute for Artificial Intelligence ( Universitat Politècnica de València ) ) , Ignacio Sánchez ( Joint Research Centre 's Cyber & Digital Citizens ' Security Unit ) .

The definition , which will be used as a basis for the AI Watch monitoring activity , is established by means of a flexible scientific methodology that allows regular revision . The operational definition is constituted by a concise taxonomy and a list of keywords that characteris e the core domains of the AI research field , and transversal topics such as applications of the former or ethical and philosophical considerations , in line with the wider monitoring objective of AI Watch . The AI taxonomy is designed to inform the AI landsc ape analysis and will expectedly detect AI applications in neighbour technological domains such as robotics ( in a broader sense ) , neuroscience or internet of things . The starting point to develop the operational definition is the definition of AI adopted b y the High Level Expert Group on artificial intelligence . To derive this operational definition we have followed a mixed methodology . On one hand , we apply natural language processing methods to a large set of AI literature . On the other hand , we carry out a qualitative analysis on 5 5 key documents including artificial intelligence definitions from three complementary perspectives : policy , research and industry . A valuable contribution of this work is the collection of definitions developed between 1955 an d 2019 , and the summarisation of the main features of the concept of artificial intelligence as reflected in the relevant literature . 4 Executive summary This report proposes a taxonomy for artificial intelligence ( AI ) and a list of related keywords , as an o perational definition for AI in the framework of the AI Watch , the Commission ’ s knowledge service to monitor the development , uptake and impact of artificial intelligence for Europe . AI Watch aims to monitor the industrial , technological and research capac ity , as well as policy initiatives in the Member States , uptake and technical developments of AI and its impact . AI Watch has a European focus within the global landscape and covers all Member States . The established operational definition will be used as a basis for the AI Watch monitoring activity . The AI taxonomy will assist in the mapping of the AI landscape , and it is expected to detect AI applications in other technological domains such as robotics ( in a wider sense ) , big data , web technologies , high performance computing , embedded systems , internet of things , etc . The need to establish an operational definition proceeds from the absence of a mutually agreed definition and taxonomy of AI , which would impede the attainment of the wide monitoring objective of AI Watch . It is in this basis that we propose a multi -perspective analysis to structure the AI taxonomy . In particul ar we provide a unique taxonomy that represents and interconnects all the AI subdomains from political , research and industrial perspective . In this scope , the taxonomy reflects these perspectives and aims to cover the entire AI landscape , which consists o f economic agents with R & D or industrial AI activities . Moreover , c onsidering that AI is a dynamic field , we propose an iterative method that can be updated over time to capture the rapid AI evolution , and that provides a taxonomy and a set of keywords . Th e method consists of the following steps : ( i ) qualitative analysis of AI definitions and subdomains emanating from reports with academic , industrial and policy perspective s , ( ii ) selection of definition , identification of representative keywords in AI with a natural language processing method , and taxonomy formation , and ( iii ) taxonomy and keywords validation . In the first part of the method , the objective is to collect and analyse the existing definitions and identify the main subdomains covering all aspec ts in the AI field . In this scope , we conduct a qualitative analysis in a selected set of 29 AI policy and institutional reports ( including standardisation efforts , national strategies , and international organisations reports ) , 23 relevant research publica tions and 3 market reports , from the beginning of AI in 1955 until today . AI has been usually described in relation to human intelligence , or intelligence in general , with many definitions refer ring to machines that behave like humans or are capable of actions that require intelligence . Since human intelligence is also difficult to define and measure , and although there have been different attempts of quantification , the objective definition of something as subjective and abstract as intelligence , falsely g ives the impression of a precision that can not be obtained . As a consequence , most definitions found in research , policy or market reports are vague and propose an ideal target rather than a measurable research concept . The study of the definitions found i n literature leads us to identify four characteristics that are commonly mentioned in AI : i ) perception of the environment and realworld complexity , ii ) information processing : collecting and interpreting inputs , iii ) decision making , including reasoning , learning and taking actions ; and iv ) achievement of pre-defined goals . Taking into consideration these features , we consider the definition proposed by the HLEG on AI as the starting point in developing the opera tional definition in AI Watch : `` Artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems are software ( and possibly also hardwar e ) systems designed by humans that , given a complex goal , act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acqu isition , interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data , reasoning on the knowledge , or processing the information , derived from this data and deciding the best action ( s ) to take to achieve the given goal . AI systems can either use symbolic rul es or learn a numeric model , and they can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions . '' ( HLEG , 2019 ) . Although it may be considered highly technical for different audiences and objectives , it is a very comprehensive definition , which incorporates the aspects of perception , understanding , interpretation , interaction , decision making , adaptation to behaviour and achievement of goals , whereas other definitions do not address them in their entirety . Consider ing that the HLEG definition is comprehensive , hence highly technical and detailed , less specialised definitions can be adopted for studies of different objective , such as enterprise surveys . In this scope , the definitions provided by the EC JRC Flagship r eport on AI ( 2018 ) and the European AI Strategy ( COM ( 2018 ) 237 final ) , or the one to be used in the AI module of the Community survey on ICT usage and e -commerce in enterprises 2021 , are suitable alternatives . Regarding the AI subdomains , we found that des pite the multiple facets of AI , and consequently the lack of a common definition and taxonomy among research communities , literature or reports , there are a number of common topics in the definitions and taxonomies analysed for this study . In particular , in order to establish the taxonomy , in addition to the assessment of the aforementioned set of documents , we explored the information provided by the official publication of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial 5 Intelligence ( AAAI ) ( aitopics.org ) , and several top AI conferences . The proposed AI taxonomy , as a list of representative core and transversal AI domains and subdomains , will assist us to classify R & D and industrial agents and their activities . Therefore , it encompass es main theoretical AI scientific areas , and AI related non technological issues from industrial and R & D AI activities , as well as ethical and philosophical issues . It remains linked to the HLEG definition of AI in the context of AI Watch . The proposed taxon omy follows : AI taxonomy AI domain AI subdomain Core Reasoning Knowledge representation Automated reasoning Common sense reasoning Planning Planning and Scheduling Searching Optimisation Learning Machine learning Communication Natural language processing Perception Computer vision Audio processing Transversal Integration and Interaction Multi -agent systems Robotics and Automation Connected and Automated vehicles Services AI Services Ethics and Philosophy AI Ethics Philosophy of AI Source : Authors ' elaboration To complete the operational definition of AI , a list of keywords representative of the AI subdomains is established based on a part of the techno -economic segments ( TES ) analytical approach that will provide at a later stage an overview of the AI landscape worldwide . The keywords are used in text queries to identify activities and economic agents relevant to AI , for their further analysis . The list of keywords is the result of a multi -step process combining a semi -automatic text mining approach , desk research and domain experts ' involvement . More specifically , the top keywords from a vast collection of journals in AI are identified though text mining in the Scopus database in three different years , from which the most frequent author ’ s keywords per year are selected . Similarly , the industrial aspect is addressed by extracting keywords from firms ’ descriptio ns . Subsequently , the initial list of keywords is reviewed by AI experts and a short selection is made . A topic modelling is then performed , so as to detect the most representative topics and terms without the involvement of any expert that might induce un intentional bias . The initial list and the list resulting from the topic modelling step are merged and any redundancies are removed . External domain experts from several AI subdomains review the list and advise on synonyms that need to be grouped and on ta rgeting subdomains that may not be sufficiently captured by the initial sources . The taxonomy and list of keywords is then validated and finalised . Valuable contribution s of this work are : the collection of definitions developed between 1955 and 2019 ; the summarisation of the main features of the concept of artificial intelligence as reflected in the relevant literature ; and the development of a replicable process that can provide a dynamic definition and taxonomy of the AI . 6 1 Introduction AI has become a n area of strategic importance and been identified as a potential key driver of economic development as underlined in the European strategy on AI ( COM ( 2018 ) 237 on Artificial Intelligence for Europe ) and in the related Coordinated Plan ( COM ( 2018 ) 795 ) . Sim ilarly , AI has become a clear target for national governments resulting in the formulation of national AI strategies . AI Watch is the Commission knowledge service to monitor the development , uptake and impact of artificial intelligence ( AI ) for Europe , launched in December 2018 . It will monitor industrial , technological and research capacity , policy initiatives in the Member States , uptake and technical developments of AI and its impact . AI Watch has a European focus within the global landscape and covers a ll Member States . The aim of this document is to establish an operational definition of AI formed by a concise taxonomy and a set of keywords that characterise the core and transversal domains of AI . The operational definition is based on a concrete and inclusive definition of AI . Such a taxonomy and keywords will assist the mapping of the AI ecosystem of interrelated economic agents , and will allow to describe their technological areas of specialisation . Also , it will expectedly overlap with other technological domains such as robotics ( in a broader sense ) , big data , web technologies , high performance computing , embedded systems , internet of things , etc . The operational definition will be used as a basis for the monitoring activity and will serve as a reference for the other AI Watch outputs . This objective results from the need to monitor the implementation of the EC Coordinated Plan on AI on an annual basis , as reflected in the communication1 . This work has been organised in a three step strategy a s follows : — Review of existing definitions . We review AI definitions found in a selected set of 55 documents : 29 AI policy and institutional reports , 2 3 relevant research publications and 3 market reports , in order to incorporate academic , industrial and corporate perspectives . — Definition selection , taxonomy formation and representative keywords selection : We then adopt , based on this review , a general definition of AI and we complement this with a taxonomy and keywords that characterise the AI domain . The keywords are extracted based on automatic text analysis of a corpus of AI scientific references , firm -level databases , and industrial activity documents , complemented by desk research and domain experts ' involvement . — Definition and taxonomy validation : We validate our approach with a small number of AI experts . Since AI is a dynamic field , the described process is planned to be dynamic . This taxonomy and keywords building process will be reviewed and iterated in the future to capture the rapid evolution of AI . The rest of the report is organised as follows : section 2 presents the AI definition , together with its operationalisation in the form of a taxonomy and list of keywords , as well as a description of the process . section 3 provides detailed information about the 5 5 documents analysed , including the source , the text of the definition a nd AI subdomains -when available - , contextual information about the source and the document itself , and the date of publication . Finally , section 4 presents the conclusions drawn from this study . 1 Footnote 19 of the Annex : `` AI Watch developed by the Joint Research Centre will contribute to monitoring AI -related development and will provide a number of analyses necessary to support the implementation of the European AI initiative . Among others it will develop AI indexes addressing all dimensions relevant for policy making . Such information will be made available at the AI Watch portal https : //ec.europa . eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch_en `` . 7 2 Proposal for a common definition on Artificial i ntelligence To establish an operational AI definition to be adopted in AI Watch , composed by a taxonomy and representative keywords , we propose a 3 -layer approach that allows the dynamic update of all the aforementioned . This approach consists of the following layers : i. AI definition selection , ii . taxonomy formation with core and transversal AI subdomains , iii . pertinent keyword selection for each subdomain of the taxonomy . In this scope , we consider 55 documents that address the AI domain from different perspectives , acknowledging three complementary approaches under which AI is considered : — the policy and institutional perspective , which is especially relevant for the objective of this work given the scope in which the AI definitio n is to be used , focus es on the development of the industry , the research capacity , and the impact on society of advanced technologies . This approach considers AI as an instrument for growth and technological development . We have collected and analysed doc uments from the European Commission , national strategies and policy documents ( European and non -European ) , as well as other international institutions such as the OECD , UNESCO , World Economic Forum , ISO , etc . ; — the research perspective , which is the unders tanding of AI as a research field and its development as a general purpose technology ; — the market perspective , which has a strong focus on industrial development and assessment of the economic value and future market prospects . The simultaneous consideration of the three approaches provides an overview of the past and current perceptions of AI and how the concept evolves over time . All the collected documents provide a n AI definition , or identify or describe core and transversal AI subdomains , most of the documents present both types of information . These were analysed in order to identify the main aspects specified as AI features , as well as the core and transversal AI subdomains , so as to propose an operational definition and ta xonomy that is useful for the objectives of AI Watch . The thorough investigation of the concept from an ontological perspective and the analysis of the evolution of AI as a concept and research field remain out of the scope of this study . The details of th e explored definitions can be found in section 3 . Table 3 offers a collection of the definitions and AI subdomains covered , as provided in the original documents . 2.1 AI definition s Despite the increased interest in AI by the academia , industry and public institutions , there is no standard definition of what AI actually involves . AI has been described by certain approaches in relation to human intelligence , or intelligence in general . Many definitions refer to machines that beh ave like humans or are capable of actions that require intelligence ( US NDAA , 2019 ; Russel and Norvig , 1955 ; McCarthy , 2007 ; Nilsson , 1998 ; Fogel , 1995 ; Albus , 1991 ; Luger and Stubblefield , 1993 ; Winston , 1992 ; McCarthy , 1988 ; Gardner , 1987 ; 1983 ; Newell a nd Simon , 1976 ; Bellman , 1978 ; Minsky , 1969 ; McCarthy et al. , 1955 ) . Since human intelligence is also difficult to define and measure , and although there have been different attempts of quantification ( Gardner , 1983 ; 19 87 ; Neisser et al. , 1996 ) , the object ive definition of something as subjective and abstract as intelligence ( Kaplan , 2016 ) falsely gives the impression of a precision that can not be obtained . As a consequence , most definitions found in research , policy or market reports are vague and propose an ideal target rather than a measurable research concept . The oversimplification of the concept of intelligence that is needed in order to define , or even develop , AI is illustrated by Russel and Norvig ( 1985 ; 2010 ) and emphasised by the High Level Exper t Group on A rtificial Intelligence ( HLEG , 2019 ) when focusing on rational AI and hence considering benchmark against an ideal performance . `` A system is rational if it does the “ right thing ” , given what it knows '' ( Russel and Norvig , 1985 ; 2010 ) . Two activities are especially considered in this study when analysing AI definitions : existing standardisation efforts , and the contribution of the High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence . 8 Standardisation efforts In order to collect information o n the standardisation of AI and its applications , the International Organization for Standardization ( ISO ) is included in the analysis . Currently the available AI definitions are found in the ISO/IEC 2382 of 2015 , established in 1993 and 1995 . In 2018 , in an effort to update these definitions , two sub committees with six working groups and one study group are formed with the goal to develop 10 AI standards for ISO/IEC . The ISO/IEC JTC1/SC42 is the first international standards committee identifying the entire AI ecosystem . JTC1 ’ s scope for SC42 is to become “ a systems integration entity to work with other ISO , IEC and JTC 1 committees looking at AI applications ” . Until May 2019 , three standards are published with a different objective ; hence an AI definition is not included . The High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence The High -Level Expert Group ( HLEG ) on Artificial Intelligence has been appointed by the European Commission with the main aim to support the implementation of the European AI Strategy . This includes the elaboration of recommendations on future -related policy developments and on ethical , legal and societal issues related to AI , including socio -economic challenges . The HLEG on AI is composed by 52 representatives from academia , civil society and industry . The first two outputs of the HLEG on AI are the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence2 , and a definition of AI3 developed to describe a common understanding of the domain and its capabilities , and serving as a supporting document for the HLEG 's deliverables . The HLEG definition is considered together with the remaining documents analysed in this study . Common features in AI definitions Despite the multiple facets of AI , and consequently the lack of a common def inition , there are a number of commonalities that we observe in the analysed definitions . This expression of common aspects suggests that they may be considered as the main features of AI : — Perception of the environment , including the consideration of the real world complexity ( HLEG , 2019 ; European AI Strategy , 2018 ; EC JRC Flagship report on AI , 2018 ; Tsinghua University , 2018 ; Nakashima , 1999 ; Nilsson , 1998 ; Poole et al. , 1998 ; Fogel , 1995 ; Wang , 1995 ; Albus , 1991 ; Newell and Simon , 1976 ) . — Information pro cessing : collecting and interpreting inputs ( in form of data ) ( HLEG , 2019 ; European AI Strategy , 2018 ; EC JRC Flagship report on AI , 2018 ; Kaplan and Haenlein , 2018 ; Tsinghua University , 2018 ; Nakashima , 1999 ; Nilsson , 1998 ; Poole et al. , 1998 ; Wang , 1995 ) . — Decision making ( including reasoning and learning ) : taking actions , performance of tasks ( including adaptation , reaction to changes in the environment ) with certain level of autonomy ( HLEG , 2019 ; OECD , 2019 ; European AI Strategy 2018 ; EC JRC Flagship rep ort on AI 2018 ; Kaplan and Haenlein 2018 ; Tsinghua University , 2018 ; Nilsson , 1998 ; Poole Mackworth and Goebel , 1998 ; Fogel , 1995 ; ISO/IEC 2382 28 , 1995 ; Wang , 1995 ; Albus , 1991 ; Newell and Simon , 1976 ) . — Achievement of specific goals : this is considered as the ultimate reason of AI systems ( HLEG 2019 ; OECD , 2019 ; European AI Strategy , 2018 ; Kaplan and Haenlein , 2018 ; Poole at al. , 1998 ; Fogel , 1995 ; Albus , 1991 ; Newell and Simon , 1976 ) . 2.2 AI Watch operational definition of AI The proposed AI Watch operational definition is based on a concrete definition taken as a starting point , and is composed by a concise taxonomy and a set of keywords that characterise the core and transversal domains of AI . To reach a common understanding o n the concept of AI in the framework of AI Watch , it is important that the starting point is an inclusive definition , hence covering all technological developments and activities carried out by all types actors that make up the AI ecosystem , whether industrial , research , gove rnment initiatives . Taking into consideration the features that many of the explored definitions share ( see Table 3 ) , as well as the afore mentioned objective s , we consider the definition proposed by the HLEG on AI as the starting point for the develop ment of the operational definition . Although it may be co nsidered highly technical for different audience s and objectives , it is a very comprehensive definition which incorporates the aspects of perception , understanding , interpretation , interaction , decision making , adaptation to behaviour and achievement of go als , whereas other definitions do not address them in their entirety : 2 ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm ? doc_id=58477 3 ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/document.cfm ? doc_id=56341 9 HLEG definition of AI `` Artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems are software ( and possibly also hardware ) systems designed by humans ( 2 ) that , given a complex goal , act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition , interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data , reasoning on the knowledge , or processing the information , derived f rom this data and deciding the best action ( s ) to take to achieve the given goal . AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model , and they can also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actio ns . '' Other suitable definitions targeted to alternative uses Considering that the HLEG definition is comprehensive , hence highly technical and detailed , less specialised definitions can be adopted for studies of different objective , such as enterprise surv eys . In this scope , the definitions provided by the EC JRC Flagship report on AI ( 2018 ) ( see detailed reference in subsection 3.1.1.4 ) and the European AI Strategy ( C OM ( 2018 ) 237 final , see subsection 3.1.1.3 ) are suitable alternatives : EC JRC Flagship report on AI “ AI is a generic term that refers to any machine or algorithm that is capable of observing its environment , learning , and based on the knowledge and experience gained , taking intelligent action or proposing decisions . There are many different technologies that fall under this broad AI definition . At the moment , ML 4 techniques are the most widely used. ” European AI Strategy `` Artificial Intelligence refers to systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking action — with some degree of autonomy — to achieve specific goals. `` The latter has been considered by Eurostat as the starting point for the development of a definition that will be included in the AI module of the Community Survey on ICT Usage and e -Commerce i n Enterprises 2021 upon approval . Community survey on ICT usage and e -commerce in enterprises 2021 “ Artificial intelligence refers to systems that use technologies such as : text mining , computer vision , speech recognition , natural language generation , machine learning , deep learning to gather and/or use data to predict , recommend or decide , with varying levels of autonomy , the best action to achieve specific goals. ” 2.2.1 AI taxonomy The proposed taxonomy addresses political , research and industrial perspectives and aims to cover and classify the AI landscape , which consists of economic agents with R & D or industrial AI related activities . Therefore , this taxonomy is able to detect correspondingly a wide range of core AI related scientific subdomains ( e.g . knowledge representation and reasoning , machine learning ) and transversal topics such as applications of the former ( e.g . robots , automated vehicles , etc . ) or ethical and philosophical considerations . The taxonomy is presented as a reduced list of abstract high level domains and their related subdomains . These are meant to encompass the main theoretical AI branches , as well as AI related non -technological issues . The AI subdomains are represented by a list of keywords ( see subsection 2.2.2 ) , these will enable us to capture the AI activities carried out by economic agents , for further analysis of the AI landscape from a techno -economic perspective . 2.2.1.1 Sources The AI field allows several classification approaches and correspon ding divisions in specific subdomains or topics . It should be noted again that there is no commonly agreed AI taxonomy among research communities , literature or reports , given the rapid evolution of this knowledge domain and varied perspectives from which AI is considered . For this part of the study , we have analysed existing taxonomies and attempts to disentangle the AI knowledge domain . We have explored the following sources : ( 4 ) Machine Learning 10 — AITopics5 : this website is an official publication of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence ( AAAI ) , presenting in ordered way information about AI . The information gathered covers different dimensions : research ( through journals and conference s ) , AI applications , authors ; and different types of sources : papers , news , tweets , etc . The documents analysed are tagged -combining machine learning with subject matter expert knowledge - and classified according to two main dimensions : technological and industrial , that is considering the economic sector in which AI is developed and/or used . We focus on the technology break down provided by this source . The following AI related fields are considered by AITopics under AI : Assistive technologies , Cognitive science , Games , Human -centered computing , Machine learning , Natural language , Representation & reasoning , Robots , Speech , Systems & languages , Vision , together with other less technology related : Challenges , . Issues , History , Science fiction , The future6 . — Specialised conferences : we explore the top AI conferences in order to identify submission groups as proxies of the main current in research sub -fields . The following conference submission groups have been considered : o AAAI5 : AI and the Web , Applications , Cognitive Modeling , Cognitive Systems , Computational Sustainability and AI , Game Theory and Economic Paradigms , Game Playing and Interactive Entertainment , Heuristic Search and Optimization , Human -AI Collaboration , Human -Computation and Crowd Sourcing , H umans and AI , Knowledge Representation and Reasoning , Machine Learning Applications , Machine Learning Methods , Multiagent Systems , Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) and Knowledge Representation , NLP and Machine Learning , NLP and Text Mining , Planning and S cheduling , Reasoning under Uncertainty , Robotics , Search and Constraint Satisfaction , Vision . o International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence ( IJCAI ) :  2009 : Agent -based and Multi -agent Systems , Multidisciplinary Topics and Applications , Robotics and Vision , Natural -Language Processing , Knowledge Representation , Reasoning and Logic , Constraints , Satisfiability , and Search , Planning and Scheduling , Uncertainty in AI , Machine Learning , Web and Knowledge -based Information Systems .  2018 : Agent -based a nd Multi -agent Systems , Computer Vision , Constraints and SAT , Heuristic Search and Game Playing , Humans and AI , Knowledge Representation and Reasoning , Machine Learning , Machine Learning Applications , Multidisciplinary Topics and Applications , Natural Lang uage Processing , Planning and Scheduling , Robotics , Uncertainty in AI . — Documents analysed for this study ( section 3 ) : We also acknowledge the AI subdomains mentioned in the policy , research and market reports . A summary of the main AI subdomain s listed in all the documents follow ( subsection 2.3 ) . Additionally , we analysed the taxonomy and keywords developed by the Working Group drafting the Spanish strategy on AI 7 : Machine Learning , Natural Language Pr ocessing , Computer Vision and Perception , Knowledge Representation and Reasoning , Multiagent Systems , Data Science , Other . — Moreover , this top -down approach is complemented with a bottom -up approach that converges with the taxonomy . In the early results of this approach we used a natural language processing method ( topic modelling ) to unbiasedly identify thematic subdomains in a collection of more than 64 thousand industrial and R & D AI activities . This resulted in the identification of six thematic subdomai ns ( machine learning , computer vision , natural language processing , connected and automated vehicles , robotics , and AI services ) , which have a correspondence in the proposed taxonomy . ( 5 ) aitopics.org ( 6 ) Additionally , some of the documents collected are classified under other main technological fields such as Architecture , Ente rprise Application , Information Management , Sensing and signal processing , among others . ( 5 ) AAAI 2018 ( 7 ) Coordinated by Professor Ramón López de Mántaras ( IIIA-CSIC ) , who acted also as advisor in this study . 11 2.2.1.2 AI Watch taxonomy In accordance to the HLEG , AI techniques and sub-disciplines can be grouped under two big strands regarding the systems ' capabilities : ( i ) reasoning and decision making , ( ii ) and learning and perception . The first group of capabilities includes the transformation of data into knowledge , by transformi ng real world information into something understandable and usable by machines , and making decisions following an organised path of planning , solution searching and optimisation . This strand cover s the AI subdomain s of Knowledge representation and reasonin g ( usually making use of symbolic rules to represent and infer knowledge ) and Planning ( including Planning & Scheduling , Searching , and Optimisation ) . The second group of capabilities develops in absence of symbolic rules , and involves learning -meaning th e extraction of information , and problem solving based on structured or unstructured perceived data ( written and oral language , image , sound , etc . ) - , adaptation and reaction to changes , behavioural prediction , etc . This second strand covers AI sub -fields related to learning , communication and perception , such as Machine learning , Natural language processing , and Computer vision . The academic approach followed by the HLEG is to be complemented by considering the wider monitoring objective of AI Watch , namely to capture and measure the AI landscape that involves multifarious economic agents and complementary approaches , considering also the impact on society . Consequently , the taxonomy proposed is based on the main AI domains identified by the HLEG and is expanded to cover additional dimensions : — the concept of rational agents , as entities that make decisions and act in relation to its environment , including interaction with other agents ; — research and industrial developments , and other AI applications s uch as cloud service models offered by service companies to accelerate AI uptake ; — other noteworthy aspects related to AI , but not necessarily technology related , arise as important subjects in policy documents and the social debate : ethical considerations such as transparency , explainability , accountability , fairness and safety , as well philosophical matters involving the deepest nature of AI and its evolution . Taking into consideration the above , we propose the following AI domains and subdomains as characterising the AI field . They are divided into core and transversal domains , the former referring to the fundamental goals of AI , the latter not specifically related to a particular academic discipline or area of knowledge , but as issues common to a ll the core domains . Table 1 . AI domains and subdomains constituting one part of the operational definition of AI AI taxonomy AI domain AI subdomain Core Reasoning Knowledge representation Automated reasoning Common sense reasoning Planning Planning and Scheduling Searching Optimisation Learning Machine learning Communication Natural language processing Perception Computer vision Audio processing Transversal Integration and Interaction Multi -agent systems Robotics and Automation Connected and Automated vehicles Services AI Services Ethics and Philosophy AI Ethics Philosophy of AI Source : Authors ' elaboration 12 It is noteworthy that the suggested domains and subdomains are related , and not disjoint , subsets of AI . This ensues from the nature of the AI field that embraces intertwined applications and theoretical advancements , with fuzzy boundaries . For instance , the fact that machine learning is exploited in either compu ter vision , audio processing or natural language processing does not prevent them from being separate research fields , considered by top AI conferences topics and related literature ( see subsection 2.2.1.1 ) . At the same time , computer vision and natural la nguage processing are in turn embedded in more complex applications , such as virtual personal assistants or robotic platforms . Following this continuum , we consider theoretical advancements in one end of the taxonomy and industrial applications in the othe r one . We should also stress that the defined subdomains may not be fully AI -driven . For instance , while mechanical robots do not always incorporate AI techniques , robotics is considered as a relevant domain impacted by recent developments in AI techniques . In conclusion , the AI Watch taxonomy is not meant to constitute a rigid classification , but a comprehensive collection of areas that represents AI from our three target perspectives : policy , research and industry . In the following , we succinctly describe the above domains and subdomains , highlighting their identification in different AI national strategies and reports . Domain : Reasoning Subdomains : Knowledge representation ; Automated reasoning ; Common sense reasoni ng The domain of reasoning tackles the way machines transform data into knowledge , or infer facts from data . Several classifications address knowledge representation and automated reasoning as a field of AI , to describe the process of justifying ( reasoning ) the available data and information , provide solutions and represent them efficiently , based on a set of symbolic rules ( HLEG , 2019 ; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence , 2019 ; National Strategy : France Monitoring Report , 2019 ; CB Insights , 2019 ; AI National Strategy : Germany , 2018 ; Working Paper for National Strategy : India , 2018 ; ETSI , 2018 ; National Strategy : France ( Villani Mission ) , 2018 ; AI National Strategy : China , 2017 ; McCarthy , 2007 ; Nilsson , 1998 ) . Domain : Planning Subdomains : Planning and Scheduling ; Searching ; Optimisation The main purpose of automated planning concerns the design and execution of strategies ( e.g. , an organi sed set of actions ) to carry out some activity , and typically performed by intelligent agents , autonomous robots and unmanned vehicles . Unlike classical control and classification problems , the solutions are complex and must be discovered and optimi sed in the multidimensional space . ( HLEG , 2019 ; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence , 2019 ; National Strategy : France Monitoring Report , 2019 ; CB Insights , 2019 ; AI National Strategy : Germany , 2018 ; McCarthy , 2007 ) . Domain : Learning Subdomains : Machine Learning ( ML ) By learning , we refer to the ability of systems to auto matically learn , decide , predict , adapt and react to changes , improving from experience , without being explicitly programmed . ML is widely included in the vast majority of efforts to identify AI categories , as the basic algorithmic approach to achieve AI r egardless the type of learning , namely reinforcement , supervised , semi -supervised , unsupervised ( HLEG , 2019 ; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence , 2019 ; StandICT.eu project , 2019 ; National Strategy : Denmark , 2019 ; National Strategy : France Monitoring report , 2019 ; Australia ’ s Ethic Framework Dawson et al. , 2019 ; US Congressional Research Service , 2019 ; CB Insights , 2019 ; EC JRC Flagship report on AI , 2018 ; AI National Strategy : Germany , 2018 ; OECD , 2018 ; Tsinghua University , 2018 ; Working Pa per for AI National Strategy : India , 2018 ; National Industrial Strategy : UK , 2018 ; 2017 ; AI National Strategy : France ( Villani Mission ) , 2018 ; US Department of Defense , 2018 ; OECD , 2017 ; McKinsey , 2017 ; Stone et al . : AI100 , 2016 ; McCarthy , 2007 ) . Domain : Communication Subdomains : Natural Language Processing ( NLP ) NLP , as the main task of communication , refers to the machine ’ s ability to identify , process , understand and/or generate information in written and spoken human communications . It is considered as an AI subdomain from several national strategies and AI experts , encompassing applications such as text generation , text mining , classification , and machine translation ( HLEG , 2019 ; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence , 2019 ; National Strateg y : Denmark , 2019 ; National Strategy : France Monitoring report , 2019 ; CB 13 Insights , 2019 ; EC JRC Flagship report on AI , 2018 ; OECD , 2018 ; Tsinghua University , 2018 ; Working Paper for AI National Strategy : India , 2018 ; National Strategy : France ( Villani Missi on ) , 2018 ; US Department of Defense , 2018 ; AI National Strategy : Japan , 2017 ; AI National Strategy : China , 2017 ; McKinsey , 2017 ; Stone et al . : AI100 , 2016 ; McCarthy , 2007 ) Domain : Perception Subdomains : Computer vision ; Audio processing Perception refers to systems ’ ability to become aware of their environment through the senses : vision , hearing , manipulation . etc . , being vision and hearing the most developed areas in AI . Computer vision ( CV ) refers to activities that identify human faces and objects in di gital images , as part of object -class detection . It is identified as one of the essential scientific fields with parts belonging to machine perception and , thus , AI . It is usually referred to as image pattern recognition for specific tasks , or as in a broa der sense as machine vision , with applications on face and body recognition , video content recognition , 3D reconstruction , public safety and security , health etc . ( HLEG , 2019 ; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence , 2019 ; National Strategy : Denmar k , 2019 ; Australia ’ s Ethic Framework Dawson et al. , 2019 ; US Congressional Research Service , 2019 ; CB Insights , 2019 ; EC JRC Flagship report on AI , 2018 ; AI National Strategy : Germany , 2018 ; Tsinghua University , 2018 ; Working Paper for AI National Strategy : India , 2018 ; OECD , 2018 ; US Department of Defense , 2018 ; AI National Strategy : Japan , 2017 ; OECD , 2017 ; McKinsey , 2017 ; Stone et al . : AI100 , 2016 ; McCarthy , 2007 ) . Audio processing refers to AI systems allowing the perception or generation ( synth esis ) of audio signals , including speech , but also other sound material ( e.g . environmental sounds , music ) . Speech or voice recognition , audio processing or sound technologies are also often proposed to be archived as an AI subdivision ( AI4Belgium Report , 2019 ; COM ( 2018 ) 237 final ; EC JRC Flagship report on AI , 2018 ; OECD , 2017 , 2018 ; Tsinghua University , 2018 ; Working Paper for AI National Strategy : India , 2018 ; AI National Strategy : Japan , 2017 ; McCarthy , 2007 ) . Domain : Integration and Interaction Subdomains : Multi -agent systems ; Robotics and Automation ; Connected and Automated vehicles ( CAVs ) The transversal domain of Integration and Interaction addresses t he combination of perception , reasoning , action , learning and interaction with the environme nt , as well as characteristics such as distribution , coordination , cooperation , autonomy , interaction and integration .. Robotics and Automation refers to activities related to application and research of the technological intelligent tools to assist or sub stitute human activity , or to enable actions that are not humanly possible ( e.g . medical robots ) , to optimize technical limitations , labour or production costs . The CAVs subdomain regards technologies of autonomous vehicles , connected vehicles and driver a ssistance systems , considering all automation levels and all communication technologies ( V2X ) . Multi -agent systems , Unmanned systems ( CAVs , drones ) , as well as robotics and process automation ( Application programming interface ( API ) , robotic process automa tion for industrial , social and other uses ) are also mentioned as separate intrinsic subdivisions of AI ( HLEG , 2019 ; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence , 2019 ; UNESCO , 2019 ; Australia ’ s Ethic Framework , 2019 ; National Strategy : Denmark , 2019 ; National Strategy : France Monitoring report , 2019 ; US Congressional Research Service , 2019 ; CB Insights , 2019 ; EC JRC Flagship report on AI , 2018 ; COM ( 2018 ) 237 final ; AI National Strategy : Germany , 2018 ; Tsinghua University , 2018 ; Working Paper for AI National Strategy : India , 2018 ; National Industrial Strategy : UK , 2018 ; 2017 ; National Strategy : France ( Villani Mission ) , 2018 ; Statista 2017 ; McKinsey , 2017 ; AI National Strategy : Japan , 2017 ; AI National Strategy : China , 2017 ; Stone et al . : AI100 , 2016 ) . Domain : Services Subdomains : AI Services The transversal domain of AI services refers to any infrastructure , software and platform ( e.g. , cognitive computing , ML frameworks , bots and virtual assistants , etc . ) provided as ( serverless ) services or applications , possibly in the cloud , which are available off the shelf and executed on demand , reducing the manag ement of complex infrastructures . In this regard , c loud computing services are often presented when describing the AI landscape ( US NDAA , 2019 ; Chinese National Strategy , 2017 ) . Infrastructure as a Service ( IaaS ) is the basis of cloud computing , providing access and management of virtual resources such as servers , storage , operating systems and networking . Subsequently , cloud platfor ms ( or Platform as a Service ( PaaS ) ) are service products of cloud applications , and can be used within Software as a Service ( SaaS ) architectures , which are cloud applications and adaptive intelligence software ( HLEG , 2019 ; Spanish RDI Strategy in Artificial Intelligence , 14 2019 ; US Department of Defense , 2018 ; Tsinghua University , 2018 ; Working Paper for AI National Strategy : India , 2018 ; AI National Strategy : China , 2017 ; Statista , 201 7 ; McKinsey , 2017 ) . Domain : E thics & Philosophy Subdomains : AI Ethics ; Philosophy of AI Philosophical and ethical issues associated with AI are proliferating and rising citizens ’ attention and governments ’ policy interest as intelligent systems become widespread . The ethics of AI is c onsidered as a transversal subdomain , as AI advances and applications in different areas should ensure compliance with ethical principles and values , including applicable regulation . Given the impact on human beings and society , establish ing trust in AI is the focus of several frameworks and initiatives by policy bodies and institutions ( HLEG , 2019 ; OECD , 2019 ; StandICT.eu project , 2019 ; National Strategy : France Monitoring report , 2019 ; Australia ’ s Ethic Framework Dawson et al. , 2019 ; EC Coordinated Acti on Plan on AI , 2018 ; European AI Strategy : EC Communication ; National Strategy : France ( Villani Mission ) , 2018 ; Artificial Intelligence for Europe , 2018 ) . 2.2.2 AI keywords In order to fulfil its objective as a monitoring tool , one of the outputs of AI Watch will be to provide an overview of the worldwide landscape of AI . This effort will be conducted by applying the Techno -economic segments ( TES ) analytical approach developed by the EC JRC to the AI field ( Samoili S. , Righi R. , Cardona M. , López Cobo M. , Váz quez-Prada Baillet M. , and De Prato G. , 2020 ) . This methodology is developed to map technological ( and non -technological ) domains that do not correspond to standard classifications ( e.g . industries , products ) , and that are pervasive and cross -sectoral . It is conceived as an analytical framework and replicable methodology to analyse and describe the dynamics of specific TES ecosystems , by exploiting different types of factual data including non -official heterogeneous sources . The initial stages of the TES analytical approach are presented in Samoili S. , Righi R. , Lopez -Cobo M. , Cardona M. , and De Prato G. ( 2019 ) , and a first application to the AI domain is shown in De Prato G. , López Cobo. , M. , Samoili S. , Righi R. , Vázquez Prada Baillet , M. , and Cardona M. ( 2019 ) and Samoili et al . ( 2019 ) . The first step of the TES methodo logy addresses the defini tion of a techno -economic segment , e.g . AI , followed by its operationalisation through a list of keywords . The keywords are used in text queries to identify activities and economic agents relevant to the technology under study , AI in this case , for further analysis . 2.2.2.1 Construction process The domains and subdomains that are selected as characterising AI are represented by a list of keywords . These , as the AI subdomains , cover different aspects , such as methods , algorithmic approaches , applications , products , research areas , etc . , but also address aspects such as ethics and philosophy , not as an intrinsic part of AI , but rather as an application of ethical principles and philosophical concerns to AI . The list of keywords is built in a multi -step process combining a semi -automatic text mining approach , desk research and domain experts ' involvement : 1 . Identification of top keywords in the research domain ( a ) Seed articles : First we conduct a selection of a seed subset of scientific articles wh ere the term `` artificial intelligence '' is present in the title , keywords or abstract of the publication . This first step is run on all articles available in the Scopus Database in three different years ( 2005 , 2009 and 2017 ) . The consideration of the time d imensions allows capturing recently coined terms , as well as others that are consolidated , or even some that fell into disuse but that were important terms in the past . ( b ) Expansion to cover articles not triggered by the technology term : In view of expanding the set of investigated documents , and not limiting the analysis to the papers containing the keyword `` artificial intelligence '' , we consider all articles published in the journals in which the articles identified in step 1 . ( a ) are found . In this step , 137 specialised journals are considered , while generalist journals and the ones centred in other scientific fields are ignored . For instance , the journal “ Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence ” would be selected , while “ Physics of Life Reviews ” would not , even if the latter has published some AI related articles . ( c ) First draft list of keywords : We consider all papers published in the journals selected in step 1 . ( b ) during the three referred years . The selected AI related articles amount to 25 600 : 2 907 published in 2005 , 12 706 in 2009 and 9 987 in 2017 . The number of different keywords included in these 15 papers totals 57 850 . The first draft list of keywords is composed by a selection from the 300 most frequent author 's keywords per year , from whic h generic terms are removed . 2 . Identification of keywords in the industrial dimension of the technology In order to cover terms reflecting the recent industrial developments and AI applications , we also take into consideration sources of industrial activity . To that end , we have analysed and extracted relevant terms from companies ’ activities descriptions . Since an equivalent to author 's keywords is not available from firms ' descriptions , we obtain the most frequent terms ( unigrams , bigrams and trigrams ) and manually inspect their relevancy in order to incorporate them to the draft list built in step 1 . 3 . Initial keyword selection The list of candidate terms , sorted by relevance based on their frequency of occurrence , is then reviewed by in-house researchers and a short selection is made . Terms are grouped when synonyms , very similar terms and different spellings are found , then the groups are reduced to a single term per groups . Terms appearing in both sub -lists are prioritised . 4 . Selection of keywords through topic modelling We consider the most representative terms from the six AI subdomains identified from topic modelling on a corpus of 64 thousand documents of R & D and industrial activity . The subdomains are identified by applying semantic clustering with the Latent Dirichlet Allocation ( LDA ) model , a generative hierarchical mixed membership model for discrete data ( Blei & Laerty , 2009 ; Blei et al. , 2003 ; Papadimitriou et al. , 2000 ) . The model returns the most probable topics that best represent the corpus , without the involvement of any expert to avoid unintentional bias . Only the labelling of topics is done manually . The most relevant keywords of each of the six topics are also considered , and redundancies with terms already included in the list , removed . 5 . Validation by a panel of experts in several AI subdomains An in -house pool of researchers made a selection that was reviewed by external domain experts in several AI areas . The advice for improvement targeted the expansion of the frontiers considered , nam ely the inclusion of domains and related terms not so well captured by the research and industrial sources analysed so far . 6 . Final review and selection of list of keywords per domain As a consequence of the review in step 5 , areas such as Knowledge represe ntation and reasoning or AI ethics and their corresponding related terms were introduced . The final taxonomy was then depicted and the final keyword list defined . Valuable inputs in this process were : the terms describing the submission groups in top AI co nferences , the term frequencies observed in AITopics , and the terms produced by the Spanish Working Group on AI responsible for the drafting of the Spanish strategy . 2.2.2.2 Keyword list Table 2 presents the keywords identified as most relevant within each AI subdomain comprising the taxonomy . This list of keywords is designed to map and model AI activities in a broad sense . The keywords are presented grouped in t he broad categories identified in the taxonomy , which , as explained in detail in subsection 2.2.1 , are not mutually exclusive . This keyword list is intended to be dynamically updated according to new technological developments in core and transversal domains , and to agree with alternative proposals . The rationale for building the list of keywords is to determine , in a practical way , the boundaries of the ecosystem of economic agents active in AI . In practical terms , the list of keywords will be used taking into account additional considerat ions . For instance , in order to avoid as much as possible the occurrence of false positives , i.e. , the incorrect identification as AI of activities that are not AI related , a reduced list of intrinsic -AI keywords is used to query the data sources to identi fy the relevant active agents in the TES ecosystem . Furthermore , some of the remaining keywords are considered only after conditioning its co-occurrence w ith some of the core AI terms ( these are the non -intrinsic AI keywords ) . Examples of intrinsic -AI terms used as standalone terms to identify activities are : deep learning , face recognition , swarm intelligence and unsupervised learning . Terms that are only used in combination with intrinsic -AI terms include , for instance : accountability , classification , clustering , cognitive system , industrial robot , service robot and social robot , since these non -intrinsic terms could be used in a non -AI context . 16 Table 2 .

This is the ideal of artificial intelligence ( AI ) , so -called. ”  McCarthy , 2007 “ It is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines , especially intelligent computer programs . It is related to the similar task of using computers to understand human intelligence , but AI does not have to confine itself to methods that are biologically observable. ” “ Intelligence is the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world .

The criteria of properness are not predefined and hence not available beforehand . They are acquired as a result of the information processing. ”  Nilsson , 1998 “ Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) , broadly ( and somewhat circularly ) defined , is concerned with intelligent behavior in artefacts . Intelligent behavior , in turn , involves perception , reasoning , learning , communicating , and acting in complex environments. ”   Neisser et al. , 1996 The article introduces in the AI definition the notions of adapting to the environment , reasoning , learning etc . through a human intelligence definition , with multiple dimensions , due to biologically inspired processes . “ Individuals differ from one another in their ability to understand complex ideas , to adapt effectively to the environment , to learn from experience , to en gage in various forms of reasoning , to overcome obstacles by taking thought . Concepts of intelligence are attempts to clarify and organise this complex set of phenomena. ”  Fogel , 1995 “ Any system…that generates adaptive behaviour to meet goals in a range of environments can be said to be intelligent. ”  Wang , 1995 Intelligence is “ the ability for an information processing system to adapt to its environment with insufficient knowledge and resources. ”  Albus , 1991 “ …the ability of a system to act appropriately in an uncertain environment , where appropriate action is that which increases the probability of success , and success is the achievement of behavioral subgoals that support the system ’ s ultimate goal. ”  Schank , 1991 ; 1987 “ AI suffers from a lack of definition of its scope . One way to attack this problem is to attempt to list some features that we would expect an intelligent entity to have . None of these features would define intelligence , indeed a being could lack any one of them and still be considered intelligent . Nevertheless each attribute would be an integral part of intelligence in its way . ... They are communication , internal knowledge , world knowledge , intentionality , and creativity. ” “ AI 's primary goal is to bui ld an intelligent machine .

There has been some useful success , but the ultimate goal still requires major conceptual advances and is probably far off . There are three ways of attacking the goal . The first is to imitate the human nervous system . The second is to study the psychology of human intelligence . The third is to understand the common sense world in which people achieve their goals and develop intelligent computer programs . This last one is the computer science appro ach. ”  Gardner , 1987 AI “ seeks to produce , on a computer , a pattern of output that would be considered intelligent if displayed by a human being ” . Schlinger ( 1992 ) mentions that this book also refers that “ AI is viewed as a way of testing a particular theory of how cognitive processes might work . That theory is the popular information -processing model of cognition . Where AI researchers disagree , according to Gardner , is how literally to interpret the thinking metaphor . For example , some take what John Searle calls the `` weak view '' of AI , wherein computer programs are simply a means for testing theories of how humans might carry out cognitive operations . The wea k view of AI is synonymous with modern cognitive psychology. ”  Gardner , 1983 “ Artificial intelligence is commonly defined by referencing definitions of human intelligence , as in Minsky ’ s definition . In contrast to the standard approach of measuring one kind of intelligence ( as in standard IQ tests ) , Gardner ( cognitive scientist ) offers an eight -dimensional definition to disentangle the oversimplification of intelligence 's measurement . In particular , he proposed multiple conceptions of intel ligence , not only logical mathematical , linguistic , but also spatial , musical , bodily -kinaesthetic , personal. ”  Newell and Simon , 1976 “ By “ general intelligent action ” we wish to indicate the same scope if intelligence as we see in human action : that in any real situation behavior appropriate to the ends of the system and adaptive to the demands of the environment can occur , within some limits of speed and complexity. ”  Minsky , 1969 AI is “ the science of making machines do things that wou ld require intelligence if done by men ” .  28 Source AI Definition Reasoning ; Planning Learning Communication Perception Integration and Interaction Services Ethics and Philosophy Other/ NA McCarthy , 1959 The author , one of the founding father of AI , proposes that common sense reasoning ability is key to AI . “ A program has common sense if it automatically deduces for itself a sufficiently wide class of immediate consequences of anything it is told and what it already knows. ”  McCarthy et al. , 1955 “ .. every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it . An attempt will be made to find how to make machines use language , form abstractions and concepts , solve kinds of problems now reserved for humans , and impro ve themselves . …the artificial intelligence problem is taken to be that of making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving. ”  Market approach CB Insights , 2019 -       Statista , 2017 “ Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) essentially refers to computing technologies that are inspired by the ways people use their brains and nervous systems to reason and make decisions , but typically operate quite differently. ”    McKinsey , 2017 -      Source : Authors ’ elaboration . 29 3 AI definitions and subdomains in : policy documents , research and market reports 3.1 Policy and institutional perspective : Commission Services ; National ; International 3.1.1 European Commission level 3.1.1.1 High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence ( HLEG ) , 2019 Source HLEG Definition of AI Text of the definition “ Artificial intelligence ( AI ) systems are software ( and possibly also hardware ) systems designed by humans3 that , given a complex goal , act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition , interpreting the collected structured or unstructured data , reasoning on the knowledge , or processing the information , derived from this data and deciding the best action ( s ) to take to achieve the given goal .

Text of the definition “ AI has always been envisioned as an evolving boundary , rather than a settled research field . Fundamentally , it refers to a programme whose ambitious objective is to understand and reproduce human cognition ; creating cognitive processes comparable to those found in human beings . Therefore , we are naturally dealing with a wide scope here , both in terms of the technical procedures that can be employed and the various disciplines that can be called upon : mathematics , information technology , cognitive sciences , etc . There is a great variety of approaches when it comes to AI : ontological , reinforcement learning , adversarial learning and neural networks , to name just a few. ” “ ... this technology [ AI ] represents much more than a researc h field : it determines our capacity to organize knowledge and give it meaning , it increases our decision -making capabilities and our control over these systems and , most notably , it enables us to capitilize on the value of data. ” “ A meaningful AI finally i mplies that AI should be explainable : explaining this technology to the public so as to demystify it —and the role of the media is vital from this point of view —but also explaining artificial intelligence by extending research into explicability itself .

An agent is something that acts in an environment —it does something . Agents include worms , dogs , thermostats , airplanes , humans , organizations , and society . An intelligent agent is a system that acts intelligently : What it does is appropriate for its circumstances and its goal , it is flexible to changing environments and changing goals , i t learns from experience , and it makes appropriate choices given perceptual limitations and finite computation. ” 2010 , 2017 : “ Artificial intelligence , or AI , is the field that studies the synthesis and analysis of computational agents that act intelligent ly . An agent is something that acts in an environment ; it does something . Agents include worms , dogs , thermostats , airplanes , robots , humans , companies , and countries. ” “ We are interested in what an agent does ; that is , how it acts . We judge an agent by its actions… An agent acts intelligently when : • what it does is appropriate for its circumstances and its goals , taking into account the short -term and long -term consequences of its actions • it is flexible to changing environments and changing goals • it learns from experience • it makes appropriate choices given its perceptual and computational limitations ” “ A computational agent is an agent whose decisions about its actions can be explained in terms of computation . That is , the decision can be broken down into primitive operations that can be implemented in a physical device . This computation can take many forms . In humans this computation is carried out in “ wetware ” ; in computers it is carried out in “ hardware. ” Although there are some agents that are arguably not computational , such as the wind and rain eroding a landscape , it is an open question whether all intelligent agents are computational . All agents are limited . No agents are omniscient or omnipotent . Agents can only observe everything about the wo rld in very specialized domains , where “ the world ” is very constrained . Agents have finite memory . Agents in the real world do not have unlimited time to act. ” The central scientific goal of AI “ is to understand the principles that make intelligent behavio r possible in natural or artificial systems . This is done by : • the analysis of natural and artificial agents • formulating and testing hypotheses about what it takes to construct intelligent agents and • designing , building , and experimenting with computational systems that perform tasks commonly viewed as requiring intelligence . As part of science , researchers build empirical systems to test hypotheses or to explore the space of possible designs . These are quite distinct from applications that are built to be useful for an application domain. ” “ The definition is not for intelligent thought alone . We are only interested in thinking intelligently insofar as it leads to more intelligent behavior . The role of thought is to affect action. ” “ The central e ngineering goal of AI is the design and synthesis of useful , intelligent artifacts . We actually want to build agents that act intelligently .

In contrast to the standard approach of measuring one kin d of intelligence ( as in standard IQ tests ) , Gardner ( cognitive scientist ) offers an eight -dimensional definition to disentangle the oversimplification of intelligence 's measurement . In particular , he proposed multiple conceptions of intelligence , not only logical mathematical , linguistic , but also spatial , musical , bodily -kinaesthetic , personal .

An exhaustive list of the collected documents can be found in the report . The p roposed operational definition is composed by a concise taxonomy characterising the core domains of the AI research field and transversal topics ; and a list of keywords representative of such taxonomy . As AI is a dynamic field , we propose an iterative meth od that can be updated over time to capture the rapid AI evolution . While the baseline definition will be used as the general AI Watch definition of AI , the operational definition has a more functional use . Both the taxonomy and the list of keywords are es sential to identify , map and characterise the worldwide AI landscape , one of the monitoring goals of AI Watch . The keywords are used in the initial phase to capture the relevant AI activities and the economic agents behind them . The main utility of the tax onomy is to classify AI activities , and will assist in the mapping of the AI landscape and the classification of economic agents ’ areas of specialisation . Different uses of the keyword list are possible . A narrow use of the list , i.e . selecting only intrin sic-AI terms , allows to identify relevant AI activities , with an expected low proportion of false positives . When the objective is the categorisation of AI -related activities , a more comprehensive list is more suitable , in order to classify activities in t heir corresponding taxonomy domains . Valuable contributions of this work are : the collection of definitions developed between 1955 and 2019 ; the summarisation of the main features of the concept of artificial intelligence as reflected in the relevant literature ; and the development of a replicable process that can provide a dynamic definition and taxonomy of the AI . 87 References AI 4 Belgium Coalition ( 2019 ) , AI 4 Belgium Report Blei , D.M. , Lafferty , J.D . : Topic models .
