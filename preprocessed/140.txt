AI Gu Idel Ines Deutsche Telekom Preamble Two of Deutsche Telekom ’ s most important goals are to keep being a trusted companion and to enhance customer experience . We see it as our responsibility -as one of the leading ICT companies in Europe - to foster the development of “ intelligent tech nologies ” . At least either important , these technologies , such as AI , must follow predefined ethical rules . To define a corresponding ethical framework , firstly it needs a common understanding on what AI means . Today there are severa l definitions of AI , like the very first one of John McCarthy ( 1956 ) “ Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it. ” In line with other companies and main players in the field of AI we at DT think of AI as the imitation of human intelligence processes by machines , especially computer systems . These processes include learning , reas oning , and self -correction . After several decades , Artificial Intelligence has become one of the most intriguing topics of today –and the future . It has be come widespread available and is discussed not only among experts but also more and more in public , politics , etc .. AI has started to influence business ( new market opportunities as well as e fficiency driver ) , society ( e.g . broad discussion about autonomously driving vehicles or AI as “ job machine ” vs. “ job killer ” ) and the life of each individual ( AI already found its way into the living room , e.g . with voice steered digital assistants like smart speakers ) . But the use of AI and its possibilities confront us not only with fast developing technologies but as well as with the fact that our ethical roadmaps , based on human- human interactions , might not be sufficient in this new era of technological influence . New questions arise and situations that were not imaginable in our dai ly lives then emerge . We as DT also want to develop and make use of AI . This technology can bring many benefits based on improving customer experie nceor simplicity . We are already in the game , e.ghaving several AI -related projects running . With these comes an increase of digital responsibility on our side to ensure that AI is uti lized in an ethical manner . So we as DT have to give answers to our customers , shareholders and stakeholders . The following Digital Ethics guidelines state how we as Deutsche Telekom want to build the future with AI . Forus , technology serves onemain purpose : Itmust actsupportingly . Thus AI is in any case supposed to extend and complement human abilities rather than lessen them . Remark : The impact of AI on DT jobs –may it as a benefit and for value creation in the sense of job enrichment and enlargement or may it in the sense of efficiency -is however not focus of these guidelines . 1 . We are responsible . The human always remains responsible . Our solutions come with a clear definition of who is responsible for which AI system or feature . We are in charge of our products and services . And , we know who is in charge for partner or third party solutions . With AI technology being in its infancy , we are aware of our responsibility in development –from the very beginning . We make sure that we clarify which initiative or product owner has which responsibilities . For partners or third parties , we define c lear guidelines for when a partnership can be established . And , we declare which duties are connected to the respective AI parts . 2 . We care . We act in tune with our company values . Our systems and solutions must subordinate to human defined rules and laws . Therefore , in addition to our technical requirements , our systems and solutions have to obey the rules and laws that we as Deutsche Telekom , our employees –and human beings as such –follow . AI systems have to meet the same high technical requirements as any other IT system of ours , such as security , robustness , et c. But since AI will be ( and already is ) a great part of our everyday lives , even guiding us in several areas , AI systems and th eir usage also have to comply with our company values ( Deutsche Telekom ’ s Guiding Principles and Code of Conduct ) , ethical values , and societal conventions . We have to make sure of that . 3 . We put our customers first . We enrich and simplify our customers ’ lives . If an AI system or the usage of customer -related data helps us to benefit our customers , we embrace this opportunity to meet their demands and expectations . The aggregation and use of customer data –especially in AI systems –shall always be clear and serve a useful purpose towards our customers . Systems and processes that support in the background are as important as services that interact with our customers directly . 4 . We are transparent . In no case we hide it when the customer ’ s counterpart is an AI . And , we are transparent about how we use customer data . As Deutsche Telekom , we always have the customer ’ s trust in mind –trust is what we stand for . We are acting openly to our customers . It is obvious to our customers that they are interacting with an AI when they do . In addition , we make clear , how and to which extent they can choose the way of further processing their personal data . 5 . We are secure . Data security is a prime quality of Deutsche Telekom . In order to maintain this asset , we ensure that our security measures are up to date while having a full overview of how customer related data is used and who has access to which kind of data . We never process privacy -relevant data without legal permission . This policy applies to our AI systems just as much as it does t o all of our activities . Additionally , we limit the usage to appropriate use cases and thoroughly secure our systems to obstruc t external access and ensure data privacy . 6 . We set the framework . Our AI solutions are developed and enhanced on grounds of deep analysis and evaluation . They are transparent , auditable , fair , and fully documented . We consciously initiate the AI ’ s development for the best possible outcome . The essential paradigm for our AI systems ’ impact analysis is “ privacy und security by design ” . This is accompanied e.g . by r isks and chances scenarios or reliable disaster scenarios . We take great care in the initial algorithm of our own AI solutions to pre vent so called “ Black Boxes ” and to make sure that our systems shall not unintentionally harm the users . 7 . We maintain control . We are able to deactivate and stop AI systems at any time ( kill switch ) . Additionally , we remove inappropriate data to avoid bias . We have an eye on the decisions made and the information fed to the system in order to enhance decision quality . We take responsibility for a diverse and appropriate data input . In case of inconsistencies , we rather stop the AI system tha n pursue with potentially manipulated data . We are also able to “ reset ” our AI systems in order to remove false or biased data . By this , we install a lever to reduce ( unintended ) unsuitable decisions or actions to a minimum . 8 . We foster the cooperative model . We believe that human and machine intelligence are complementary , with each bringing its own strength to the table . While we believe in a people first approach of human -machine collaboration , we recognize , that humans can benefit from the strength of AI to unfold a potential that neither human or machine can unlock on its own . We recognize the widespread fear , that AI enabled machines will outsmart the human intelligence . We as Deutsche Telekom think differently . We know and believe in the human strengths like inspiration , intuition , sense making and empathy . But we a lso recognize the strengths of AI like data recall , processing speed and analysis . By combining both , AI systems will help humans to make better decisions and accomplish objectives more effective and efficient . 9 . We share and enlighten . We acknowledge the transformative power of AI for our society . We will support people and society in preparing for this future world . We live our digital responsibility by sharing our knowledge , pointing out the opportunities of the new technology without neglecting its risks . We will engage with our customers , other companies , policy makers , education institutions and all other stakeholders to ensure we understand their concerns and needs and can setup the right safeguards . We will engage in AI and ethics education . Hereby preparing ourselves , our colleagues and our fellow human beings for the new tasks ahead . Many tasks that are being executed by humans now will be automated in the future . This leads to a shift in the demand of skil ls.Jobs will be reshaped , rather replaced by AI . While this seems certain , the minority knows what exactly AI technology is capable of achiev ing . Prejudice and sciolism lead to either demonization of progress or to blind acknowledgment , both calling for educational work . We as Deutsche Telekom feel responsible to enlighten people and help society to deal with the digital shift , so that new appropriate skills can be develo pedand new jobs can be taken over . And we start from within –by enabling our colleagues and employees . But we are aware that this task can not be solve d by one company alone . Therefore we will engage in partnerships with other companies , offer our know -how to policy makers and education providers to jointly tackle the challenges ahead .
