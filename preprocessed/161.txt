developed quickly direct impact aspects societies including basic social economic principles values whereas causing revolution military doctrine equipment profound change way armies operate owing mainly integration use new technologies autonomous capabilities whereas development design artificial intelligence robotics related technologies done humans choices determine potential technology benefit society whereas common union framework must cover development deployment use robotics related technologies must ensure respect human dignity human rights enshrined charter fundamental rights european union whereas union member states particular responsibility make sure robotics related technologies used cross borders basically intended use service humanity common good order contribute general interest citizens whereas union help member states achieve particular begun reflect possible development legal standards legislative changes field whereas european citizens could benefit appropriate effective transparent coherent regulatory approach union level defines sufficiently clear conditions companies develop applications plan business models ensuring union member states retain
