The explosion of artificial intelligence ( AI ) and big data analytics applications is enabled by the extreme availability of data in combina tion wit h the substantial computing power of modern highly distributed computing infrastructures connected by high -speed networks . Machine learning technologies can be trained to perform specific tasks with an efficiency and an accuracy that can supplement and , in some cases , outperform that of humans . These systems provide deep insights by learning from data and interactions with users , which is already leading to a profound transformation of numerous industries , professions and society at large . The curre nt state of AI is , however , still far from delivering truly intelligent behaviour that is comparable to human intelligence . An AI research strategy should therefore carefully analyse AI ’ s history with its various waves of large promises and conceptual shor tcomings . Recent advancements in machine learning have enabled AI technologies to become extremely successful . Speech recognition , natural language interaction with machines and facial recognition based on deep learning are now commodities that have changed the wa y people interact . The machine learning strategy of emulating human performance by learning from human experience promises a solution to the knowledge extraction problem . However , the automated reasoning process is as opaque as human decision making . Evolu tion has enabled humans to collectively reason and act on our collective experience , though other humans are often black boxes . Today , we are confronted with computational artefacts that are adapted to complex human decision making and , thereby , have inher ited a similar “ black box ” behaviour . 1 Preamble – lead author : Lukas Czornomaz Given the penetration of AI across most industries , its potential impact on GDP promises to be very high2 . In Switzerland , AI is already reshaping industries such as banking , insurance , pharmaceuticals and man ufacturin g. Furthermore , Switzerland is the European country that has the highest number of AI start -ups per citizen3 , with more than 100 start ups4 . Many leading countries are heavily investing in AI development strategies and the establishment of technol ogy trans fer centres in this field5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13 2 Chui , M. , et al. , ( 2018 ) .

AI is one of many topics covered in the strategy “ Digitale Schweiz ” . An interdepartmental working group on AI which should ensure knowledge exchange in the domain of AI within the federal administration and coordinate Switzerland 's position s in international bodies , is mandated to submit a report to the Federal Council by September 2019 . Furthermore , an interdisciplinary study on behalf of TA SWISS is evaluating the opportunities and risks of AI on the basis of various focal points : work , ed ucation , media , consumption and administration . The publication of that study is planned for the end of 2019 . The contributors to this publication are convinced that Switzerland can be a frontrunner in selected fields of AI services and applications . Howev er , to attain this position , a structured approach and common direction for efforts in AI research and technology development are required . This document formulates recommendations for an AI strategy for Switzerland . The goal is to position Switzerland as a leading AI country and to amplify and accelerate the positive impact of AI on the Swiss economy . The recommendations are delivered in the context of five important aspects of AI . Switzerland should pioneer a model for an open market for data , stimulating the valuation and exchange of data while ensuring privacy , security and trust . Thus , we propose leveraging Switzerland ’ s unique historical geopolitical reputation and trust to promote itself as a safe harbour for data storage . Furthermore , Switzerland sho uld take the lead in the definition of the general requirements that AI systems should follow to enhance their acceptability by businesses and society . As AI is bein g more widely deployed , it becomes crucial to ensure that these models meet high ethical standards and provide safety . A verification body for AI could provide requirements for trusted ethical and safe AI systems . faire-de-la-france-un-acteur -majeur -de-l-intelligence artifici elle.html ? menu=4 10 Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy . www . cifar.ca/ai/pan canadian -artificial -intelli gence -strategy 11 United Kingdom AI Sector Deals . www . gov.uk/gove rnment/ publications/artificial -intelligence -sector -deal 12 US Presiden t ’ s appro ach to AI . www.whitehouse.gov/wp content/uploads/2018/05/Summary -Report -of-White -House -AISummit . pdf 13 New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan . www.gov.cn/zhengce/content/2017 -07/20/content_5211 996.htm To improve the image of AI , we need to increase human trust in AI . A positive message about how AI empowers humans to become more efficient , makes knowledge more accessible and improves quality of life needs to be communicated . The profound impact of data science on society re quires additional educational efforts to enable the population to meaningfully use this AI technology . Corresponding challenges lead to a demand for AI in higher education but also a profound revision of the topic catalogues in grammar schools . The positive effect of AI on the Swiss economy could be strongly accelerated if we were to create an appropriate framework through which to ease access and enable AI for SMEs . AI empowers SMEs to compete better with larger market actors and to accelerate their growth . 5 Individuals are a major source of data for AI solutions in various fields , including healthcare , education , urban planning , energy , and economics . This chapter focuses o n how personal data can best be harnessed in a fair and sustainable way that protects individuals ’ privacy and digital self determination and how Switzerland can play a leading role in the concomitant democra tization of the personal data economy . Personal data are a new asset class15 , and its market value is estimated to reach more than one trillion Euros in 202016 . Currently , personal data are stored in incompatible silos and are increasingly fuelling the profi ts of a few multinational data companies that of fer free services and smartphone apps in exchange for personal data . This approach has led to a rapid increase in socioeconomic asymmetry in the concentration of and control over personal data17 . With the incr easing use of AI in healthcare , education and ot her disciplines , this asymmetry will increase dramatically since the companies and institutions with the largest amount of data will be able to develop the best algorithms18 . This asymmetry threatens to leave little opportunity for smaller institutions and countries to catch up or compete , particularly countries such as Switzerland .

In the European Union , the rights of individuals to control their personal data have been strengthened with the enactment of the European General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) in May 2018 . In particular , the right to data portability gives EU citizens the opportunity to obtain a digital copy of all their personal data . In the revision of the Swiss data protection law , which is currently being discussed in parliament , the federal council has omitted the data portability provision on the grounds that it d ecreases the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises , a view that is also shared by Economiesuisse19 . Thus , in Switzerland , individuals currently possess significantly less au tonomy in the control of their own data than EU citizens . In a future digi tal global society that is heavily dependent on AI solutions involving personal data , individuals will have to play a central role as the aggregators 19 Djonova , I. , & Herzog , E. ( n.d. ) . Eine Daten politik des Vertrauens für Fortschritt und Innovation ( No . # 03/2018 ) . Retrieved fro m www . economiesuisse.ch/de/entityprint/node/4542 5 A Safe H arbo ur for Data The status quo and Switzerland ’ s future in a global AI dependent digital soc iety14 6 and access controllers of their personal data . In the current financial economy , most citizens possess a b ank account and decide how to invest or spend their money . It is the individual consumer who drives the economy . The role of citizens20,21 in a data -driven society and economy is more central than in the current consumer economy , which is still dominated by physical goods , because three unique features of personal data set them apart from goods and financial assets . F irst , personal data are a nonrivalrous good . In contrast to money and other physical assets , data are not consumed ; they can be copied and reused . This fact makes the article on Data Portability in the EU GDPR a true innovation since it legally entitles data subjects to copies of all their personal data22 . Second , personal d ata are a new asset class that is equally distributed among individuals . In contrast to the uneven distribution of financial assets , our common biology implies that each individual possesses a genome that contains six billion base pairs , has a heart that beats with a similar frequency , consumes similar numbers of meals ( even though caloric i ntake differs ) , etc . Third , and most importantly , individuals are the maximal aggregators of their personal data . Only individuals have the potential and the legal right to aggregate medical , social media , consumer , and genome data . AI solutions in areas s uch as healthcare , education or urban planning are increasingly dependent on the aggregation of such different data types from millions of people . Thus , the individual , as an active producer and aggregator of personal data and consumer of data services , wi ll play an even more important role in a future AI -supported society . For this to happen , however , there is need for a new trust -promoting framework in which citizens pl ay an active role in the personal data economy . 20 Toffler , A . ( 1980 ) .

C omputer Law & Security Review : The International Journal of Technology Law and Practice , 34 ( 2 ) , 1 –11 . doi.or g/10.1016 /j.clsr.2017.10.003 Medical data stored in incompatible silos or on paper has hindered systematic outcomes research and medical research in general . The only datasets that are also in demand internationally are those of cohorts23 funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation , which provide a longitudinal dataset of AIDS patients and healthy individuals and typically contain data from several thousand participants . A trust -promoting framework that supports the fair and active pa rticipation of citizens relies on several of the qualities for which Switzerland is recognized internationally . The one person one vote principle of direct democracy fits well with the equal distribution of personal data . Historically , Switzerland has been a forerunner in democratically controlled coope ratives . Some of Switzerland ’ s alpine farming cooperatives are several hundred years old24 . As a repository and platform for sharing personal data , cooperatives offer two advantages over other organiz ational f orms . Cooperatives belong to their members . Muc h like Swiss citizens who control their government , cooperative members manage their data and control cooperative governance and how revenues are invested . 23 Example 1 : The Swiss Digital H ealth Cohort , https : //www.satw.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/docum ents/02_Themen/08_Kuenstliche -Intelligenz/SATW Swiss_AI_Strategy -Example1.pdf 24 Ostrom , E. ( 2015 ) . Governing the Commons ( Reissued edi tion ) . Cambridge . 7 The Swiss MIDATA cooperative25 , with its non -profit and ethical governance principle , aims to be the founding example of networked personal data cooperatives in other countries , thus promoting the democratization of the personal data economy . Moreover , Switzerland ’ s trusted role as a safe harbour and provider of financial services could be extended t o the management of personal data . Finally , Switzerland ’ s neutrality and its credibility in international organizations will help promote the democ ratizatio n of the personal data economy . Given that personal data is a non -rivalrous good , cooperatives in wh ich citizens control the aggregation of and access to their personal data do not replace but extend the existing global personal data ecosystem . Al l existin g providers of data and AI solutions will benefit from such an extension , since they obtain access t o new data aggregates . Democratically governed cooperatives acting as the fiduciaries of their member ’ s data can ensure that the socioeconomic asymmetry in a global data and AI -dependent society is rebalanced and that the economic benefits of these data ar e also returned to society at large . Switzerland possesses an active and internationally competitive academic research community in machine learnin g , AI , cl oud computing and data security . Recent investments in the Swiss Data Science Center and the Swiss Personal Health Network initiative are further steps in strengthening academic research in the areas of AI . As outlined above , it is essential to empower and enable citizens to become active data aggregators and participants in all areas that rely on the availability of personal data , including healthcare and 25 Example 2 : Box – MIDATA Personal Data Cooperative , https : //www.satw.ch/fileadmin/user_upload/documents/02_Themen/08_Ku enstliche -Intelligenz/SATW -Swiss_AI_Strategy -Example2.pdf education . Early projects and platforms by CERN and the University of Geneva26 as well as ETH Zurich an d the University of Zurich27 to promote and strengthen the participation of citizens in science are encouraging . Two problems remain that the Swiss national parliament must address . First and foremost , it is essential that Switzerland adopt the data portabi lity framework of the EU GDPR . Switzerland should do so , not only because it is the only country in Europe that does not grant its citizens the fundamental right to a digital copy of their personal data but more importantly because it lays the fou ndation f or a citizen -controlled extension of personal data and AI ecosystem . Second , the rapid introduction of an elect ronic identity ( eID ) , which is currently being discussed in parliament , is essential . Countries , such as Estonia , that possess such an eID have seen a transformative shift towards a digital society , with many start -ups and international companies offering new services . Moreover , politicians and the media need to realize that , while it is important to talk about privacy and data protection , it is equally important to talk about the po 26 The Citizen Cyberlab , www . citizencyber lab.org 27 The Citize n Science Center Zürich , citizenscience.ch Recommendations for networked personal data cooperatives 8 tential benefit of open , transparent and fair data sharing . Many studies ha ve shown that people are willing to share data for the benefit of medical research and for personalized information28,29 . Finally , finan cial supp ort for the effective initiation of the transformation to a fair democratically controlled personal data ecosyst em is essential . Once established , a new democratically controlled personal data economy that involves hundreds of millions of people a cross the globe will generate substantial benefits because of the data aggregation power of citizens and because they wil l not only contribute data but also their human intelligence . Run by citizen-owned non -profit cooperatives , these benefits will be returned to s ociety . Examples include real -world patient reported outcomes via smartphone apps and sensors from medical treat ments , drug efficacy or the active recruitment of people for clinical trials .

However , the path to establishing such a democratically controlled data economy can not be financed by cl assical investment strategies that rely on venture capital equity investments . Cooperatives belong to their members , one vote at a time , and thu s can not accept equity investors . Therefore , there is a need for foundations , philanthropists and crowd funding to bridge this initial gap to achieve the breakeven point of data cooperatives . ogy . ( 2018 , June 19 ) .

Aspects s uch as bias or interpretability are nontrivial and require a thorough examination . AI systems should follow general ethical and safety requirements that enhance their acceptab ility by businesses and society . To date , no clear generally accepted guidelines for the implementation of AI systems exist . Therefore , there is a need to define the essential requirements that must be fulfilled by an AI system and the associated verificat ion proce sses . The definition of such ethical and safety requirements and their v erification implies a profound technical expertise but also a more societal , political and philosophical point of view regarding how democracies can adapt to coexist with AI a nd benefi t most from it . The topic of the requirements , validation and verificati on of AI systems is related to software liability , where providers typically are not liable for bugs in their systems or consequential damage caused by a failure of their syst ems . Medi cal software tools or apps also have similar challenges , and their effec tiveness must be provable to be accredited as a medical product . Providing broadly applicable requirements and verification processes could advance the development and dissemi nation of AI systems in Switzerland and thereby support and strengthen the local economy . The global trust in its institutions and democratic system could help to position Switzerland as a global role model that defines widely acceptable guidelines and pro cedures f or AI systems . There are many activities in the field of trust in AI ; increasing the reliability of algorithms is a prerequisite for their deployment in critical applications . Various experts and initiatives aim 32 A Verification Body for AI – lead author : Ma nuel Kugler The aut hors acknowledge Markus C hristen ( Managing Director Digital Society Initiative , Unive rsity of Zurich ) and Christian Westermann ( Leader Data & Analytics , PwC Swit zerland ) fo r their valuable inputs to this section . to foster ethics in AI33,34,35,36,37 . However , there are few concrete projects establishing a holistic view for addressing general ethics and safety requirements across industries and applications other than some limited projects wit h specific applications , e.g. , autonomous cars38 . In different c ountries and cities , laws are implemented to guid e the application of machine learning and the accountability of algorithms39,40 . Currently , we do not know of any concrete measures for the implementation of an interdisciplinary approach to specify the suffic ient and practical requirements for the safety of self-learning systems and to address the validation and verification of AI systems in Switzerland . 33 The p artnership on AI is a multi -stakehol der organization to better understand AI ’ s impacts . www . partnershiponai.org 34 Informatics Europe recomm ends to esta blish means , measures and standards t o assure fair ADM systems . www . informatics -europe.org 35 High -Level Expert Group on Artifi cial Intelligence support s implementation of European AI strategy . ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/high -levelgroup -artifici al-intelligence 36 MIT Turing Box as a certific ation envir onment . turingbox.mit.edu 37 The IEEE Global Initiativ e on Ethics of Autonomous an d Intelligent Systems . standards.ieee.org/industry connections/ec/autonomous -systems.html 38 TÜV SÜD and DFKI to develo p “ TÜV f or Artificial Intelligence ” . www . tuv-sud.com 39 European General Data Protection Regula tion . eugdpr.org 40 New York City Council , Fairness in computing . legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx ?

They should differentiate AI systems based on whether they are truly self -learning , adaptive or fixed . The general guidelines should al so provide a framework to determine whether or not a human is required in the loop depending on the criticality of the application and severity of the consequences of a failure . Decisi on-making systems that are truly self-learning pose the greates t challenges . In such cases , a decoupling of decision making and autonomous action -taking might be required . Another key requirement is to demonstrate the system ’ s flexibility in reacting to ne w situations . The algorithms shou ld be robust and reliable when facing s hifts in data or manipulations of processed data , i.e. , the algorithms have to generalise . The algorithms should be able to detect when the input data are outside of the trained capabi lities and defined boundaries . Le arning algorithms must be enha nced by an automonitoring capability to assess the uncertainty in the algorithm ’ s knowledge of the domain/world . Often , it is essential to know what one does not know . To minimize the risk of a system failure in such an event , a domain -specific process is required , e.g. , a feedback loop so humans can remain in control of the system ’ s response . The control of bias in data or AI systems must be considered . AI systems should be fair , and they shoul d not fall prey to unintended disc rimination . There must be a s trong eth ical definition of what an AI system should and should not decide . In particular , the responsibility for a system failure needs to be clarified . Along with such design principles , all AI systems should be able to expla in the reasons , at an adequate level o f detail , of why they made certain decision and what the determining factors were in the input and training data . Bias and explainability are essential requirements linked to ethics an d liability . Security aspects are crucial , particularly in cybe rsecurity . A successfully tested AI system should be verified as safe against known adversarial attacks . The performance of the algorithms and their adaptation needs to be verifiable while maintaining individuals ’ data privacy and the intellectual property rights o f the system developers . The verification process should be as transparent and explainable as possible . Thus , the key components of the verification and validation procedures should be based on open source systems . There are numerous incentives fo r Switzerland to establish a place to define requirements and verify AI systems . Given its neutrality and reputation as a mediator , Switzerland is in a very favourable position . Being known wor ldwide for excellence in produc t quality and services , trust in Switzerl and as a reliable state with profound ethical standards is high and could also apply to Swiss verified AI systems . Being small and independent , Switzerland is more agile than other Eur opean countries . In addition , S witzerland has internationally known rese arch institutes in the field of AI , and various large technology companies that are leaders in AI have research facilities here . Bringing together industry , Essential general r equirements of AI sy stems 11 research institutes and tec hnology companies as well as governmental institutions to set u p a requi rements and verification process is demanding but crucial and in the interest of all the involved parties . Based on the statements above , we recommend defining an institution at the go vernmental level in Switzerland to assume responsibility for th e require ments and verification of AI systems . - The institution should provide clear but flexible general guidelines for testing algorithms . - The guidelines should be extended by industry specif ic standards and include different levels of requirements depen ding on t he criticality of the use cases and the severity of the consequences in case of failure . - Standards and guidelines can be verified by existing industry -specific service providers and te sting bodies . - The proposed body could be organised as an extraparliament ary committee41 or existing verification bodies42 . An expert committee consisting of academic and industry specialists in AI core technology , industry use cases , security , societal implications a nd ethics should be instal led to develop an implementation plan for suc h a requirements and verification institution . SATW would be willing to organise and coordinate such a committee in collaboration with a government body . 41 www.admin.ch/gov/de/start/bundesrecht/ausserparlam entarische kommissionen.html 42 Nation al Institute of Standards and Technology , U.S. Department of Commerce . www.nist.gov/topics/artificial -intelligence 12 The availability of affordabl e , highly parallel computing , vast amounts of training data , and economic interest from large corporate actors in “ big da ta ” has led to large -scale AI systems capable of solving problems that w ere , until recently , consi dered unsolvable for at least a decad e , if eve r. It is predicted that these novel and complex AI technologies will impact virtually every human activity , from health and education to manufacturing and warfare , and will become central in the lives of citize ns and consumers . In this context , it will be critical to improve the AI image in public discourse ; hence , we are also focusing on “ human trust in AI ” by stud ying how to improve the multifaceted trust between human users and “ AI s ystems ” by making the systems more robust , more intelligible to human mi nds , and more aligned with society ’ s needs . This ambitious goal should develop along three complementary axes : Trust in AI as an a bstract object . A clear quantification of AI ’ s techni cal performance is fundame ntal to allowing humans to anticipate its fail ures and conversely to trust it when it operates in a properly functioning regime , just as one constantly infers the behaviour of other humans to safely interact with them . Research an d development should place particular emphasis on the challenge of deter mining the uncertainty in the learned knowledge of AI agents . How can we specify AI ’ s expected performance ? How can we ensure that this level of perf ormance is reached ? Additionally , at a more fundamental level , how can we create a common understa nding bet ween humans and AI ? Trust in AI as an operational system . Can we trust that there will be proper handling of the required mass of data , particularly regarding privacy laws and intellec tual property , 43 Raise Human Trust in A I – lead a utho r : Hervé Bou rlard The author acknowledges Dr. François Fleuret fro m the Idiap Research Institute for hi s inputs to this section . or that the resulting systems will be robust to adversari al attacks , as is expected from any critical software ? Security is a central topic in practice , as an AI system remains a complex piece of software running in a failure -prone and vulne rable physical device . Trust in the impact of AI on society . Our common sense has been shaped over thousands of years to handle the risks and benefits of dealing with either objects devoid of cognition or intelligent human beings . AI creates a new category to which our most fundame ntal behaviours h ave not ( yet ) been a dapted . H ow can we prepare citizens for pervasive intelligent systems that will influence them in all their decisions , including personal and societal decisions ? How can we ensure that AI follo ws basic ethical principle s and adapts to s ocietal changes ? How can we f orecast the disruptions AI may cause to the economy ? Additionally , we believe that reproducibility and openness in the context of extremely complex AI models and large scale data corpo ra are critical and require a strong commitm ent to and investme nt in “ op en science ” tools and practices that will be central to the project . Increase Human Trust in AI An a mbitious but necessary objective43 13 It is clear that Switzerland has reached a critical mass in regard to the technical expertise re quired to improve AI and make it trus tworthy a nd safe . However , at the national level , there is no initiative that brings the different players together in a common forum that could act as a force multiplier . Even more problematic is the scattered expertis e and the lack of coordinated researc h on the implications that AI will have for various aspects of our society , ranging from the economy to law to ethics , which is a situation that , nevertheless , reflects what is typical of AI re search worldwide . In this context , the expert committee propose d for the verification of AI systems would have the right to take a leading role in increasing human trust in and public awareness of AI . Efforts should be focused on sharing positive messages about the impact of AI on society , increasing the transparency of AI sol utions by generally requiring explainability in software , and finally encouraging societal debates about wider social consequences of AI technologies .

As a consequence , knowledge will be “ democratized ” , potentially also impro ving the enforcement of data privacy . Positive changes in the quality of life : There are a growing number of AI applications that actively improve people ’ s lives and create positive changes in the world . For instance , A I systems will help improve clinical diagnoses ( e.g. , applying AI to various types of healthcare data , cancer detection ) , medical prevention , or the diagnosis of faults in physical systems . AI also has the potential to improve far ming and food production p rocesses . Finally , the security of pe ople ( including children ’ s safety ) , systems ( communication ) , and criminal activity prevention will be improved . More efficient society : Through AI , society will have the potential to become more efficient , for instance , by optimizing traffic and transporta tion syst ems , reducing waste , and improving ecological behaviours . AI has great potential to support human society in facing the challenge of climate change and other global threats .

We should encourage ways to embed tr ansparency and clarity int o the software ( as well as hardware ) . For instance , when AI makes life -changing judgments ar ound sentencing , welfare , and medical decisions , it is fair to assume that those affected need to know how these decisions were made . Address m ultifaceted AI conce rns : Encourage debates across society to ensur e that we use the various AI technologies ( which are changing the way we behave , wo rk and interact with others ) in ways that are ultimately beneficial and that consider many kinds of c oncerns . Clearly identify long-term impacts of AI developments : The technology industry must recognise the long -term impacts of AI developments and assume responsibility for the wider social consequences of its w ork . This goal requires policy makers to st art thinking seriously abo ut the challenges that may arise from the adva ncement and increasing application of AI across all industrial sectors . Engage business and citizens in discussions : Businesses and citizens need to become more broadly engaged in the discussions , recognising t heir common stakes in defining the future . Thanks to AI , we have the opportunity to redesign many aspects of our world and to make the most of the opportunities provi ded by new technologie s. We must focus on making these changes i n ways that we all trust a nd that 46 Could transparency make AI safe and reduce public fears ?

Focused studies , monitoring and anal ysis47 : AI guidance should be developed through focused and multidisciplinary studies , monitoring , and an alysis . Maximizing the impact of AI d evelopmen ts and their acceptability by soc iety will indeed require engagement with cross disciplinary groups , including computer scientists , social scientists , psychologists , economists , and la wyer . Increase transpar ency and data privacy : In that direction , the EU General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) 48 is prob ably the most important change in data privacy regulation in 20 years . 47 AI , People , and S ociety , Eric Horvitz , Science , July 2017 : Vol . 357 , Issu e 6346 , science.sciencemag.org/content/357/63 46/7 48 eugdpr.org 15 Machine learning and AI are currently funda mentally changing the way we think ab out compu ting at larg e , especially how we approach algorithm design , software engineering and computer systems engineering . Modern intelligent decision -making systems process and interpret high volume data streams for c omputer vision , natural language and speech pr ocessing , ro botics , and health data analysis and , more generally , for flexible data -centric model building in engineering , natural science and , for the first time , in the humanities . S uch systems commonly proce ss heterogeneous data with substantia l uncerta inty caused by measurements . Classical concepts of how to establish the correctness of planning and decision -making algorithms when they process uncertain data often rely on worst -case guarantees that do not se em to be adequate and predictive enou gh for many real -world applications . Self -adapting AI algorithms must generalize well over fluctuations and model misspecifications ; they should be resilient by proper regularization to avoid o verfitting , i.e. , “ reading the tea leaves ” . On the other hand , versatile intelligent systems should also be sufficiently flexible to exploit the signal in data to its full extent for prediction . Intelligent decision -making systems should provide ( provable ) guarantees to deliver typ ical answers with a high predictive v alue ; how ever , scient ifically , it is still mostly unknown what that means for algorithm design , and we need large research programs to make progress on these questions beyond the standard parad igm of supervised machine learning . Research on these fundament al questi ons will als o strengthen public trust in this technology that is about to be deployed for autonomous transport , for health care applications , for societal infrastructure management and for public and private se rvices , including entertainment . 49 AI in Higher Educ ation – lead author : Joachim Buhmann AI in Higher Education A core research topic49 16 Where does higher and conti nuous education stand in this scientific revolution ? Computational thinking has clearly amended the scientific method , the unforeseeabl y successful methodology o f industrialized societies , by adding a third pillar to empiricism – experimentation , theory bu ilding and computational modelling . In light of the big data challenge , we must revisit all aspects of computational thinking and fuse it with probabilistic reas oning . Lessons from the history of AI indicate that the reduction of intelligent behaviour to l ogical calculus delivers successful expert systems but can also be interpreted as one of the causes of the AI winter since neither the scientific community nor t he general public has seen its high e xpectatio ns of AI fulfilled . Human intelligence clearly em ploys rational logical calculus , but it seems to be even more governed by our subconscious abilities to imitate intelligent behaviours and , more importantly , by our capacity to teach such behaviours to other human beings across generations . Deep learning , with its inherent connectionism , emulates this style of thinking as opposed to the symbolic reasoning strategy and connects to the age of cybernetics before symb olic AI . We see predictive patterns i n data ap parently without using a consciously accessible , “ rationally accessible ” theory ; for example , medical doctors are top experts in using their experience to achieve successful benefits i n health care with often v ery little theoretical understanding that woul d explain the success in diagnosis , prognosis and therapy . Current educational programs in higher education have to evolve to strengthen probabilistic computational thinking . Such a mindset will be vital for our future society since it will larg ely deter mine the value generation of future products and service . Are we prepared for these challenges in higher education ? Current curricula in computer science emphasize a scientific methodo logy for algorithms and sy stems design and their analysis , which mostly focuses on the efficient usage of computational resou rces such as memory requirements and processing time . Data science , as a necessary prerequisite for intelligent reasoning , planning and acting in the real wo rld , demands resilient algorithms and systems design in computation . These two scientific cultures must be fused into a coherent picture of computational reasoning and inference . Resource efficient computation should be balanced w ith the predictive power o f computational solutions . In many ap plication s , this trade -off leads to a win -win situation in whi ch superior predictions can be computed in a more efficient way than with traditional algorithmic approaches . AI education should be modernized 17 Are our students in higher educati on well p repared for this epochal paradigm shift ? The answers to this question depend on their specialization of s tudies and the role of model building by computation in the respective field . R equired knowledge and skil ls could range from the developer lev el , where novel AI solutions are created and deployed , to various grades of the expert user level , where there is creative usage of AI tools in various application domains . Science , technology , engineering and mathemati cs ( STEM ) students mostly acquire a solid basi s for this paradigm shift due to rigorous mathematical training . Future curricula reforms should be asses sed according to criteria that strengthen these educational goals . The long tra dition of deterministic co mputational thinking has to be complemented by a rigorous education in probabilistic modelling and the design of probabilistic algorithms that can deli ver typical solutions and readily adapt to changing input data properties , demo nstrating at least traces of intelligence . In addition , a knowl edge of s ystems theory and ( optimal ) control should also be substantially required in disciplines outside of engin eering . The evolution of the scientific method by probabilistic computational t hinking has to influence c urricula in all scientific discipline s , rangin g from physics to theology . Digitalization and intelligent information processing affect nearly all areas of human thought and will leave a profound footprint on all disciplines . Novel ways to conduct research are expected to emerge in the humanit ies when intelligent search algorithms can scan large digital libraries orders of magnitude faster than human investigators ; sociological experiments can be conducted at the scale of societies . Research strategies from the natural sciences and engineering might sub stantially enrich the method catalogue of the humanities , and conversely , a novel common language will al so enrich the STEM disciplines with advances in computational humanities . As a society , we should make pa r-ticular efforts to empower all stude nts in higher education to participate in these societal transformations . What are the needs of the workforce in the private and public sectors ? AI technologies have enriched the start -up culture with novel models of co llaboration and communication . Work t eams are now forming over virtual platforms , and continuous education migh t be provided through such platforms . AI tools affect the job profile of intellectuals and highly skilled brain workers . The critical thinking skills of such employees will be essent ial in th is transformation when algorithms start to replace experts in the ir decision making roles . Imagine a radiologist interacting with an automated radiology scoring program : for various ta sks , the algorithm already delivers superior performance in sco ring radi ology images due to its speed and enormous storage capacity . The humans in the loop have to be able to evaluate the machine ’ s decisions , and such a competence for quality assurance requires profound computation al training . Continuous educational p rograms w ill serve such an educational need . In particular , aging societie s should allocate the necessary resources for continuous education to remain competitive with societies of developing c ountries that are usually characterized by much younger populat ions than the highly industrialized world . Getting our student s and workforce ready for AI 18 AI has not been an important sub ject in higher education in Switzerland . Few educational cours es have been available in the last 20 -30 years , and those only showed si ngle aspects of AI in light of a particular approach . Furthermore , computer science has not been viewed as a strong and im portant field of its own but often been subsumed under other s ciences . Only very recentl y has this approach started to change , for exa mple in the “ Lehrplan 21 ” . Consequently , we do not find much representation of computer science skills among the manageme nt of SMEs in Switzerland . Notably , a deep understanding of al gorithms , modelling , or so ftware architecture is a rare skill t hat is highly in demand . This lack of skills makes it very difficult for SMEs to assess what AI can truly do to bring innovation to their businesses and what type of problems can be solved by the current state of AI tec hnology . Many industry representative s are dee ply influenced by the deep learning hype and believe that this technology is all that AI is about and that it will solve a ll problems . Furthermore , the hysteria about AI as a job kille r encourages many companie s to prefer to look into optimization and auto mation scenarios but less into innovation . Becoming more efficient and flexible is important ; however , such a mindset does not necessarily lead to innovative products and services . Num erous companies struggle t o understand the impact of digitaliza tion and novel technologies on their business . These companies need to link technology ( computer science , AI and others ) to the tra nsformation scenarios that may turn out to be highly relevant for them . For example , consider booking.com ( or uber.com ) , wher e brokers have taken over a market and created a difficult situation for the local Swiss hotel industry . A similar effort is curren tly underway in Switzerland to establish a brokering service f or 50 Enable AI for SMEs – lead author : Jana Koehler access to AI -related te chnological know how .
