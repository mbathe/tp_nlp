development three main objectives develop ethical framework development deployment guide digital transition everyone benefits technological revolution open national international forum discussion collectively achieve equitable inclusive ecologically sustainable development declaration principles declaration first objective consists identifying ethical principles values promote fundamental interests people groups principles applied digital artificial intelligence field remain general abstract read correctly important keep following points mind although presented list hierarchy last principle less important first however possible depending circumstances lend weight one principle another consider one principle relevant another although diverse must interpreted consistently prevent conflict could prevent applied general rule limits one principle application defined another principle field application although reflect moral political culture society developed provide basis intercultural international dialogue although interpreted different ways interpreted way imperative interpretation coherent although ethical principles translated political language interpreted legal fashion recommendations made based principles establish guidelines digital transition within declaration ethical framework aims covering key themes reflect transition towards society helps promote common good algorithmic governance digital literacy digital inclusion diversity ecological declaration declaration montréal declaration addressed person organization company wishes take part

able alert public opinion necessary also addressed political representatives whether elected named whose citizens expect take stock developing social changes quickly establish framework allowing digital transition serves greater good anticipate serious risks presented declaration according method declaration born inclusive deliberation process initiates dialogue citizens experts public

perceive declaration open guidance document revised adapted according evolution knowledge techniques well user feedback use society end declaration elaboration process reached starting point open inclusive conversation surrounding future humanity served artificial intelligence technologies first time human history possible create autonomous systems capable performing complex tasks natural intelligence alone thought capable processing large quantities information calculating predicting learning adapting responses changing situations recognizing classifying objects given immaterial nature tasks analogy human intelligence designate wideranging systems general name artificial intelligence artificial intelligence constitutes major form scientific technological progress generate considerable social benefits improving living conditions health facilitating justice creating wealth bolstering public safety mitigating impact human activities environment climate intelligent machines limited performing better calculations human beings also interact sentient beings keep company take care however development artificial intelligence pose major ethical challenges social risks indeed intelligent machines restrict choices individuals groups lower living standards disrupt organization labor job market influence politics clash fundamental rights exacerbate social economic inequalities affect ecosystems climate environment although scientific progress living society always carry risk citizens determine moral political ends give meaning risks encountered uncertain world lower risks deployment greater benefits artificial intelligence first danger artificial intelligence development consists giving illusion master future calculations reducing society series numbers ruling algorithmic procedures old pipe dream still drives human ambitions comes human affairs tomorrow rarely resembles today numbers determine moral value socially desirable principles current declaration like points moral compass help guide development artificial intelligence toward morally socially desirable ends also offer ethical framework promotes internationally recognized human rights fields affected rollout artificial intelligence taken whole principles articulated lay foundation cultivating social trust toward artificially intelligent systems principles current declaration
