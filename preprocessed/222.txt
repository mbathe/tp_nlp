FRA Focus 1Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcementHELPING TO MAKE FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS A REALITY FOR EVERYONE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION FRA Focus Facial recognition technology ( FRT ) makes it possible to compare digital facial images to determine whether they are of the same person . Comparing footage obtained from video cameras ( CCTV ) with images in databases is referred to as ‘ live facial recognition technology ’ . Examples of national law enforcement authorities in the EU using such technology are sparse – but several are testing its potential . This paper therefore looks at the fundamental rights implications of relying on live FRT , focusing on its use for law enforcement and border-management purposes . EU law recognises as ‘ sensitive data ’ people ’ s facial images , which are a form of biometric data . But such images are also quite easy to capture in public places . Although the accuracy of matches is improving , the risk of errors remains real – particularly for certain minority groups . Moreover , people whose images are captured and processed might not know this is happening – and so can not challenge possible misuses . The paper outlines and analyses these and other fundamental rights challenges that are triggered when public authorities deploy live FRT for law enforcement purposes . It also briefly presents steps to take to help avoid rights violations . Contents 1 .

Facial recognition technology and fundamental rights : setting the scene This focus paper explores fundamental rights impli cations that should be taken into account when developing , deploying , using and regulating facial recognition technologies . It draws on recent analy ses and data ( Section 3 and Section 4 ) and evidence from interviews conducted with experts and rep resentatives of national authorities who are test ing facial recognition technologies ( Section 5 ) .1 The last sections ( Section 6 and Section 7 ) provide a brief legal analysis summarising applicable Euro pean Union ( EU ) and Council of Europe law . The paper forms part of FRA ’ s larger research pro ject on artificial intelligence , big data and fundamen tal rights.2 It is the first paper to focus on the uses of facial recognition technology , and builds on the agency ’ s extensive past work on the fundamental rights implications of the use of biometric data in large-scale EU information systems in the field of migration , asylum and borders.3 Facial recognition technology ( FRT ) allows the auto matic identification of an individual by matching two or more faces from digital images . It does this by detecting and measuring various facial features , extracting these from the image and , in a second step , comparing them with features taken from other faces.4 In the private sector , facial recognition technology is widely used for advertisement , marketing and other purposes , with individual customers profiled and identified to predict their preferences towards 1 FRA carried out eleven interviews between March and May 2019 , in EU Member States such as Germany , France and the United Kingdom , to gain better insight into current testing , and the potential use , of facial recognition technology . 2 The following have been published so far as part of the research project : FRA ( 2018 ) , # BigData : Discrimination in datasupported decision making , Luxembourg , Publications Office , May 2018 ; FRA ( 2019 ) , Data quality and artificial intelligence – mitigating bias and error to protect fundamental rights , Luxembourg , Publications Office , June 2019 .

It also opens new possibilities for public administration , including law enforcement and border management . A consid erable increase in accuracy achieved in the past few years has prompted many public authorities and private businesses to start using , testing or planning the use of facial recognition technologies across the world . This , in turn , has sparked an intense debate on its potential impact on fundamental rights . For exam ple , the large-scale use of facial recognition tech nology in combination with surveillance cameras in the People ’ s Republic of China has led to many discussions and concerns about potential human rights violations , particularly with respect to detect ing members of certain ethnic minorities.9 Follow ing an increased use of facial recognition in the US , a national survey published in September 2019 by the Pew Research Centre finds that , while slightly more than every second American ( 56 % ) trusts law enforcement agencies to use these technologies responsibly , smaller shares of the public say they 5 See for example : Italy , Garante per la protezione dei dati personali , Installazione di apparati promozionali del tipo “ digital signage ” ( definiti anche Totem ) presso una stazione ferroviaria , 21 December 2017 . 6 See EDRi , “ Danish DPA approves Automated Facial Recognition ” , 19 June 2019 . 7 See The Telegraph , “ AI used for first time in job interviews in UK to find best applicants ” , 27 September 2019 . 8 See Wired , “ Facebook can now find your face , even when it ’ s not tagged ” , 19 December 2017 . 9 Human Rights Council ( 2019 ) , Surveillance and human rights .

FRA Focus 3have such trust in technology companies ( 36 % ) or advertisers ( 18 % ) .10 In a number of European countries , facial recogni tion technologies are being tested or used in differ ent contexts in both private and public spheres . This paper examines a specific aspect : comparing foot age obtained from video cameras ( CCTV ) against databases of facial images ( e.g . a watchlist ) for lawenforcement and border-management purposes . Often referred to as ‘ live facial recognition tech nology ’ , it is a specific form of video surveillance – and analyses of its fundamental rights implica tions are lacking . To date , there are few examples of national law enforcement authorities using live facial recogni tion technology in Europe . Defining law enforcement authorities The term ‘ law enforcement authorities ’ refers to Member State agencies and encompass “ com petent authorities for the purposes of the pre vention , investigation , detection or prosecu tion of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties , including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to pub lic security ” . Source : Law Enforcement Directive , Article 1 ( 1 ) The United Kingdom has tested facial recognition technology to identify people in real time by using street cameras . Other European Union ( EU ) Member States have engaged in testing and made plans for using facial recognition technology . For example , in Hungary , a project called ‘ Szitakötő ’ ( dragonfly ) plans to deploy 35,000 cameras with facial recogni tion capabilities in Budapest and across the country . The cameras will capture drivers ’ license plates and facial images for maintaining public order , including road safety.11 The Czech government has approved a plan to expand the use of facial recognition cam eras − from 100 to 145 − at the Prague International Airport.12 Police in Germany and France have car ried out extensive testing . Sweden ’ s data protection 10 Pew Research Center ( 2019 ) , “ More Than Half of U.S . Adults Trust Law Enforcement to Use Facial Recognition Responsibly ” . 11 See e.g . at Hungary Today , “ CCTV : Is it Big Brother or the Eye of Providence ? ” , 18 January 2019 . For the multiple legal – primarily data protection-related – concerns raised by the Hungarian Data Protection Authority in connection with this project , see the letter available on the Authority ’ s website . 12 See Biometriupdate.com , “ Expanded use of facial recognition at Prague international airport approved ” , 10 March 2019. authority has recently authorised the use of facial recognition technology by the police to help identify criminal suspects , which allows the police to compare facial images from CCTV footage to a watchlist containing over 40,000 pictures.13 The processing of facial images is expected to be introduced more systematically in large-scale EU-level IT systems used for asylum , migration and security purposes.14 As outlined in Section 5 , most of these EU-wide systems will process facial images in the future , once the necessary legal and technical steps are completed . These images will be taken in controlled environments – for example , at police stations or border-crossing points , where the quality of the images is higher compared to that of CCTV cameras . FRA has already pointed to the fundamental rights risks of processing facial images in such IT systems in earlier publications.15 Despite the strong push from private industry and other stakeholders to use facial recognition technol ogy , strong opposition has emerged , citing weak nesses . This led , for example , the world ’ s largest corporate supplier of police body cameras ( Axon ) to announce this year that it would not deploy facial recognition technology in any of its prod ucts – because it was too unreliable for law enforce ment work and “ could exacerbate existing inequi ties in policing , for example by penalising black or LGBTQ communities ” .16 In a similar vein , the city of San Francisco in the United States , among other cit ies , has banned the use of the technology because of its excessively intrusive nature into people ’ s pri vacy and to avoid possible abuse by law enforce ment agencies.17 Against this backdrop , a number of questions arise from a fundamental rights perspective : is this technology appropriate for law enforcement and border management use – for example , when it is used to identify people who are wanted by law 13 See e.g . Datainspektionen , “ Polisen får använda ansiktsigenkänning för att utreda brott ” , 24 October 2019 and NewEurope , “ Sweden authorises the use of facial recognition technology by the police ” , 28 October 2019 . 14 For more information , see Table 2 . 15 FRA ( 2018 ) , Interoperability and fundamental rights implications – Opinion of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights , FRA Opinion 1/2018 [ Interoperability ] , Vienna , 11 April 2018 ; FRA ( 2018 ) , The revised Visa Information System and its fundamental rights implication – Opinion of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights , FRA Opinion 2/2018 [ VIS ] , Vienna , 30 August 2018 ; FRA ( 2018 ) , Under watchful eyes : biometrics , EU IT systems and fundamental rights , Luxembourg , Publications Office , March 2018 ; FRA ( 2017 ) , Fundamental rights and the interoperability of EU information systems : borders and security , Luxembourg , Publications Office , June 2017 . 16 Crawford , K.

Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 4enforcement ? Which fundamental rights are most affected when this technology is deployed – and what measures should public authorities take to guarantee that these rights are not violated ? The risk of errors in matching faces is the most fre quently raised fundamental rights concern . How ever , fundamental rights concerns also stem from the weak position of the individuals whose facial images are captured and processed . Fundamental rights affected include , among others , human dig nity , the right to respect for private life , the pro tection of personal data , non-discrimination , the rights of the child and the elderly , the rights of peo ple with disabilities , the freedom of assembly and association , the freedom of expression , the right to good administration , and the right to an effec tive remedy and to a fair trial . For example , facial recognition technology has higher error rates when used on women and peo ple of colour , producing biased results , which can ultimately result in discrimination . The use of facial recognition technology can also have a negative impact on the freedom of assembly , if people fear that facial recognition technology is being used to identify them ( “ chilling effect ” ) . Moreover , there are possible long-term implications , which are not within the scope of this focus paper . Curtailing privacy by processing large amounts of personal data , including in particular individual faces , may ultimately affect the functioning of democracy , since privacy is a core value inherent to a liberal democratic and pluralist society , and a cornerstone for the enjoyment of fundamental rights . Civil society and private companies have advocated for a clear regulatory framework of facial recognition technology.18 Furthermore , the European Commis sion ’ s High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelli gence ( HLEG AI ) specifically recommends the pro portionate use of facial recognition technology and suggests that its application must be clearly war ranted in existing laws,19 given its growth fuelled by the increasing use of artificial intelligence . Case law is still virtually non-existent , with one recent exception adjudicated in the United Kingdom ( judg ment not final ) .20 18 See , for example , Big Brother Watch , Face Off Campaign , May 2019 ; Microsoft , Facial recognition : It ’ s time for action , 6 December 2018 .

FRA Focus 52 . Facial images as a unique biometric identifier in EU law People ’ s facial images constitute biometric data : they are more or less unique , can not be changed , and can not easily be hidden . Facial images are also easy to capture : in contrast to other biometric iden tifiers , such as fingerprints or DNA , a person is typi cally unable to avoid having their facial image cap tured and monitored in public . EU law regulates the processing of facial images under the EU data protection acquis . Table 1 provides an over view of relevant EU data protection instruments , their subject matter , and whether they govern the process ing of facial images as biometric data . In the field of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters , the Law Enforcement Directive ( Directive ( EU ) 2016/680 ) 21 is the most relevant instrument . It establishes a com prehensive system of personal data protection in the context of law enforcement.22 The Law Enforcement Directive specifically refers to facial images as ‘ biom etric data ’ when used for biometric matching for the purposes of the unique identification or authentica tion of a natural person.23 The sectorial EU instruments governing large-scale EU information systems in the field of migration and security , listed in Table 2 in Section 5.2 , complement the EU data protection acquis . Biometric data is defined as “ personal data result ing from specific technical processing relating to the physical , physiological or behavioural characteristics 21 Directive ( EU ) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention , investigation , detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties , and on the free movement of such data , and repealing Council Framework Decision 2008/977/JHA , OJ 2016 L 119/89 ( Law Enforcement Directive ) , OJ L 119 , 4.5.2016 , pp . 89-131 .

Digital facial images belong to the first category . Recital ( 51 ) of the GDPR makes a distinction between the legal nature of simple ‘ photographs ’ and biom etric ‘ facial images ’ . The definition of biometric data applies to photographs only when these are processed through specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person.26 ‘ Special categories ’ of personal data “ [ P ] ersonal data revealing racial or ethnic ori gin , political opinions , religious or philosophical beliefs , or trade union membership , and the pro cessing of genetic data , biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural per son , data concerning health or data concerning a natural person ’ s sex life or sexual orientation. ” Source : Law Enforcement Directive , Article 10 ( 1 ) ; GDPR , Article 9 ( 1 ) and Regulation ( EU ) 2018/1725 , Article 10 ( 1 ) Due to their sensitive nature , facial images fall into the ‘ special categories of personal data ’ or sensi tive data .

What is facial recognition technology ? Facial recognition technologies are biometric sys tems that allow the automatic identification and matching of a person ’ s face . The technology extracts and further processes biometric data by creating a ‘ biometric template ’ .28 For facial images , a biome tric template detects and measures various facial features.29 Facial recognition Facial recognition is the “ automatic processing of digital images which contain the faces of indi viduals for identification , authentication/verifi cation or categorisation of those individuals ” . Source : Article 29 Data Protection Working Party ( 2012 ) , Opinion 02/2012 on facial recognition in online and mobile services , 00727/12/EN , WP 192 , Brussels , 22 March 2012 , p. 2 Facial recognition refers to a multitude of technol ogies that can perform different tasks for different purposes . In this regard , a key distinction is whether facial recognition is used for verification , identifi cation or categorisation . Verification and identifi cation deal with matching unique characteristics of individuals to determine their individual iden tity . Categorisation deals with deducing whether an individual belongs to a specific group based on his or her biometric characteristics – for example , sex , age , or race . In the past few years , facial recognition technolo gies have strongly benefitted from increased data availability , computing power and the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms . 28 Article 29 Data Protection Working Party ( 2012 ) , Opinion 3/2012 on developments in biometric technologies , 00720/12/ EN , WP193 , Brussels , 27 April 2012 . 29 ‘ Biometric template ’ means a mathematical representation obtained by feature extraction from biometric data limited to the characteristics necessary to perform identifications and verifications ( see Art . 4 ( 12 ) of Regulation ( EU ) 2019/818 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 on establishing a framework for interoperability between EU information systems in the field of police and judicial cooperation , asylum and migration and amending Regulations ( EU ) 2018/1726 , ( EU ) 2018/1862 and ( EU ) 2019/816 , OJ L 135 , 22.5.2019 , pp . 85-135 ) .3.1 . Verification ( one-to-one comparison ) Verification or authentication is often referred to as one-to-one matching . It enables the comparison of two biometric templates , usually assumed to belong to the same individual.30 Two biometric templates are compared to determine if the person shown on the two images is the same person . Such a procedure is , for example , used at Automated Border Control ( ABC ) gates used for border checks at airports . A person scans his or her passport image and a live image is taken on the spot . The facial recognition technology compares the two facial images and if the likelihood that the two images show the same person is above a certain threshold , the identity is verified . Verification does not demand that the biometric features be deposited in a central data base . They may be stored , for example , on a card or in an identity/travel document of an individual . 3.2 . Identification ( one-tomany comparison ) Identification means that the template of a person ’ s facial image is compared to many other templates stored in a database to find out if his or her image is stored there . The facial recognition technology returns a score for each comparison indicating the likelihood that two images refer to the same person . Sometimes images are checked against databases , where it is known that the reference person is in the database ( closed-set identification ) , and sometimes , where this is not known ( open-set identification ) . The latter operation would be applied when persons are checked against watchlists . Using facial recog nition technology for identification is sometimes referred to as Automated Facial Recognition ( AFR ) .31 Identification can be used based on facial images obtained from video cameras . For this purpose , the system first needs to detect if there is a face on the video footage . Smart phone users might know 30 See also Kindt , E.

( 2018 ) , An Evaluation of South Wales Police ’ s use of Automated Facial Recognition , Cardiff University , September 2018 . Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 8when taking pictures that sometimes the camera automatically draws rectangles over faces . Faces on video footage are extracted and then com pared against the facial images in the reference database to identify whether the person on the video footage is in the database of images ( e.g . on the watchlist ) . Such systems are referred to as Live Facial Recognition Technology ( LFRT ) .32 The quality of the facial images extracted from video cameras can not be controlled : light , distance and position of the person captured on the video footage limit the facial features . Therefore , live facial recogni tion technologies are more likely to result in false matches as compared to facial images taken in a controlled environment , such as a border crossing point or a police station . 3.3 . Categorisation ( matching general characteristics ) Apart from verification and identification , facial rec ognition technology is also used to extract infor mation about an individual ’ s characteristics . This is sometimes referred to as ‘ face analysis ’ . It can , therefore , also be used for profiling individuals , which involves categorising individuals based on their personal characteristics.33 Characteristics com monly predicted from facial images are sex , age and ethnic origin . Categorisation means that the tech nology is not used to identify or match individu als , but only characteristics of individuals , which do not necessarily allow for identification . However , if several characteristics are inferred from a face , and potentially linked to other data ( e.g . location data ) , it could de facto enable the identification of an individual . 32 Fussey , P. and Murray , D. ( 2019 ) , Independent Report on the London Metropolitan Police Service ’ s Trial of Live Facial Recognition Technology , University of Essex , Human Rights Centre , July 2019 . 33 See FRA ( 2018 ) , Preventing unlawful profiling today and in the future : a guide , Luxembourg , Publications Office , December 2018.The use of facial recognition technology does not stop here . Researchers and companies have exper imented with inferring other characteristics from facial images , such as sexual orientation.34 Such tests are highly controversial from an ethics perspective . Facial recognition technology can also be used to infer emotions , such as anger , fear or happiness , and to detect whether people are lying or telling the truth . The latter was researched at selected EU external borders ( Greece , Hungary and Latvia ) in the framework of the Integrated Portable Con trol System ( iBorderCtrl ) project , which integrates facial recognition and other technologies to detect if a person is saying the truth.35 The serious fundamental rights implications of the categorisation of individuals based on facial images is beyond the scope of this paper , which focuses on the use of facial recognition technology for iden tification purposes . 34 Wang , Y. and Kosinski , M.

FRA Focus 94 . Accuracy of facial recognition technology : assessing the risks of wrong identification 4.1 . Technological developments and performance assessment The high level of attention given to facial recognition technology in the recent past stems from strong accu racy gains achieved since 2014.36 The accuracy gains are mainly attributed to the availability of increased computational power , massive amounts of data ( dig ital images of people and their faces ) , and the use of modern machine learning algorithms.37 Determining the necessary level of accuracy of facial recognition software is challenging : there are many different ways to evaluate and assess accuracy , also depending on the task , purpose and context of its use . When applying the technology in places visited by mil lions of people – such as train stations or airports – a relatively small proportion of errors ( e.g . 0.01 % ) still means that hundreds of people are wrongly flagged . In addition , certain categories of people may be more likely to be wrongly matched than others , as described in Section 3 . There are different ways to calculate and interpret error rates , so caution is required.38 In addi tion , when it comes to accuracy and errors , questions in relation to how easily a system can be tricked by , for example , fake face images ( called ‘ spoofing ’ ) are important particularly for law enforcement purposes.39 Facial recognition technologies , like other machinelearning algorithms , have binary outcomes , meaning that there are two possible outcomes . It is there fore useful to distinguish between false positives and false negatives : 36 See Grother , P. , Ngan , M. , and Hanaoka , K. ( 2018 ) , Ongoing Face Recognition Vendor Test ( FRVT ) Part 2 : Identification , NISTIR 8238 ; or Galbally , J. , Ferrara , P. , Haraksim , R. , Psyllos , Al , and Beslay , L. ( 2019 ) , Study on Face Identification Technology for its Implementation in the Schengen Information System , Luxembourg , Publications Office , July 2019 . 37 For facial image recognition , the success mostly stems from the use of deep convolutional neural networks . These algorithms learn generic patterns of images by splitting images in several areas . 38 For more detailed discussions of evaluation metrics , see Grother , P. , Ngan , M. , and Hanaoka , K. ( 2018 ) , Ongoing Face Recognition Vendor Test ( FRVT ) Part 2 : Identification , NISTIR 8238 ; or Galbally , J. , Ferrara , P. , Haraksim , R. , Psyllos , Al , and Beslay , L. ( 2019 ) , Study on Face Identification Technology for its Implementation in the Schengen Information System , Luxembourg , Publications Office , July 2019 . 39 See for example : Parkin , A. and Grinchuk O . ( 2019 ) , Recognizing Multi-Modal Face Spoofing with Face Recognition Networks . A ‘ false positive ’ refers to the situation where an image is falsely matched to another image on the watchlist . In the law enforcement context , this would mean that a person is wrongly identi fied as being on the watchlist by the system . This has crucial consequences on that persons ’ fun damental rights . The “ false positive identification rate ” gives the proportion of erroneously found matches ( e.g . number of people on the watchlist identified who are in fact not on the watchlist ) among all those who are not on the watchlist . False negatives are those who are deemed not to be matches ( i.e . not on the watchlist ) , but in fact are matches . The corresponding “ false negative identification rate ” , or “ miss rate ” , indicates the proportion of those erroneously not identified among those who should be identified . The issue of false positives and false negatives is also connected to data quality and to the accuracy of data processing . Addressing this requires a regular correction and updating of the facial images stored in a watchlist in order to ensure accurate processing . When discussing error rates , three important con siderations need to be kept in mind : First , an algorithm never returns a definitive result , but only probabilities . For example : with 80 % likelihood , the person shown on one image is the person on another image on the watchlist . This means that thresholds or rank-lists need to be defined for making decisions about matches . Second , as a consequence , there is always a tradeoff between false positives and false negatives because of the decision on a probability thresh old . If the threshold is higher , false positives will decrease , but false negatives will increase , and the other way round . This is why such rates are usually reported with the other rate at a fixed level ( e.g . the miss rate is reported at the fixed false positive identification rate of 0.01 , i.e . 1 % ) .40 Third , the rates need to be evaluated with the quan tities of real cases in mind . If a large number of people are checked in mass , a potentially small false positive identification rate still means that a 40 E.g . Grother , P. , Ngan , M. , and Hanaoka , K. ( 2018 ) , Ongoing Face Recognition Vendor Test ( FRVT ) Part 2 : Identification , NISTIR 8238 . Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 10significant number of people are incorrectly identi fied . For example , a false positive identification rate of 0.01 means that among 100,000 people , 1,000 will be erroneously flagged . The assessments of accuracy are usually done on the basis of specified training data sets and can not easily be evaluated when deployed . One of the reasons is that those missed in a real world scenario are not known . Finally , accuracy assessments need to be made for different population groups , because the general accuracy rates might be misleading . Apart from issues related to varying performance of facial recognition technology depending on people ’ s sex , age ( children and the elderly ) and ethnic group , the technology ’ s accuracy when applied to people with disabilities is another important aspect that is rarely considered . 4.2 . Data quality and training databases The accuracy of FRT is strongly influenced by the data quality used to create the software and the quality of data used when deployed . Under the principle of data accuracy – reflected in Article 5 ( 1 ) ( d ) of the GDPR as well as Article 4 ( 1 ) ( d ) of the Law Enforcement Directive – authorities must use information that is accurate and up to date . Several factors influence the quality of facial images . These include background and object occlusion , illumi nation and light reflection , ergonomics , age , aging , gen der , skin colour and skin conditions.41 Existing standards for facial images define properties of images showing faces to ensure high quality – for example , the number of pixels between the eyes of a face.42 While further standards and ways of conducting quality checks are still being discussed and researched , FRT often differ entiates between images based on their quality . High quality images , taken under controlled circumstances , are usually referred to as facial images , portraits , or mug shots . Other images are considered of lower quality and have to be considered more cautiously . The quality of images is a serious issue when applying facial rec ognition technologies to images retrieved from video cameras , as the quality of the image can not be eas ily controlled . 41 Sanchez del Rio , J. , Conde , C. et al . ( 2015 ) , Face-based recognition systems in the ABC e-gates ; FRA ( 2018 ) , Under watchful eyes : biometrics , EU IT systems and fundamental rights , Luxembourg , Publications Office , March 2018 . 42 The International Civil Aviation Organization ( ICAO ) created standards for facial images to be included in travel documents ( ICAO 2018 , Technical Report . Portrait Quality , Reference Facial Images for MRTD ) . The International Standard Organization ( ISO ) , together with the International Electrotechnical Commission ( IEC ) , released a standard for Best Practices for Face Images ( ISO/IEC 19794-5 ) .Facial recognition software is based on pre-trained mod els , meaning that the software develops rules for iden tification of faces based on a database of facial images . This was possible through the increase in the availabil ity of facial images at higher quality and the increase in computing power to process large amounts of data . From a fundamental rights perspective , it is important to know which datasets were used to build the facial recognition software , as this influences the perfor mance of the software . For example , although pretrained software can be adapted to current use , per sistent problems were reported for gender and ethnic groups because the software for facial recognition was often trained mainly on facial images of white men , and much less of women and people belonging to other ethnic groups.43 Not everyone can access large data bases of facial images for developing software due to data protection and property rights . Hence , large IT companies have a distinct advantage when develop ing their facial recognition software . Yet even among these major vendors of facial recognition software , performance problems persist.44 This highlights the importance of having high quality training data for the development of facial recogni tion technologies and other AI-systems in general , as the use of the systems might lead to discrimination against individuals with certain characteristics , most notably women and girls.45 In reality , it may be difficult to obtain information about the training data used for developing software . Software might build on already existing algorithms ( pre-trained models ) , which makes it difficult to track back to the original training data . More importantly , vendors of facial recognition soft ware might not want to disclose information about the training data , as was experienced by an expert from a civil society organisation . Copyright issues and trade secrets could be used to block access to information needed to assess the quality of systems employed.46 Finally , the quality of images included in the watchlists to be checked against facial images is a crucial discus sion in relation to the use of facial recognition technol ogies . Low quality images on watchlists can considera bly increase the number of errors and wrong matches . 43 Buolamwini , J. and Gebru , T.

FRA Focus 115 . Use of facial recognition technology by public authorities in the EU To date , there is no comprehensive overview on the use of facial recognition technology in the EU . Many IT companies offer facial recognition technologies and there is a strong interest in the use of the technol ogy by public administrations for different purposes . This section focuses on their use for law enforce ment purposes.47 A number of tests of facial recog nition technologies were carried out during the past years by law enforcement authorities in different EU Member States , although the information available is limited . Apart from test deployments of live facial recognition technologies by public authorities in EU Member States , there is an increased planned use of facial images in the large-scale EU databases in the fields of migration and security ( see Section 5.2 ) . Meanwhile , research on the possible use of facial recognition technologies continues ( see Section 5.3 ) . 5.1 . Testing facial recognition technologies by law enforcement in EU Member States FRA interviewed representatives of public authorities in Germany , France and the United Kingdom about their possible use and plans of using live facial rec ognition technologies for law enforcement purposes . So far , the police in the United Kingdom has been most active in experimenting with live facial rec ognition technologies . The United Kingdom is the only EU Member State testing live facial recogni tion technologies in the field with real watchlists . For example , the South Wales Police has been using it at major events,48 and the London Metropolitan 47 To give another example , a Swedish municipality has used facial recognition technology to monitor the attendance of pupils in schools . This has led the Swedish Data Protection Authority to fine the municipality for violating the GDPR . See European Data Protection Board , “ Facial recognition school renders Sweden ’ s first GDPR fine “ , 22 August 2019 . In a similar vein , the French data protection authority ( CNIL ) has also held that the use of facial recognition technology at the entrance of two high schools ( in Marseilles and in Nice ) , for security reasons , appears neither necessary nor proportionate to the given purpose and violates the GDPR . See CNIL , “ Expérimentation de la reconnaissance faciale dans deux lycées : la CNIL précise sa position “ , 20 October 2019 . 48 South Wales Police also tested it for criminal investigation purposes based on CCTV materials , but retrospectively . A full list of deployments of this technology is available on the South Wales Police ’ s website .Police has carried out several live trials of facial recognition technologies . The South Wales Police were the first to use live facial recognition technology in the United Kingdom at large sporting events . The police used it at the UEFA Champions League final in June 2017 , which brought about 310,000 people to Cardiff . The tech nology was also used at several further events , including other sports events and music concerts . Several CCTV cameras were placed at different preselected locations . Depending on the size of the events , the police constructed watchlists including several hundreds of people of interest . According to the independent evaluation report from the trials , four different watchlists were used for the UEFA Champions League final . These include : a small number of individuals , who were per ceived to pose a serious risk to public safety ; individuals with previous convictions for more serious offense types ; individuals of possible interest to police , whose presence did not pose any immediate risk or threat to public safety ; and images of police officers to test the effective ness of the system . The watchlists contained between 400 and 1,200 individuals for the different events . The selection was based on different possible criteria . However , no further information on the creation of watchlists was shared with the evaluators of the trial.49 The absence of information on how watchlists were cre ated makes difficult an assessment of the real pur pose , necessity and social need for employing live facial recognition technology . The first case on this issue to come before a court in the European Union ( judgment not final ) arose in a divisional court in Cardiff . It ruled , in a case directed against the South Wales Police , that the current national legal regime is adequate to ensure the appropriate and non-arbi trary use of the facial recognition technology called 49 Davies B. , Innes M. , and Dawson A. , An evaluation of South Wales Police ’ s use of Automated Facial Recognition , Cardiff University , September 2018 . In addition to these deployments to locate people , the South Wales Police used FRT to identify suspects from past crime scenes . Images captured at crime scenes via CCTV or mobile phone cameras are compared against a large database of police custody images for investigation purposes . Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 12 “ AFR Locate ” , and that the South Wales Police ’ s use to date of “ AFR Locate ” has been consistent with the requirements of the Human Rights Act and the data protection legislation.50 The London Metropolitan Police conducted ten live facial recognition technologies test deployments between 2016 and 2019 in order to test how effec tively facial recognition technologies can identify individuals on watchlists . These include the Notting Hill Carnivals in 2016 and 2017 , and other selected venues in London.51 The tests were carried out using existing watchlists and additional images from police staff to test accuracy . Creating watchlists is described as being relatively complex , using different sources and databases.52 The watchlists of the tests included : individuals with outstanding arrest warrants , individuals believed likely to carry out violent crimes , and individuals known to the police who could pre sent a threat to safety of public figures . The London Policing Ethics Panel highlighted the cen tral importance of why and how watchlists are com piled . They raised concerns with respect to the integ rity of the databases from which images were taken for the watchlists , and the fact that images were drawn from other sources as well.53 Civil society criti cised the lack of information on who is on the watch lists due to the absence of legislation or guidance . In Germany , the Hamburg police used facial recogni tion technologies in the framework of the G20 sum mit in July 2017 . Based on video material from eight train stations , as well as image and video mate rial from other sources ( e.g . buses , underground ) , police officers manually identified criminal activity and related individuals . In a second step , they tried to identify these individuals , potentially involved in criminal activity , in all the material available from the event using facial recognition technologies . The Data Protection Commissioner of Hamburg ( Hamburgische Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informa tionsfreiheit ) issued a report about the use of facial recognition technologies at the G20 and found that the use of the technology did not comply with data 50 UK , High Court of Justice ( Queens ’ Bench Division – Divisional Court Cardiff ) , The Queen ( OTAO ) Bridges and Chief Constable of South Wales Police and others , [ 2019 ] EWCH 2341 ( Admin ) , 4 September 2019 , para . 159 . 51 Fussey , P. and Murray , D.

It raised as particularly problematic the absence of a legal basis for its use.54 The Berlin police carried out a large trial of live facial recognition technologies at a train station in 2017 and 2018 . The test ’ s main aim was to assess the tech nical performance when using three different facial recognition software systems . The potential use of facial recognition technologies was justified by the impossibility of being able to review video mate rials of all CCTV cameras available in Berlin when searching for people . The police published a compre hensive report about the test results in September 2018.55 The test included only volunteers , who were included on an artificial ‘ watchlist ’ . About 300 volun teers had their facial images taken and the software tried to identify them when passing a certain area of the train station . Other people , not on the ‘ watchlist ’ , could choose whether or not to walk through the areas marked to test facial recognition technologies . In terms of accuracy , the results were satisfactory for the police when all three software systems were combined . However , the potential use of the soft ware in the sense of whom to include on a possible watchlist and in which cases it can be deployed , was not determined by the police . The police stated that the legislator needs to decide on this by adopting a law on deploying live facial recognition technologies . This includes the definition of who could be included in watchlists – for example , people searched in con nection with terrorism , sexual offenders , people who escaped from prison while serving long sentences , or missing children . According to information provided by experts , using facial recognition technologies for identification is also being considered in the context of border management in Germany . However , it has not yet been implemented in this context . The police in Nice ( France ) conducted a trial of live facial recognition technologies at the carnival in 2018 . The purpose of the test was to assess the technolo gy ’ s efficiency . The ‘ watchlist ’ of the trial consisted of images of volunteers . People at the carnival could choose whether or not to enter the area where live facial recognition technologies was being deployed . The Gendarmerie in France has been using facial rec ognition technologies for criminal investigations , but does not use live facial recognition technologies due to the absence of a legal basis to do so . Experts FRA interviewed mentioned that potential future use of facial recognition technologies for the police could target large events and gatherings as well as every 54 Der Hamburgische Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit , Datenschutzrechtliche Prüfung des Einsatzes einer Gesichtserkennungssoftware zur Aufklärung von Straftaten im Zusammenhang mit dem G20-Gipfel durch die Polizei Hamburg , 2018 .

FRA Focus 13day security at public places . Experts stated that facial recognition technologies could make current sys tems of control more efficient , such as searching for wanted people . In sum , German and French authorities have tested live facial recognition technologies only on volunteers , without clearly indicating who would be included on watchlists if the technology were to be used for real deployments . Due to the absence of a legal basis for their deployment , live facial recognition tech nologies could currently not be used legally in these two countries . Only limited information is currently available on the possible use or tests of live facial recognition tech nologies in other EU Member States . Austrian author ities bought facial recognition software in 2019 for running facial recognition technologies against data bases to identify unknown perpetrators of criminal offences for whom images are available from CCTV cameras or other sources.56 In the Netherlands , tests have been initiated on the use of facial recognition technologies . These tests show that a number of Member States are interested in the potential use of facial recognition technologies , whether live ( i.e . from CCTV cameras ) or not . In some cases , the testing is evaluated either by independent entities contracted by the police , or by the police themselves . Civil society , data protection authorities and academics have raised several fundamental rights concerns with respect to the use of facial recognition technologies.57 Fundamental rights concerns in relation to the potential use of facial recognition technologies , with a focus on live facial recognition technologies , are discussed in Section 6 and Section 7 . 5.2 . Facial recognition in large-scale EU IT systems in the area of migration and security In recent years , the EU developed or upgraded sev eral large-scale IT systems in the field of migration and security . This process is ongoing , with some leg islative proposals still pending final adoption . 56 Reply to parliamentary enquiry ( Anfragebeantwortung 3403/J ) . 57 See for example in the United Kingdom : Fussey , P. and Murray , D. ( 2019 ) , Independent Report on the London Metropolitan Police Service ’ s Trial of Live Facial Recognition Technology , University of Essex , Human Rights Centre , July 2019 ; Big Brother Watch ( 2019 ) , Joint statement on police and private company use of facial recognition surveillance in the UK ; and Big Brother Watch , Face Off Campaign , May 2019.The Entry/Exit System Regulation introduced facial images as biometric identifiers and provided for the use of facial recognition technology for verification purposes for the first time in EU law.58 As Table 2 shows , the processing of facial images is meanwhile included in all IT systems , except for the European Travel Information and Authorisation System ( ETIAS ) . The processing of facial images supports biometric verification to check a person ’ s identity , for example , when applying for a visa , crossing the border or requesting asylum . In these cases , the individual concerned is aware that the authorities are taking his or her facial image . This is different from a situation where live facial recognition is applied for identification purposes , without the knowledge of the person affected . The processing of facial images in large-scale EU IT systems complements the processing of other biometric identifiers , in particular fingerprints . Table 3 provides an overview of the type of biometric data which will be processed in the six EU IT systems once the new legal basis for two of them , Eurodac and the Visa Information System , is in place . Five of the six systems will process facial images . In the large-scale EU IT systems , the collection and processing of facial images , along with other biome tric data , are strictly regulated by law . 59 Safeguards limit the collection and further processing of personal data to what is strictly necessary and operationally required . Access to the data is restricted to persons who have an operational need to process the personal data . The legal instruments setting up the IT systems provide for rights of data subjects in line with the EU data protection acquis.60 Furthermore , the legal instruments of the upgraded EU IT systems strengthen data quality safeguards . They require that these are met for biometric searches with facial images to be carried out.61 Typically , they 58 Regulation ( EU ) 2017/2226 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 November 2017 establishing an Entry/Exit System ( EES ) to register entry and exit data and refusal of entry data of third-country nationals crossing the external borders of the Member States and determining the conditions for access to the EES for law enforcement purposes , and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement and Regulations ( EC ) No . 767/2008 and ( EU ) No . 1077/2011 , OJ L 327 , 9.12.2017 , pp . 20-82 ( EES Regulation ) , Arts . 3 ( 1 ) ( 18 ) , 15 , and 23-26 . 59 See for example Arts . 32-33 , read in conjunction with recitals ( 20 ) , ( 22 ) and ( 54 ) , of Regulation ( EU ) 2018/1861 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 28 November 2018 on the establishment , operation and use of the Schengen Information System ( SIS ) in the field of border checks , and amending the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement , and amending and repealing Regulation ( EC ) No 1987/2006 , OJ L 312 , 7.12.2018 , pp . 14-55 ( SIS II-borders checks ) . 60 See e.g .

These strict con trols should always comply with the principle of pur pose limitation and the access must be necessary and proportionate to the objectives as defined in law.66 5.3 . EU-funded research in the field of facial recognition technology The EU funds , within the framework of the EU Hori zon 2020 programme for Secure Societies 20182020,67 several research projects on the potential application of facial recognition technology in the area of security and border management , as the following examples show . In the field of border management , the Pervasive and UseR Focused BiomeTrics BordEr ProjeCT ( PRO TECT ) explored the application of facial recognition technologies in the development of an ‘ enhanced contactless biometric-based person identification system ’ at external border crossings . The project also looked at the privacy requirements and con cerns that such a technology could raise . Other pro jects focused on novel mobility concepts for land border security .

Made of a combination of stateof-the arts technologies , such as a face matching tool and an Automatic Deception Detection System , the research tests whether such technology could help border guards in detecting bona fide travellers but also passengers not saying the truth . Furthermore , research is ongoing to understand the societal acceptability of , and public attitudes to , facial recognition technologies . The project ‘ Privacy , ethical , regulatory and social no-gate crossing point solutions acceptance ’ ( PERSONA ) , for example , aims to design tailored impact assessment methods to appropriately assess the effects of new contactless crossing border-controlling technologies , including facial recognition technologies .

Austria is in the lead of the focus group on ‘ facial recognition ’ .71 The European Commission is also funding a project called ‘ Towards the European Level Exchange of Facial Images ’ ( TELEFI ) . This research project will examine “ how facial recognition is currently being used for the investigation of crime across EU Mem ber States. ” It will also give particular consideration to the potential for implementing the exchange of facial images within the Prüm framework.72 The pro ject is implemented by the Forensics Departments of Finland , Latvia , Sweden and the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Estonian Ministry of Justice . 68 Project funded under H2020-EU.3.7.6 . – Ensure privacy and freedom , including in the Internet and enhance the societal , legal and ethical understanding of all areas of security , risk and management , Topic : SEC-18-BES-2017 – Acceptance of no gate crossing point solutions . 69 The Prüm Decisions allow for the large-scale exchange of fingerprints and DNA profiles and vehicle registration numbers between parties to the Prüm Convention and other EU Member States for the purposes of law enforcement and national security .

Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 186 . Fundamental rights implications of using live facial recognition : general points The use of facial recognition technology entails both risks and opportunities for fundamental rights . It entails many fundamental rights chal lenges that result from the weak position of the individuals whose facial images are captured and then checked against a ‘ watchlist ’ . At the same time , facial recognition technology can offer more timely protection – for example by helping to find missing children – and can help to detect fraud and identify theft . With many unanswered questions linked to the technology ’ s use and accuracy , major concerns with the use of facial recognition technologies and particularly live facial recognition technolo gies have been voiced by civil society . This sec tion presents how facial recognition is perceived and analyses the fundamental rights implications of such technology in general . Section 7 discusses the individual fundamental rights that are most affected . 6.1 . Public perceptions There is no detailed assessment across the EU of the extent to which people find the use of facial recognition technologies intrusive . However , there are indications that a certain share of the popula tion strongly objects to being subjected to facial recognition . In a survey conducted by FRA in 2015 – involving 1,227 third-country nationals at seven border crossing points – 12 % of all respondents indicated feeling very uncomfortable when their facial image was used for crossing the border ( see Figure 1 ) ; 18 % considered providing a facial image at a border very intrusive to their privacy ; and 26 % said that doing so was humiliating . There are dif ferences across nationalities , with Russians and citizens of the United States being less concerned , and Chinese citizens and people from other areas in the world being more concerned . No clear dif ferences with respect to the level of feeling humil iated based on age and gender emerged from the Figure 1 : Travellers ’ level of feeling comfortable with providing facial images at borders , 2015 Notes : Question : “ How comfortable are you with the use of facial images when crossing the border ? ” ; N = 1,227 . Source : FRA , 2015 ( based on survey carried out at seven border-crossing points ) FRA Focus 19survey.73 Results from such a survey might change rapidly over time given the fast development of the technology and that people are more often being exposed to such technology . According to experts interviewed by FRA , in another survey conducted in the framework of the live facial recognition technologies tested in Nice ( France ) , only three percent of 900 respondents opposed the use of FRT . A larger survey among the general population about their views on facial recognition was carried out 73 Based on FRA ( 2015 ) , Fundamental Rights Agency Survey results , annexed to eu-LISA , 2015 , Smart Borders Pilot Project Technical Report Annexes Volume 2. in the United Kingdom.74 The results of the survey show that , among the general population in the United Kingdom , only 9 % feel completely uncom fortable when facial recognition is used for policing purposes , and 10 % when used at airports . How ever , 24 % do not feel comfortable with the use of facial recognition in public transport , 28 % at schools , 37 % in supermarkets , and 37 % at the workplace . It appears that , while people generally tend to feel more comfortable with the use of facial recognition technologies for policing purposes , many are not happy with the use of these technologies in every day life . Figure 2 shows that , according to this sur vey in the United Kingdom , the main reasons for 74 Ada Lovelace Institute ( 2019 ) , Beyond face value : public attitudes to facial recognition technology .Figure 2 : Reasons for people feeling comfortable or uncomfortable when facial recognition is used in the United Kingdom , 2019 Notes : The upper panel includes respondents who indicated the values 6-10 on the question about feeling comfortable with the use of FRT for policing ( on a scale from 1 to 10 , where 1 means not comfortable at all , n=2,757 ) .

Source : Data from Ada Lovelace Institute , 2019 , based on an online survey in the United Kingdom Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 20feeling comfortable are linked to increased security , whereas the main reasons for feeling uncomfortable are related to interferences with people ’ s privacy . 6.2 . Requirements for justified interference with fundamental rights Full compliance with fundamental rights is a prereq uisite for any law enforcement activities , irrespective of the technologies used . EU and international human rights law provide a normative framework for the design , development and deployment of facial rec ognition technologies . They help determine whether or not a specific use of facial recognition technology is human rights compliant.75 Section 7 examines the main fundamental rights affected by facial recognition technologies . These are typically not absolute rights , so can be subject to limitations.76 This sub-section presents the steps that need to be followed to determine whether or not a Charter right can be limited . Requirements that are specific to an individual right ( in particular those relating to interferences with the right to respect for private life and protection of personal data ) are ana lysed in Section 7 . So far , the tests and deployments of facial recognition technologies in EU Member States by public authori ties mainly focused on technical accuracy and did not assess fundamental rights implications more broadly . A strong focus was put on image quality and error rates . These results are important – but are only one aspect . If facial recognition technology were perfect in terms of accuracy , other questions would none theless remain . For example , live facial recognition technology , which involves subjecting people to facial recognition potentially without their informed con sent , puts them in a weak and potentially humiliat ing position . The use of live facial recognition technologies thus also relates more broadly to the right to human dignity . Human dignity is the foundation of all fundamental rights guaranteed by the EU Charter of Fundamental 75 See also , Fussey , P. and Murray , D.

The Court of Justice of the EU ( CJEU ) has confirmed in its case law that the fundamental right to dignity is part of EU law.78 Biometric data , including facial images , must be pro cessed in a manner that respects human dignity . The processing of facial images may affect human dignity in different ways , as the following examples illustrate : People may feel uncomfortable going to public places under surveillance . They may change their behaviour , withdrawing from social life , not visit ing central places under surveillance , avoiding train stations or declining to attend cultural , social or sports events . Depending on the extent to which live facial recognition technologies are applied , the impact on what people may perceive as surveillance technologies on their lives may be so significant as to affect their capacity to live a dignified life . FRA documented examples where authorities used excessive force to take the fingerprints of peo ple who arrived at the border.79 Similar situations may hypothetically also occur to force people to go through places where facial images are cap tured . The prohibition of excessive use of force deriving from Article 4 of the Charter , which pro hibits torture , inhuman and degrading treatment , is a key safeguard when taking any biometric data from individuals.80 When law enforcement authorities obtain many hits when deploying facial recognition technologies ( for example during a large public event ) , they may need to stop and check a larger number of peo ple . This poses high demands on police staff , par ticularly when many people are wrongly stopped due to an erroneous match , as may likely be the case when the facial image is extracted from CCTV cameras . The risk of inappropriate police behav iour due to stress increases , potentially undermin ing the dignity of the person stopped . Interacting with people who have been subject to a match requires particular attention . Officers need ade quate training on the need to ensure full respect of the right to human dignity and on how to avoid the risk of tensions , including when dealing with 77 Barak , A .

Media in the United Kingdom reported a case concerning a person who avoided the facial recognition technology cameras in Lon don and subsequently got fined for a public order offense . The concrete circumstances of the inci dent are contested , though . 81 An important way to promote compliance with fun damental rights is oversight by independent bodies . This applies to many different areas , ranging from the oversight of child protection authorities in case of children at risk of exploitation , abuse or neglect to international monitoring bodies established to pre vent torture , inhuman or degrading treatment . Inde pendent supervision is also an essential component of European data protection law,82 with Article 8 ( 3 ) of the Charter making express reference to it . In light of the fundamental rights issues at stake and its com plexity , independent supervision is essential to gen uinely protect people whose rights may be affected by facial recognition technology . Turning to fundamental rights that may be subject to restriction , Article 52 ( 1 ) of the Charter sets the frame work . Interferences with fundamental rights can only be justified if they respect the requirements of the Charter and of the ECHR , in case of Charter rights cor responding to rights guaranteed in the ECHR ( Article 52 ( 3 ) of the Charter ) .83 Pursuant to Article 52 ( 1 ) of the Charter , any limita tion on fundamental rights must : be provided for by law , genuinely meet objectives of general interest rec ognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others , respect the essence of the right , and be proportionate . 84 81 Fussey , P. and Murray , D.

The court has also emphasised that any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by in the Char ter must respect “ the essence ” of those rights and freedoms.85 This means that fundamental rights can be limited to a certain extent , but not completely disregarded . Once it has been established that the inalienable , essential core of a right is not violated by a measure , the necessity and proportionality test as outlined in the Charter is to be conducted as a next step in respect of non-core aspects of that right.86 An objective of general interest − such as crime pre vention or public security − is not , in itself , sufficient to justify an interference . Any interference with a Charter right needs to be examined as to whether the given legitimate aim could not be obtained by other means that interfere less with the right guar anteed . 87 Similar requirements are also imposed by the ECHR , as interpreted by the European Court of Human Rights ( ECtHR ) . A three-pronged test developed by the ECtHR requires that any rights interference has to pursue a legitimate aim ; be in accordance with the law , i.e . necessitating an appropriate legal basis meeting qualitative requirements ( public , precise , and foreseeable ) ; 88 as well as necessary in a demo cratic society ( necessity and proportionality test ) .89 As a fourth test , the ECtHR also used the ‘ essence of a right ’ concept , which can be derived from the object and purpose of the ECHR as a whole.90 The case law of the ECtHR has identified the following elements when determining whether a measure is “ necessary in a democratic society ” − for exam ple , that the interference needs to correspond to a pressing social need , must be proportionate , and that the reasons given to justify the interference 85 See CJEU , C-362/14 , Maximillian Schrems v.

Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 22must be relevant and sufficient.91 In respect to the use of new technologies , the ECtHR observed in S. and Marper v. the UK that States should “ strike a right balance ” between protecting fundamental rights and developing new technologies.92 This also applies when introducing facial recognition tech nologies to help support law enforcement and bor der management . This assessment needs to be carried out for each way of using the technology . It must cover all rel evant fundamental rights and take into account all elements , ranging from the legitimate purpose the technology wants to achieve and the way the facial images are captured ( e.g . CCTV cameras , bodyworn cameras , mobile phone applications , etc . ) to the degree of errors it entails , so as to enable an informed assessment of the necessity and propor tionality of its use . The more intrusive the technol ogy is , the stricter the test must be . As regards its legitimate objective , the results of the necessity and proportionality test will be different depending on whether it supports the verification of the identity of a person – as , for example , during border checks at airports ( one-to-one comparison ) ; or whether it is used in criminal investigations to run the facial image of a person against a watchlist ( one-to-many comparison ) . In this second case , the seriousness of the crime being investigated plays an important role . The examples of its use listed in Section 5 indicate that , in general terms , the authorities deployed or tested the technology to enhance efficiency in police work in terms of increased success in finding wanted people and reducing costs . Authorities also mentioned the inability of human work force to go through all video footage produced by CCTV cameras as a justification for testing facial recognition technologies . FRA was not able to obtain a comprehensive picture of the types of crimes for which law enforcement authorities used or tested the technology . Concerning accuracy , the results from the tests in Nice were reported to have worked perfectly , with out any errors . However , the use of facial recog nition technologies usually comes with errors . The largest accuracy test of facial recognition technol ogies is available from the US Department of Com merce ’ s National Institute of Standards and Tech nology ( NIST ) , conducting an ongoing vendor test 91 See , for instance ECtHR , Khelili v. Switzerland , No . 16188/07 , 18 October 2011 ; ECtHR , S. and Marper v. the United Kingdom [ GC ] , Nos . 30562/04 and 30566/04 , 4 December 2008 ; ECtHR , K & T v.

The results show a strong increase in accuracy rates , currently below 0.2 % for galleries of 12 million individuals.93 Yet there is a complex relationship between false posi tives ( i.e . stopping innocent people ) and false neg atives ( i.e . not being able to find the person of interest ) . A proportionality assessment needs to balance the trade-off between the two as illustrated below . The question is what number of innocent people being flagged by the system and stopped by the police is acceptable for the sake of possi bly succeeding in finding a person of interest . The outcome of this assessment varies depending on the importance of finding a specific person and the harm done by stopping innocent people . A vivid example comes from the test carried out in Germany . When using three different facial recogni tion software systems in parallel , analysing matches in cases when at least one of the three systems pro vided a match , the tests in Berlin had an average miss rate ( false negatives among all negative ) of 8.8 % , with a false positive identification rate of 0.34 % . This means that in just under one in ten cases – on aver age and in the long run – a person of interest would be missed ( or in just over nine in ten cases identi fied ) . At the same time , out of every 1,000 people crossing the system , between three and four people would be wrongly identified as matches by the sys tem . According to the German authorities , this is not acceptable , because considering the number of peo ple crossing train stations every day , this would lead to a large number of people incorrectly stopped ( or at least flagged to the police ) . The system can also be used to provide a match only when all three software systems agree . This would increase the miss rate to 31.9 % ( meaning in one in three cases – in the long run – a person of interest would be missed ) , and reduce the false positive identification rate to 0.00018 % . This is considered very low by the authorities con ducting the test.94 Used at a station with 100,000 people crossing every day , such a rate would mean that , over a period of ten days , about two people would be flagged despite not being in the system.95 93 Grother , P. , Ngan , M. , and Hanaoka , K.

Fundamental rights most affected This section discusses the specific fundamental rights that are most affected when using facial recogni tion technologies in the context of law enforce ment . It focuses on live facial recognition technol ogies , when facial images are extracted from CCTV cameras and compared with a database or watch list . This section is not an exhaustive analysis of all fundamental rights affected by facial recogni tion technologies , but rather of pertinent examples . 7.1 . Respect for private life and protection of personal data The rights to respect for private life and data protec tion are central to the deployment of facial recogni tion technology in public places . Although the two are closely related , they are distinct , self-standing rights . They have also been described as the “ clas sic ” right to the protection of privacy and a more “ modern ” right , the right to data protection.96 Both strive to protect similar values , i.e . the autonomy and human dignity of individuals , by granting them a personal sphere in which they can freely develop their personalities , think and shape their opinions . They thus form an essential prerequisite for the exercise of other fundamental rights , such as the freedom of thought , conscience and religion ( Arti cle 10 of the Charter ) , freedom of expression and information ( Article 11 of the Charter ) , and free dom of assembly and of association ( Article 12 of the Charter ) .97 Using live facial recognition technologies implies collecting , comparing and/or storing facial images in an IT system for identification purposes . It , there fore , constitutes an interference with the right to protection of personal data set out in Article 8 of the Charter ( embodying pre-existing EU data protection law ) and the right to private life under Article 7 of the Charter and Article 8 of the ECHR . Facial images constitute personal data , as also confirmed by the CJEU98 and the ECtHR.99 The ECtHR has also stated that a person ’ s facial image constitutes one of the 96 CJEU , joined cases C-92/09 and C-93/09 , Volker und Markus Schecke and Eifert GbR and Hartmut Eifert , Opinion of Advocate General Sharpston , 17 June 2010 , para . 71 . 97 FRA , Council of Europe and EDPS ( 2018 ) , Handbook on European data protection law . 2018 edition , Luxembourg , Publications Office , June 2018 , p. 19 . 98 CJEU , C-291/12 , M.

The right to the protection of one ’ s facial image is thus one of the essential components of personal development.100 The concept of “ private life ” is a broad term not susceptible to exhaustive definition . It covers the physical and psychological integrity of a person , and can , therefore , embrace multiple aspects of the person ’ s physical and social identity.101 There is also a zone of interaction of a person with others , even in a public context , which may fall within the scope of “ private life ” .102 In other contexts , the ECtHR has used the concept of “ reasonable expectation of privacy ” – referring to the extent to which people can expect privacy in public spaces without being subjected to surveillance – as one of the factors , albeit not necessarily a conclusive one , to decide on a violation of the right to respect for private life . Its relevance and scope of application , however , appears to be limited.103 Similarly , according to UN experts , the mere fact that participants in assem blies are out in public does not mean that their pri vacy can not be infringed.104 The processing of facial images in large-scale databases may , as facial rec ognition technology develops , raise unchartered issues about the rights to protection of private life as well as of personal data . Given that these two rights are not absolute rights , they can be subject to limitations , but any interference needs to be ade quately justified105 and can not compromise at any event the essential , inalienable core of that right , as explained in Section 6.2 .106 Live facial recognition technology involves the bio metric processing of facial images taken in a pub lic place , for the purpose of determining a person ’ s 100 ECtHR , Guide on Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights Right to respect for private and family life , home and correspondence , Strasbourg , Council of Europe , 31 August 2019 , para . 138 . 101 ECtHR , López Ribalda and Others v.

Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 24identity ( one-to-many identification ) and the poten tial retention of those images . Consequently , both the initial biometric processing of facial images , any subsequent retention of video footage , and compar ing the data to a ‘ watchlist ’ – alongside populating the watchlist with facial images – constitute inter ferences with the right to respect for private life and the protection of personal data.107 Given that processing of personal data constitutes a limitation of these rights , it needs to be subjected to a strict necessity and proportionality test , including a clear legal basis to do so and a legitimate aim pursued . Such a test has to take into account the context and all circumstances at hand . Hence , the sensitivity of the data or the way the data are used are impor tant for the context.108 Next to the fundamental rights safeguards and key data protection principles flowing from Article 8 of Charter as interpreted by the CJEU , specific guaran tees under the EU data protection acquis further cor roborate the necessity and proportionality test out lined in Section 6.2 . Pursuant to Article 9 ( 2 ) ( g ) of the GDPR , the processing of biometric data is only allowed where processing is “ necessary for reasons of substantial public interest , on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued , respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and spe cific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject ” . Article 10 of the Law Enforcement Directive lays down similar , albeit a bit more permissive conditions.109 Collecting and processing facial images for the pur pose of FRT needs to be strictly in line with European data protection law . Following the main legal prin ciples of data protection , processing facial images must be a ) lawful , fair and transparent ; b ) follow a specific , explicit and legitimate pur pose ( clearly defined in Member State or Union law ) ; and c ) comply with the requirements of data minimi sation , data accuracy , storage limitation , data security and accountability.110 107 Fussey , P. and Murray , D.

The GDPR and the Law Enforcement Directive include provisions guaranteeing the principle of transparency and the right to information . The right to personal data pro tection requires fair processing , which includes ade quately informing persons whose facial images are taken . Article 5 ( 1 ) of the GDPR stipulates that “ per sonal data shall be processed lawfully , fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data sub ject ” . Recital ( 26 ) of the Law Enforcement Directive echoes the same requirements . Also , the right to information is a precondition for the child to exer cise their right to be heard in judicial and adminis trative proceedings that affect them , which is pro tected by Article 12 of the CRC and Article 24 ( 1 ) of the Charter . Provision of information is not only a transparency requirement under European data pro tection law , but it also promotes respect for dignity of the individual . Controllers must take appropriate measures to pro vide information related “ to processing to the data subject in a concise , transparent , intelligible and eas ily accessible form , using clear and plain language ” .111 Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR and the Article 13 of the Law Enforcement Directive require that individuals be informed on the identity and the contact details of the controller , the purpose of the processing of data , retention times , the right to request access to stored data , and its erasure or rectification , as well as the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority . However , the Law Enforcement Directive carves out some possible exceptions under this obli gation in Article 13 ( 3 ) , to avoid obstructing or prej udicing ongoing investigations ; or to protect public security and national security . These scenarios are of major importance when facial recognition technolo gies are considered . The potential purposes currently discussed and invoked for the use of facial recogni tion technologies might only work without informed consent or without the possibility to opt out ( e.g . in case of searching terrorists or other suspected criminals ) . Hence , this limitation on the fundamental right to be informed and consent to the processing of data , paired with the restrictions on the right to access to stored data , needs to be strongly justified . The European Data Protection Board ( EDPB ) clarifies that Member States have the obligation to inform individuals of existing video surveillance devices . Such information should be provided through a warning 111 Law Enforcement Directive , Art . 12 ; GDPR , Art . 12 ( 1 ) . FRA Focus 25sign at a reasonable distance of the monitored places , and information that is accessible without enter ing the area under surveillance . This may include an information sheet , a link to a website detailing information on the surveillance , a telephone num ber to receive further information , or an app map ping the location of video devices.112 The process of extracting biometric features from a face , which makes the face available for process ing in other ways , changes the level of intrusion due to the availability of new technological means . As a consequence , the availability of a facial image in a database is different from applying a software that extracts unique features from a facial image , irre spective of whether the extracted features are in fact run against a watchlist . Following the argumenta tion of the Data Protection Commissioner of the City of Hamburg , a previously legally specified balance between authorities ’ interference for the purpose of law enforcement and the right to informational self-determination , is changed massively to the det riment of the latter . Moreover , the Data Protection Commissioner sees facial recognition technologies as providing for an entirely new way of intrusion and opportunities of persecution , which requires a stand-alone , specific regulation.113 Specific , explicit and legitimate purpose The principle of purpose limitation is one of the funda mental principles of European data protection law.114 It is mirrored in Article 8 ( 2 ) of the Charter , as well as in Article 5 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the GDPR and Article 4 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Law Enforcement Directive . It requires that personal data are processed only for specified pur poses , which must be explicitly defined by law . The person concerned should be able to foresee the pur pose for which their data will be processed.115 These principles equally apply in the context of processing data via facial recognition technologies . The princi ple of purpose limitation also implies the prohibition of the unlimited retention of such data . 112 European Data Protection Board ( 2019 ) , Guidelines 3/2019 on processing of personal data through video devices – version for public consultation , Brussels , 10 July 2019 , pp . 21-23 . 113 Der Hamburgische Beauftragte für Datenschutz und Informationsfreiheit ( 2018 ) . 114 FRA , Council of Europe and EDPS ( 2018 ) , Handbook on European data protection law . 2018 edition , Luxembourg , Publications Office , June 2018 , p. 122 ; Article 29 Data Protection Working Party ( 2013 ) , Opinion 03/2013 on purpose limitation , WP 2013 , 00569/13/EN , Brussels , 2 April 2013 . 115 CJEU , C-275/06 , Productores de Música de España ( Promusicae ) v. Telefónica de España SAU , Opinion of Advocate General Kokott , 18 July 2007 , para . 53.In this context , the purpose of processing facial images via facial recognition technologies must be strictly determined – with a high threshold , essen tially consisting of the purpose to combat terrorism and other forms of serious crime , which is the wellestablished purpose limitation under EU law for law enforcement access to various large-scale EU data bases . As an additional purpose , it could also be used to identify missing persons and victims of crime , including children . By designing IT systems , including facial recognition systems , for combating serious crimes and terrorism , improving public safety , and curbing irregular migra tion , there is a risk of function creep – meaning that the personal data ( the facial images ) may be used for purposes that were not initially envisaged . In the case of interoperability of large-scale EU databases , safeguards need to be implemented to ensure that facial image recognition technology is not unlawfully used to access EU large-scale databases.116 Data minimisation , data accuracy , storage limitation , data security and accountability Data must be also safely collected , processed and stored and unlawful data processing must be pre vented and detected.117 A related issue is the pre vention of unauthorised access to and use of the personal data processed by facial recognition tech nologies . Article 32 of the GDPR and Article 29 of the Law Enforcement Directive both require Mem ber States to take necessary measures to avoid that personal data are disclosed to , or accessed by , unau thorised persons or organs . If facial recognition sys tems are made interoperable with other IT systems in future , ensuring purpose limitation in such a sce nario will be particularly challenging . To avoid poten tial data leakages , ongoing research looks into ways to protect the privacy of biometric data and hence increasing data security . Current research assesses technological solutions to protect biometric iden tifiers ( templates ) .118 116 For more on the fundamental rights implications of interoperability of large-scale IT systems , see FRA ( 2018 ) , Interoperability and fundamental rights implications – Opinion of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights , FRA Opinion 1/2018 [ Interoperability ] , Vienna , 11 April 2018 . 117 For a comprehensive overview of the European legal framework on data protection , see : FRA , Council of Europe and EDPS ( 2018 ) , Handbook on European data protection law . 2018 edition , Luxembourg , Publications Office , June 2018 . 118 Gomez-Barrero M. , et al .

Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 26EU law requires data controllers to protect data by design , meaning that measures need to be put in place to integrate safeguards to protect the rights of people concerned.119 As a consequence , when plan ning to use facial recognition technologies , a fullyfledged analysis , plan and process for protecting rights needs to be made from the outset . Pursuant to the GDPR and the Law Enforcement Directive , the use of facial images requires a Data Protection Impact Assessment ( DPIA ) , including prior consul tation with the data protection authority ( DPA ) .120 Data Protection Impact Assessments are important tools to comprehensively assess the legal permis sibility of and risks involved in using facial recogni tion technologies and they need to be thoroughly done . The role of the DPAs is crucial in this respect for safeguarding fundamental rights , as indepen dently acting bodies established by law.121 119 Law Enforcement Directive , Art . 20 ( 1 ) ; GDPR , Art . 25 ( 1 ) . 120 Law Enforcement Directive , Arts . 27-28 ; GDPR , Arts . 35-36 . 121 Further information on how to conduct Data Protection Impact Assessments , including in the context of video surveillance , are included in the Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment ( DPIA ) and determining whether processing is “ likely to result in a high risk ” for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 , WP 248 rev.01 , Brussels , as last revised and adopted on 4 October 2017.Indeed , tests on facial recognition technologies made some efforts to conduct an impact assessment . The German test included a data protection plan set up with the DPA for the purpose of the test . The data protection impact assessment of the South Wales Police was also published,122 as was the assessment of the London Metropolitan Police.123 The police in France informed the DPA a few weeks before the trial about their plans of carrying out the test . 122 South Wales Police Data Protection Impact Assessment , Version 5.4 , October 2018 . 123 London Police Ethics Panel , Interim Report on Live Facial Recognition , 2018 . Automated decision making and the right to human review Article 22 of the GDPR and Article 11 of the Law Enforcement Directive generally forbid automated deci sion making , meaning any “ decision based solely on automated processing , including profiling , which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. ” The exception to this prohibition is when this is authorised by Union or Member State law , which provides for appro priate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject , at least the right to human interven tion on part of the controller . When special data are involved , such as facial images , suitable measures to safeguard the data subject 's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests must be in place . All trials and deployments envisaged in EU Member States do provide for human intervention . This means that matches based on facial recognition technologies are flagged to humans ( e.g . police offic ers ) , who will evaluate the match and based on this evaluation take action . Many false positives are already ruled out at this stage . However , the concept of ‘ automated ’ decision making is elusive and needs further discussion and research . For example , in some cases human intervention might be to simply ‘ sign-off ’ on all outcomes of the system , hence rendering it virtually automated . * Contrary to that and as another example , if humans review and potentially override outcomes of the system , this needs to be evaluated as well . Research indicates that humans overrule outcomes from algorithms mainly when the result is in line with their stereotypes ( for example , again putting minority groups at a disadvantage ) . This behaviour threatens the possible added value of the automated processing through potentially being more accu rate or in cases even fairer than humans . * * * Veale , M. and Edwards , L.

FRA Focus 277.2 . Non-discrimination Discrimination is “ where one person is treated less favourably than another is , has been or would be , treated in a comparable situation ” on the basis of a perceived or real personal characteristic124 ( called ‘ protected grounds/characteristics ’ ) . Article 21 of the Charter prohibits any discrimination based on any ground such as sex , race , colour , ethnic or social origin , genetic features , language , religion or belief , political or any other opinion , member ship of a national minority , property , birth , disability , age or sexual orientation . The Charter prohibition reflects corresponding rights in the ECHR ( Article 14 ) and in Protocol No . 12 to the ECHR ( Article 12 ) , but is even broader . This formulation established a non-exhaustive , open list extending protection to a wide range of new grounds ; and unlike Article 14 of the ECHR , the Charter right to non-discrimination is a freestanding right applying to situations that do not need to be covered by any other Charter pro vision.125 Article 20 of the EU Charter provides that everyone is equal before the law . Justification for different or less favourable treat ment is possible under the ECHR and EU law . Differ ential treatment may be justified where it pursues a legitimate aim and where the means to pursue that aim are necessary and proportionate.126 These boundaries may vary on a case-by-case basis , depending on the circumstances of the individual case . For instance , in ECtHR jurisprudence , differen tial treatment relating to matters to be at the core of personal dignity ( e.g . race or ethnic origin , gen der , private life ) are more difficult to justify than in other areas . 127 Discrimination in data-supported algorithmic deci sion making can occur due to several reasons . Dis crimination can occur during the design , testing and implementation of algorithms used for facial recog nition , through biases that are incorporated – con sciously or not – in the algorithm itself , as well as 124 Council Directive 2000/43/EC of 29 June 2000 implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of racial or ethnic origin , OJ L 180 , 19.7.2000 , pp . 22-26 , Art . 2 ; and Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation , OJ L 303 , 2.12.2000 , pp . 16-22 , Art . 2 . 125 FRA and CoE ( 2018 ) , Handbook on European non-discrimination law . 2018 edition , Luxembourg , Publications Office , June 2018 , p. 35 . 126 See for example ECtHR , Burden v. the United Kingdom [ GC ] , No . 13378/05 , 29 April 2008 , para . 60 ; ECtHR , Guberina v.

If there are differences in the performance of an algorithm , it is usually very difficult and some times impossible to remove the bias through math ematical or programmatic solutions.128 An important cause of discrimination is the quality of data used to develop algorithms and software.129 To be effective and accurate , facial recognition software needs to be fed with large amounts of facial images . More facial images lead , in principle , to more accurate predictions . However , accuracy is not only deter mined by the amount of facial images processed but also by the quality of such facial images . Data quality requires also a representative set of faces reflecting different groups of people.130 Yet to date , facial images used to develop algorithms in the Western world often over-represent white men , with lower numbers of women and/or individuals of other ethnic backgrounds . As a result , facial rec ognition systems worked well for white men , but not for black women.131 Phenotypical characteristics – i.e . the expression of genes in an observable way , such as hair or skin colour – might influence the outcome of biometric matching in facial recognition systems : reflection of light affects the quality of facial images of very fair-skinned persons , and not enough light affects the quality for very dark-skinned persons.132 When comparing their facial images against a database or watchlist , such people are , therefore , exposed to a higher likelihood of being wrongly matched as false positives . This may result in certain groups of persons being wrongly stopped more frequently due to their colour of the skin . Article 26 of the Charter guarantees the rights of persons with disabilities . Disability must not result in unequal treatment or discrimination prohibited by 128 FRA ( 2018 ) , Preventing unlawful profiling today and in the future : a guide , Luxembourg , Publications Office , December 2018 , p. 26 ; FRA ( 2018 ) , # BigData .

However , there is ongoing research looking into this aspect particularly from privacy and non-discrimination point of view . See for example the SensitiveNets website , and A. Morales , A. , J.

Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 28Articles 20 ( equality before the law ) and 21 ( non-dis crimination ) of the Charter . There is a lack of research and little discussion on how facial recognition tech nologies ( and artificial intelligence more broadly ) affect people with disabilities . The types of disabili ties are manifold . Not much information is available on the extent to which facial recognition technolo gies work accurately for different forms of disabil ities or injuries to the face , such as people whose face has been altered as a result of an accident or paralysis , people who had facial surgeries or peo ple with craniofacial differences.133 More research is needed to understand whether facial recognition technologies may discriminate against people with certain disabilities . Although the awareness of the risk of discrimina tion by facial recognition technologies has increased considerably over the past years , many profession als still do not see this is an issue . Some public offi cials FRA interviewed indicated that discrimination is not a problem because the ‘ technology is neutral ’ or were confident that the system works equally for different groups because people from different groups were included when testing it . In fact , none of tests described in this paper analysed the results in terms of different performance by ethnic origin , sex or age . Some of the tests did not even have enough dark-skinned people among volunteers to test differ ences in the performance . Therefore , a much larger sample of people would have been needed to test for possible discrimination . The largest test of facial recognition technologies in the United States shows that error rates differ according to demographic char acteristics , including age , sex and country of ori gin . Moreover , the results in terms of differences by characteristics also differ across software systems.134 Discrimination in facial recognition technologies might have an adverse effect on group cohesion , if peo ple from specific ethnic groups are disproportion ally more often erroneously stopped . This can sig nificantly affect their trust in the police or border management officials.135 7.3 . Rights of the child and of elderly people Facial recognition systems affect the rights of children in different ways . Article 24 of the Char ter ( rights of the child ) emphasises that the best 133 See Medium , “ Disability and AI-Bias ” , 11 July 2019 . 134 Grother , P. , Ngan , M. , and Hanaoka , K.

Part 1 : Verification , 2019/04/12 . 135 FRA ( 2018 ) , Preventing unlawful profiling today and in the future : a guide , Luxembourg , Publications Office , December 2018 , p. 39.interests of the child must be a primary considera tion in all actions public authorities and private actors take concerning children . EU Member States must provide the child with such protection and care as is necessary for the child ’ s well-being and devel opment . The best interests of the child is one of the four core principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) .136 The child ’ s best inter ests must also be given a primary consideration in the context of using facial recognition technology for law enforcement and border management pur poses . The CJEU has also expressly recognised the need to respect children ’ s rights and requires Mem ber States to take due account of the CRC when implementing EU law.137 The EU data protection acquis provides special protection to children with regard to their personal data.138 Due to the particular vulnerability of children , the processing of their biometric data , including facial images , must be subject to a stricter necessity and proportionality test , compared to adults . In addition , as the child grows and time passes , the accuracy of a biometric match diminishes . The risk of a wrong match increases when facial images recorded at a young age are compared more than five years after they were collected.139 Present tech nologies for facial recognition guarantee a reliable match when the child was at least six years old when the biometric facial image was captured and the match happened within a time frame of five years . In general , research indicates that the accu racy of facial recognition technology is significantly lower for children younger than 13 years.140 Software tests clearly indicate that images of younger people 136 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child , New York , 20 November 1989 ( 1577 U.N.T.S. , p. 3 ) . 137 CJEU , C-540/03 , European Parliament v.

FRA Focus 29result in considerably more false negatives ( misses ) compared to other age groups , most probably due to rapid growth and change in facial appearance . Ageing , i.e . the time between an image is taken and when it is compared , negatively affects the accuracy of facial recognition technologies.141 Scientific research does not allow for conclusions on the reliability of a match when more than five years have passed . The same holds true for facial images of older people if compared to images taken many years earlier . When addressing the issue of blanket retention of biometric data for law enforcement purposes of per sons not convicted of a crime , the ECtHR empha sised in S. and Marper v. the UK that this may be especially harmful in case of children , given their special situation and the importance of their devel opment and integration into society.142 Moreover , when facial recognition is used to prevent , detect and investigate terrorism and other serious crime , it is difficult to see how this may justify the pro cessing of facial images of children below the age of criminal responsibility.143 At the same time , in some cases , the impact of facial recognition technology on the best interests of the child may also be positive . Facial recogni tion systems can contribute to protecting the right of the child to preserve their identity.144 In line with the CRC , where a child is deprived of some or all of the elements of their identity , States must pro vide appropriate assistance and protection , with a view to quickly re-establishing the identity of the child.145 Facial recognition systems used by the police and border guards may help trace missing and abducted children , including child victims of crime , and prevent child abduction . FRA ’ s smallscale survey at border posts shows that children reported as missing are frequently encountered at border-crossing points.146 141 Grother , P. , Ngan , M. , Hanaoka , K.

Children – but also older persons – should not be put in a situa tion in which they would , as a result of their age , be disproportionately affected by the negative con sequences of facial recognition technologies . The processing needs to fully respect Article 24 ( rights of the child ) and Article 25 ( rights of the elderly ) of the Charter . 7.4 . Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and of association The freedom of expression and information is a cornerstone of a democratic society.147 This right is enshrined in Article 11 ( 1 ) of the Charter and in Arti cle 10 of the ECHR . As is evident from Article 52 ( 3 ) of the Charter and the CJEU jurisprudence,148 the meaning and scope of this right are the same as those under the ECHR , as interpreted by the ECtHR . The limitations , which may be imposed on it , may therefore not exceed those provided for in Article 10 ( 2 ) of the ECHR.149 Article 12 ( 1 ) of the Charter recognises and protects the freedom of assembly and of association , which corresponds to the same right enshrined in the Article 11 of the ECHR . Under Article 11 ( 2 ) of the ECHR , restrictions on this right are only allowed if these are prescribed by law , pursue one of the legitimate aims expressly listed therein ( e.g . national security , public safety , prevention of crime ) and are necessary in a democratic society . These limitations equally apply to the Charter right guaranteeing freedom of assembly and of association , in accordance with Article 52 ( 3 ) of the Charter . Using facial recognition technologies to process facial images captured by video cameras in public space may interfere with a person ’ s freedom of opin ion and expression , including because a necessary aspect of exercising this freedom is group anonym ity.150 In this regard , a court in Germany declared illegal the publication of pictures taken at demon strations via social media , due to its negative effect 147 ECtHR , Mouvement Raelien Suisse v.

Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 30on the freedom of association.151 Knowing that peo ple are being watched by facial recognition tech nologies in public spaces creates a chilling effect and may lead individuals to change their behaviour . They may not express their thoughts in the same way.152 This infringes on their freedom of expression . If people are discouraged to attend demonstrations , it not only goes at variance with their freedom of expression , but it also represents a serious inter ference with their freedom of assembly . The right of peaceful assembly enables people to participate collectively in shaping their societies in a powerful yet peaceful way . The freedom of assembly protects the ability of people to exercise autonomy while experiencing solidarity with others.153 Using facial recognition technologies during peaceful assem blies may discourage people from demonstrating . If applied during violent protests , the technology may still affect those who protests peacefully along side those rioting . The deployment of facial recog nition technologies may generate a chilling effect whereby individuals refrain from lawfully exercis ing their freedom of assembly and association due to fear of the negative consequences that may fol low.154 They might thus be discouraged from meet ing particular individuals or organisations , attending particular meetings or taking part in certain dem onstrations . The ability to engage in these forms of activity is protected by the Charter . This chill ing effect also has clear implications vis-à-vis the effective functioning of participatory democracy , and thus directly interferes with the freedom of assembly and association.155 Civil society experts indicate that facial recognition technologies may negatively impact on the willingness of protesters to engage in activism . Hence , deploying facial rec ognition technology during demonstrations would need to meet an even higher threshold of neces sity and proportionality than in other public spaces . FRA highlighted that civil society organisations in some EU Member States are already highly concerned that their work is subject to state 151 Verwaltungsgericht Gelsenkirchen ( 2018 ) , 14 K 3543/18 ( ECLI : DE : VGGE:2018:1023.14K3543.18.00 ) . 152 Human Rights Council ( 2019 ) , Surveillance and human rights .

Right to good administration The right to good administration is a well-established general principle of EU law elaborated by the CJEU and , as such , is binding all EU Member States.158 It is also a fundamental right enshrined in Article 41 of the Charter , although only for actions of EU insti tutions , bodies and agencies.159 As a general prin ciple of EU law , it requires EU Member States to apply the requirements of the right to good admin istration in all public action . This right includes , but is not limited to , the right of an individual to have access to their file and the obligation of any public authority to give reasons for its decisions.160 Access to the file facilitates understanding of the eviden tiary basis on which the decision has been made , and/or of the reasons underlying it , thereby plac ing the individual in a better position to put forward counter-arguments when exercising the right to be heard.161 The obligation to give reasons makes , from the perspective of the individuals affected , the decision-making process more transparent , so that the person concerned can know why a measure or action has been taken . According to the CJEU , the context in which individual decisions are made is important in determining the extent of the duty to give reasons.162 The right to good administration also applies when law enforcement authorities process facial images using facial recognition technologies . Although the right to good administration may be subjected to certain limitations , the question arises how to ensure 156 FRA ( 2018 ) , Challenges facing civil society organisations working on human rights in the EU , Luxembourg , Publications Office . 157 See also Privacy International ( 2019 ) , Privacy International ’ s contribution to the half-day general discussion on Article 21 of ICCPR , February 2019 , p. 7 . 158 In recent case law , see CJEU , C-604/12 , H.

FRA Focus 31that the potentially huge number of individuals have all access to their files ( personal data stored ) . Another question is how to make sure that police and other public authorities always give reasons when someone is stopped and/or searched based on a facial recognition match . Exercising the right to access one ’ s file , including the personal data stored in IT systems , requires that the person is aware that their personal data are stored there . People are oftentimes not aware of the fact that their faces are recorded and pro cessed in a database for comparison . If they are not aware of the processing , they are also not in a position to request access to their data . Key components of the right to good administra tion , such as the right to access to one ’ s file and the obligation of the administration to give reasons for its decisions , have also been translated into the more specific provisions of EU data protection law . Article 8 ( 2 ) of the Charter and the EU data protec tion acquis provide for the right of access , correc tion and deletion of one ’ s own personal data that are stored . The possibility to exercise the right of access is part of the right to an effective remedy . If the purpose of data processing concerns 1 ) pre vention , investigation , detection or prosecution of criminal offences , 2 ) execution of criminal penal ties , or 3 ) safeguarding public security , the right to access personal data and to request the correction or erasure may be limited in the following cases according to the Law Enforcement Directive:163 to avoid obstructing official or legal inquiries , investigations or procedures ; to avoid prejudicing the prevention , detection , investigation or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties ; to protect public security ; to protect national security ; to protect the rights and freedoms of others.164 These exemptions stem from the obligation for law enforcement authorities to work within a cer tain degree of confidentiality and secrecy in order to ensure the effectiveness of their work . In this 163 Arts . 15-16 . 164 See also FRA ( 2018 ) , Preventing unlawful profiling today and in the future : a guide , Luxembourg , Publications Office , December 2018 , p. 105.context , and as highlighted by FRA in previous reports,165 independent accountability mechanisms are key to ensure effective access to remedies . A combination of internal and external monitor ing bodies , active a different stages of the process ( before , during , and after the use of facial recogni tion technologies ) would guarantee that individu als ’ rights are properly and effectively protected . According to FRA research , there is still a lack of awareness and understanding of how to exercise the right to access , correction or deletion of inac curate personal data that are stored in large-scale IT systems.166 The same applies to facial recogni tion databases used for law enforcement purposes . This situation is exacerbated by the fact that very few lawyers are specialised in seeking to enforce the right of access , correction and deletion of per sonal data in IT systems , including facial images used for facial recognition . 7.6 . Right to an effective remedy Article 47 of the Charter guarantees the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal , including a fair trial . This fundamental right of horizontal charac ter empowers individuals to challenge a measure affecting any right conferred to them by EU law and not only in respect of the fundamental rights guar anteed in the Charter.167 The right to an effective remedy also covers decisions taken with the sup port of facial recognition technologies , for example , a measure ( such as a police stop ) that has solely or significantly been informed by facial recognition.168 The CJEU underlined that Article 47 of the Charter constitutes a reaffirmation of the principle of effec tive judicial protection and that the characteristics 165 See FRA ( 2015 ) , Surveillance by intelligence services : fundamental rights safeguards and remedies in the EU – Volume I : Members States ’ legal framework , Luxembourg , Publications Office , November 2015 ; and FRA ( 2017 ) , Surveillance by intelligence services : fundamental rights safeguards and remedies in the EU – Volume II : field perspectives and legal update , Luxembourg , Publications Office , October 2017 . 166 FRA ( 2018 ) , Under watchful eyes : biometrics , EU IT systems and fundamental rights , Luxembourg , Publications Office , March 2018 , pp . 17 , 100-101 . 167 EU Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights , Commentary on the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union , June 2006 , p. 360 .

Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 32of a remedy must be determined in a manner that is consistent with this principle.169 A precondition to exercise the right to an effec tive remedy is that a person must be aware that his or her facial image is processed . As the CJEU has noted , in the context of security measures affect ing the right to private life and the right to the protection of personal data , national law enforce ment authorities must notify the persons affected , under the applicable national procedures , as soon as that notification is no longer capable of jeopardis ing the investigations undertaken by those author ities.170 Such a situation occurs , for example , when law enforcement authorities populate a ‘ watchlist ’ used for facial recognition with a great number of facial images . The CJEU has found that notification is , in fact , necessary to enable the persons affected by these measures to exercise , inter alia , their right to an effective legal remedy guaranteed in Article 47 of the Charter.171 EU data protection law reconfirms that the right to an effective judicial remedy must be provided in relation to decisions by the controller or the proces sor172 as well as the supervisory authority.173 Data processed by facial recognition technologies is no exception . People might want to challenge why their facial image has been included in the ‘ watch list ’ ; why it has been done so in a non-transparent way and without their consent ; or seek redress for a false positive match that entailed negative consequences for them ( e.g . unlawful stop , search or arrest ) , including seeking compensation for any damage suffered174 ( e.g . the individual missed a flight connection , or was wrongly prevented from entering an EU country and missed a business meeting ) . 169 CJEU , C-432/05 , Unibet ( London ) Ltd , Unibet ( International ) Ltd v.

FRA Focus 33Conclusions Using facial recognition technology – a technology that has been developing quickly in the past years and is increasingly used by multiple actors – affects a range of fundamental rights . However , there is limited information about the way and extent to which the technology is used by law enforcement , and about the impact of its use on fundamental rights . Working with new AI-driven technologies , which are not yet fully understood and where not much experience has yet been gathered , requires the involvement of all relevant stakeholders and experts from different disciplines . Facial images constitute biometric data , EU law rec ognises , as they can be used to identify individuals . Facial recognition technology can be used in many different ways , such as verifying the identity of a person , checking whether a person is among a list of people , and even to categorise people accord ing to different characteristics . Live facial recogni tion technology detects all faces on video footage and then compares the faces against watch lists – potentially used at public spaces . While not much information is available about the actual use of facial recognition technology in the EU , several Member States are considering , test ing or planning the use of the technology for law enforcement purposes . Most actively , the police in the United Kingdom carried out several tests in real life situations such as sports events , even using real watch lists . Other law enforcement agencies tested the accuracy of the technology in larger tests with volunteers , such as the police in Berlin , Germany or in Nice , France . The lack of more comprehensive information about the actual use of the technology limits the opportunities to analyse its fundamental rights implications . In particular , there are no laws or other guidance or information on who will be included in potential watch lists . The fundamental rights implications of using facial recognition technology vary considerably depending on the purpose , context and scope of the use . Some of the fundamental rights implications stem from the technology ’ s lack of accuracy . Accuracy has strongly increased , but the technology still always comes with a certain rate of error , which can negatively impact fundamental rights . Moreover , importantly , several fundamental rights concerns would remain even if there were a complete absence of errors . Notwithstanding the varying context , purpose and scope of the use of facial recognition technology , several fundamental rights considerations apply . The way facial images are obtained and used – poten tially without consent or opportunities to opt out – can have a negative impact on people ’ s dignity . Relatedly , the rights to respect for private life and protection of personal data are at the core of fun damental rights concerns when using facial recog nition technology . In addition , any use of the tech nology needs to be thoroughly assessed in terms of its potential impact on non-discrimination and rights of special groups , such as children , older persons and persons with disabilities , because of the ( some times unknown ) varying accuracy of the technology for these groups and according to other protected characteristics . Moreover , freedom of expression , association and assembly must not be undermined by the use of the technology . Lastly , the paper highlights that it is essential to consider procedural rights when facial recognition technology is used by public administrations , includ ing the right to good administration and the right to an effective remedy and fair trial . Given the novelty of the lechnology as well as the lack of experience and detailed studies on the impact of facial recognition technologies , multiple aspects are key to consider before deploying such a sys tem in real life applications : Following the example of the large-scale EU IT systems , a clear and sufficiently detailed legal framework must regulate the deployment and use of facial recognition technologies . Determin ing when the processing of facial images is nec essary and proportionate will depend on the pur pose for which the technology is used and on the safeguards in place to protect individuals whose facial images are subjected to automated pro cessing from possible negative consequences . Forms of facial recognition that involve a very high degree of intrusion into fundamental rights , compromising the inviolable essential core of one or more fundamental rights , are unlawful . A distinction must be made between the pro cessing of facial images for verification purposes , when two facial images are compared to verify if they appertain to the same person ; and their processing for identification purposes , when a facial image is run against a database or watchlist of facial images . The risk of interferences with fundamental rights is higher in the second case and therefore the necessity and proportionality test must be stricter . So-called “ live facial recognition technologies ” − when facial images are extracted from video cameras deployed in public spaces – are particu larly challenging . Such a use triggers different Facial recognition technology : fundamental rights considerations in the context of law enforcement 34feelings among the population and raises fears of a strong power imbalance of the State versus the individual . These fears need to be taken seriously . Given that individuals may not be aware that their facial image is matched against a watch list and considering the higher error rate com pared to facial images taken in a controlled envi ronment ( such as an airport or a police station ) , their use should remain exceptional . It should be strictly limited to combatting terrorism and other forms of serious crime , or to detect miss ing people and victims of crime . When facial images are extracted from video cameras deployed in public areas , assessing necessity and proportionality of facial recogni tion must also consider where the cameras are placed . There is a difference between a sports or cultural event and events where people exercise one of their fundamental rights . The deployment of facial recognition technologies during demon strations may generate a chilling effect whereby individuals refrain from lawfully exercising their freedom of assembly and association due to fear of the negative consequences that may follow . It is difficult to imagine situations where the deploy ment of facial recognition technologies on peo ple participating in demonstration may be nec essary and proportionate . Facial recognition technology algorithms never provide a definitive result , but only probabilities that two faces appertain to the same person . In the context of law enforcement , there is thus a certain margin of error leading to people being wrongly flagged . When deploying the technol ogy , the risks of wrongly flagging people must be kept to a minimum . Everyone who is stopped as a result of the technology must be treated in a dignified manner . Public authorities typically rely on private compa nies for procuring and deploying the technology . Industry and the scientific research community can play an important role in developing tech nical solutions that promote respect for funda mental rights , including the protection of personal data . For this , however , fundamental rights con siderations need to be built into technical spec ifications and contracts . The EU Public Procure ment Directive ( 2014/24/EU ) strengthened EU Member States ’ commitment towards a socially responsible public procurement when purchas ing a product or a service . Following the spirit of the 2014 directive , the EU and its Member States could apply a similar approach when procuring facial recognition technology or commissioning innovative research . Placing fundamental rights and , in particular , data protection and non-discrim ination requirements at the centre of all technical specifications , would ensure that the industry pays due attention thereto . Possible measures could include a binding requirement to involve data pro tection experts and human rights specialists in the teams working on the development of the tech nology , to ensure fundamental rights compliance by design . Furthermore , technical specifications could make reference to high quality standards to minimise false identification rates and adverse impacts on gender , ethnicity and age . A fundamental rights impact assessment is an essential tool to ensure a fundamental rights com pliant application of facial recognition technolo gies , whatever the context in which it is employed . Such an assessment needs to evaluate all affected rights , including those listed in this paper , in a comprehensive manner . To enable them to carry out such assessment , public authorities need to obtain all necessary information from the indus try which is required to assess the technology ’ s impact on fundamental rights . Trade secrets or confidentiality considerations should not hinder this effort.177 In light of the constantly developing technology , interferences with fundamental rights are not easy to predict . Close monitoring by independent super visory bodies of facial recognition developments is therefore essential . Article 8 ( 3 ) of the Charter on the protection of personal data requires the oversight of data processing by an independent authority . To prevent fundamental rights viola tions and effectively support those people whose fundamental rights are affected by facial recogni tion technology , oversight authorities must have sufficient powers , resources and expertise . 177 See also Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights ( 2019 ) , Unboxing Artificial Intelligence : 10 steps to protect Human Rights – Recommendation , Council of Europe , Strasbourg , May 2019 .
