The current preliminary analysis suggests that by 2030 , EU action on liability could generate €54.8 billion in added value for the EU economy by stepping up the level of research and development in AI and in the range of €498.3 billion if other broader impacts , including reductions in accidents , health and environmental impacts and user impacts are also taken into consideration . A clear and coherent EU civil liability regime for AI has the potential to reduce risks and increase safety , decrease legal uncertainty and related legal and litigation costs , and enhance consumer rights and trust . Those elements together could facilitate the faster and arguably safer uptake and diffusion of AI . Member States have not yet adopted specific legislation related to the regulation of liability for AI , with some exceptions related to drones , autonomous vehicles and medical AI applications . Timely action at EU level would therefore reduce regulatory fragmentation and costs for producers of AI while also helping to secure high levels of protection for fundamental and consumer rights in the EU Study EN ( PDF - 2 MB ) About this document Publication type Study Author EVAS Tatjana Policy area European Added Value Geographical area EU Member States Share this page : Share this page on Facebook Share this page on X Share this page on LinkedIn Share this page on Whatsapp Sign up for email updates Think Tank Other sources Legislative Observatory Register of documents STOA EPRS blog ESPAS ORBIS - Foresight studies ' hub URBIS - Implementation studies ' hub EU Bookshop European Parliament News Topics MEPs About Parliament Plenary Committees Delegations Elections Check out Parliament on Facebook Check out Parliament on X Check out Parliament on Flickr Check out Parliament on LinkedIn Check out Parliament on YouTube Check out Parliament on Instagram Check out Parliament on Pinterest Check out Parliament on Snapchat Check out Parliament on Reddit Contact Sitemap Legal notice Privacy policy Accessibility
