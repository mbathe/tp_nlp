However , in recent years symbolic AI has been complemented and sometimes replaced by Neural Networks and Machine Learning techniques . This has vastly increased its potential utility and impact on society , with the consequence that the ethical debate has gone mainstream . Such debate has primarily focused on principles - the what of AI ethics - rather than on practices , the how . Awareness of the potential issues is increasing at a fast rate , but the AI community 's ability to take action to mitigate the associated risks is still at its infancy . Therefore , our intention in presenting this research is to contribute to closing the gap between principles and practices by constructing a typology that may help practically-minded developers apply ethics at each stage of the pipeline , and to signal to researchers where further work is needed . The focus is exclusively on Machine Learning , but it is hoped that the results of this research may be easily applicable to other branches of AI . The article outlines the research method for creating this typology , the initial findings , and provides a summary of future research needs .
