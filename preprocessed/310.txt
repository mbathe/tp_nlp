The history of the Industrial Revolution teaches us that nation states have always endeavored to build or maintain political supremacy through pioneering economic achievements . In the age of digital upheavals , multiple disruptions and immense acceleration , this dictum still applies . The topic of “ artificial intelligence ” plays a special role here – a technology that is currently being discussed worldwide and increasingly applied . As with any new tech nology , both the Cassandrian pessimists ( such as Steven Hawking or Elon Musk ) and the progress optimists ( Mark Zuckerberg , Eric Schmidt or Bill Gates ) contribute their theses on the future development of humanity . They widely vary from dark dystopia to paradisiacal future prospects . Let us hope that the recently appointed Enquete Commission of the German Bundestag will counter an agitated and possibly overheated debate with sober stocktaking . Germany ’ s AI strategy , which is expected by the end of the year , must define quanti fiable goals and concrete measures , which will then be vigorously implemented . The political crash barriers necessary for the use of automated machine learning need to be established . Other countries are well ahead in this respect . They have long since defined AI strate gies , developed business models and subjected ground-breaking applications to initial practical tests . Therefore , it is worth taking a close look at how other economies are dealing with the digital revolution : What regulatory framework conditions have they defined ? How do they implement policy strategies and programs to create new indus trial policy facts ? With this two-part publication , the Konrad Adenauer Foundation intends to give a com parative overview of the AI strategies of major national economies in order to provide food for thought and inspire the German debate . We believe : “ Tech is politics ” – and pol itics and civil society should give this more attention and discuss this more vigorously . I hope you find this publication an inspiring read . Yours Dr. Gerhard Wahlers Dr. Gerhard Wahlers is Deputy Secretary General and Head of the Principal Department for European and International Cooperation of the Konrad-Adenauer-Stiftung . 5 Background and Definitions Artificial intelligence : rapid developments and designs of the initial conceptual AI frameworks . In July 2018 , the German federal government published a key issues paper on the German strategy with regard to artificial intelligence ( AI ) and there they acknowledge : “ Artificial intelli gence has reached a new stage of maturity in recent years and is becoming a driver of digitiza tion and autonomous systems in all spheres of life. ” 1 Therefore , the state , society , the economy , the government , and science are urged to con sider artificial intelligence in depth and to deal with its chances and risks . A comprehensive German AI strategy was pre sented at the Digital Summit in December 2018 . The aim is to prominently embed the topic of AI in the digital policy of the federal government . In this way , Germany is catching up with a large number of countries which in recent years have seen extensive initiatives for AI strategy finding processes.2 These strategies are motivated by partly spec tacular progress in research and application of AI systems , based on techniques of Machine Learning ( ML ) as well as its subdiscipline of Deep Learning ( DL ) and its large varieties of neuronal networks . The global relevance of AI technologies is dem onstrated by their prominent representation on this year ’ s international agenda – from the Munich Security Conference in February , to the presenta tion of the EU Commission ’ s3 AI paper in April , to the joint AI declaration of the G7 states in Canada in June ( “ Charlevoix Common Vision for the Future of Artificial Intelligence ” ) .4 The role of Artificial Intelligence as a potential key technology of dystopian future concepts , social control , and autocratic world power fantasies is also increasingly finding its way into public debate . This overview , however , focuses on the analysis of AI framework conceptss in six countries and how they deal with the revolutionary potential of Artifi cial Intelligence . The following definition is used as a basis for the terminology : “ In the broadest sense , artificial intelli gence is the ability of machines to learn , to think , to plan and to perceive ; i. e. the primary qualities that we identify with human cognition . This ability is achieved by digital technologies or digital-phys ical hybrid technologies , which imitate the cognitive and physical functions of humans . For that purpose , AI systems do not only process data , they recognize patterns , draw conclusions , and become more intelligent over time . Their ability to adopt and refine newly developed skills has improved significantly since the turn of the century . This also means that what is referred to as AI changes with each major technological breakthrough , and the definition must therefore be periodi cally adjusted. ” 1 Cf .

The analysis of the six countries from part 1 of the study and the findings from the countries examined in this part ( Canada , Japan , Israel , United Arab Emirates , India and Singapore ) serve as a basis . Against the background of the results of the first two parts of the study , there is also a third part in preparation which focuses exclusively on the analysis of the recently published German AI strategy and the recommendations for action that follow it . Policy fields for AI : In the European countries , the economic potential of AI is considered above all , while in Japan AI is seen as part of the inevita ble next stage in human development , which will encompass all areas of life : Society 5.0 . In Israel , the security policy dimension plays a central role ; an aspect that other countries selectively or only rudimentarily address in their strategies . The USA , and China in particular , benefit from mutu ally open civil and military sectors . In India , the AI focus is on the promotion of social and societal aspects . Ethics and human orientation as strategic strengths of the Europeans : Although ethical issues are discussed in different social forums in China and the USA , the topic is not given any high priority by the respective governments . This has left leeway for France ’ s Emanuel Macron to take the lead on the topic of ethical AI . Although Lon don took the initiative faster than Paris to develop an international AI governance architecture , it was weakened by the Brexit in its attempts to project and implement such initiative . Other countries , such as Finland , also lack the international signifi cance for this . The private sector as driver in AI development : In the leading AI countries , i. e. the USA and China , the development dynamics are largely determined by the private sector , in particular by young com panies and globally operating Internet groups . These dynamics are enhanced by the deregulation tendencies that are common in the USA . In China , on the other hand , trends towards increased state control of the large technology companies become more and more evident . In Japan and South Korea , it is also the globally positioned hardware-oriented conglomerates that are driving AI forward . In the countries of continental Europe ( including Germany ) , which focus on science and the protection of individuals , there is currently a lack of global technology companies . This is based in part on a general skepticism towards digital technologies and the resulting protective attitude of politics and society . AI superpowers vs. “ fortress countries ” : In com parison to the USA , where cooperation between business and science has grown over decades , Europeans , but also countries such as Canada , Singapore , Japan and India , have so far only been able to achieve this permeability to a very limited extent . Excellent research results remain in the ivory tower and its walls of debilitating regula tion . Connecting AI research with the needs of the industry thus represents a major challenge in these countries . Ecosystems as a strategic asset : In order to develop better solutions and introduce them into the international dialogue , in addition to research ers , 2. talented developers , 3. data pools , 4. com puting capacities and 5. strategic entrepreneurs , experienced investors ( 6 . ) and an agile ( 7 . ) are also required . While in the USA and China as well as partly in Israel these factors provide the breeding ground for the successful commercialisation of AI , within Europe this is only possible to some extent in the United Kingdom . In France or Finland , the small number of AI startups bears witness to the fact that such ecosystems are not yet actively Summary 7 Summary thought through and supported to the necessary extent . In Japan and South Korea , the majority of these factors is concentrated in large corpo rations , while local startup ecosystems remain small . Lack of computing capacities as a strategic weakness : While availability of data and training of specialists are promoted by many strategies as a prerequisite for AI research and commercialisa tion , only in a few cases is there also a focus on the expansion of domestic computing capacities ( except : South Korea , Japan and China ) . The cur rent global trade conflicts reveal that availability of powerful chips or access to cloud-based comput ing power is a strategic necessity . Despite a tech nologically highly developed economy , there is only a small globally competitive semiconductors industry in Europe . At the moment , US companies dominate this sector . Vague and inconsistent AI definitions : In the strategies compared , there are very different defi nitions of AI , or in some cases no definitions at all . The only thing that the strategies have in com mon is that they consider AI a driving force in the digital revolution , which harbours both potentials and risks in terms of social , economic and secu rity policy . Accordingly , they often leave aside any existing sector or digital strategies . This is the the oretical foundation and basis for the divergence and convergence of different national AI strate gies . Such divergence and convergence is both positive and problematic , since it leads to appli cation diversity on the one hand , but at the same time increases the cost and time expenditure for political transition and implementation of global approaches for cooperation and regulation . Lack of target systems : The strategies are pre dominantly formulated in general terms . Their partially vague objectives relate to different levels of impact . For example , China measures the eco nomic strength of the AI industry , among others , while Great Britain and South Korea also set tar gets for the number of future PhD students . The Japanese government has established clear goals and time frames for AI applications.The countries of the second part of the study at a glance : Canada : Canada has developed a comprehensive strategy that involves all levels of economy , sci ence and industry in order to strategically posi tion the relevant players and support each other across disciplines . The aim is to strengthen the global presence and improve national prospects . The country also strives to take on an interna tional leadership role in research and ethical prac tice . Canada ’ s early involvement in AI research has made it possible for provincial , regional and federal governments to provide targeted support for educational and research institutions since the 1980s . The institutions are now well positioned , especially in terms of research and development . The government continues to play an important role in the development of advanced technologies by supporting communities with high-level strate gic investments and transfers . The state collabo rates closely with the private sector to improve financing , access and commercial applications . At the same time , the value of ethics is empha sized . By supporting academic and commercial recruiting and loyalty tactics through three major institutions , Canada aims to offer its economy a sustainable future and an open approach for the exchange of knowledge . Japan : No government in any of the reviewed countries links the future of their country as closely to AI as Shinzō Abe in Japan . One of his two top goals is the realization of Society 5.0 . In this next stage of human evolution , the physi cal and cyber worlds merge . Numerous govern ment initiatives and an interministerial AI strategy have already resulted from the implementation work . The focus of research funding is on three institutes that perform research on specific AI applications for increased productivity , mobility , medicine and safety . So far , the private sector has been the main contributor to research spending . Public university research is underfunded and internationally isolated . The degree of permeabil ity and exchange between research and indus try is also rather low . In order to change this , the cross-appointment system allows researchers and developers from science and the private sector , 8 Summary respectively to work part-time in the other area . Universities also receive incentives to do more research together with the private sector . Large companies such as Toyota , NEC or Toshiba have recognised that the future of machines lies in their intelligence . They can scale it globally if they catch up in software development and adopt the concept of open innovation . So far , there are only a few AI startups . With deregulation in sandboxes and geographically defined Strategic Special Zones , AI policy is linked to the development of struc turally weak regions . The government wants to achieve global integration by adapting data pro tection legislation to the EU GDPR , establishing international standards for robotics and guide lines for ethical AI . Israel : In the last two decades , the “ startup nation ” has created a dynamic high-tech sector with at least 360 AI start-ups through incentives and sup port programmes . In a highly developed network approach , national and international business and science cooperate closely with the state . Virtually all the major tech companies and corporations in the world operate research centres in Israel . They generate many jobs , but often transfer the added value of intellectual property abroad . Through the Technology Transfer Companies ( TTC ) , the domestic universities and research clinics have established an effective instrument for the commercialisation of research . Startups can rely on funding run ning into billions by the innovation authority and Venture Capital , particularly for establishment and development of marketable technology products . The military considers AI to be “ the key to survival in the modern world ” and acts as a driving force of innovation through its selection and training programmes : Israel – a knight of the cognitive era Although there is still no independent AI strategy , yet , Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sees great export potential for AI in the fields of cyber security , digital medicine and mobility . However , the transformative force of AI has so far been little reflected in society of the country.United Arab Emirates : Small data pools , no supercomputers , very low scientific performance , and practically no AI patents . In contrast to that , there is an urgent need to reduce dependence on oil revenues and to diversify the economy , in combination with the government ’ s high politi cal capacity to act . As part of a cabinet reshuffle in October 2017 , the government systematically focused on the vision of making the UAE the “ best country in the world ” by 2071 . Technology , and particularly AI and innovation , plays a central role in this . These ambitions are reflected in the newly established State Ministry for AI and in many ambitious and concisely formulated technology strategies . Their goal is clear : a leading position for the UAE in the application of AI . For implemen tation , the country relies above all on the creative power and demands of the authorities and on partnerships with countries such as India . It is not yet clear which concrete capacities are to be built up and how they will fit into the global AI land scape . India : India has a unique focus on the applica tion of AI to improve welfare and social problems and seeks leadership in this area . Before this can be achieved , however , India must overcome a multitude of challenges . There is a particular lack of institutional and coordinating capacities , which the Indian AI Strategy of 2018 aims to rem edy with institutions at two levels : to promote the basic AI research and to advance AI commer cialisation . Other obstacles include a low level of data processing capabilities , a weak intellectual property system and relatively low Internet pen etration . India ’ s approach will bear fruit only if and when these factors show progress . However , important findings on institution establishment can be derived from the Indian AI strategy , such as the strategically positioned two-stage institu tions at the level of basic AI research and AI com mercialisation policy . Both aim to build partner ships with relevant stakeholders to found and expand networks and accelerate AI development . 9 Summary Singapore : The country is seeking a co-operative AI ecosystem between industry and science and intends to provide an environment with appropri ate resources to foster innovative development . In the absence of mineral resources and geopo litical relevance , the promotion of digitisation and AI has become one of the government ’ s priori ties , with the aim of becoming known worldwide as the AI hub . To this end , the five-year initiative AI Singapore was developed in 2017 . Within the 100Experiments scheme , companies can submit problems for which there is no standardised AI solution yet , but for which a solution could easily be worked out . These companies and their prob lems are then placed with AI developers . Through Fundamental Research , Singapore supports basic research and addresses research gaps , with a view to both technical and ethical societal issues . Understanding and acceptance of AI among the population is promoted by the AI for Everyone scheme , which offers specific learning formats on AI . The Accreditation @ SGD initiative supports young companies in their early growth phases by means of customised consulting services , par ticularly in the areas of technical applications . In addition to its efforts to create an AI-friendly envi ronment among relevant players and in terms of legislation , the government also intends to pro mote , through various initiatives , the responsible use of data and the ethical use of AI solutions . 10 Cambrian AI Index © The analysis assessed the countries on the basis indicators that incorporate the countries ’ pre conditions , the research and development situ ation and the degree of commercialisation of AI . To integrate these indicators and determine the AI position of a country , the Cambrian AI Index © was developed . The index is limited by proxy measurements for which reliable and compara ble data are available at this early stage of the AI application . There was no weighting of the data . The reference country for the index is the United States , the world ’ s leading AI nation .

Rather , the declared objectives are : 1 ) to prevent AI talent from migrating to the USA , 2 ) to create favourable conditions for the commercialisation and economic growth of the country . In order to achieve these goals , the various administrative and governmental levels in the country have allo cated a total of approximately 430 million Euros6 provided by various schemes , either directly or very closely linked to R & D in AI , talent delivery and commercialisation . II . ) Requirements for AI Canada has about 36 million inhabitants ( about one tenth of the United States ) , 32 million of whom used the Internet in 2016.7 The source of potential data for AI is correspondingly small . 12 Canada IV . ) Research and Development In Canada , total R & D spending in 2016 was at around 22 billion Euro.13 Around 200 million Euro have been allocated for AI research ; 83 million via the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy14 and 118 million are forwarded to the universities of Montreal and McGill through the Canada First Research Excel lence Fund .15 In addition the provincial govern ments of Quebec and Ontario recently allocated a further 100 million Euro exclusively for R & D in AI.16 According to the CSRanking , about 120 teach ers ( about 1,060 in the USA ) have been engaged in research on AI in the country since 2016,17 which represents a similar relation relative to the overall population as in the United States.18 These teachers are estimated to supervise 370 doctoral students per year.19 The AI-relevant scientific pro duction is 1,200 citable documents,20 which puts Canada in eighth place among the twelve coun tries compared . Interestingly , however , Canada ranks fourth in the H index , which measures the influence of these publications ( after the US , UK and China ) ,21 which emphasises the high quality of Canadian AI publications . Research areas and instruments The most important instrument for AI R & D is the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy managed by CIFAR ( see above ) , which coordinates research at the three major AI hubs . These three centres , located in Montreal , Toronto and Edmonton , are all associ -The public sector , on the other hand ( also a rel evant data source for AI ) makes its data freely available in high quality ( among the countries compared , the availability and quality of public sector data is better only in the UK ) .8 In relation to Canada ’ s small population , about as many Master ’ s students are trained in AI-related fields as in the USA . This puts Canada ahead of Great Britain and France and behind Singapore and Israel . In absolute figures , however , it is esti mated that there are currently only 860 Master ’ s students , which means that the country still lags significantly behind the USA.9 In addition , Canada only operates six of the world ’ s 500 best super computers.10 III . ) Institutional framework Canada has a strong institutional framework to implement AI R & D funds for a network of estab lished top research institutions . A central pil lar in this framework is the Canadian Institute For Advancement and Research ( CIFAR ) , founded in 1982 , which currently runs twelve different R & D programmes in 16 provinces , which in turn pro vide orientation for the Pan-Canadian AI Strategy , and whigh governs the recently established Fed eral Fund with 83 million Euro . CIFAR is currently forwarding the majority of this fund to the three main AI R & D centres in Canada : the Montreal Insti tute for Learning Algorithms ( MILA ) in Montreal , the Vector Institute in Toronto and the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute ( AMII ) in Edmonton . All three centres are associated with universities that strictly focus on AI R & D and not on commercialisation . Ethics – “ top down ” and “ bottom up ” : The discourse on AI ethics and the impact of AI progress on society in Canada takes place at several levels On the one side , CIFAR man ages an independent program ( with its own fund and team ) called “ AI & Society ” . It is focused on future national economic , ethi cal and legal policies which take into account the concerns about the impact of AI on the labour market or on the health sector.11 To this end , the AI & Society team runs nation wide workshops , conducts surveys with experts and cooperates with the UK and France . In addition to this “ top down ” -Initia tive , the Montreal AI players have compiled the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI , which aims to stimulate the discussion between the public , the private sector and the state.12 It proposes a framework and a set of values , such as well-being , autonomy , justice and privacy , which must be assessed and observed in the development or imple mentation of AI technologies . 13 Canada ated to local universities and focus almost exclu sively on AI research and development . These centres , each led by one of the three famous AI researchers Dr. Yoshua Bengio , Geoffrey Hinton and Richard Sutton , are pioneers in the develop ment of Deep Learning , neural networks and rein forcement learning . It is worth noting that they continued to operate during the last “ AI hiberna tion ” of the 1990s and 2000s , financed by a sister AI programme also managed by CIFAR ( “ Learn ings in Machines & Brains ” ) .22 Today , with renewed interest in AI research , all three centres benefit from the basic funding provided by the federal programmes . The Vector Institute hub in Toronto is currently the best funded . In addition to the 14 million Euro it received from CIFAR , a further 86 million Euro came from the provincial govern ment and the private sector , in particular Goog le.23 It ’ s not uncommon in Canada for private investments to be made following public funds . With the additional funding from the private sec tor and the provincial governments , all three centres have expanded their basic research and are now actively participating in the development of the following key technologies : Deep learning , neural networks , reinforcement learning , Pattern Recognition , Computer Vision , unattended learn ing , Natural language processing , Deep Networks , learning theory and optimisation of Deep learn ing , statistical theory and algorithmic gaming theory . All in all , the centres directly or indirectly support a large network of researchers , with the MILA Montreal Centre taking the lead and directly supporting 234 AI researchers.24 Canadian companies are also offered 15 to 35 percent tax benefit for basic and applied research in the field of science and technology through the Scientific Research and Expert Develop ment ( SR & ED ) program.25 In addition , the Global Talent Stream program26 simplifies immigration requirements for AI researchers , and other spe cialists and talents . According to Navdeep Bains , Canada ’ s Minister of Innovation , Science and Eco nomic Development it only takes “ two weeks ” until a work permit for these researchers is applied for and issued.27 Other countries can learn from this as the battle for AI talent intensifies.V . ) Commercialisation Commercialisation of AI research is the weak point of the country . While a study by Asgard and Roland Berger in 2018 recorded 131 AI startups ( just under 1,400 in the USA ) ,28 another mapping of the Canadian startup scene revealed 650 AIfocused startups scattered across the country in 2018.29 In 2016 , however , only 2.7 percent of all global investments in AI startups were made in Canada ( USA 62 percent in the same period ) .30 Also , only a small proportion of relevant AI pat ents originate in the country ( between 2015 and 2017 , an average of 1.43 percent of all interna tionally enforceable AI patents worldwide ) .31 At the level of automation of the economy , measured by the number of robots per 10,000 employees in the manufacturing industry , the country is ranked in the back midfield ( 145 robots in comparison to 631 in South Korea and 71 in Great Britain ) .32 Among the countries compared , the public sec tor exerts the least influence as a possible driver of innovation through its demand33 and does not play a role in the strategy as a possible user of AI , either . Regulation : The Canadian federal govern ment sets the guidelines for provincial regula tion . Of the ten provinces , the following are the most economically important : Ontario , Que bec , Alberta and British Columbia . The existing rules and regulations are not sufficient to pro mote the use and application of AI , in particular with regard to intellectual property , copyright and ownership of both inputs ( data ) and out puts ( decisions or actions of robots ) and think ing machines that use AI ) .34 CIFAR , with its “ AI & Society ” programme , is working hard tochange this . They focus on cross-company and crossindustry collaboration , data privacy and ethics . PIPEDA , the law on the protection of personal data and electronic documents , which in many respects is similar to the EU GDPR , regulates the use of data ( the input ) as well as the actions in case of data protection violations , as stipulated by the latest amendment ( November 2018 ) .35 The regulations also include how Canadian startups and companies can use data in their AI models . 14The Canadian Securities Authority ( CSA ) , the gov erning body of the Canadian capital market , has established a special regulatory zone ( sandbox ) to explore new business models with innova tive products in the capital markets , such as the use of AI for trading.36 Similar special zones are also being developed by Transport Canada for the development of self-propelled vehicles , after the institution has specified “ Guidelines for Testing of Highly Automated Vehicles ” .37 Health Canada also promotes the research and testing of technologi cally advanced ( and possibly AI-controlled ) medi cal devices.38 Generally speaking , while Canada ’ s current regula tions remain insufficient and overall cautious with regard to AI applications , they are not too strict to discourage companies . On the contrary : Compa nies and startups are familiar with what is allowed and what is not ( e. g. through PIPEDA ) , they are given the opportunity to participate in the discus sions on future regulations ( e. g. through CIFAR and the CSA Special Regulatory Zone ) and have a good understanding of which industries will be better regulated next . Promotion of startups and companies : The Cana dian federal government is focusing its direct sup port of commercialisation of technology and inno vation on larger projects and companies . However , smaller companies and startups , are not left alone and well supported by private venture capital . The Strategic Innovation Fund of Canada ( SIF ) , a program designed to accelerate technology trans fer and the commercialisation of innovative prod ucts , is intended to provide grants for companies and their projects , which will cover up to 50 per cent of the expenditure.39 This fund is also availa ble to foreign companies intending to do business in Canada . With the 2018 budget , this fund was replenished with 840 million Euro for a period of five years.40 Although the SIF is more traditional in its operation ( i. e. ‘ grant application ’ ) , it is quite flexible and often changes its parameters . In Feb ruary 2018 , for example , the fund announced that it would adapt to the economic situation and gen eral access to capital by providing 6.7 million Euro to support larger projects.At the beginning of 2018 , the federal govern ment announced a new commercialisation instru ment , the “ Supercluster ” initiative , which will be financed with around 635 million Euro over five years.41 The Superclusters were created specifi cally to promote economic growth and to encour age the private sector to collaborate with educa tion and research institutions to create regional innovation ecosystems comparable to Silicon Valley . Three of these superclusters are specifi cally oriented towards applied research and the use of AI technologies for commercialisation . The Advanced Manufacturing Supercluster in Ontario focuses on the next generation of manufacturing and robotics.42 With 270 participants , the largest “ Digital Technology Supercluster ” in British Colum bia concentrates on the use of larger data records and machine learning to improve service delivery in the fields of natural resources , precision health care and manufacturing.43 The “ AI-Powered Supply Chains Supercluster ( SCALE.AI ) ” , headquartered in Quebec , focuses on harmonising the sectors of manufacturing , transport , IT and retail as well as on developing intelligent supply chains using AI and robotics.44Canada 1523 Shead , 2017 . 24 MILA , k.

Since immigration is very limited for various reasons ( less than two percent of foreigners in 2016 ) ,47 AI is intended to help compensate for a shrinking working popu lation . Consequently , the focus is on practical fields of application which fundamental research is intended to serve : 1 ) productivity , 2 ) health , care and wellbeing , 3 ) mobility and 4 ) security.48 ›Interministerial AI strategy and numerous government initiatives for attainment of Society 5.0 ›Three research institutes researching specific AI application areas ›Cross-appointment system and reforms for increased permeability between research and industry ›Adapted copyright law for text and data mining and adaptation to EU GDPR ›Deregulation in special regulatory zones ( sandboxes ) and geographically defined strategic special zones ›But : Hardware focus of large corporations ( IoT ) and only a few AI startups I . ) Introduction “ Abenomics ” , Premier Shinzō Abe ’ s ambitious economic programme , has two key objectives . One is sustainable growth . The other is nothing less than mankind ’ s evolutionary move towards the “ super-smart society 5.0. ” 45 “ Society 5.0 is a human-centred society that reconciles economic progress with the solution of social problems through a system that integrates cyberspace and physical space to a very high degree. ” 46 The fact Japan On the way to “ Society 5.0 ” with AI 17Japan AI-supported robots are to be used primarily in geriatric care,49 which is also based on a cultural openness to non-human forms of intelligence.50 AI technology should be understood as a service ( AIaaS ) based on large amounts of data from the Internet of Things ( IoT ) , as the strategy presented in March 2017 explains.51 For the 2018 financial year alone , the govern ment has planned total investments of around 580 million Euro in the AI sector , which repre sents an increase of 30 percent over the previous year , but which the Japanese press still considers to be too low.52 The globally operating Japanese corporations are strong in the hardware sector , but lack soft ware innovations . They try to buy these abroad , as there are hardly any AI startups operating in the country at the moment . There is also a lack of training for AI talents , but research is interna tionally isolated . If , however , AI research support is successful , the country catches up in terms of software development and the state regulation measures become effective , Japan has the poten tial to become a world leader in AI in the areas of industrial production , medicine and mobility . II . ) Requirements for AI With around 118 million , Japan has comparatively many Internet users ( fourth place after China , India and the USA ) ,53 however , due to the continu ing negative demographic trend , the population is ageing and shrinking . The country ranges more in the midfield in terms of access to and qual ity of public data ( sixth among the twelve coun tries surveyed ) .54 Of the 500 strongest computers worldwide , 36 are in Japan ( third place after China and the USA ) . One of them ( ABCI ) currently ranks fifth in the top 500.55 In the strategically important semiconductor industry , four companies56 gener ated sales of around 30 billion Euro in 2017 , which represented around 17 percent of the sales of US companies.57 The 2018 budget therefore foresees investments for “ R & D in AI chips of high efficiency and speed through industry-government-science cooperation ” at an amount of 77 million Euro . In turn , investments of 17 million Euro are planned for research into quantum computers and chips , and around 15 million Euro for the establishment of an “ open platform for nanotechnology and materials research ” .58 The talent pool for AI is valued at 210 Master stu dents who graduate annually at computer science institutes , and rather small compared to South Korea.59 III . ) Institutional framework Shinzō Abe and his party have a comfortable majority in both houses of parliament with regard to implementation of Society 5.0 . The strategies of most ministries include references to AI , such as the Integrated Innovation Strategy and the Japan Revitalization Roadmap .60 The framework conditions for research and devel opment of innovations as well as the allocation of budget and personnel are set by the “ Council for Science and Technology and Innovation ” ( CSTI ) . The CSTI is chaired by the Prime Minister and the individual sector ministries follow the guidelines of the CSTI.61 Already in April 2016 , the “ Strate gic Council for AI Technology ” was founded on the instructions of Shinzō Abe , which presented an AI strategy in March 2017 . The Council con siders itself a “ control tower ” 62 that coordinates the efforts of various ministries . The coordinated ministries are : 1 ) Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications , 2 ) Ministry of Education , Cul ture , Sport , Science and Technology , 3 ) Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry . Coordination includes the research centres subordinated to the ministries as well as the “ Japan Science and Tech nology Agency ” ( JST ) and the “ New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization ” ( NEDO ) .63 The CSTI also includes representatives of the Ministries of Health and Labour , Land , Infra structure , Transport and Tourism , as well as Agri culture and Fisheries , which have large amounts of data at their disposal,64 as well as representa tives of universities and the industry association Keidanren . The Ministry of Defence has so far only played a minor role . 18Japan In addition to promoting R & D , the Council coordi nates with the industries that use AI ( exit indus tries ) and promotes the social fields of application for AI within an industry coordination body . The AI strategy also calls for an ambitious industrial strategy ( Industrialization Roadmap ) , which com bines the “ wisdom of industry , science and gov ernment ” to arrive at “ consistent approaches ” in terms of research , commercialisation and social implementation of AI.65 Numerous proposals and initiatives for ethical AI with positive basic tenor : Already in May 2016 , the Advisory Council for AI and Human Society was established on the initia tive of the CSTI . It consists of twelve members from the fields of engineering , philosophy , law , economics and social sciences . Its report of March 2017 takes a critical look at ethical , legal , social and economic considerations , as well as the influence of AI on education and research , but comes to the conclusion that the positive aspects clearly predomi nate . New forms of interaction between man and machine are an opportunity to rethink the concept of humanity.66 The Council also proposes that an Institutional Review Board ( IRB ) on AI be established at all universities.67 International rules and standards for AI were adopted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications ( MIC ) in 2016 at the G7 meeting of ICT ministers.68 In addition , the Japan Society for Artificial Intelligence has developed principles for ethical AI.69 The lack of diversity ( gender , age , origin , language ) within the research and development teams in Japan could become a problem for devel opment of neutral ( unbiased ) algorithms.at the University of Tokyo as the only Japanese university AI institute in the country.70 Since 2016 , 30 faculty members have been actively research ing in AI areas at this institute71 and supervising approximately 90 doctoral candidates in this field every year . The three non-university AI research centres AIST , RIKEN and NICT are “ integrated administra tive institutes ” subordinated to various ministries . They employ numerous researchers , but do not offer any training or educational courses . Moreo ver , there are more than 70 robotics laborato ries nationwide,72 some of which also deal with AI applications.73 Elderly gentlemen dominate the management of these research labs , which in turn hardly cooperate with each other . Moreo ver , the higher education system is underfunded and becomes less and less efficient.74 In 2017 , researchers in various fields have been able to issue 2.800 citable AI publications ( fourth place among the twelve countries surveyed ) . However , their overall influence was rather small ( sixth place out of twelve ) .75 Only publications on Com puter Vision and Pattern Recognition ( fourth place worldwide ) and Human-Computer Interaction ( fifth place worldwide ) had a noteworthy world wide influence.76 In order to implement Society 5.0 , Prime Minister Abe ’ s government intends to increase total R & D spending to one percent of GDP,77 to fund three research centres for concrete AI applications in four areas of activity , train AI talents , increase per meability between business and science and over come the international isolation of the research sector . Research areas and instruments In the centre of state funding of AI research are three research centers,78 that work interdisci plinary and collaborate with each other . These research centres are also planned to be used as “ research hubs ” for “ open innovation ” created by cooperation between industry , government and science ( by other universities ) .79 According to the Industrialization Road Map , there are clear plan ning guidelines for roles , timelines and expected results of these centers.80 They will focus on IV . ) Research and Development In absolute figures , total R & D spending in 2016 amounted to around 140 billion Euro ( third place among the twelve countries surveyed ) . The pub lic sector contributed only around 22 percent of this sum , the lowest of all the countries surveyed . CSRankings rates the Computer Science Institute 19Japan research in four strategic application fields ( pro ductivity , mobility , health , safety ) . This involves approaches that must be consistently pursued from fundamental research through to social implementation . On the other hand , there are approaches for which a short-term monetarisa tion and thus a commitment of the private sec tor is not expected , or approaches in cooperative areas , such as international standardisation and common infrastructure technology.81 From 2020 , the results of the individual centres are to be com bined in cooperation with companies and minis tries to form “ integrated systems ” . The Artificial Intelligence Research Center ( AIRC ) at the AIST Institute considers itself a “ central contact point for the promotion of large-scale research ” 82 and has at its disposal 123 million Euro ( 2016 ) , the largest budget among the three centres men tioned above . This is expected to almost dou ble in 2019 to around 212 million Euro.83 On the basis of Deep learning and neural networks twelve teams are performing research on the interaction of AI and IoT , among others , as well as pattern and image recognition ( for medicine or security ) . According to AIST information , the world ’ s largest open AI computing infrastructure ( ABCI ) is avail able to AIST.84 AIST also maintains a joint AI labora tory with NEC and partnerships with foreign insti tutes such as the DFKI in Germany . The Center for AI Development ( AIP ) is part of the RIKEN Institute for Physics and Chemistry gov erned by the Ministry of Education ( MEXT ) . More than 50 teams do research on fundamentals , “ goal-oriented technology research ” and “ AI in society ” .85 The AIP will have an important role to play , especially in the development of AI-support ing “ all-purpose infrastructure technology ” for the purpose of “ revolutionising industrial production ” , for medical diagnostics and damage limitation in the event of natural disasters.86 In 2016 , around 56 million Euro were available for these areas.87 The AIP cooperates with NEC , Toshiba , Fujitsu and Fujifilm through separate , respective AI centres . Also under the authority of the Ministry of Educa tion ( MEXT ) is the Japan Science and Technology Agency ( JST ) , which in turn runs programmes for the promotion of “ strategic fundamental research ” related to AI . A laboratory for interlinking of vari ous AI projects both of the research institutes and the universities ( AIP Network Lab , PRISM ) 88 is a par ticularly noteworthy project in this context . The National Institute of Information and Commu nication Technology ( NICT ) reports to the Ministry of the Internal Affairs and Communications ( MIC ) and was endowed with around 17 million Euro in 2016 . On the one hand , research is being car ried out there on the development of “ universal communication technology ” .89 On the other hand , CiNet is also located there and engages in applica tions of nerosciences in computer science , inter faces between brain and machine , and robotics for medical applications , which “ helps us under stand how humans and robots can best coexist in future. ” 90 Counteracting the lack of AI talents is one of the most urgent challenges because by 2020 the METI Ministry of Economics expects a shortfall of about 48,000 people in “ leading IT human resources ” .91 These are divided into three groups : those that 1 ) solve basic AI problems ( especially in the fields of information technology , robotics , Natural Lan guage Recognition , neurosciences ) , 2 ) translate AI fundamentals ( e. g. in algorithms , database archi tectures and programs ) , 3 ) are able to apply and use AI practically in industries and services.92 The first two groups are to be expanded through attractive salaries , favourable research condi tions and contents for domestic and foreign researchers . Young AI researchers , in particular , are intended to benefit from this and to access funds , for example through JST programmes.93 The third group needs AI further training and overall improved training and education in mathematics and IT subjects . The exact needs and strategies for this are to be clarified in a discourse between industry and science under the auspices of the METI Ministry of Economics.94 To date , the degree of cooperation between uni versities and industry has been rather low ( sixth place among the twelve countries surveyed ) .95 An important instrument to improve this is the cross appointment system,96 which allows research - 20ers from universities to also work part-time at national research institutes or in the private sec tor . In return , researchers from the private sec tor are allowed to work part-time at universities . New subsidy mechanisms are also intended to benefit universities that implement “ manage ment reforms ” and seek funding from the private sector . At the same time , companies are to be encouraged to invest more in long-term research projects at and in cooperation with universities97 and establish so-called Moonshot initiatives .98 Moreover , in 2016 , the Ministry of Economics ( METI ) stated that Japan was isolated from the global flow of researchers and research funds.99 Therefore , the immigration requirements for highly qualified foreigners and the underly ing points system were revised and updated in 2017.100 Now , researchers are permitted to take on multiple employment , obtain permanent stay permits much faster , initiate family reunion and obtain work permits for their partners . In the field of AI , research partnerships have also been agreed , for example with Israel101 and Germany102 V. ) Commercialisation In addition to cooperation with the aforemen tioned centres , many of the globally operating corporations ( Toshiba , NEC , Hitachi , Sony , Mit subishi Electrics , Fujitsu , Canon , etc . ) conduct their own application-oriented research programmes on AI.103 According to government information , the private sector invests around 4.5 billion Euro in technology per year.104 On average , between 2015 and 2017 , 5.17 percent of internationally enforce able patents came from Japan,105 which puts the country in second place in the world . Despite this ranking , the gap to the USA , who are at first place , is still enormous , since around three quarters of the mentionend AI patents in the same period came from the USA . Although Japanese companies continue to be leading in the production and export of robots , this position is threatened because manufacturers have invested too little in software development.106 The concept of open innovation has not yet been sufficiently adopted by the corporations.107 At the same time , only few impulses are generated by the domestic innovation ecosystem . Asgard and Roland Berger only count 113 AI startups ( USA : 1,393 , China : 383 ) ,108 of which CB Insights consid ers at least two to be among the most influential AI startups in the world , i. e. “ Preferred Networks ” and “ LeapMind ” .109 Similar to South Korean con glomerates , Japanese corporations buy innovation abroad , such as Toyota in Silicon Valley . The Abe government supports AI commercialisa tion alongside its commitment to global indus try standards for industrial robots under the New Robot Strategy ,110 through adjustments in copy right law , an EU-compatible data protection law , accelerated or suspended approval procedures , startup support and tax relief for modern IT pro curement . Regulation : From January 2019111 an already resolved extension of copyright law will apply , which through three new articles permits the use and further processing ( text and data min ing ) of protected contents by commercial and non-commercial AIs even without the consent of the authors ( fair-use principle ) .112 Access to large amounts of data is important to improve the selflearning capabilities of machines . A similar regula tion is currently initiated in Singapore and Can ada . The legal framework is also to be extended for copyright of products created by AI ( e. g. texts , music ) .113 In May 2017 , the Act on the Protection of Personal Information was also revised in order to promote the collection and sharing of data while at the same time decoupling them from personal data and processing them anonymously . The revised version has many similarities with the EU GDPR . Against this background , the EU has put Japan on a “ white list ” of countries with data protection standards comparable to the high standards of the EU.114 This promotes global integration of the country , as Japan , unlike China , allows its AI prod ucts to be exported to the EU . A law adopted in June 2018 allows companies to develop innovative pilot projects within previously Japan 21approved and clearly defined boundaries ( sand boxes ) . Within these deregulated test environ ments , companies can try out new technologies and business models and generate data . If the pilots are successful , the government can extend the same ( de- ) regulation to the entire country . For this purpose , an office was specifically estab lished to coordinate the application process.115 The establishment of geographically defined National Strategic Special Zones is aiming in a similar direc tion.116 At ten locations in the country tax relief is granted for new companies settling there and regulations are relaxed or repealed – for exam ple in the field of mobility or medical research – in order to strengthen regions outside Tokyo and develop interesting “ test cases ” for the country . In 2016 , for example , the city of Senbocu created such a test case for driverless buses.117 In terms of regulation of autonomous driving ( up to level 4 ) , a strategy already worked out in 2016 is currently being specified118 and the world ’ s first functional system of driverless taxis will probably be operat ing in Tokyo by the 2020 Olympic Games.119 In order to make the country the central “ hub ” for regenerative medicine , allocation of National Stra tegic Special Zones as well as the approval proce dures for medications and medical devices have been revised . As a result , Japan has the fastest approval procedures in the world.120 Support of startups and companies : The low number of AI startups is due to the generally small startup scene . Traditionally , society has a rather high risk aversity , is self-regarding and many of the existing skilled workers are absorbed by the large technology groups.121 This in combina tion with a restrictive immigration policy makes it difficult for startups that were founded despite these unfavourable conditions to find good staff . To make matters worse , startups have virtually no private startup capital and an exit by purchase is the exception ( rule : IPO ) .122 However , due to the number of founders returning from abroad and the increase in corporate venture capital123 the number of startups is rising , nevertheless . In order to promote this trend further , the gov ernment is paying into the “ 500 Startups ” fund . Furthermore , in 2018 , the Ministry of Economics approved a new incubator programme that was launched to found a total of 20 companies with a market value of more than one billion US dollars ( unicorn companies ) by 2023 . In addition , since May 2018 , the government has reduced property tax rates for small and mediumsized companies investing in “ ICT , robotics and cloud tools ” .124 Apart from that , companies of all sizes are going to receive tax relief if they procure “ advanced IT. ” 125 The state as user : In terms of procurement of advanced technology , the public sector is in the midfield compared to other countries ( together with Finland , it ranks eighth among the twelve countries surveyed ) .126 Nonetheless , the coun try strives for becoming the most advanced IT nation in the world , based on the Basic Act for the Advancement of Public and Private Sector Data Uti lization . In accordance with the aforementioned law , the entire administration is to be digitised and public and private data made available for use to the private sector . The concept of “ Society 5.0 ” , in which AI will permeate all areas of life , is superior to the law , so that this concept will cer tainly bring along further demand from the state . The results in the “ Security ” research field serve the disaster control authorities in forecasting , lim iting damage and initiating rapid reconstruction.127 There are further AI projects carried out by the military ( AI-based archive management as a pilot project for the entire administration ) 128 and the police ( image recognition , detection of financial fraud ) .129Japan 22 Japan 45 Cf .

With only about eight mil lion inhabitants , there are now more than 360 AI startups , which , after the USA , have at their dis posal the second highest density of venture capi tal worldwide . For all these developments , there has been no need for an AI strategy so far , yet such a strategy is now apparently in progress.130 Like the US and China , Israel can be viewed as a “ knight of the c ognitive era ” , since “ defensebased innovations that radiate into academic and private fields and enable a range of commer cial applications ” .131 In the absence of domestic Internet giants , research institutions and start ups are adopting a network approach with a highly international orientation , but a focus on the USA , above all . Globally operating tech com panies , such as IBM , Google , SAP and Samsung , are present with research centers and account for a large proportion of research spending . At the same time they take over local start-ups . This promotes innovation but at the same time it also Israel Startup Nation and Knight of the Cognitive Age 24Israel means that scaling and added value of applica tions and developments is generated mostly by multinational companies and hardly by local companies . II . ) Requirements for AI The country has comparatively few Internet users ( around 6.8 million , only Finland and Singapore have fewer ) .132 In terms of access to and quality of public data , Israel only ranked 28th in the world in 2016 and is roughly on a par with India in the countries surveyed.133 So far , none of the commercially available Top 500 supercomputers are in operation in Israel,134 which could prove to be a strategic disadvantage in the further development of AI in the country and in comparison with other major AI players , as a sen ior NVIDIA employee warns.135 At the computer science institutes in which AI research has been actively performed since 2016 , about 560 Master ’ s students graduate annually . This is a compara tively large pool of talent ( ranked fourth after the USA , China and Great Britain ) and impressive con sidering Israel ’ s small population.136 III . ) Institutional framework Although Prime Minister Netanyahu speaks on AI in public and envisages economic opportuni ties in the fields of medicine , cyber security and mobility,137 his office refers to the Israel Innova tion Authority ( IIA ) as the competent authority ( November 2017 ) .138 So far there are no signs of a coherent interdepartmental AI policy , which might change with the development of an AI strategy . As successor to the Office of the Chief Scientist , which had existed since 1969 , the Israel Innova tion Authority ( IIA ) , which reports to the Ministry of Economics and Industry , was established in 2016139 and was granted funds of around 380 mil lion Euro.140 It is expected create and strengthen the necessary infrastructure and the required framework conditions to support innovation and technology development . Moreover , the authority monitors all state-funded industrial R & D . In addi tion to the IIA , the Ministry of Science , Technology and Space , the Planning and Budget Committee of the Council on Higher Education and the Ministry of Finance are involved in the formulation and/or implementation of guidelines for innovation and technology industries . The Prime Minister ’ s office manages the relevant sector ministries for auton omous driving and digital health programmes141 and the Ministry of Defense develops and pro cures AI technology for the military . There is also a digitisation strategy in place , referred to as Digital National Initiative that the Ministry of Social Equal ity presented , but which is not mentioned in AI . IV . ) Research and Development The country has the highest density of research ers ( 8,250/one million inhabitants ) 142 and the highest research expenditure in relation to its GDP among all the countries surveyed ( currently more than four percent ) .143 Total expenditure on research and development has more than dou bled in the last ten years.144 In absolute figures , however , they amounted to only around 12 bil lion Euro in 2016 ( eighth place among the twelve countries surveyed ) , with the share of the public sector in these expenditures declining.145 More than 65 percent146 of research spending origi nated from foreign private donors in the form of research centres , mainly US companies such as Intel , Google or Qualcomm . Roland Berger esti mates for 2016 that “ almost every major IT com pany in the world ” will operate research centres in the country , including Deutsche Telekom and SAP.147 The total number of research centres is estimated at about 300.148 This is a blessing in dis guise , as it promotes research in the country and creates jobs in R & D , on the one hand , but at the same time absorbs many AI talents whose devel opments are primarily scaled and translated into value by US companies.149 Research areas and instruments In the absence of an AI strategy , there is no dedicated AI research funding , either . Due to the dominance of foreign research institutes , the commercial application research predominates . 25Israel At public universities , research is carried out into AI fundamentals and applications , which the state only supports with investments in framework conditions . A single governmental ( Israeli-French ) science program supports research on the appli cation of AI for “ digital agriculture ” on a small scale.150 Although research on AI has been going on since the 1980s and Israeli researchers have already won the prestigious Turing Award,151 five times ( of 62 ) , they produced a total of only 225 citable AI publications , whose worldwide influence also remained rather small ( H index 132 , ranking them seventh among the twelve countries surveyed ) .152 This is due on the one hand to the fact that the number of scientific publications is generally decreasing , and on the other hand to the fact that many computer science publications are only presented at conferences and are therefore not effective for the H-Index.153 At the same time , the research universities are very focused on the application and commercialisation of their results . CSRankings currently identifies six information technology institutes,154 in which about 80 faculty members have been actively researching AI since 2016 . It is estimated that they supervise 240 doc toral candidates per year . The Israeli Association for Artificial Intelligence , on the other hand , lists eleven public AI institutes as well as a number of industrial researchers , AI laboratories and compa nies in an overview.155 What they have in common is good international networking with universities and companies doing research in AI.156 The Hebrew University stands out from this research landscape , researching at various insti tutes with a total of around 40 doctoral stu dents and thus having the largest number of AI researchers.157 Interdisciplinary centres conduct research there on algorithm designs and together with Intel and the Technion University on Machine learning and new computer architectures . The Fac ulty of Computer Science also conducts research in the following fields of application Cyber secu rity158 and cooperates with the Fraunhofer Insti tute , among others . The second largest number of AI researchers ( about 30 doctoral candidates159 and at least 15 professors ) work on AI at faculties of the Technion University ; 160 the Faculty of Com puter Science is active among other things , in basic research on Deep Learning ( theory of neural networks ) .161 In October 2018 , an AI centre was also opened together with Intel , which intends to do research on Natural Language Processing , Deep Learning and hardware optimisation for learning algorithms.162 A total of about 22 doctoral stu dents163 research at the Tel Aviv University including on Machine learning ( in cooperation with Yandex ) and Optical Signal Processing and image recogni tion . For the “ Smart Cities ” application field , coop eration with Stanford University is maintained . Within the multiannual funding framework of the Council for Higher Education ( 2017 and 2021 ) , around 480 million Euro will be used to support the development of a “ national research infra structure ” in which the areas of IT and big data infrastructure are just as important as the train ing of specialist personnel in various fields . These areas include life sciences ( personalised medi cine ) , quantum physics , chemistry ( materials ) , social sciences and humanities . Around 170 mil lion Euro will also be used to support research and the number of students and faculty members in precisely those areas that “ the market needs ” , i. e. electronics and software engineering , infor mation technology and IT.164 V. ) Commercialisation Since the 1990s , Israel has developed into a hightech and innovation location and has become the brand of the “ Startup Nation ” . Asgard and Roland Berger have counted an impressive number of 362 AI startups ( third place among the twelve countries surveyed ) , of which CB Insights consid ers four ( OrCam Technologies , Workey , Twiggle and Prospera ) to be among the 100 most influ ential startups worldwide . The Israel ’ s State of AI report counts 950 startups that use or develop AI and estimates that by 2018 they will have cumula tively raised around 3.8 billion Euro through Market Exits .165 CB Insights assumes that four percent of all private equity deals concluded worldwide in 2016 took place in the field of AI in Israel ( third place after the USA and Great Britain ) .166 26In addition to the investment activities of ven ture capital funds and the establishment of R & D centres in Israel by foreign groups on the basis of incentives and tax relief , the current good position in AI commercialisation is primarily attributable to the following further points : 1 ) Influs of scien tific and technical talents from the former Soviet Union , 2 ) successful technology transfer from sci ence and the military to the private sector . In the global AI race , however , the country is coming under increasing pressure , to which the govern ment is responding with new initiatives . The lack of well-trained personnel “ is the main obstacle to Israel ’ s growth and competitiveness , ” states the IIA , estimating the shortage of engi neers and programmers for the next decade at up to 10,000.167 In the past , the the innovation and technology sectors mainly benefited from aca demics and state industry workers moving into the private sector , and the arrival of tens of thou sands of Jewish engineers from the former Soviet Union . Both sources of young talent have dried up in the meantime.168 In addition , the share of science graduates in the total number of gradu ates fell from 13 percent in 2004 to 8.7 percent in 2014.169 Enforced by the increasing global com petition , all this has led to a shortage of AI talent whose supply in Israel can hardly keep up with demand in the country.170 On the one hand , the country ’ s scientific institutions are responding to this by expanding the range of courses they offer in AI.171 On the other hand , the Center for Absorption in Science under the Ministry of Return and Immigration ( Alija ) continues its incentive and support programmes for support of Jewish “ returning ” specialists and scientists from all over the world as well as companies that integrate them . Besides , the Innovation Authority intends to promote extracurricular training programmes relevant to the high-tech industry ( “ Coding Bootcamps ” ) .172of innovation and technology since the 1970s . A highly effective system has evolved to identify top talent and involve them in sophisticated high-tech training programmes equipped with the most advanced technology platforms and extensive resources ( especially data ) .173 The research and development car ried out there serves as a de facto training center and incubator for AI talents.174 When reserve forces are deployed , others return with extensive AI or digital experience and act as mentors : a reinforcement system for knowledge transfer in both directions . Many of the country ’ s leading high-tech startups were therefore founded by partners who had met during their time in the army.175 However , the number of recruits is currently falling for demographic reasons . Technology transfer from universities to the private sector : Together with the USA , Israel is the world leader in cooperation between indus try and universities.176 An important reason for this are commercialisation companies ( technology transfer companies – TTC ) , which were founded as subsidiaries of universities , colleges or hospitals . The role of these companies is to seek , develop and market the know-how accumulated in their institutions , to transform a patent into a com mercial product and to help set up startups.177 For example , the well-known AI startup Mobileye , which was taken over by Intel for around 13 bil lion euros , was a spin-off of the TTC of Technion University . The technology transfer process follows some basic principles : ( a ) Researchers are obliged to report an invention to the TTC of their univer sity . If the TTC gives a positive assessment of the invention ’ s commercial potential , it can apply for a patent and develop a marketing strategy for the invention in order to identify potential trading partners ( or licensees ) who might be interested in the invention . It negotiates licence agreements with them under which commercial partners can further develop , exploit or market the inven tion . The revenues from royalties payments and/ or royalties from licensees are shared between Israel The military as innovation driver In spite of all the above , the most important talent factory for the high-tech industry is prob ably the military , which every citizen must join and which has been an important driver 27the inventors and the research univer sity.178 Among the renowned university TTCs are the Yeda Research and Development Company Limited ofthe Weizmann Institute of Science and the Yissum Research Development Company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem . This model puts Israel in fourth place ( among the twelve countries sur veyed ) in terms of the number of AI patents regis tered in the country and internationally enforce able . However , UNESCO estimates that since 2002 almost 80 percent of all applications to the Israeli Patent Office have been filed by foreigners , in par ticular through the research centres of US com panies . Intellectual property therefore primarily migrates abroad.179 Promotion of startups and companies : The Inno vation Authority is the largest public investor in AI startups with its programmes for innovative tech nology concepts ( see text box ) .180 The IIA can act largely independently and operates flexible instru ments ( loan programmes , guarantees , funds and financial instruments ) .taken over if the company invests in the country ’ s periphery . The number of foreign research cen tres is also to be further increased , particularly in the fields of biotechnology and medicine.183 Private investors , who are invest in R & D startups can also deduct investments of up to 1.2 million Euro per startup as current expenses from the tax , thanks to the so-called Angels Law.184 With regard to autonomous driving , the Ministry of Transport and the Prime Minister ’ s Office jointly launched a five-year programme in early 2017 for which some 60 million Euro will be made avail able . The aim is to further develop Israeli industry in this field . Transport technology companies can receive financial support under the programme of up to 50 per cent of their approved R & D costs . 75 percent of the funds will be allocated to a programme which could have an exceptional impact on the rationalisation and improvement of transport . The supported company pays back the money received from the innovation authority through royalties on the sale , but only if it reaches the commercial phase . So far there is no regula tion on autonomous driving in the country , but some test tracks for autonomous d riving on mil itary premises and abandoned roads have been authorised.185 Some 240 million Euros will be invested in the digitisation of all patient files , in a database open to companies and researchers ( with SAP SE ) and in support for researchers and startups , with the aim of developing preventive and personalised medicine . The government sees this as an impor tant growth engine.186 Regulation of the high-tech sector : So far , it has been more the environment in which commercial AI products can be created that has been regu lated . In order to remain attractive for high-tech companies , at the end of 2016 , the corporate income tax for these companies was reduced from 25 percent to six to twelve percent , depend ing on the type of company . This change also introduces additional tax benefits for dividends and investment income . In August 2017 , a law was also passed on the completion of high-tech mergers and acquisitions , aimed at facilitating Support instruments of the IIA „ Startup Division “ 181 Tnufa Incentive : Support for the development of “ innovative ” technology concepts ( up to 85 percent of the costs , maximum around 50,000 Euro over two years ) Incubator Incentive : Up to 85 percent ( maxi mum around 800,000 Euro ) of the costs for research and development of “ innovative technology concepts ” by IIA as an incentive also for private incubators to provide the remaining 15 percent plus premises , legal assistance and partner inventions.Israel IIA ’ s Growth Division also subsidises the research spending of larger domestic and foreign com panies by 20 to 50 percent for cases where new products are developed or existing technologies are upgraded . Long-term R & D projects of local large companies ( more than 86 million Euro turn over and more than 200 employees in R & D ) can be funded by half.182 A further ten percent will be 28 “ necessary structural adjustments ” .187 A scheme that reduces capital gains tax for domestic compa nies by four to six percentage points when “ new intellectual property is generated , or acquired from a foreign company ” 188 can be understood as an instrument for keeping intellectual property in the country . The state as user : In addition to its role in the training of talent and knowledge transfer , the military itself is an active developer and user of AI , which the military considers to be a “ key to survival in the modern world. ” 189 Thus , the Israeli Armed Forces ( IDF ) use AI in autonomous drones190 and the new version of the standard Merkava IV tank . In the area of cyber security , the military carries out its own developments , but also buys from domestic startups , which in turn func tions as a pull factor for startups.191 Through the digital medicine program Big data and AI based on that can also be used in public hospitals.192Ethics – the discussion is still in its infancy : Although Jewish intellectuals have a critical attitude towards AI ( e. g. Prof. Yuval Noah Harari ) ,193 this has not yet translated into institutions or guidelines on ethical AI . After a scandal over the collection of patient data for an AI application , the Knesset has been dealing with data protection regulation in the health sector since the end of 2017 . Uri Maklev , chairman of the Science and Technol ogy Committee of the Knesset , said he would further the efforts : “ We see the latest tech nological developments and are enthusias tic advocates of the further development of AI . The use of the technology is a question of human life , and concerns can be dealt with by appropriate regulations and laws. ” 194 An IEEE report of 2017 , however , sees a number of institutions that could deal with ethical AI , and names the Initiative AI Ethics Open Source , which is intended to serve as an umbrella for a discussion on this topic in Israel and to develop guidelines.195Israel 29130 Globes , 2018b . 131 Groth/Nitzberg , 2018 : 126 . 132 World Bank , 2018 ( cf .

It is “ the new wave ” on which , according to Sheikh Maktoum , all “ services , sectors and future infra structures will rely ” .199 The UAE is the first country in the Middle East to publish an AI strategy and the first country in the world to appoint a Minister of State for AI . In addition to using AI to achieve the Vision 2071 scheme and improving govern - ›AI and technology as pioneers for a diversified economy ›The first approach of an AI strategy in the region , the first AI Ministry of State worldwide ›Focus on AI applications through public sector demand and strategic focus on the healthcare sector ›Cooperation with India to develop the mutual potential of both markets for AI ›Ethical issues do not play a role in the government ’ s public deliberations I . ) Introduction The United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) , which owe the oil and high finance sector their rapid rise to the inter national stage , have learned their lessons from the growth and crisis cycles of a globally networked economy.196 Against this background , the coun try must diversify its economy and compete with technologically advanced neighbors such as Qatar and Iran . In October 2017 , the UAE published the rough structure of an AI strategy as one of the major initiatives of the UAE Centennial Plan with the goal to make theUAE “ the best country in the United Arab Emirates On the way to the user country with central support of the public sector 31United Arab Emirates ment performance the strategy is to position UAE as a leader in AI investments in a variety of sectors and to generate a new market for AI . However , the methods to achieve all these objectives have not been specified . Nevertheless , Accenture estimates an annual gross value added potential of 160 bil lion Euro by 2035 for the UAE.200 As part of the AI strategy , the government will invest in nine sec tors : transport , health , space , renewable energy , water , technology , education , environment and transport . The strategy is embedded in a num ber of other relevant national plans and strategies designed to pave the way for the UAE to become a knowledge-based economy.201 II . ) Requirements for AI The AI ambitions of the government are at odds with the country ’ s hitherto unfavorable condi tions in terms of the size of existing data pools , the computing power available within the country , and the size of the talent pool . The low popula tion of the UAE is also reflected by a relatively low number of Internet users ( 2016 : 8.4 million ) , which is lower only in Israel ( 6.8 million ) , Finland ( 4.8 million ) and Singapore ( 4.5 million ) among the countries surveyed.202 Measured by the Open Data Barometer 2016 , the UAE also have catch ing up to do in terms of access to and quality of public data ( only ahead of China among the com pared countries ) .203 Furthermore , not one of the top 500 supercomputers is currently operated in the UAE.204 Although the country has a focus on building a knowledge-based economy , there were fewer enrolled students in tertiary educa tion across the country than in the smaller Singa pore.205 According to CSRankings , there is also only one institute in the UAE that has been actively researching AI areas since 2016 . The AI talent pool is correspondingly small . That this could change in the near future is shown , among other things , by the launch of the country ’ s first AI bachelor ’ s programme at the British University Dubai in 2018.206 In addition , the country has hosted its first AI summer camps in cooperation with companies such as IBM and SAP207 and launched the One Mil lion Arab Coders initiative,208 to increase the pool of qualified professionals.III . ) Institutional framework The federal constitutional hereditary monarchy consists of seven emirates whose executive is the Cabinet . In October 2017 , the cabinet was reshaped in the course of the largest “ structural change ” in the country ’ s history and oriented towards achieving the goals of the Centennial 2071 Plan .209 As part of this reform , new minis tries were introduced and structural changes were made to existing ministries . This also implied the establishment of of the world ’ s first ministry of state for AI , which Omar Al Olama has taken over.210 This restructuring also explains the early stage at which many of the govern ment ’ s relevant strategies still are . As part of the national AI strategy , a ten-member AI council , also headed by Omar Al Olama , was established in March 2018 to monitor the integration of AIs in the government and education sector.211 The newly established government apparatus reflects the country ’ s ambitions and promises to increase its capacity to act in order to shape technological change in the country . IV . ) Research and Development In none of the countries surveyed did abso lute R & D spending in 2016 turn out to be lower than in the UAE ( 3.1 billion Euro , or around one percent of GDP ) . Of the R & D expenditures , 60 percent were financed by the private sec tor . This value is roughly comparable to France ( 55 percent ) .212 In 2017 only 108 citable docu ments on AI were published ( last place among the twelve countries examined ) 213 and their influ ence remained very limited – while the UAE had a value of 29 in the H index , the USA achieved a value of 437.214 The reason for this may be the fact that since 2016 only one university institute has actively researched AI.215 The current weak ness of research stands in contrast to the coun try ’ s ambitions , which Sheikh Maktoum describes as follows : “ We believe that science , technology and innovation are the roadmap for building future generations. ” 216 32United Arab Emirates Research areas and instruments R & D is not mentioned in the very concise UAE AI strategy so far . Nevertheless , there are various indications that the country is planning to use sci ence to advance AI in the health sector . The scientific priority areas of the new research funding strategy 2031217 aim , among other things , to ensure that all the country ’ s strategic natural resources are made available through national capacity building , promotion of the sustaina ble energy sector , improvement of water safety and development of an advanced scientific food security system . The health challenges in the UAE are to be mastered by a national science system – however , without describing it in detail . In addition , efforts are being made to develop an advanced industry , to build a system of logisti cal support based on scientific studies and data , and to create a complex of strategic industries.218 Although the research strategy does not specify AI in particular , an institution was founded in the form of the Inception Institutes for Artificial Intel ligence ( IIAI ) , which intends to be active in basic and applied research in AI areas . In the area of fundamental research , the research areas cur rently planned are the following : Deep Learning , Reinforcement Learning , Computer Vision and Natu ral Language Processing . In application-oriented research , the healthcare sector again is given pri ority , particularly with the fields of Video Under standing and Medical Imaging .219 In order to meet the Institute ’ s claim to global leadership , the IIAI aims to establish state-of-theart research conditions . This includes : 1 ) freedom in in academic research , without the pressure of scholarships and teaching , 2 ) access to data , 3 ) an advanced computing centre , 4 ) “ extremely com petitive ” incentives for researchers.220 V. ) Commercialisation The economic environment is characterised by a centralised government and a much stronger emphasis on security , protection and stability than on the privacy and freedom of the individ ual . There are neither AI startups nor significant internationally enforceable AI patents.221 Robotics and AI are recognised as important trends in the important economic sectors of the country , as the example of the Jebel Ali harbour in Dubai shows.222 However , the country does not appear in interna tional comparative statistics on the use or manu facture of robots . However , the weak starting position is countered by the ambition to become a leading AI user country . According to a survey by Accenture , half of UAE executives plan to invest in the field of AI next year , putting it second only to the Internet of Things ( 58 percent ) .223 The biggest impacts of AI are expected in the financial ser vices , healthcare , transportation and warehous ing industries.224 In order to tap the potential of technology for politics , the economy and society , the national government as well as the individual emirates have launched various strategy papers in recent months . It will have to show whether the goals set are realistic and whether the gov ernment has identified the right instruments for implementation , most of which are still lacking . However , it is emerging that AI is understood as part of a holistic plan of economic development.225 Regulations and political objectives : Since the concept was introduced in 1985 , more than 30 Special Economic Zones ( SEZs ) have been established in the UAE.226 Founded in 1999 , Dubai Internet City , one of these SEZs , is now home to technology companies such as Microsoft , Dell and IBM and is the largest information and commu nications technology hub in the Middle East and North Africa.227 It can therefore be assumed that SEZs will also play a central role in the economic exploration of AI in the UAE . The instruments with which AI commercialisation is to be achieved in the application areas mentioned remain vague . The multitude of different strategies gives an ini tial picture of a complex system of objectives with which the government will align future regula tions . The strategy to promote the fourth indus trial revolution pursues the goal of “ strengthening the UAE ’ s position as a global hub for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and increasing its contribu tion to the economy through the promotion of innovation and future technologies. ” In addition to initiatives at the national level , the local govern ments of the seven Emirates have also established 33United Arab Emirates various policies . In particular , the Emirate of Dubai has developed strategic objectives that are not only sector-specific but also technology-specific . These include autonomous traffic systems , 3D printing and data . The Dubai Autonomous Trans portation Strategy aims to automate 25 percent of transport by 2030 and to achieve an annual economic return of 4.25 billion Euro through increased transport efficiency.228 The most impor tant goal in the 3D printing strategy is to “ ensure that 25 percent of Dubai ’ s buildings are based on 3D printing technology by 2030. ” 229 The data strategy of Dubai ’ s government pursues the aim of developing and implementing a culture of data exchange and evidence-based decision-making in Dubai.230 This is particularly targeted at high qual ity data . In the field of cyber security , a separate strategy pursues five strands of action : 1 ) increase of public awareness , 2 ) cyber innovation , 3 ) cyber security , 4 ) cyber resilience , 5 ) national and inter national cooperation.231 Direct support for companies and startups : The only element explicitly promoting an ecosystem is the Centennial 2071 Plan referred to as AREA 2071 . It is understood as a “ room and ecosystem that is geared towards connecting companies , gov ernments , startups , investors , young people and the public with one another in order to shape the future together ” 232 The planning and partial imple mentation of this began already in 2017 . With out more comprehensive measures to support a startup ecosystem , the innovative strength and thus productivity of the country ’ s economy will remain limited or dependent on the purchase of innovative technologies from abroad . In this way , the country risks not living up to its ambition of becoming a leading user country . The state as user : More than in any of the other countries examined , innovation and the use of new technologies are driven by demand from the government apparatus and public procurement . This is also underlined by the results of an opin ion poll conducted by the World Economic Forum , according to which the country ’ s government is a global leader in the procurement of advanced technologies and uses this as a targeted stimu lus for innovation.233 This is impressively reflected , among other things , in the plan to have the immi gration officials at airports replaced by artificial intelligence by 2020.234 The central role of the state as a user of AI is made clear by the cornerstones of the AI strategy as well as in the strategy to promote the “ Fourth Industrial Revolution ” or the Blockchain Plan , which in turn provides for “ 50 percent of state transactions to be converted into a blockchain platform by 2021. ” 235 The third of the six pillars of the strategy to promote the Fourth Industrial Revolution lists intelligent government services and smart cities . These are used as a basis for the satisfaction and wellbeing of citizens as well as ecological sustainability and improvement of the human lifestyle.236 VAE ’ s track record in this field is mixed . Masdar City , once a model of an ecological and smart city , is still more a con struction site than reality after ten years.237 At the same time , according to McKinsey , Abu Dhabi and Dhabi are considered leaders in the region in terms of the strength of the Smart City tech nology base.238 The eGateways of the Emirate of Abu Dhabi ( www.abudhabi.ae ) already offer over 1,250 government services in 18 different areas , such as transport and real estate . In Dubai , the Smart Dubai Plan includes WiFi hotspots as well as networked technology for controlling water consumption and traffic . To develop new technol ogies for the public sector , the Emirate of Dubai has also launched an initiative called Dubai 10X in which 24 government agencies have already participated.239 Dubai 10X : 240 While the number 10 stands for Dubai ’ s claim to be ten years ahead of other world cities , the X stands for “ Thinking Out of the Box ” . The Dubai Future Foundation initiative provides for the creation of “ X units ” in each agency , equipped with sufficient resources and staff , with the aim of promoting disrup tive innovation and developing so-called Moonshoot solutions for the achievement of their goals .

Regulatory obstacles that disruptive companies encounter in such partnerships are to be removed.Despite political support , commercialisation of AI is limited by the small size of the internal mar ket . It is against this background that the signing of an agreement between the UAE and India is to be understood in order to combine “ the fastest growing market opportunity in the world , with its talent pool of human capital recognised for inno vation – and the UAE , a centre for cutting-edge technologies ” 243 From this AI partnership both sides expect economic advantages worth 17.5 bil lion Euro , which are expected to materialise in the next decade.244 However , similar to the range of strategies mentioned above , concrete contents and specific implementation instruments are not yet known from this document . 35United Arab Emirates 196 Groth , Nitzberg , 2018 : 162 . 197 UAE Cabinet . 198 Gulf Business , 2017 . 199 Elsaadani , Hakutangwi , Purdy , 2018 : 5 . 200 Ibidem . 201 UAE Government , 2018 . 202 World Bank , 2016 ( cf .

Despite the exist ing hurdles , significant technology service compa nies , such as Infosys and Tata , have already been founded in India . In view of this situation , the gov ernment aims to create a formalised pan-Indian network to foster cooperation between science and industry and strengthen the AI value chain . II . ) Requirements for AI India has over 1.3 billion inhabitants , of whom only about 390 million were connected to the Internet in 2016.248 This clearly illustrates the growth potential for the domestic data pool and ›AI for the improvement of education , health and other social areas ›Focus on establishment of institutions to catalyse synergies between science and industry ›Planned establishment of multi-actor institutions as nodes of a pan-Indian network of research ( CORE ) and commercialisation ( ICTAI ) ›So far hardly any directives to implement the AI strategy , no prioritisation of areas of basic research I . ) Introduction On February 18 , 2018 , Indian Prime Minister Nar endra Modi opened the Wadhwani Institute for Artificial Intelligence at Mumbai University and expressed optimism about the role of AI in solving social problems.245 As the largest democracy in the world , the Indian AI strategy concentrates on the areas of poverty reduction , education , health and universal speech , embedded both in the larger industrial policy Make in India246 and the broader Digital India Strategy247 . Until now , the country has not been able to fully exploit its considerable potential in AI , for example , its large pool of quali fied talents . Microsoft and Google are currently managed by Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai , India AI for everyone 37India the internal market for AI applications . At the same time , an estimated 480 Master ’ s students graduate from computer science institutes with a focus on AI each year , compared with over 7,000 in the USA and nearly 2.000 in China ( Germany approx . 410 ) .249 There is also a need to catch up in the availability of machine-readable and openly accessible data : According to the Open Data Barometer , in 2016 the country only ranked elev enth ahead of China and the UAE.250 As these areas improve , large data sets with large sample sizes will accelerate the potential for AI in India . But also the low data processing capacity is remarka ble : India only operates five of the 500 best super computers in the world , which is far from China ’ s 206 and the 124 of the USA.251 In semiconductor production , the country is a global player and also dependent on foreign computing power . III . ) Institutional framework So far , the goals of social progress through AI have been embedded in other government poli cies and schemes . However , these for their part hardly refer to AI . Institutions that can substantiate synergies between science and industry are the focus of India ’ s National Strategy for AI : # AIforALL which was published in June 2018 by the Policy Think Tank of the government ( NITI Aayog ) .252 Although the actual budget expenditure for their projects is unknown , # AIforALL is expected to be imple mented promptly . It has strong political appeal in New Delhi , since it was supported by high-rank ing government officials at the federal level – an important sign in the federal Indian state system . The comprehensive strategy is strongly influenced by the federal government structure . Every state in India has strong government and the central government often lacks mechanisms to imple ment certain policies at the local level . Although laws can only be passed by the Indian Parliament , the executive and regulatory authorities have a wide margin of discretion when it comes to imple mentation . The national AI strategy needs to be implemented in coordination with the Ministry of Industry and Technology and the Indian Regula tory Authority for Telecommunications . However , it must be noted that in 2019 general elections will be held in India in a polarised political climate that could influence the priorities of the government apparatus . The Digital India programme mentioned above has been allocated almost 420 million Euro by the central government in the latest budget.253 How ever , it concentrates mainly on the development of the telecommunications infrastructure and does not yet have a programmatic approach for the targeted introduction of AI . The Make in India programme , which is primarily aimed at industrial policy and export promotion , does not make any substantial mention of AI , either.254 Leading Indian universities and industrial com panies have each organised several conferences to discuss the potential of AI for India . However , these events took place independently of each other . For example , an influential business con sortium , the Confederation of Indian Industry , will host the Indian Innovation Summit : India AI in July 2018 . The over 70 speakers at the summit , how ever , were almost exclusively business and gov ernment representatives . No representative from civil society gave a speech and only two academics from the field of science made it onto the agenda : the director of the Indian National Centre for the Arts and a Brazilian professor from the University of São Paulo.255 IV . ) Research and Development In 2015 , India spent around eleven billion Euro on R & D , equivalent to 0.6 percent of GDP . India is thus investing the lowest percentage of all the countries compared here.256 This translates into the lowest number of researchers per mil lion inhabitants ( 156 ) .257 As a result , Indian AI research performance was weak across all indi cators . According to CSRankings , between 2016 and 2018 , there were about 70 professors at 15 institutes who did active research on AI and an estimated 200 doctoral students.258 In terms of citable publications in AI areas the high quantity 38India is striking , but this is not in line with their qual ity . India , for example , only lags behind China ( 6,214 ) and the USA ( 4,673 ) in the broad field of IT applications and in the AI-focused areas of computer vision and pattern recognition in terms of the number of citable documents ( 2,223 ) .259 Measured in terms of the H index , however , in a quality comparison it only ranks tenth among the twelve countries surveyed ( ahead of Finland , but behind South Korea ) .260 This is due to rigidities in the academic system and the process of award ing research grants in India , which is strongly administrative and slow , creating incentives for less risky but less effective research . Research areas and instruments The AI strategy aims at the creation of two types of networks : on the one hand research excellence centres for AI ( COREs ) , on the other hand inter national centres for transformative AI ( ICTAIs ) . The COREs will be located at technical universities and will focus on the promotion and financing of AI fundamental research . In contrast to that , the ICTAIs will closely cooperate with the industry to use research to create commercial applications . Using a cloud-based pool of robust data , which COREs and ICTAIs will contribute to and draw on , these centres will form a network whose scal ing effects will increase over time . These clusters of research and industry would enable scalable knowledge transfer systems and generate the necessary dynamics to create a basis for the start of a domestic AI industry . According to the Indian national AI strategy of 2018 , COREs and ICTAIs are towork together under the umbrella of the Centre for Studies on Technological Sustainability ( CSTS ) , which is to ensure that science and industry move in paral lel . To bring all major universities together in one “ Hub-and-spoke ” model , India would ideally need about two dozen COREs , each of which would cost about eight million Euro over a period of five years . The costs of ICTAIs are estimated at 40 million Euro over the same period , which may , however , be partly borne by contributions from the private sector , which the strategy considers to be optimistic.The main channel for the improvement of AI research is the strengthening and equipping of researchers . The strategy recognizes that in the rapidly changing field of AI , university research must work according to a fast-failure model . The aim is to enable researchers to leave a failed pro ject early and smoothly , to take risks and cross borders . As mentioned earlier , there is a lack of powerful or high-quality AI researchers based in India and the thematic focus areas of AI research are still unclear . To address the low availability of rich data , it is recommended to use a cloud-based pool of robust data that COREs and ICTAIs can use , but also contribute to . In this way , the cen tres generate mutual benefits and form a network with increasing scale gains that maximise the potential for generating high-quality data . # AIforALL – Indian proposals for ethical AI : For Prime Minister Modi and his government the provision of a social security network for the poor population of India enjoys high politi cal priority . Many programmes are subject to the “ Sabke saath , sabke vikas ” framework scheme , which translates as “ self-determina tion for all parts of society ” . Thus , the Indian AI strategy also focuses on directing AI in areas relevant to social progress . These include edu cation and health care , hygiene and the fight against corruption . India , as a voting member of the G77 coalition , has also spoken out on these issues in international fora . In addition , the strategy aims for incentives to keep Indian AI researchers in the country . A national AI scholarship programme is currently under consideration , to attract the numerous doctoral students who work abroad and main tain connections to India.261 However , these parts of the proposal are described only briefly and remain unclear as to their actual implementa tion . Many of the details of India ’ s AI strategy also remain to be determined by India ’ s political process , which can often be opaque . An example of unclear recommendations are the potential research areas for COREs . These are supposed to concentrate on areas with high potential in 39India AI fundamental research . However , the strategy lists virtually all components of AI research with out prioritising them : “ Possible AI focus areas for COREs could be : a ) Sensory AI ( Computer Vision , IoT , among others ) , b ) physical AI ( robotics , industrial automation , among others ) , c ) cognitive AI ( Natu ral Language Processing , further education ) , d ) gen eral AI , e ) high-precision learning based on small data sets , f ) research on new algorithms ( such as advances in cryptography , security ) , data sets , and g ) explainable AI . A CORE can decide to work on one or more [ sic ! ] of the focus areas. ” 262 India would be able to formulate a stronger AI strategy if it oriented the list of possible areas towards contextual realities . For example , natu ral language processing in local Indian languages would require collaboration with interest groups at subnational level , as Indian citizens speak dif ferent mother tongues in over 20 regions of the country . This already gives India a comparative advantage in the creation of cognitive AI adapted to local contexts , which would be difficult for a researcher in the USA or China to replicate . V. ) Commercialisation At the heart of AI commercialisation are the ICTAIs . These are intended to act as industrial accelerators to catalyse the creation of successful companies and apply basic research . The motiva tion for commercialisation of AI is the solution of social problems , as formulated by Prime Minister Modi . The ICTAIs focus on the following five areas : healthcare , agriculture , education , smart cities and smart mobility/transport.263 In each of these areas , intensive efforts are being made to improve affordability and quality for economically weaker parts of society . This is unique as almost all other countries focus their AI strategy more on eco nomic growth than on the prosperity and emanci pation of broad sections of the population . Since the economic liberalisation reforms of 1991 , India has seen development of an influential and skilful private sector that largely follows market forces rather than government dictates . This , how -ever , is facing a weak AI R & D landscape , leaving the commercialisation of AI lagging behind their potential . According to a study by Roland Berger and Asgard , there are only 82 AI startups in India ( 2017 ) , while there are almost 1,400 in the US , 106 in Germany and 35 in Singapore.264 None of the Indian startups ranges among the Top 100 of the most influential AI startups.265 This small num ber , especially compared to the overall size of the country , leads to a small proportion of AI patents that are internationally enforceable . Between 2015 and 2017 on average , only 0.4 percent of the inter national enforceable AI patents came from India , fewer only from Singapore.266 Also the number of installed industrial robots per 10,000 employees in the manufacturing industry is the lowest indica tor of the degree of automation of the economy among the countries compared here ( three com pared to 631 in South Korea or 309 in Germany ) .267 Support of startups and companies : At the moment , only little progress by Indian companies and start-ups in AI commercialisation268 is notice able and even large technology companies like Infosys and Tata Services are no exception . Also the projects announced by these companies269 currently appear little innovative , but it is still too early to judge their success or failure . Although Indian AI startups are currently overshadowed by most counterparts in the countries compared here , they have shown resilience in parts of the Indian market and still hold untapped growth potential . For example , the Sigtuple Technologies startup in Bangalore , which uses AI to read medi cal tests accurately and cost-effectively , raised five million Euro in Series A funding in 2017 and a further 16 million Euro in Series B funding in early 2018.270 In a country where there is a seri ous shortage of physicians in many regions , a startup that can help close this gap at low cost has a high potential for scalability . These startups are typically financed by smaller venture capi tal funds , such as Endiya Partners , which alone have invested 25 million Euro in startups operat ingin the fields of Big Data , Internet of Things and sensory AI.271 Although such funds do exist , most Indian AI startups do not make significant pro gress in Series A or B financing . 40In 2016 , the Ministry of Commerce and Industry launched a programme to directly support start ups ( Startup India ) . Advantages include acceler ated patent filing , tax advantages and simplified application procedures for releases and approv als.272 Startup India also has an investment fund of almost one billion Euro , however , with no mention of the share earmarked for AI startups . India has also proactively signed bilateral agree ments in connection with the commercialisation of AI , such as with the UAE in July 2018 , to gener ate over 17 billion Euro of economic value added through AI over the next ten years.273 Meanwhile , Google , Microsoft , Bosch Engineer ing and many others in India have made signifi cant investments in AI to gain access to the large potential Indian customer base.274 There is cer tainly reason to be optimistic about the future of AI startups in India , but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to manoeuvre out major investments by international competitors in the coming years . Regulation : The AI strategy itself does not directly address the issue of the regulatory reform . How ever , the necessity of combining existing data archives in order to make them machine-readable is mentioned , on the one hand . On the other hand , regulations for commercial applications of online user data and data protection are identi fied as necessary . India ’ s first national telecommu nications policy was established in 1994 , shortly after economic liberalisation.275 The latest update of this policy was adopted by the Indian Cabinet in September 2018 under the name National Digi tal Communications Policy ( NDCP ) . The NDCP aims to attract around 90 billion Euro in private sector investment , although it is not clear how much the NDCP focuses on AI-based technologies.276 India could benefit from the establishment of a tailormade regulatory framework for the commerciali sation of AI . Since the Special Economic Zones ( SEZ ) Act of 2005 , the Indian government has used the SEZ model to promote certain industries.277 In the future , this model could also be used to create special regulatory zones ( sand boxes ) that can be used for AI commercialisation . However , the Indian Special Economic Zones are facing the great challenge of weak relationships with the rest of the economy . At the same time there are accu sations of corruption and that they provoke tax disputes.278 Large social media companies like Facebook are preparing for negative reference in Indian political discourse for the upcoming elections , which could serve as a stress test for AI-generated filtering of online abuse and harassment.279 The state as user : The Indian AI strategy also mentions the possibility of the government as a user of AI , but without providing further details or explanations . With the strong focus on improve ment of prosperity through AI , the bureaucratic structure of the government must adapt to that in order to integrate AI , but many basic prerequi sites are not yet met . As mentioned earlier , many of the Indian government ’ s data stores have not yet been commented and some data points are not yet machine-readable . In order for the govern ment to start using AI , the first step would be to identify areas where it is possible to conduct shortterm AI tenders so that the bureaucratic structure can get used to the use of AI to rationalise differ ent processes . Until these issues are resolved , the Indian government is not well equipped to use AI on a large scale.India 41245 Government of India , 2018a . 246 Government of India , 2018b . 247 Government of India , 2018c . 248 World Bank , 2016 ( cf .

Compared to that , in China an industrial invest ment fund of 15 billion Euro represents a single AI promotion instrument.282 AI Singapore pursues an application and commercialisation approach , as the initiative is designed in particular to contrib ute to “ strengthening the bonds between industry and research to ensure that AI research meets the needs of industry ” 283 ›Promotion of fundamental research not only from a technical point of view , but also in terms of ethical and social issues ›With 100Experiments , companies can submit problems for which there is no standardized AI solution and are referred to AI developers ›Understanding of AI within the population through the AI for Everyone training programme ›The Accreditation @ SGD initiative offers customised consulting services in the areas of technical application for companies in early growth phases I . ) Introduction In recent years , Singapore ’ s government has made it clear how serious it is about promot ing AI . In 2017 , the National Research Foundation ( NRF ) , an agency reporting to the Prime Minis ter , launched the national AI Singapore initiative with the ambition of establishing a firm foothold on the global map of AI sites , and to advance the future of the country ’ s digital economy.280 With an investment of around 130 million Euro , NRF will join all Singapore research facilities and the AI ecosystem of companies and startups to cata -Singapore How to think and act like a startup 43Singapore II . ) Requirements for AI Due to the small population of the country , the number of active Internet users is the lowest among the compared countries.284 In terms of avail ability and accessibility of public data , the coun try is only half as good as the UK according to the Open Data Barometer 2016.285 This data source for data mining is correspondingly limited.286 In con trast to that the country has established itself as a strategic location for the data centres of neighbour ing countries . Consequently , half of the Southeast Asian data centres are located in Singapore.287 With an estimated number of around 525 AI Master ’ s students , the country ranks sixth among the coun tries surveyed here . In relation to the small number of inhabitants this value is remarkable.288 Further more , although only two of the top 500 supercom puters worldwide are located in Singapore , this value is also considerable in relation to the small number of inhabitants.289 The semi-conductor industry has been a strong driver of the growth of the city-state over the past year . According to the Economic Development Board , semiconductor pro ductionincreased by 48 percent in 2017,290 which does not yet make the country a global location in this sector.291 The technology-friendly conditions created by the government , especially in relation to the size of the country , are also appreciated by private sector players , who increasingly consider the country a location for innovation.292 The deep technology company DataRobot has announced , for example , that it will invest 13 million Euro in Singapore as part of its expansion plans.293 III . ) Institutional framework The government regards technical progress and the promotion of AI as crucial for the develop ment of the country:294 “ Singapore must think and act like a startup to survive as a small open citystate. ” 295 said the Minister of Communications and Information S. Iswaran . This idea is implemented through numerous initiatives : Through the Smart Nation Initiative , the govern ment aims to steer investment in and use of tech nological infrastructure to support commercialisa -tion by developing realistic and targeted solutions to urban challenges . In doing so , the initiative refers to the Digital Government Blueprint , the Digital Readiness Blueprint and the Digital Economy Framework for Action .296 The latter focuses on four frontier technologies : AI , cyber security , immer sive media ( such as Virtual reality ) and Internet of Things .297 The Smart nation initiative has the high est political priority and is supported by the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office coordinated in the Prime Minister ’ s office and supported by other government agencies.298 The interdepartmental initiative AI Singapore com pletes Singapore ’ s ambitions in the field of tech nology promotion . Participants in AI Singapore are the National Research Foundation ( leading entity ) , the Smart Nation and Digital Government Office ( SNDGO ) , the Economic Development Board , the Infocomm Media Development Authority ( IMDA ) , the state-owned company SGInnovate , which funds and promotes Deep-Tech startups , as well as the leading IT analyst in healthcare Integrated Health Information Systems .299 Through AI Singapore AI is expected to contribute to overcoming major soci etal challenges , to adapting human capital to tech nological change in the sense of AI , and prepare the adoption and use of AI by the industry . Specifi cally , the Initiative consists of the following pro grammes : Foundation Research , Grand Challenge , 100Experiments , AI Apprenticeship , AI For Industry and AI For Everyone .300 IV . ) Research and Development The good education of the population and R & D are important components of the policy to pro mote competitiveness and economic growth . With about 6,729 per million inhabitants , Singa pore has a high density of scientists , especially in comparison to the other countries examined here ( USA : 4,255 , China : 1.096 ) .301 The Government pro vides financial incentives for small and mediumsized local companies to become involved in R & D and thus support the development of innova tions.302 In total , the country spent 5.9 billion Euro on R & D in 2016 , which corresponds to about 2.1 per cent of GDP ( GDP share comparable to 44Singapore France , about half the size of Israel ) .303 Around 53 percent of investment comes from the private sector , while in China and Japan almost 80 per cent of R & D investment comes from the private sector . This conveys the impression that the research impulses in Singapore are set by the state in particular , which basically contradicts the project of developing application-related innova tion . The majority of AI research is also financed by government agencies : NRF , Ministry of Edu cation , A * Star Science and Engineering Research Council .304 It is estimated that 225 doctoral stu dents graduate annually in AI areas , outperform ing competing countries due to Singapore ’ s small population.305 Scientific publications still have little influence beyond the borders of Singapore . Meas ured by the H index , which is 125 for the AI sector in Singapore , it is far behind countries such as the US ( 437 ) or Germany ( 186 ) .306 Research areas and instruments In order to address existing deficits in national AI research , various programmes were initiated – both to improve the coverage of the needs of industry and research and to promote young scientists . In the past , the focus of AI research in Singapore was on applications in health care and robotics , while the research directions concen trated on graphic models , neural networks and Fuzzy systems . In recent years , the main areas of research have largely been adjusted to the strate gies of Smart Nation and AI Singapore .307 Through the recently formed Singapore Data Sci ence Consortium , NRF , universities and the Agency for Science , Technology and Research are seek ing research partnerships between institutions of higher education , research institutes and The industry in order to make technologies usable for practice-oriented challenges.308 In the course of receiving a research grant of 2.8 million Euro from the NRF and the IMDA , Singapore Management University established a five-year AI research programme , with par ticular attention being paid to three research areas : AI and society , AI and industry as well as AI and commercialisation . Critical and interdis ciplinary perspectives will help to build bridges between academia , industry and government.309 These research priorities are also considered by research institutions in other countries , but with a funding amount of 2.8 million Euro the Singapore Management University can not keep up financially with the research budgets of institutes of other nations . For example , the Academy of Finland made available 13 million Euro for research in the field of the Machine learning and AI applications in physics and engineering.310 The AI Singapore Fundamental Research programme supports basic research and seeks to fill exist ing research gaps . This includes purely technical research , such as image recognition algorithms , but also research on the social impact of AIs and their socially acceptable use.311 The research grants will be distributed by means of a tender . Individu als as well as research institutions could apply to obtain subsidies up to 632,000 Euro.312 Propos als were expected to focus on methodology and algorithms , in particular deep learning , rather than sector-specific solutions.313 At the time of writing , decisions on recipients had not been made . The Grand Challenges programme is designed to work with the public to promote new , innovative ideas in three long-term areas : healthcare , urban solutions and financial technology ( in short : FinTech ) .314 Criteria for a Grand Challenge are : Inspira tion ( for researchers , users and the public ) , meas urability ( success criteria ) and impact ( solutions that benefit many people ) .315 The funding will be provided in two phases : up to 4.4 million Euro in the first two funding years and up to 17.4 million Euro in the second phase ( three more years ) .316 V. ) Commercialisation The cooperation between research and industry is one of the key factors for the adaptation of AI solutions by the private sector . However , it has so far hardly been accepted and used by companies , which the government wants to change by means of initiatives to link research and industry . There are between 1,600 and 2,400 technology startups in Singapore,317 however , according to 45Singapore Asgard and Roland Berger , only a few of them specialise in AI ( 35 ) . This is a long way from the global peak ( just under 1,400 in the USA ) and is the lowest in comparison with the countries ana lysed in this study.318 Meanwhile , the interest of foreign companies in the AI ecosystem is growing . Thus , in 2017 , the investment group Marvelstone , financier of the global Fintech hub “ Lattice80 ” announced to open an AI hub in Singapore . The group wants to bring together scientists , com panies and the government to develop AI tech nologies for the market . To this end , up to 100 AI startups per year can be funded.319 One of the 25 Hottest AI Companies 2018 according to the CIO Advisors Ranking is located in Singapore : AIQ , a company specialising in technologies for visual capture and intelligent recognition.320 These devel opments are reinforced by well-trained profes sionals and close cooperation between universi ties and industry in research and development ( fifth place among the countries surveyed ) .321 Between 2015 and 2017 , however , only 0.31 per cent of all internationally enforceable AI patents were from Singapore – for comparison : in South Korea the figure was around 3.8 per cent.322 The manufacturing industry accounts for 20 to 25 percent of the gross domestic product ( GDP ) in Singapore . The key industries are electron ics , chemistry , biomedicine , logistics and trans port technology.323 The country with the second highest robot density in the world ( behind South Korea ) 324 expects strong consequences of AI for the labour market : Nearly 21 percent of fulltime workers could lose their jobs in the next ten years – more than in other ASEAN coun tries – through the increased use of technolo gies such as AI and robotics.325 In order to pro mote understanding and acceptance of AI among the population , the government offers the AI For Everyone programme : In free workshops , up to 100,000 Singaporeans are informed about AI applications in their own companies and in daily life.326 AI For Everyone is financially supported by IMDA and Microsoft.327 Regulation : In his speech at innovfest unbound 2018 , the largest Southeast Asian innovation festi val , S. Iswaran promised a progressive regulatory framework for the ICT sector in Singapore . With regard to data protection , this means , in particu lar , that the Personal Data Protection Act of 2012 will be examined for favourable regulations . Up to now , this has legitimised the needs of compa nies to collect and use personal data on the one hand , and regulates the responsible handling of data on the other.328 The law has also established the Personal Data Protection Commission Singa pore ( PDPC ) , which administers the law and its implementation.329 As early as July 2017 , the PDPC issued a guideline for data exchange to explain the Data protection acts published . In addition , a framework for the agreement on the exchange of data within a regulatory- sandbox will be estab lished that releases companies from certain obli gations to test and promotes innovative uses of personal data.330 Since text and data mining are essential for the development of AI , this topic was part of the pub lic consultation on amendments of the Copy Right Act in 2016 . In it , the Ministry of Justice proposes an exception in the Copy Right Act which allows copying of copyrighted documents and data for the purpose of data analysis.331 Politicians are expected to agree to this proposal.332 Business support and startup promotion : The conditions for startups in the country are already very good . According to Genomes 2017 Startup Ecosystem Ranking singapore ranks twelfth in the world and promises young startups in the country great opportunities for global success.333 The value of the Singapore startup ecosystem in 2017 was 9.6 billion Euro , which is comparatively high com pared with the global average of 3.6 billion Euro.334 In addition to the SME Go Digital Initiative announced in 2017 , which aims to support small and medium-sized enterprises in strengthening digital capabilities,335 young companies will be sup ported by the initiative Accreditation @ SGD in their early growth phases with tailor-made advice on technical applications.336 In fact Accreditation @ SGD was instrumental in the Taiger startup company transferring its intellectual property and key oper ations to Singapore in 2015.337 The Infocomm Media Development Authority ( IMDA ) through its coop - 46eration with the leading banks DBS , OCBC and UOB offers the following services Accreditation @ SGD participating companies improved access to innovative Fintech projects.338 In addition , IMDA has decided to support AI developers in the field of language recognition for the national language corpus in order to prepare their long-term entry into the global speech recognition market.339 The AI for Industry programme of the AI Singa pore Initiative is aimed at developing the skills of engineers , managers and executives who already have technical knowledge and wish to develop their programming skills to use data and create AI applications.340 In addition , the 100Experiments programme is intended to connect AI researchers and develop ers with players from the industry who want to address their specific challenges through AI solu tions . Companies can submit problems for which AI could be used as a solution and will be referred to AI experts accordingly . AI Singapore finances the project together with the company in equal shares with up to 160,000 Euro.341 The programme is popular with the industry and initial solutions are already being tested.342 High initial investment in AI solutions are entry barriers for companies , which the programme helps to overcome.343 IMDA has also launched the AI Business Partner ship Programme . It provides a guided process to bring local companies with potential problems ( AI end-user companies ) together with providers of existing AI solutions and support these partner ships in the development and deployment of pro totypes . In addition , quarterly free AI workshops are offered by IMDA.344 Problem areas that do not yet have commercially available solutions will be forwarded to 100 experiments of AI Singapore .345The public sector as users of AI : Through the public procurement sector , the government is increasing its demand for cutting-edge technolo gies and thus encouraging innovation . From 2017–2018 , in the World Competitiveness Index , the country ranked in fifth place of the 137 countries surveyed in the field of government procurement of cutting-edge technology.349 The Smart Nation Ini tiative also intends to expand the area of E-govern ance further . This has been specified in the Digital Government Blueprint paper , which also states that digitisation and AI are defined as elementary components of the transformation efforts of the public service at the interface between state and citizens and that digital payments and digital sig natures are concrete applications . Employees of public institutions are to be provided with digital competences in the workplace in order to meet the challenges between public authorities and citizens more effectively.350 Since access to data sets is essential for machine learning , S. Iswaran announced that he would expand the provision of public data via the data . gov.sg platform and motivate companies to exchange data responsibly among themselves in order to solve common business problems . Labour market : As a country with a knowledgebased economy , Singapore also focuses on the training of specialists in the field of AI . This is reflected in the relatively high number of AI tal ents.351 As part of the Industry Transformation Map that Infocomm Media Development Authority ( IMDA ) aims to further develop the IT and communica -Singapore Ethical use of AI and data : For the Singa porean government , ethics plays a central role in the use of AI applications and the handling of data . So S. Iswaran in his speech at innovfest unbound 2018 announced the establishment of an advisory board on the ethical use of AI and data.346 In June 2018 , the Personal Data Protection Commission Singapore published a discussion paper on responsi ble handling of AI , which stresses the prin ciples of transparency and “ Do no harm ” .347 After receiving a research grant in 2018 , the Singapore Management University opened the Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Data Governance , which will examine the societal opportunities and risks arising from these technologies.348 47tions industry through the targeted promotion of skilled workers in the transformation towards a digital economy.352 It is not clear from the search whether funds have already been spent on this . SkillsFutures is a comprehensive initiative to spread ICT skills and knowledge across the population.353 Part is also the 2016 announced TechSkills Accelerator ( TeSA ) , which takes an inte grated approach to the acquisition of ICT skills and the training of ICT practitioners.354 Through a partnership between AI Singapore and the TechSkills Accelerator , a “ pipe line of locally grown , world-renowned AI talents ” 355 is to be created : the AI Apprenticeship Programme . The training is designed by industry players to meet the demand for trained professionals . Contents include the construction of data pipe lines , Data warehouses for AI Use cases and adjustment of machine learning algorithms . The nine-month programme is aimed at experts from all fields within the first three years after graduation and includes a combination of in-depth AI courses and hands-on training in industrial projects.356 The pro gramme has been completed by the first year of students and partnerships have been established between the trainees and industrial actors .

In an attempt to integrate these indicators and determine the AI position of a country in an international compari son , the Cambrian AI Index © was developed . The Cambrian AI Index consists of the three segments mentioned above , which in turn consist of dif ferent components for which one or more proxy indicators have been identified . The methodol ogy must be specified more , since the index is defined by proxy measurements for which reliable and comparable data from different countries are available . The reason for using the proxies is that the field of AI in its latest phase only provides lim ited measurable outputs . This is likely to change over the next few years , as the accompanying research on AI is also developing rapidly.The values of the different proxies are indexed from 0 to 1 , with the USA representing the “ bench mark ” value 1 against which the other countries are measured . Due to the world leadership AI , the United States have been selected the AI bench mark country . The mean value of the indexed proxy values of a component is the component ’ s intermediate value . The mean values of all com ponents of a segment , in turn , result in the total value of the segment . The mean values of the three segments result in the comprehensive Cambrian AI Index . Weighting was not carried out at proxy , component or segment level , since well-founded empirical studies are required for adequate weighting.Methodology of the Cambrian AI Index © 50Methodology of the Cambrian AI Index © Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source General require mentsFramework conditionsNetwork Readiness Index Value ( 2016 ) Explanation : The index provides insights about the performance of national economies in the use of information and communication technologies to enhance competi tiveness , innovation and well-being . Thus it serves as a proxy for the framework conditions of AI.Survey based on a scale from 1 ( worst ) to 7 ( best ) . World Economic Forum : https : //widgets.weforum.org/ gitr2016/ Data OpenData Barometer ( 2016 ) Explanation : In addition to individu als with internet access and busi nesses , the public sector is the third important source of AI-related data . The OpenData barometer assesses governments worldwide in their will ingness to implement OpenData ini tiatives . It also measures the impact of OpenData on business , politics and civil society.The data for the OpenData barom eter is collected through expert inter views , self-assessments by govern ments and secondary data sources . World Wide Web Foundation : https : //opendatabarometer.org Number of Internet users ( 2016 ) Explanation : Internet users are persons who have used the inter net ( from anywhere ) via comput ers , mobile phones , personal digital assistants , gaming machines , digital television , etc . in the last 3 months . This proxy measures internet users in absolute numbers rather than as a percentage of the population , since the quantity of data is what counts for AI.World Bank : https : //data.worldbank.org/ indicator/IT.NET.USER.ZS Computing powerNumber of 500 most powerful supercomputers per country ( 2018 ) Explanation : Even if computing power can be used across borders , the availability of supercomputers to cope with large amounts of data and increasingly complex algorithms is a strategic factor for a nation.The website Top500.org counts and lists the top super computers that are publicly known and commercially available worldwide in semi-annual surveys ( June and November ) . It is possible that military high-perfor mance computers exist which are not known . Top500.org : www.top500.org 51Methodology of the Cambrian AI Index © Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source Number of 10 most powerful supercomputers per country ( 2018 ) Explanation : The Top 10 of the 500 most powerful supercomputers shows that in some countries , e. g. China , the most supercomputers are installed , but they are not the most powerful.Top500.org : www.top500.org Turnover of leading semiconductor manufacturing companies in billions ( 2017 ) Explanation : Turnover from semicon ductor companies per country gives information about the dominance and thus innovation power in this industry segment . Even though the production of semiconductors is not indicative of the use of semiconduc tors , production capacities are a stra tegic factor for a nation.China : HiSilicon Technologies Uni Group Sanechips Huada Goodix Japan : Toshiba Renesas Electronics Sony ROHM Semiconductor Republic of Korea : Samsung Electronics SK Hynix USA : Intel Micron Technology Broadcom Qualcomm Texas Instruments nVidia Skyworks Solutions SanDisk / Western Digital Analog Devices ON Semiconductor Freescale Semiconductor AMD Statista : https : //www.statista.com/ statistics/271553/worldwiderevenue-of-semiconductor-supplierssince-2009 supplemented by the evaluations of individual annual financial statements . 52Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source Number of leading semiconductor manufacturing companies ( 2017 ) Explanation : Complementing the proxies stated above , the number of semi-conductor companies provides information about the strength of a country ’ s semiconductor environment.Statista , supplemented by further research ( see above ) Revenues from FPGA chips in million USD ( 2016 ) Explanation : Intel and Microsoft are confident that FPG chips will be the dominant AI hardware in the future . A paper recently published by Intel engineers titled “ Can FPGAs Beat GPUs in Accelerating Deep Neu ral Networks ” provides some of the technical reasons for this specula tion . It should be noted that the industry has developed strongly since 2016 ( see chapter on China ) .EE Times : https : //www.eetimes.com/author . asp ? doc_id=1331443 Nurvitadhi , E. ; Venkatesh , G. ; Sim , J. ; Marr , D. ; Huang , R. ; Ong , J.

In contrast , the index assigns the number of doctoral students to the “ Research and Devel opment ” segment.The estimate is based on the num ber of scholars at computer science institutes who have been actively researching artificial intelligence , computer vision , machine learning & data mining , natural language pro cessing and robotics since 2016 , i. e. whose publications have been pre sented at relevant conferences . In order to determine the annual number of Master ’ s graduates , theMethodology of the Cambrian AI Index © 53Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source number of scholars was multiplied by a factor of 7 . This factor was determined by Mark Nitzberg , Chief Scientist for Cambrian and Head of UC Berkeley CHAI , on the basis of a random sample survey of top AI research laboratories in the USA ( potential regional/national differ ences were not considered ) . CS Ranking : http : //csrankings.org/ # /index ? none Research and DevelopmentGeneral R & D framework conditionsGross domestic expenditure on research and development in 000 USD ( 2016 ) Explanation : The gross domestic expenditure comprises the R & D investments of the private sector , the government , higher education institutions and civil society . This proxy is presented in absolute terms in USD as opposed to the percentage ratio of GDP to reflect the global and mobile value chains of AI.The data are available in the respec tive national currency . For compara bility , all values have been converted to USD ( average exchange rate of 2016 ) . The 2016 expenditures from Singapore and India are not availa ble , which is why they were projected based on historical values . UNESCO http : //data.uis.unesco.org Number of researchers per 1 million inhabitants ( 2016 ) Explanation : The “ density ” of researchers is a proxy for the ser endipity in research in a country . The importance of serendipity in the field of AI is high , since AI is a basic technology with practically unlim ited application areas.UNESCO http : //data.uis.unesco.org AI-relevant R & D ( Input ) Number of computer science institutes with actively research ing teachers in AI-relevant areas Explanation : The number of com puter science institutes provides information about the size of the relevant R & D ecosystem.Number of scholars at computer science institutes who have been actively researching artificial intel ligence , computer vision , machine learning & data mining , natural language processing and robotics since 2016 , i. e. whose publications have been presented at relevant conferences .

It is unknown whether the index takes into account co-authors and their nationality.The influence of publications is meas ured on the basis of the H index . The figure is based on bibliometric analy ses , i. e. on citations of the scientist ’ s publications . Scimago Journal & Country Rank : https : //www.scimagojr.com Commercial izationKnowledge and technol ogy transferCooperation between universi ties and industry on research and development ( 2017–18 ) Explanation : This proxy delivers information on the knowledge and technology transfer between univer sities and the private sector.Opinion polls among executives : In your country , to what extent do business and universities cooperate in research and development ( R & D ) ? ( 1 = not at all ; 7 = intensively ) . Weighted average . World Economic Forum : https : //www.weforum.org/reports/ the-global-competitivenessreport-2017-2018 Public procurement of cuttingedge technology ( 2017–18 ) Explanation : This proxy provides information about the incentives that the public sector creates by demand for certain technologies and thus innovations.Opinion polls among executives : To what extent do government purchas ing decisions promote innovation in your country ? ( 1 = not at all ; 7 = to a large extent ) . Weighted average . World Economic Forum : https : //www.weforum.org/reports/ the-global-competitivenessreport-2017-2018Methodology of the Cambrian AI Index © 56Segment Component Proxy Survey Method/Source Patents AI patents ( with international enforcement expectations ) by assignee country in % ( average of the years 2015 , 2016 and 2017 ) . Explanation : This proxy provides information on the patent activities of a country ’ s companies . Neverthe less , this proxy is subject to reserva tion , since the patents are not indic ative of the quality of an innovation and are often merely incremental in nature.Although various sources suggest that China has overtaken the US in terms of AI-related patent applica tions , most Chinese patents have no international equivalents and are therefore unenforceable outside China . The patents cover AI as well as Machine Learning and Deep Learning . Notice : The process of patent appli cation for patent publication is associated with a considerable time delay , which is why the figures may also vary retroactively . Research by M-Cam : https : //www.m-cam.com AI startup landscapeNumber of AI startups ( 2017 ) Explanation : The number of AI start ups provides information about the diversity of the potentials of AI and the innovative strength of the national economies.The data collection focused exclu sively on startups active in the AI technology industry and ignored companies dealing with other digital topics and technologies . These are startups that produce AI solutions and expressly excludes startups that use existing AI solutions on the market to develop new services or products .

V.The race for world leadership in Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) technologies has begun . Since the publication of the AI strategy of the Obama government in 2016 , other countries have also started to explore ways to support research and development ( R & D ) as well as the com mercialisation of AI and to catch up with the U. S. as the leading AI nation . With this two-part publication , the Konrad Adenauer Foundation intends to give a compa rative overview of the AI strategies of major national economies ( Part 1 & 2 ) and to analyse the German AI strategy in an international comparison ( Part 3 ) in order to enrich the German and international debate . We believe : “ Tech is politics ” – and politics and civil society should give this more attention and discuss this more vigorously .
