example system used website determine content show users decision individually signiﬁcant since user greatly aﬀected whether particular piece media shown however website popular system may making set decisions biases system aﬀect large number users significant decision decision either individually signiﬁcant part set decisions subject artificially intelligent system also subject natural person following system directly aﬀected operation outcomes system recipient service recommendation provided system guidelines make systems fair consideration given whether data ingested representative affected population developer organisations operator organisations undertake reasonable data exploration testing identify potentially prejudicial tendencies systems arising biases data example following natural disaster government relief agency uses system detect communities greatest need analysing social media data range websites however communities smartphone penetration lower less presence social media risk receiving less attention therefore charity complements tool traditional techniques identify needy populations elsewhere developer organisations operator organisations refrain training systems data likely representative aﬀected subjects likely accurate whether due age omission method collection factors developer organisations consider whether systems expected perform well exposed data especially evaluating people training data consideration given whether processes introduce bias subjecting diﬀerent groups diﬀerent processes developer organisations consider whether lead bias evaluating fairness system developer organisations operator organisations consider whether subjects circumstances receive equal treatment example organisation uses tool automate candidates job opening trained data company existing employees majority ethnic background therefore system learns use name nationality discriminating factors ﬁltering job applicants could identiﬁed testing rectiﬁed example balancing training data using relevant data ﬁelds training signiﬁcant decisions informed use fair developer organisations operator organisations could consider formal procedures discrimination impact assessments means ensuring fairness operator organisations consider whether systems accessible usable fair manner across user groups consideration given effect diversity development deployment processes eﬀorts could made include people diverse demographic backgrounds development deployment processes developer organisations consider whether assumptions make subjects could wrong likely lead bias consider consulting subjects representative manner development deployment conﬁrm assumptions make systems accountable accountability outcomes system lie system accountability loss damages resulting application systems attributed system operator organisations developer organisations consider designating individuals responsible investigating rectifying cause loss damage arising deployment systems positive efforts made identify mitigate signiﬁcant risks inherent systems designed operator organisations use systems backed respected academic research developer organisations base development research operator organisations identify likely impact incorrect automated decisions subjects case incorrect decisions likely cause signiﬁcant cost inconvenience consider mitigating measures example foreign country government service identiﬁes parents owe money child maintenance data matching process often incorrect due misspelled names missing data results individuals incorrectly targeted automatically system result large bill poor credit ratings even freezing wages recourse individuals incorrectly targeted straightforward potential impact incorrect decisions assessed mitigation measures review procedure could set operator organisations consider internal risk assessments ethics frameworks means facilitate identiﬁcation risks mitigating measures designing systems inform signiﬁcant decisions developer organisations consider measures maintain data accuracy time including completeness data timely update data whether context data collected aﬀects suitability intended use case example border camera scanning predictors risk may misinterpret tic individual tourette syndrome suspicious manifest diverse fashion cause person undergo secondary inspection every time pass border data updated ﬁrst case encountered would avoid causing inconvenience subsequent visits developer organisations operator organisations consider tuning models periodically cater changes data models time operator organisations consider whether systems trained comparatively static environment display model instability deployed dynamic environments cabinet
