Samsung Gauss Image , a creative generative image model , excels in generating and modifying images with ease . It offers capabilities for artistic style transformations and content additions , as well as upgrading low-resolution images to high-resolution , showcasing its versatility and creative potential . Principles for AI Ethics As AI technology unfolds its boundless potential , ushering in a new era of experiences , it simultaneously poses potential social and ethical challenges . To ensure the sustainable and ethical deployment of AI and its applications , we have established the principles of “ Fairness , ” “ Transparency , ” and “ Accountability. ” These guidelines are not just about legal compliance but are a testament to our commitment to social and ethical responsibilities . To integrate these ethical principles into our corporate culture , they will be embedded into our internal guidelines and training programs . This initiative aims to educate and direct our employees toward the ethical development and use of AI . 1 . Fairness Our commitment extends to embedding the values of equality and diversity diversity across the AI system ’ s entire lifecycle , ensuring that our AI does not perpetuate or amplify negative or unfair biases . We will make AI accessible to all users , promoting inclusivity . 2 . Transparency Users will be clearly informed when they are interacting with AI. , fostering an environment of trust . AI will be designed to be explainable , allowing users to comprehend the basis of its decisions or recommendations within the bounds of technological possibility . The processes involving the collection or use of personal data by AI will be conducted with utmost transparency . 3 . Accountability We pledge to imbue our AI systems with social and ethical responsibility , reflecting our corporate values . AI systems will be fortified with robust security measures to safeguard against data breaches and cyberattacks , ensuring user data protection . Through our AI systems , we aim to contribute to society and enhance our stature as responsible corporate citizens .
