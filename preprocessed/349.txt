Norwegian Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation Strateg y National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2 Foreword It is difficult to predict the future , but we know that Norway will be affected by the age wave , climate change and increasing global isation , and that in the coming years we must work smarter and more efficiently to remain competitive and maintain the same leve l of welfare . Digitalisation and new technologies are the key to achieving this , and artificial intelligence will be a vital component . Artificial intelligence represents vast opportunities for us as individuals , for business and industry , and for the pub lic sector . If used in the right way , technology can contribute to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals – not just in Norway , but globally . There are many good examples of AI in use in Norway , and in the coming years we will likely see many more , e specially in business and industry and the public sector . While the United States and China have come far with consumer -oriented applications , our strength lies in the fact that our industry , business and public sector are more technologically advanced and digitalised than in most other countries . Norway is world -leading in the process industry , green shipping , aquaculture and petroleum activities . We have one of the most digitalised public sectors in the world . We must continue to build on these advantages in our development and use of artificial intelligence . Norwegian society is characterised by trust and respect for fundamental values such as human rights and privacy . This is something we perhaps take for granted in Norway , but leading the way in develo ping human -friendly and trustworthy artificial intelligence may prove a key advantage in today 's global competition . There is no denying the fact that AI also presents some difficult questions . Who is responsible for the consequences of a decision that is made by AI ? What happens when autonomous systems make decisions which we disagree with and which , in a worst -case scenario , cause harm ? And how do we mak e sure that the technology does not inten tionally or unintentionally perpetuate and reinforce discrimination and prejudice ? When faced with dilemmas like these , it can be useful to have some fundamental principles to turn to for guidance : transparency , ex plainability and cautious testing . These principles must also be applied when we develop and use solutions built on artificial intelligence . While working on this strategy I have had opportunities to meet people who work on artificial intelligence in acade mia , business and industry , and the public sector . I have had meetings with employer and employee organisations who see that artificial intelligence will impact the labour market in the time ahead . An overview of most of these meetings is available at www.regjeringen.no/ki -strategi , along with all the written input I received . I would like to thank everyone who shared their engagement and insights . I hope this strategy can serve as a framework for bot h public and private entities seeking to develop and use artificial intelligence . Together we will explore the potential that lies in this exciting technology !

tasks in increasingly better ways ; it will also enable us to perform them in completely new ways . The Government wants Norway to take the lead in developing and using AI that respects in dividuals ' rights and freedoms . Introduction and summary Artificial intelligence ( AI ) represents vast opportunities for us as individuals and for society at large . AI can lead to new , more effective business models and to effective , user -centric services in the public sector . Norway is well positioned for succe eding with artificial intelligence . We have :  a high level of public trust in both the business and public sectors  a population and business sector that are digitally competent  An excellent infrastructure and high -quality registry data that span over many d ecades  well developed e -governance and public agencies that have come a long way with digitalisation and that have the capacity and expertise to experiment with new technologies  tripartite cooperation between employers , unions and government , which facilit ates cooperation when restructuring is necessary Technology will not only enable us to perform tasks in increasingly better ways ; it will also enable us to perform them in completely new ways . But development and use of AI can also present challenges . Norwegian society is characterised by trust and respect for fundamental values such as human rights and privacy . The Government wants Norway to lead the way in 6 developing and using AI with respect for individual rights and freedoms . This can become a key a dvantage in today 's global competition . The Government believes that :  artificial intelligence that is developed and used in Norway should be built on ethical principles and respect human rights and democracy  research , development and use of artificial in telligence in Norway should promote responsible and trustworthy AI  development and use of AI in Norway should safeguard the integrity and privacy of the individual  cyber security should be built into the development , operation and administration of systems that use AI  supervisory authorities should oversee that AI systems in their areas of supervision are operated in accordance with the principles for responsible and trustworthy use of AI A good basis for artificial intelligence The Government will facilitate world -class AI infrastructure in Norway in the form of digitalisation -friendly regulations , good language resources , fast and robust communication networks , and sufficient computing power . It will facilitate data sharing within and across indust ries and sectors . Data Data is vital for the develop ment and us e of AI . Today vast amounts of information are generated from many different sources . AI and machine learning can use this data to give us important insights . Access to high -quality datasets i s essential for exploiting the potential of AI . The Government will facilitate data sharing in both the public and private sectors and between sectors . Regulations The Government will evaluate whether there are regulations that hamper appropriate and desi red use of artificial intelligence in the public and private sectors . There will be requirements for transparency and accountability in new systems for public administration in which AI is used . The Government is positive towards establishing regulatory sa ndboxes in areas where this is called for . Such initiatives already exist in connection with autonomous transport . The Government will also establish an advisory body and a regulatory sandbox for AI in the area of data protection . Language Language technol ogies such as speech recognition and language comprehension represent an important component of AI . To enable Norwegian citizens to participate in increasingly advanced services in their own language , we need good language resources in both Norwegian langu age forms and in Sami . The Government will facilitate the collection of and access to language resources . 7 Communication networks and computing power Development and use of AI requires a sound communication infrastructure and access to computing power . The work on communication infrastructure , and on 5G networks in particular , is a priority area for the Government . Access to sufficient computing power will be secured through the use of national and international resources for high performance computing . Developing and leveraging artificial intelligence Norway will invest in AI in areas where we have distinct advantages , such as health , seas and oceans , public administration , energy and mobility . The Government wants Norwegian organisations to be attractive cooperation partners for leading business and research communities in AI . Norway will continue to pursue its investment in basic and applied ICT research . Policy instruments that stimulate investment in strong research communities , such as the Research Cou ncil of Norway 's centre schemes , will be central to AI investments . Artificial intelligence will have a dominant place in Horizon Europe , the EU 's next framework programme for research and innovation . Moreover , the EU has proposed the establishment of a c omprehensive digitalisation programme , Digital Europe Programme ( DEP ) , for the period 2021 –2027 . The programme will focus on initiatives in high -performance computing and artificial intelligence . The Government has signed a non-binding declaration of inten t to participate in Horizon Europe and will consider Norway 's participation in DEP from 2021 . Norway will have advanced skills , including in basic ICT research and AI research , in order to understand and benefit from changes in technological developments . This requires good study programmes that coincide with the needs of different sectors for adva nced skills in artificial intelligence and in basic subjects such as statistics , mathematics and information technology . AI and related topics such as ethics and data protection associated with applications of AI will also be important in areas such as la w and other professional programmes . Institutions of higher education ought to evaluate how topics with relevance to artificial intelligence can be integrated into their programmes in areas that will be affected by artificial intelligence in the coming yea rs . Technological development will lead to changes in the labour market , and the pace of change is likely to accelerate . Opportunities for upskilling and reskilling – both in the workplace and in the form of study programmes – will therefore be increasingl y important as applications of AI become more widespread in the labour market . The Government will present a white paper on a skills reform , and has already begun work on flexible further educational programmes both for digital skills and for employees who must adapt their skills as a result of digitalisation and the transition to a green society . Enhancing innovation capacity using artificial intelligence The Government wants Norway to exploit the innovative potential of artificial intelligence . Norway ca n take a leading position in applying artificial intelligence , particularly in areas where we already are well positioned and have strong research 8 and business communities , such as health , oil and gas , energy , the maritime and marine industries and the pub lic sector . The Government will consider how industrial policy instruments can best be designed to support the potential value creation and use of AI in the business sector . Public agencies ought to actively explore the potential of artificial intelligence , and increased interaction between the public sector and the business sector should promote innovation and value creation . The public sector ought to actively explore opportunities in the market in connection with procurements , and innovative public procu rements should be used where appropriate . To facilitate innovative solutions , the agencies ought to focus on their needs rather than on concrete products or services . Responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence Development and use of AI can also p resent challenges , in particular for AI that builds on personal data . There is therefore a need for continuous discussion about what is responsible and desirable development and about what can be done to prevent adverse development . The Government wants N orway to lead the way in developing and using AI with respect for individual rights and freedoms . In Norway , artificial intelligence will be based on ethical principles , respect for privacy and data protection and good cyber security . Norway will continue to participate in European and international forums to promote responsible and trustworthy use of AI . About the strategy The National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence is intended for the civilian sector – both private and public . It does not cover the defence sector . The strategy focuses on specifying what is meant by artificial intelligence and on describing some areas where it will be important for Norway to exploit the opportunities offered by AI . Artificial intelligence is an are a that is constantly evolving . For this reason , no specific time period is applied to the strategy . There will be a need to adjust and evaluate the strategy at appropriate intervals , in line with technological and social developments . This strategy must also be viewed in connection with other important work by the Government , such as the digitalisation strategy for the public sector1 , a new public administration act2 , a review of the system of business -oriente d policy instruments3 , the skills reform for lifelong learning ( Lære hele livet ) , health data regulation4 , and several other small - and large -scale initiatives that are discussed in the strategy . 1 Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation ( 2019 ) : One digital public sector .

This strategy takes the definition proposed by the European Commission 's High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Int elligence5 as its starting point , and defines AI as : AI systems act in the physical or digital dimension by perceiving their environment , processing and interpreting information and deciding the best action ( s ) to take to achieve the given goal . Some AI systems can adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions . As a scientific discipline , artificial intelligence embraces various approaches and technologies , such as machine learning ( including , for example , deep learning and reinforcement learning ) , machine reasoni ng ( including planning , search and optimisation ) , and certain methodologies in robotics ( such as control , sensors , and integration with other technologies in cyber physical systems ) . 5 High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission ( 2019 ) : A definition of AI : Main capabilities and scientific disciplines 10 Figure 1 : Simplified overview of AI 's sub -disciplines Source : Indepe ndent High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission ( 2019 ) : A definition of AI : Main capabilities and disciplines . 'Strong ' and 'weak ' artificial intelligence We are still a long way from a form of artificial intell igence that resembles human intelligence , or artificial general intelligence ( AGI ) . Artificial general intelligence is often referred to as 'strong AI ' while other forms are referred to as 'weak AI ' or 'narrow AI ' . This does not mean that AI systems that a re designed for a specific 'narrow ' area can not be powerful or effective , but they more often refer to specific systems designed to perform a single task , such as image processing or pattern recognition , for specific purposes . Nor is it the case that AI de veloped in parallel in many specific areas , or research on 'weak AI ' , necessarily brings us closer to artificial general intelligence . Our definition embraces both 'strong ' and 'weak ' artificial intelligence . Rule -based systems for automation A rule -base d IT system is often built on rule s such as 'IF x happens , THEN do Y ' . Such rules can be organised in complex decision trees . Rule -based automation systems can be used to model regulations , business logic or experience -based practice ( exercise of discretion ) . Many of the systems used for automated administrative processing in the public sector are rule -based . Our definition of artificial intelligence covers some of these systems , depending on factors such as the complexity of the rule set . 1.2 How does artificial intelligence work ? A system based on artificial intelligence can either interpret data from devices such as sensors , cameras , microphones or pressure gauges or can be fed input data from other in formation sources . The system analyses the data , makes decisions and performs actions . Both the need for data and the fact that it is the system that makes decisions and performs actions raise ethical issues that are discussed in chapter 5 . 11 Some types of s ystems have a feedback loop which enables the artificial intelligence to learn either from its own experiences or from direct feedback from users or operators . The artificial intelligence system is usually embedded as a component within a larger system . T asks are often performed digitally , as part of an IT system , but AI systems can also be part of a physical solution , such as a robot . Examples of current practical applications of AI are :  Computer vision/identification of objects in images : can be used for purposes such as facial recognition or for identifying cancerous tumours .  Pattern recognition or anomaly detection : can be used to , for example , expose bank or insurance fraud or to dete ct data security breaches .  Natural language processing ( NLP ) : can be used to sort and categorise documents and information , and to extract relevant elements from vast datasets .  Robotics : can be used to develop autonomous vehicles such as cars , ships and drones . Development in some areas has progressed rapidly , and we are already seeing systems being used in practice . Development and testing in other areas can take longer to achieve reliable and verified results . Machine learning Today when we hear abo ut systems being based on artificial intelligence , they are usually based on machine learning . Unlike rule -based systems , where rules are defined by humans and are often based on expert experience , business logic or regulations , the concept of machine lear ning covers a range of different technologies where the rules are deduced from the data on which the system is trained . In AI systems developed by machine learning , the machine learning algorithms build mathematical models based on example data or trainin g data . These models are then used to make decisions . Machine learning algorithms usually learn in three different ways :  Supervised learning : the algorithm is trained with a dataset where both input data and output data are given . In other words , the alg orithm is fed both the 'task ' and the 'solution ' and uses them to build the model . This will make it capable of making a decision based on input data .  Non-supervised learning : the algorithm is fed only a dataset without a 'solution ' and must find patterns in the dataset which then can be used to make decisions about new input data . Deep learning algorithms can be trained using non -supervised learning .  Reinforcement learning : the algorithm builds its model based on non supervised learning but receives feed back from the user or operator on whether the decision it proposes is good or bad . The feedback is fed into the system and contributes to improving the model . 12 Figure 2 : The interrelationship between an AI system , its operator and environments . Deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning . Today deep learning is an important component in widely used solutions such as image processing , computer vision , speech recognition and natural language processing . Other areas of application are : pharma ceutical development , recommendation systems ( for music , films , etc . ) , medical imaging processing , personalised medicine , and anomaly detection in a range of areas . The most widely used deep learning frameworks have been developed by Google ( TensorFlow ) an d Facebook ( PyTorch ) . Some deep learning algorithms are like a 'black box ' , where one has no access to the model that can explain why a given input value produces a given outcome . This is discussed in more detail in chapter 5 . « Data urns » , Daniel Huber ( AT ) Photo : Ars Electronica 13 The Government will facilitate world -class AI infrastructure in Norway in the form of digitalisation -friendly regulations , good language resources , fast and robust communication networks , and sufficient computing power . It will facilitate data sharing within and across industries and sectors . 2 A good basis for AI 2.1 Data and data management Data is vital to AI . Today vast datasets are generated from many different sources . AI and machine learning can use this data to provide important insights . Access to high quality datasets is decisive for exploiting the potential of AI . The Government 's goal is to facilitate sharing of data from the public sector so that business and industry , academia and civil society can use th e data in new ways . Data can be regarded as a renewable resource . Sharing data with others does not mean that one is left with less data . In fact , the value of data can increase when shared because it can be combined with other types of data that can offer new ins ights or be used by organisations with the expertise to use the data in new and innovative ways . Open public data In principle , all information that is lawfully published on public websites can also be made accessible as open data . Personal data that is e xempt from public disclosure or that is subject to confidentiality must not , however , be made accessible unless specific reasons apply for doing so . Weather data from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute and traffic information from the Norwegian Public Roads Administration are examples of open data from the public sector . Personal data The issues related to sharing and using data are closely connected to the type of data involved . It is important to distinguish between use of personal data and use of d ata that can not be traced back to specific individuals , such as weather data . Use of 14 personal data for developing AI raises a number of issues that must be addressed before such data can be shared or used . Data sharing principles Principles for sharing ope n public data Even though there is n o statutory obligation that requires open public data to be made accessible , the Government 's goal is for such data to be shared so that it can be used by others ( what we refer to as 'reuse ' ) . Report to the Storting no . 27 ( 2015 –2016 ) Digital agenda for Norway : ICT for a simpler everyday life and increased productivity highlighted five sectors where reuse of open public data is regarded to be of particular economic value : culture , research and education , government expen diture , transport and communications , and maps and property ( geodata ) . Specific strategies have been developed for data sharing in these areas . Furthermore , the Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Manage ment ( DFØ ) has developed a system for publishi ng data pertaining to public expenditure . The Freedom of Information Act regulates how public data should be made available for reuse . Since 2012 , the Digitalisation Circular has required government agencies which establish new or upgrade existing IT-systems or digital services to make data from these accessible in machine -readable formats . The agency should arrange for data to be accessible in the long term , with integrity , authenticity , usability and reliability intact . The Nordic countries share many i nterests and values with respect to artificial intelligence . The Nordic countries therefore cooperate through the Nordic Council of Ministers in several areas related to AI . One of these areas concerns data . A working group has been formed to identify data sets that can be exchanged between Nordic countries and create added value for Nordic enterprises – public and private alike – while still respecting the ethical aspects and the trust and values particular to the Nordic countries . One important measure in the digitalisation strategy for the public sector6 is to establish a national resource centre for data sharing in the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency . The centre is intended to serve as a knowledge hub , and one of its tasks will be to increase awareness a bout the value of sharing data . Principles for data sharing between public -sector agencies The Government has established a 'once only ' principle to ensure that citizens and businesses do not have to provide identical information to multiple public bodies .7 Updated and quality -assured information that is shared across public administrations is a prerequisite for implementing the once -only principle , and is important for developing better , more coherent public services . Some information is held in central registries , such as the National Population Register and the Central Coordinating Register for Legal Entities , but a lot of information exists outside such registries . To facilitate sharing of this data between public agencies , the 6 Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation ( 2019 ) : One digital public sector . Digital strategy for the public sector 2019 –2025 7 Report to the Storting no . 27 ( 2015 –2016 ) Digital agenda for Norway : ICT for a simpler everyday life and in creased productivity 15 Brønnøysund R egister Centre and the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency have established the National Data Directory to provide an overview of the types of data held by various public agencies , how they are related , and what they mean . This catalogue will also provide info rmation on whether data may be shared and on what terms . The Digitalisation Circular requires agencies to publish data that can be shared with others in the National Data Directory and on data.norge.no . Principles f or publicly funded research data Research that is publicly funded should benefit everyone . It is therefore important that research data be made accessible to as many as possible ; to other researchers as well as to public administration and the business sec tor . Better access to research data can boost innovation and value creation by enabling actors outside research communities to find new areas of application . It can also contribute to smarter service development in the public sector , opportunities for new business activities , and new jobs . There is no doubt that far more datasets from research can be made accessible , along with pertinent protocols , methods , models , software and source codes . Such access must be safeguarded by sound data protection practices and give due consideration to security , intellectual property rights and business secrets . However , the vast and growing amount of research data means that not all data can be a rchived and maintained for the same long periods . The costs of making datasets genuinely reusable must be weighed against the benefit to research communities and society . The Government has presented a strategy on access to and sharing of research data.8 The strategy sets out three basic principles for publicly funded research data in Norway :  Research data must be as open as possible , and as closed as necessary .  Research data should be managed and curated to take full advantage of its potential value .  Decisions concerning the archiving and curation of research data must be made within the research community . Framework for data sharing in the industry sector In Germany , a framework for sharing data in the industry sector , International Data Spaces , was established in connection with the Industry 4.0 initiative . The initiative has been expanded to industry sectors in other countries , and in Norway SINTEF has enabled Norwegian companies to use the framework . The framework offers a common infrastructure for the secure storage of industry data . The framework offers companies contro l of their own data while enabling them to share it if they wish to do so . Sources : Fraunhofer institut , SINTEF 8 Ministry of Education and Research ( 2012 ) : National strategy on access to and sharing of research data 16 Principles for data sharing in the business sector In principle , companies own their own data , and it is up to each company to decide how it wants to use its data within the parameters of data protection regulations . Few industries and businesses are aware of the value of data sharing . Many companies have a poor overview of their own data , and therefore have neither categorised it nor assessed its potential benefit to themselves or to other organisations.9 Norway has some examples of voluntary data sharing within the private sector and between businesses and the public sector :  The oil and gas industry : In 1995 the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate and the oil companies operating in the Norwegian continental shelf established the Diskos National Data Repository ( Diskos ) . Diskos is a national data repository of information related to exploration and extraction from the Norwegian shelf . The data is di rectly accessible online to members of the Diskos joint venture . The idea behind Diskos is that the oil companies should all cooperate on storing exploration data and compete in interpreting it.10  Geodata : Norway Digital is a broad cooperation programme bet ween agencies that are responsible for obtaining geospatial information and/or that are large users of such information . The cooperation partners comprise municipalities , counties , national agencies and private enterprises such as telecom and power compani es.11 Geonorge.no is a national website that has been created for weather data and other geospatial information in Norway under the Norway Digital partnership . The authorities are generally hesitant about requiring private enterprises to share data . The Government 's position is that private enterprises with a mutual interest in sharing data should do so on their own initiative . Nonetheless , this can prove difficult to achieve in practice . The Government has set out t he following principles for sharing data from the business sector:12  Voluntary data sharing is preferable , particularly between parties with a mutual interest in sharing data .  The authorities can facilitate the sharing of data where the enterprises themselves do n't see the value in sharing if sharing such data would enhance public benefit .  Data sharing may be imposed if necessary ; for example for reasons of public interest .  Data must be shared in such a way that individuals and business es retain control of their own data . Privacy and business interests must be safeguarded . 9 Veritas Technologies LLC ( 2015 ) : The Databerg Report : See what others do n't 10 Ministry of Petroleum and Energy ( 2015 ) : DISKOS 20 years of service for petroleum geology . 11 www.geonorge.no/en/ 12 The principles are inspired by : Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy ( 2019 ) : Dutch vision on data sharing between businesses 17 Some activities in the business sector are performed for the public sector or under permits or licences granted by public authorities . Public agencies have taken litt le advantage of opportunities to set requirements for data access or sharing in connection with entering into contracts or awarding licences . The Government will therefore consider whether the public sector can contribute to making more datasets from the b usiness sector accessible by setting requirements for data sharing in conjunction with entering into public contracts wherever appropriate . The Government will also consider evaluating requirements to make data publicly accessible in licensing areas where such access is considered to be of particular benefit to society . Methods of sharing data A variety of methods are available that can make it simpler and safer to share data between different stakeholders : Data lakes A data lake is a central repository for storing data , such as a cloud service . The data can be stored as is , in its original format , and can be a combination of structured and unstructured data . The data need not be structured or labelled . The data lake ca n then be used to retrieve data for machine learning or for other analyses . Data trusts A data trust is a legal structure where a trusted third party is responsible for the data to be shared . The third party decides which data should be shared with whom , in compliance with the purpose for which the data trust was set up . Anonymisation interface An anonymisation interface allows various analyses to be carried out on register data containing personal data from multiple data sources without being able to id entify individuals . The Remote Access Infrastructure for Register Data ( RAIRD ) is a cooperation project between the Norwegian Social Science Data Services and Statistics Norway on such an anonymisation interface . The information model for RAIRD is openly a ccessible and can be used by anyone.13 Synthetic data Synthetic data can in many cases be an alternative to identifiable data or anonymised data . If synthetic datasets can be produced with the same features as the original dataset , they can be used to trai n algorithms or be used as test data . This means that even datasets which normally would be considered sensitive could be made openly accessible for use in research and innovation . Common open application programming interfaces An application programming interface ( API ) makes it possible to search directly in a data source to retrieve the desired data . This is a prerequisite for being able to use data in real time . The Digitalisation Circular establishes that public agencies must make appropriate informat ion available in machine -readable and preferably standardised formats , ideally using APIs . 13 RAIRD Information Model RIM v1_0 accessible at https : //statswiki.unece.org/display/gsim/RAIRD+Information+Model+RIM+v1_0 18 Generation of synthetic test data for the National Registry The Norwegian Tax Administration is in the process of developing a solution in which machine learning is used to generate rich synthetic test data in a dedicated test environment for the National Registry . The synthetic National Registry will offer synthet ic test subjects in addition to simulating events . The objective is to allow enterprises that use information from the National Registry to test their integrations without using authentic personal data in the tests . Initially the synthetic National Registr y will be made available to parties needing to test integration with the National Registry . Eventually it will be available to everyone who needs National Registry data for testing purposes . Source : Norwegian Tax Administration White paper on the data -driven economy The Government will prepare a white paper on data sharing and the data -driven economy . The white paper will discuss important issues such as data ownership , incentives for sharing data , and possibilities for equitable sharing of the eco nomic gains from a global digital data economy . Other important issues are data protection , secure data sharing , and ethical use of data . The white paper will also discuss issues relating to competence in data science and data sharing , and to infrastructur e for data capture and sharing . As part of the work on preparing the white paper , the Minister of Digitalisation will appoint an expert group to examine the prerequisites and terms for sharing data within and from the business sector . The Government w ill  present a white paper on the data -driven economy and innovation  establish a resource centre for data sharing , with expertise in the relation ship between law , technology , business and administrative processes  establish a set of principles for extracting and managing data from central registries , and a common API catalogue to promote better utilisation of basic data by providing an overview of data interfaces ( APIs )  consider policy instruments that can make it easier for industry sectors to shar e data and that simultaneously safeguard privacy and data protection , security , and business interests  give guidance to public agencies on how they can ensure access to data when entering into contracts by , for example , proposing standard clauses  conside r which areas it may be in the public interest to require that data from the business sector be made accessible , and examine whether requirements for data access in connection with licences might be a suitable policy instrument in this regard 19 2.2 Language data and language resources Language technology in the form of , for example , speech recognition and language comprehension , represents a key component in AI . Natural language processing ( NLP ) involves registering natural language ( text/audio ) and understanding the meaning and context . Natural language generation ( NLG ) involves producing text based on data . These technologies combined are important in the development of virtual assistants and in analyses based on unstructured data . To make systems like these accessible in written Norw egian and Sami and in dialects , the technology must be adapted to these languages and to local conditions . This requires language resources . Språkbanken , a service provided by the National Library of Norway , makes language data available for developing la nguage technology in Norwegian . The National Library of Norway and the Language Council of Norway will cooperate by coordinating their efforts to further develop the resources held in Språkbanken . They also have a responsibility to make sure that the publi c sector as buyer , and developer communities in both the public and private sectors , be informed about and request these language resources . The Sami languages are particularly vulnerable . Language technology and language technology resources in Sami are important for contributing to future development and use of the language and eventually for developing services in Sami based on artificial intelligence . Divvun and Giellatekno , the research group for Saami language technology at the Arctic University of N orway , are both developing different language technology tools for Sami . The Government will return to the issue of Sami language data and language resources in a white paper on Sami language , culture and society . The main topic of the white paper will be digitalisation . One of the challenges in the work on facilitating language technology in Norwegian and Sami is obtaining sufficient amounts of language data within different domains , such as medicine , ICT and transport . There is a need for both written an d oral data that covers dialects and pronunciation variations . Examples of useful resources include Analysis and classification of unstructured data in the MFA Every year , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ( MFA ) receives up to 6,000 reports from Norwegian embassies , delegations , etc . Previously it was extremely difficult to navigate all this information . Since the MFA adopted machine learning and NLP to analyse and classify the content of these documents , it has been possible t o find almost all relevant information on a given subject matter . The solution is also used to extract key information in reports and prepare summaries . In the work on developing this solution , the MFA cooperated with the University of Oslo , which provide d solutions for categorising the Norwegian language . The plan is to gradually expand the solution with information from archives and external research reports . Source : Ministry of Foreign Affairs 20 multilingual terminology lists , area -specific texts and speech recordings or parallel texts in different languages . The linguistic structures in text produced by the public sector constitute valuable data for language technology research and development . I t is important to facilitate reuse for these purposes . There is reason to believe that the public sector possesses far more data that could be used in developing language technology than it realises . The Government will there fore promot e awareness of language data and language resources in the public sector by , among other things , addressing such data specifically in the Digitalisation Circular . The Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation has strengthened the infor mation manageme nt resource centre in the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency in order to facilitate closer cooperation with the National Library and the Language Council of Norway . The agencies will cooperate on strategies to ensure that public language resources can be used for language technology purposes , guidance on what can be regarded as language resources and on ensuring deposits of language resources for Språkbanken . Language technology aids Tuva is an aid for dictating text ( speech recognition ) and navigating a PC using voice control . The product was developed by Max Manus in 2017 and is provided to people with permanent disabilities . The solution uses AI and builds on resources from Språkbanken . The dataset developed specially for this system is now openly accessi ble to other developers in Språkbanken . eTranslation is a machine translation service developed by the EU that can be used by the public sector in the EEA area . The functionality for Norwegian is built on translations by the Unit for EEA Translation Servic es in the M FA , translations by Semantix for public agencies and from standards translated by Standard Norway . Språkbanken makes the datasets accessible to developers and researchers . Source : Ministry of Culture The Government will  make a recommendation in the Digitalisation Circular that text produced by the public sector be made available for language technology purposes and deposited in S pråkbanken at the National Library and the national term bank .  formulate standard clauses for use in public -sector contracts in order to give the public sector rights to the language resourc es produced by translation services and other language -related services  present a white paper on language  continue cooperating with the University of Oslo on plain a nd digitalisation friendly legal language  present a white paper on Sami language , culture and society that focuses on digitalis ation 21 2.3 Regulations Norway has a tradition for modernising its legal framework to meet new technological developments , starting with the eRegulation project14 in 2000 . The aim is to make laws and regulations as technology -neutral as possible so that they can be applied even when new technologies and digitalisation change our society and the way we live . At the same time , we often see that regulation is called f or when new technologies give rise to problematic applications . We have seen examples of this with artificial intelligence in connection with electoral manipulation in social media and 'deep fakes ' . However , it is challenging – and often inexpedient – to regulate a technology that is still in an early phase . Regulating too early can have unintended consequences on developments , disrupt the market and reduce the potential for innovation . Moreover , any technology will often have both positive and negative app lications . The same underlying technology used to produce deep fakes can also be used to , for example , create synthetic data , a technology that helps protect personal data . Digitalisation -friendly regulations The Government wants the legal framework to reflect the opportunities and challenges that come with new technology , including artificial intelligence . It also wants regulations to be digitalisation friendly . Regulations ought to facilitate fully and partly automated administrative proceedings and not contain unnecessary discretionary provisions.15 Regulations suitable for automated administrative proceedings ought to be machine -readable so that they can be used AI -systems . There is a need to consider whether there are areas where regulations impose inexpedient and adverse limitations on the development and use of artificial intelligence . Among other things , there is a need to review laws that apply to some public agencies to see how the regulations can better facilitate sharing and using data and develo ping and using artificial intelligence . Such a process will require thoroughly reviewing sector -specific regulations and drawing on cross -sectoral expertise so that consideration is given to society 's needs , the individual 's right to privacy , and the tech nological possibilities . This work must be viewed in connection with the regulatory review aimed at removing barriers to digitalisation and innovation , as discussed in the Government 's digital strategy for the public sector . Areas that create particular ch allenges : Interoperability The fact that different sector -specific regulations use the same concepts in different ways can present challenges . Income , for example , does not mean the same in the Norwegian Tax Administration as it does in the Norwegian Labo ur and Welfare Administration ( NAV ) , and the concept of co-habitant is defined in a variety of ways in different regulations . The Government aims to achieve semantic interoperability in its 14 Ot.prp . nr . 108 ( 2000 -2001 ) Om lov om endringer i diverse lover for å fjerne hindringer for elektronisk kommunikasjon [ Draft resolution and bill to amend various acts in order to remove obstacles for electronic communication ] 15 Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation ( 2019 ) : One digital public sector . Digital strategy for the public sector 2019 –2025 22 legislation to make it easier to be read by machines and used for artificial intelligence . If concepts do not have the same meaning , it is important to have information on this to prevent the system from producing misleading results . Personal data : consent and statutory authority Personal data is covered by the Personal Data Act . The principle of purpose limitation means that the purpose for processing personal data must be clearly stated and established when the data is collected . This is fundamental to ensuring that individuals have control of their data and can give informed consent to data processing . Development and use of artificial intelligence often require different types of personal data ; data which in some cases was originally collected for other purposes . Moreover , processing of data – such as health data – may be subject to other regulations , such as the Health Registries Act . The most widespread way of gaining lawful access to personal data for use in AI is consent . Consent is often obtained by the users ' approving an end user agreement and consenting to dat a processing when they want to use a service . The agreement should state , among other things , how the entity will use the data collected and with whom it may be shared . It must also be possible to withdraw consent , and some services allow end users to admi nister how their personal data is used in more detail . The public sector often collects and processes personal data without the explicit consent of the user . In such cases , collection is based on a statutory provision that provides legal basis to collect and use data on citizens for specific purposes . Norway currently has no common system whereby citizens can see what information is collected and administered by the public sector , though solutions have been established in some important areas , such as helsenorge.no . Here users can administer which healthcare personnel may access their summary care record and clinical documents ; withdraw their consent to be registered in certain health registries ; and grant power of attorney to family members . Datasets that are based on consent will in most cases be incomplete or contain bias that may influence the outcome of any analyses performed on the data . This is an important reason for having central regist ries where registration is statutory and mandatory . When personal data is collected pursuant to a statutory provision , opportunities to use the data for purposes other than the original purpose are limited unless the new use is also permitted by a statuto ry provision . This means that public agencies have little scope to use the data they collect to perform analyses on their own activities using AI beyond the statutory authority provided for the relevant dataset . The Government wants to expand the scope for public agencies to use their data to develop and use AI . Regulatory challenges in the health area There may be a need to develop regulatory frameworks in some health -related areas before testing of methods based on AI takes place . Other areas are already safeguarded under existing regulations . For example , algorithms used in medical equipment software , such as surgical robots or software for enhancing or processing images in diagnostic imaging instruments , are subject to regulation of medical equipment . The Norwegian Medicines Agency provides guidance and supervises compliance with regulations governing such equipment in the Norwegian market . 23 Development and use of tools based on artificial intelligence are dependent on information from sources beyond the individual patients who receive health care in a specific case . Use of data for patient treatment a nd use of patient data for research purposes ( secondary use ) are currently regulated differently . The current regulations provide no clear legal basis for using health data pertaining to one patient to provide healthcare to the next patient unless the pati ent gives consent . However , exemption from the duty of confidentiality may be granted to use patient data for research purposes . Artificial intelligence challenges the distinction between research purposes and patient treatment because there is often a nee d to include patient data from research when AI -based tools developed in a research project are used to provide treatment . Exemption from the duty of confidentiality will no longer apply in such cases , and the use of personal data will no longer be legally permitted . In July 2019 the Ministry of Health and Care Services distributed a proposal for consultation regarding access to health data and other health -related data in health registries.16 The proposal concerns access to health data for use in statistic s , health analyses , research , quality improvement , planning , management and emergency preparedness in order to promote health , prevent disease and injury , and provide better health and care services . The Ministry of Health and Care Services is also consid ering amendments to regulations governing access to health data in connection with teaching and quality assurance . This work includes reviewing permission to use health data in decision support tools . Moreover , the Norwegian Directorate of Health , the Dire ctorate of eHealth and the Norwegian Medicines Agency have , in consultation with the regional health authorities , been tasked with identifying the opportunities and challenges posed by artificial intelligence and what adaptations in regulatory conditions a t national level night be needed . In the long term , more tasks which today are performed by healthcare personnel may be performed by autonomous systems and artificial intelligence . Relevant examples span from automatic generation of patient records , patie nt logistics and fleet management of the ambulance service to autonomous surgical robots . Although the scope of automation and autonomous tools will expand in the health sector , health personnel will still be responsible for ensuring proper provision of he althcare . Health analysis platform The Government will establish a health analysis platform , a national system for making health data accessible for research purposes and for other , secondary uses . The platform will allow more advanced analysis of Norwegian health data and will form the basis for new types of medical and health research . Among other things , it will allow health data to be used more actively in developing medicines and medical technology .

A regulatory sandbox is intended to give enterprises opportunities to test new technologies and/or business models within specific parameters . In this strategy the concept is used to refer to :  legislative amendments that allow trials , for example subject to application , usually within a limited geographical area or time period  more comprehensive measures in areas where close monitorin g and supervision is needed , usually by the relevant supervisory authority The concept of regulatory sandboxes is best known in the financial sector , where supervisory authorities in several countries have given enterprises opportunities to test specific products , technologies or services on a limited number of customers for a limited time period and under close monitoring . In December 2019 the Norwegian financial supervisory authority ( Finanstilsynet ) established a regulatory sandbox for financial technol ogy ( fintech ) . The purpose of the sandbox is to expand Finanstilsynet ’ s understanding of new technological solutions in financial markets , while at the same time expanding enterprises ' understanding of regulatory requirements and how they are applied to ne w business models , products and services . However , it makes little sense to talk about one regulatory sandbox for AI . AI solutions do not represent a homogeneous group of services , and are subject to a broad spectrum of regulations and regulatory authorit ies , depending on their purpose and functionality . The Government has already established regulatory sandboxes in the area of transportation , in the form of legislative amendments that allow testing activities . An act has been introduced allowing pilot pr ojects on autonomous vehicles . The act entered into force on 1 January 2018.17 The Norwegian maritime authorities established the first test bed for autonomous vessels as early as 2016 . A further two test beds have since been approved.18 In 2019 the Storting adopted a new Harbours and Fairways Act19 which , subject to application , permits autonomous coastal shipping . Such permission allows sailing in specific fairways subject to compulsory pilotage or in areas where no pilotage services are provided . Where pilot projects depart from applicable laws and regulations , they can be conducted with statutory authority in special laws , as in the examples mentioned , or in the Pilot Schemes in Public Administration Act . Under the Pilot Schemes , public administration can apply to the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation to depart from laws and regulations in order to test new ways of organising their activities or performing their tasks for a period of up to four years . In the white paper on innovation in the public sector we will consider whether the Pilot Schemes allows sufficient scope to test new solutions based on AI . 17 LOV -2017 -12-15-112 Lov om utprøving av selvkjørende kjøretøy [ Act relating to testing self -driving vehicles ] 18 Sjøfartsdirektoratet ( 2017 ) : Horten blir testområde for autonome skip [ Norwegian Maritime Authority ( 2017 ) : Horten to be test bed for autonomous ships ] . www.sdir.no/en/ 19 LOV -2019 -06-21-70 Lov om havner og farvann ( havne - og farvannsloven ) §25 [ Act relating to Harbours and Fairways , section 25 ] 25 Investment in autonomous ships The Norwegian shipping industry is at the forefront of developing and exploiting new technologies . Norway will have the world 's first commercially operated autonomous ship : Yara Birkeland . On commission from Yara , the Kongsberg Group is supplying equipment for the world 's first electric , zero -emissions , autonomous container ship . The ship will transport fertiliser from Yara 's factory on Herøya to the ports of Brevik and Larvik . The ship , which is due to be delivered in 2020 , will gradually move from manned operation to fully autonomous operation with remote monitoring in 2022 . The ship will replace a substantial volume of road haulage ( estimated at 40,000 truck journeys annually ) , emit fewer greenhouse gas emissions , improve local air quality and produce les s noise . In addition , NorgesGruppen ( ASKO ) has received funds from ENOVA ( NOK 119 million ) to establish an autonomous transport chain across the Oslo fjord , between Moss and Holmestrand . Two sea drones will then replace 150 daily ( approximately 50,000 ann ual ) truck journeys between Østfold and Vestfold . These all -electric , autonomous transport ferries are scheduled for commission in 2024 . Sources : Norwegian Maritime Authority/Yara and Enova The Government will establish a regulatory sandbox for data protection under the remit of the Norwegian Data Protection Authority . This will fulfil several purposes :  Enterprises can gain a better understanding of the regulatory requirements placed on data protection and reduce the time from development and testing to actually rolling out AI solutions to the market . Systems that are rolled out after being developed in t he sandbox can serve as leading examples , and can help other enterprises that are interested in developing similar systems .  The authorities can gain a better understanding of new technological solutions and more easily identify potential risks and problem s at an early stage so that guidance material can be produced to clarify how the regulations should be applied .  The authorities and industries can identify sectors with a need for their own industry standards .  Individuals and society as a whole will benef it from new and innovative solutions being developed within responsible parameters . The Government is positive towards developing new regulatory sandboxes in different areas . Responsibility for such regulatory sandboxes ought to lie with the communities best qualified to test new systems . In some areas , such as further development of smart cities and autonomous transport systems , it may be natural for this respon sibility to lie with local and regional authorities or other enterprises communities . 26 The I nformation Commissioner 's Office 's regulatory sandbox The Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) in the UK is testing a regulatory sandbox designed to support development of products and services that are innovative and widely beneficial . Organisations can have the way they use personal data in their systems reviewed and assessed . ICO can provide some comfort from enforcement action during the testing and development phases of their systems . ICO wants to work on products and services that are at the cutting edge of development and that operate in areas where there is genuine uncertainty about how regulations should be interpreted . Following an open application process , the ICO selected 10 organisations of varying types and sizes and from different sectors to be provided with free , professional guidance from I CO staff . One of the successful applicants is Heathrow Airport 's project to assess whether facial recognition technology can be used for checking in , security checks , self -service bag drops , etc . to create a frictionless journey through the airport . Anothe r project selected comes from TrustElevate , which is developing a model using AI for age -checking children and young people under 16 in connection with accessing social media . Source : The Norwegian Data Protection Authority Public Administration Act and Archival Act The reports published by the Law Commission on the Archival Act20 and by the Law Commission on the Public Administration Act21 will both have a bearing on public sector administrative proceedings and on the use of AI in public administration . Administrative proceedings in the public sector are highly regulated , though some degree of discretionary assessment may be exercised in the process . This means that a system does not have to be either manual or automated . It can have solutions where only e xceptional cases are processed manually or have processes where an executive officer must examine certain points in order to make an assessment , but where the rest of the process is automated and rule -based . Many public -sector administrative proceedings ar e already automated . There are case management systems with integrated application dialogue making it possible to make automated decisions immediately . A feature common to all of the current automated case management systems is that they are rule -based . T he regulations are programmed into the solution , making it possible to give reasons for the decisions made . The Public Administration Act requires grounds to be given for all decisions affecting individuals . This obligation to state grounds is important fo r safeguarding citizens ' opportunities to verify and check decisions made concerning them . 20 NOU 2019 : 9 Fra kalveskinn til datasjø – Ny lov om samfunnsdokumentasjon og arkiver [ Official Norwegian Report on a new Archiva l Act ] 21 NOU 2019 : 5 Ny forvaltningslov – Lov om saksbehandlingen i offentlig forvaltning ( forvaltningsloven ) . [ Official Norwegian Report on a new Public Administration Act ] 27 NOU 2019 : 5 Ny forvaltningslov [ New Public Administration Administration Act ] The Law Commission on the Public Administration Act was appointed in 2015 and submit ted its report in the spring of 2019 . A central element in the commission 's mandate was 'to draft an act that facilitates and builds on the fact that most administrative proceedings are performed , or will be performed , digitally ' . The commission points ou t that automat ed decision -making can generate substantial efficiency gains , particularly where case volumes are large . Auto mation can also promote equal treatment , given that everyone who is in the same situation , according to the system criteria , is automatically treated equally . Automation enables consistent implementation of regulations and can prevent unequal practice . Automated administrative proceedings can also enhance implementation of rights and obligatio ns ; for example , by automatically making decisions that grant benefits when the conditions are met . This can particularly benefit the most disadvantaged in society . More consistent imple men tation of obligations can lead to higher levels of compliance and to a per ception among citizens that most people contribute their share , which in turn can help build trust . Wherever there is a need to exercise discretion , rule -based systems can filter out cases or checkpoints for manual assessment . The commission points out that machine learning can offer new possibilities for automating assessment criteria . The majority of the commission proposes that statutory authority be provided in the regulations to allow administrative bodies in specific areas to make decisi ons using fully automated administrative proceedings . Decisions with a low impact on individuals may be made without providing statutory authority in regulations . The commission also proposes that the administrative body must document the legal content of automated decision -making systems . Such information should be made public unless laws , regulations or special considerations dictate otherwise . The Law Commission on the Public Administration Act sees the difficulty in implementing cohesive services witho ut sharing data across agencies . The absence of authority to share information can make it difficult to organise the public administration appropriately , and prevent full automation of administrative proceedings in areas that lend themselves to this . The c ommission therefore proposes that authority be given to share confidential information with other administrative bodies on a need -to-know basis . This constitutes a broader application than current laws . Source : NOU 2019 : 5 Ny forvaltningslov - Lov om saks behandlingen i offentlig forvaltning ( forvaltningsloven ) There is huge potential to increase the use of artificial intelligence in public -sector administrative proceedings in the form of both rule -based systems and machine learning . The Law Commission on the Public Administration Act emphasizes that automation can promote equal treatment and consistent implementation of regulations . Nonetheless , when case management systems containing AI elements are implemented , the algorithm 's judgement must be at least as sound and as trustworthy 28 as the human discretion it replaces . To ensure this , we need systems that are transparent and explainable . In its report , the Law Commission on the Archival Act points to the importance of ensur ing that AI -driven processes and decisions are documented and that the documentation is protected in ways that render it authentic and usable . Existing archiving procedures , archiving systems and archiving institutions in the public sector are currently not e quipped to address this challenge . The commission therefore recommends that consideration be given to how archiving functionality can be built into the administrative processes and to identify any specific aspects resulting from the use of artificial intel ligence . Artificial intelligence can also be used to achieve better , more efficient classification and sorting of information and thereby simplify and improve record -keeping and archiving practices in the future . The Government will  review and assess regulations that hamper appropriate and desired use of artificial intelligence in the public and private sectors  set requirements for transparency and accountability in new public administration systems in which AI is part of the solutio n  establish an advisory body and a regulatory sandbox in the area of privacy and data protection  be receptive to requests from public and private enterprises to establish more regulatory sandboxes  establish a health analysis platform to streamline and simp lify access to health data for research and analysis and simultaneously strengthen privacy and data protection  facilitate more active use of health data for testing the effects and safety of medicines and medical technology 29 2.4 Infrastructure : networks and computing power Deployment of the electronic communication networks The electronic communication networks , and the mobile communication networks in particular , are a cornerstone in the digital transformation of society . Norway has a well-developed fou rth-generation ( 4G ) mobile network with excellent coverage . There are plans to deploy a nationwide 5G network in the Norwegian mobile market by 2023.22 This will be important for leveraging the opportunities that lie in 5G technology and 5G networks , not le ast as an underlying technology for the Internet of Things ( IoT ) . IoT is a term often used to refer to the ever increasing amount of sensors connected to the internet . It can cover everything from mobile phones and private smart home solutions to sensors measuring air pollution , water quality , noise levels , and so on . The data can be used in predictive maintenance , decision processes and development of new business models . IoT solutions are already deployed in today 's 4G networks , but because 5G is faster than 4G , has better capacity and detect weaker signals , it will play a significant role in the development of IoT . Better capacity is particularly important in densely populated areas . 5G infrastructure will therefore be important for implementing a full -scale realisation of IoT with a capacity that can not be delivered by today 's technology . This will enable completely new applications in different sectors of society , such as transport , health and care , and smart cities . The mobile networks will be a vital enabling technology for AI , due not only to their role as a communication infrastructure but also to the vast amount of communication data generated by producing the services . Anonymis ed metadata from the mobile networks can be used as input in systems that use AI for analysis , improving the underlying data for decision -support , and processes controls . Such data is already commercially available from mobile network operators ( Telenor , T elia and Ice ) . Use of such data falls under a range of regulations , both sectoral laws and the Personal Data Act . The Government will monitor developments in this area and consider how to facilitate more use of this data . In the transport sector , deploymen t of the electronic communication networks , expansion of IoT technology and access to anonymised metadata from communication will represent key elements in leveraging the opportunities that lie in AI , such as :  self-driving and autonomous cars , buses , truc ks , drones , trains and ships  intelligent traffic management , controlling and influencing behaviour in traffic  early warning of the need to make replace ments and maintain infrastructure  prediction of travel behaviour  more advanced route optimisation 22 Telia ( 2019 ) : Telia skal bygge ut et nasjonal 5G -nett i løpet av 2023 [ Telia to deploy a national 5G network by the end of 2023 ] . Press release , 8 October 2019 30 Transport and communication infrastructure is also a key element in the development of smart cities and municipalities . Smart city solutions such as personalised health services , smart energy supply , and building management systems based on big data and AI will depend on fast and robust electronic communication networks . The Government wants to accelerate the pace of further broadband deployment . The draft legislation on broadband deployment includes measures to facilitate the common use of existing physic al infrastructure ; measures to ensure that developers of mobile and broadband networks receive information on , and can participate in , ongoing and planned building and construction projects ; and measures to ensure that developers receive information on exi sting physical infrastructure . The new act will require new buildings and buildings that undergo renovation to be made ready to connect to high -speed networks . The Government will present a white paper on electronic communication . High -performance comput ing ( HPC ) The amount of d ata in many areas of research and public administration is growing rapidly . In addition to experiments and theory development , calculations and data driven research have become important work methods for researchers . This creates a growing need not only for storing and accessing data , but also for the computing power to process th e data . Scientific calculations make it possible to analyse and identify new theoretical relationships in the vast datasets generated by , for example , gene tic sequencing , satellite observations or research vessels . Many research projects that process large datasets can use local resources or buy capacity from one of the large cloud service providers . If the chosen provider stores and processes data in compl iance with the General Data Protection Regulation , most unclassified data can be processed in cloud services . Use of cloud services from large commercial players like Google , Amazon and Microsoft offer more capacity ( for storage and computing power ) and va rious commercially available analytical tools . However , these services are often insufficient for processing large r datasets or data requiring large -scale parallel calculations . S uch s ituations call for larger computing resources , which are more cost -effective to establish at national or international level . UNINETT AS develops and operates Norway 's high -speed research and education network . UNINETT 'S subsidiary , UNINETT Sigma2 , is responsible for procuring , operating and maintaining national resources for HPC and data storage in Norway . For some research areas , such as astrophysics and marine research , the datasets are so large and require such high computing speeds that our national resources lack the necessary capacity . We are dependent on cooperation an d on buying capacity in international consortia . Such high -performance computing centres can have up to 100 times more capacity than the national resources . In 2017 the European Commission took the initiative to establish the European High Performance Com puting Joint Undertaking ( EuroPHC ) , which is jointly funded by the European Commission and national contributions . From 2021 Norway 's continued participation in EuroPHC will depend on Norway 's participation in the Horizon Europe framework programme and the Digital Europe Programme ( DEP ) . UNINETT Sigma2 is Norway 's national competence centre for high -performance computing in the EuroHPC partnership . 31 HPC produces vital knowledge about major societal challenges Life cycle assessments and mat erial flow analyses are key elements for gaining an overall picture of the environmental impacts of different products from cradle to grave . Such analyses demand large datasets and immense computing power . Combining data from the oceans with atmospheric me asurements will provide a better data source for climate modelling . Climate models require increasingly higher resolution in time and space , and thereby more calculations , if they are to provide the necessary local insights into how climate change will aff ect the risk of floods , land slides and extreme weather . Similarly , modelling of space weather will be essential for avoiding paralysis of critical infrastructure by severe solar storms . Health research has been revolutionised in recent years by genetic sequencing and advanced algorithms , which in turn have opened the door to personalised medicine and new advanced forms of treatment . These methods generate vast amounts of sensitive data that must be analysed by high -performance computers and stored in hig hly secure environments . Source : Ministry of Education and Research Some areas require high levels of cyber security while simultaneously allowing the data to be processed efficiently . Relevant examples are high -resolution MR images , DNA data , videos of patients and other sensitive data . Solutions for storing and processing such data are mainly provided through the Service for Sensitive Data ( TSD ) , which is operated and developed through collaboration between the University of Oslo and UNINETT Sigma2 . Norwegian data centres as a resource for AI Cloud services are fundamental for enabling enterprises to exploit the potential of AI technology . Cloud services provide access to computing power and frameworks for machine learning , which are not available locally . Many factors are driving the increase in data , among them IoT and the possibility to perform more and increasingly advanced analyses on complex data so urces . This increases the demand for storage and processing capacity 'in the cloud ' , which in turn increases the need to establish more data centres . The Government wants Norway to be perceived as an attractive host country for data centres and other data -driven industry . A national data centre strategy was published in 2018.23 Several measures laid out in the strategy , such as reduced electricity supply costs for data centres , removal of the 'machinery tax ' and a more straightforward site zoning process fo r data centres , have made Norway even more attractive to the data centre industry . Clean energy , good communications infrastructure and political and geological stability are other important arguments for choosing Norway as a host country for data centres . 23 Ministry of Trade , Industry and Fisheries ( 2018 ) : Powered by Nature – Norway as a data centre nation . Strategy 32 The number of data centres established in Norway has grown in recent years . Many Norwegian data centres have major international customers , and several large international cloud service providers have opted to establish their own data centres in Norway . W e are also witnessing a trend whereby customers – including international companies – are moving tasks that require large amounts of computing power to Norwegian data centres because they can offer scalable capacity based on renewable energy . This is a pos itive trend from a business perspective , and provides Norway 's business and public sectors with a wider choice of suppliers . It is particularly important for enterprises with stringent latency requirements or that process data that needs to be stored and p rocessed in Norway due to legal requirements ( e.g .

Policy instruments that stimulate investment in strong research communities , such as the centre schemes , will be important elements . The Go vernment wants Norwegian research communities to be attractive partners for leading AI enterprises and research communities through continued investment in basic and applied ICT research , good study programmes and competence building in AI through courses and further education programmes at all levels . 3 Developing and leveraging AI Norway will have advanced expertise in basic ICT research and AI research in order to understand and benefit from changes in technological developments . Norwegian communities will be attractive partners for leading business and research communities . Norway will invest in research and development in artificial intelligence within the long term priority areas in the Government 's long -term plan for research and higher education : seas and oceans , environment , environmentally friendly energy , health , public administration and civil protection . The EU framework programmes for research and innovation represents important arenas for cooperation and a n important source of funding for Norwegian enterprises and institutions . In the future , too , the aim is for national policy instruments to stimulate participation in and qualification for any European programmes Norway chooses to join . The EU framework pr ogrammes also open the door to cooperation with countries on other continents . Norway has entered into bilateral government agreements with selected countries to strengthen cooperation with strong research nations . The aim is to promote cooperation in prio rity areas , including AI . The Government 's goal is that investments in artificial intelligence within research , research -based innovation and development should be concentrated on strong 34 research communities where cooperation between academia and industry is central , such as in the centres of excellence and the centres for research -based innovation . Higher education programmes should correspond to needs for advanced expertise in the diffe rent sectors , both for competence in AI and in basic subjects such as statistics , mathematics and information technology . Overviews of courses and further education programmes in artificial intelligence will be readily available . In school , d igital skills , digital literacy and basic understanding of technology will be given prominence already at primary and lower secondary level . A basic introduction to artificial intelligence will be made available to the general population . 3.1 Research and higher educa tion Research There has been solid growth in research and development in ICT in recent years , with a nominal increase from NOK 8 billion in 2007 to NOK 18 billion in 2017 . Industry accounts for the largest share of R & D investment in ICT , and most of this comprises development activities . More recently , however ( 2015 –2017 ) , the strongest growth has been in the university and university college sector.24 Figure 3 : Consumption of ICT R & D Source : Statistics Norway and NIFO , R & D statistics . Research Council of Norway ( 2019 ) : Report on science and technology indicators for Norway In 2018 the Government allocated a total of NOK 9.9 billion to the Research Council of Norway , approximately NOK 1.4 billion of which was allocated to research , innovation and advanced applications of ICT . The Research Council of Norway has no programmes dealing specifically with AI , but AI has been one of several priorities in the IKTPLUSS initiative . Calculations from 2019 show that over 40 per cent of the Research 24 Research Council of Norway ( 2019 ) : Report on science and t echnology indicators for Norway 35 Council of Norway 's allocations to ICT was awarded to projects in AI , robotics and information management ( big data ) . This represents almost NOK 400 million . Between 2015 and 2019 allocations to these research areas totalled approximately NOK 1.3 billion , of which almost NOK 400 million was allocated to research infrastructure while over NOK 240 million was allocated to innovation projects in the industrial sec tor . AI , robotics and information management are also the ICT technology areas that grew most between 2015 and 2019 ( see Figure 4 ) . Other important ICT related R & D areas are data protection , security and risk . Figure 4 : R & D expenditure for different tech nology areas in the Research Council of Norway . Recorded expenditure of funds allocated by the Research Council of Norway 2015 –2018 and budgeted figures for 2019 . Source : Research Council of Norway The investment in AI is heavily influenced by the challe nges and opportunities that lie in applications , and projects that combine good AI research with advanced applications stand a strong chance of winning the competition for funding . The Research Council of Norway 's centre schemes The centre schemes are intended to support the best research communities and drive pioneering research and ground -breaking innovation or to strengthen priority areas . The centres for research -based innovation and the centres of excellence are two examples of such schemes . The ov erarching objectives of the centres for research based innovation are to enhance innovative ability and increase value creation in the Norwegian business sector through long -term research . 36 Norwegian AI Research Consortium ( NORA ) In 2018 a consortium was set up aimed at strengthening Norwegian research and education in artificial intelligence , machine learning , robotics and related disciplines . The consortium comprises Norwegian universities and research institutions engaged in research and education in ar tificial intelligence : the University of Agder , the Arctic University of Norway , OsloMet , the University of Bergen , the Norwegian University of Life Sciences , Simula Research Laboratory AS , the University of Stavanger , NORCE and the University of Oslo . Source : nora.ai BigInsight – Statistics for the knowledge economy and Sirius – Centre for Scalable Data Access are centres for research -based innovation that focus on AI -relevant technologies ( big data and data analysis ) . The Research Council of Norway is now witnessing a trend whereby most centres for research -based innovation have one or more activities related to artificial intelligence . Sirius is affiliated with the BigMed project , to which the Research Council of Norway has allocated NOK 60 million for personalised me dicine and use of large -scale data analysis in healthcare . Industrial PhD scheme Under the industrial PhD scheme , companies can get funding from the Research Council of Norway to allow an employee to undertake a PhD project in an area that is relevant to the company 's activities . The scheme enables companies to enhance their long -term research competence and innovation ability and to strengthen their collaborative relationship with academia . The scheme is a good alternative for companies in need of target ed research activities but with no possibility or capacity to initiate large -scale R & D projects . Figures from the Research Council of Norway show that artificial intelligence is the area of knowledge in ICT showing the strongest growth in the industrial Ph D scheme . The Government 's ambition for Norwegian AI research The Government considers Norway to be well placed to succeed with human -friendly and trustworthy AI , and with AI in industrial applications . Norway has a technologically advanced industry with the ability and will to adopt new solutions . Although large countries such as the United States and China have resources with which neither Norway nor Europe can compete , there are areas where Norway and Europe have competitive advantages , such as certain industrial applications of AI and trustworthy AI that takes data protection and ethical considerations into account . To ensure that Norway remains internationally competitive in areas where we have comparative advantages , it is important that AI research is integrated with investments in these areas . As a small country , Norway does not have the capability to build knowledge and expertise to high international standards across the full spectrum of AI . Nevertheless , the quality and scope of our national ex pertise must be sufficient to exploit the technologies and innovations that emerge internationally . Another goal must be to 37 leverage our position as a nation with a digitally advanced population and business sector in order to take the lead in applying AI , not least in industry . Our national research and study programmes in artificial intelligence must hold a high international standard . Artificial intelligence falls under one of the five long -term priorities in the Government 's long -term plan for research and higher education : enabling and industrial technologies . The Government is increasing allocations to this priority area through , among other things , the Technology Initiative escalation plan , which is one of the stated measures in the long -term plan . Private investments in AI research Wallenberg AI , Autonomous Systems and Software Program ( WASP ) Wallenberg AI , Autonomous Systems and Software Program ( WASP ) is a Swedish research institution funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation . WASP cooperates with Sweden 's five leading ICT universities . WASP focuses on two areas in AI : the main focus area covers machine learning , deep learning and next generati on AI ( explainable AI ) and the other focus area is the mathematical foundations of AI . WASP also aims to recruit outstanding international researchers and to enhance competence in Sweden and in Swedish industry by training at least 400 new PhD candidates , of which at least 100 should be industrial PhD candidates . WASP has a budget of SEK 3 billion up to and including 2026 . Norwegian Open AI Lab The Telenor -NTNU AI Lab was established at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology ( NTNU ) in 2017 after Telenor donated approximately NOK 50 million . The donation was made to help boost research , innovation and education in artificial intelligen ce , machine learning , big data analysis and IoT in Norway . In 2018 several business partners were included in the cooperation project , and the research centre changed its name to the Norwegian Open AI Lab . The new partners – DNB , DNV GL , Equinor and Kongsb erg – have donated funds towards general research at NTNU and to research where AI is a central component . The contributions from industry are donated primarily to fund researcher positions and professorships but also physical facilities and equipment that can be used by both researchers and students . These types of donations from industry strengthen relationships between the partner companies and the university . The connection to industry forms a better platform for exploiting the opportunities that lie i n artificial intelligence . This form of cooperation will , among other things , give students and researchers opportunities to work on authentic problems and datasets from industry , contributing to innovation and moving the frontier of AI research forward . Cooperation is continually being expanded to include new cooperation partners from research and industry . Sources : www.wasp -sweden.org and Norwegian Open AI Lab 38 It is also important that Norwegian research communities take full advantage of the opportunities offered by the EU framework programme , and that we leverage the opportunities that lie in our bilateral research and technology agreements with strong academic communities in leading research nations wor ldwide . Norway must be a trustworthy and attractive partner in international cooperation , networks and consortia dealing with research and education in artificial intelligence . A key research policy objective is to stimulate private investment in research .25 This includes stimulating private individuals and organisations to make donations to research . There are general policy instruments to support this : under the gift reinforcement programme , donations of at least NOK 3 million made to long -term , basic res earch can trigger a gift reinforcement from the state worth 25 per cent of the donated amount . This programme is administered by the Research Council of Norway . The Norwegian Tax Administration has a scheme under which deductions from taxable income may be granted for monetary donations made towards scientific research conducted by pre -approved organisations . Participation in EU programmes Norway has actively participated in the EU 's framework programmes for research and innovation for many decades . The Re search Council of Norway 's policy instruments should be designed in such a way that they stimulate and qualify for participation in the EU programmes . Artificial intelligence and high -perfor mance computing are areas where we are dependent on international cooperation . AI is included in several calls for proposals in Horizon 2020 , and will have an even more prominent place in the next EU framework programme , Horizon Europe . Investment in innovation will also be strengthened compared with the current period . The EU has proposed establishing a comprehensive digitalisation programme , Digital Europe Programme ( DEP ) , for the period 2021 –2027 . This is the first time the EU has proposed a programme dedicated specifically to digitalisation . The programme has a pr oposed budget of EUR 9.2 billion divided into five main areas : high -performance computing , artificial intelligence , cyber security , digital transformation and inter operability , and advanced digital skills . DEP is a core element in the European Commission ' s efforts in digital transformation . The programme targets areas where individual countries alone lack the necessary resources to succeed . The resources in the programme will be used in areas where they are expected to be most effective , such as health , justice , consumer protection and publi c administration . The programme also aims to help small and medium -sized enterprises to adapt to changes brought about by digitalisation and artificial intelligence . Norway has made a non -binding declaration of intent to participate in the next programme period for the research and innovation framework programme , Horizon Europe . This will give us the opportunity to participate in the strategic planning process . The Government is considering Norway ’ s possible participation in DEP . 25 Report to the Storting no . 4 ( 2018 –2019 ) Long -term Plan for Research and Higher Education and the Granavolden platform of 17 January 2019 39 Figure 5 : Priority areas in DEP Source : European Commission 2018 The Government will also facilitate participation by the business sector in the European Commission 's research , innovation and development programmes . This will give access to leading knowledge communities and mark ets . The Research Council of Norway and Innovation Norway have policy instruments for providing guidance and encouraging Norwegian actors to participate in EU programmes . The Research Council of Norway has taken the initiative to form a national network f or artificial intelligence . The objective is to promote Norway 's priorities and interests in the strategy work that takes place in the EU and to achieve greater participation by Norway in Horizon 2020 and Horizon Europe . The network will coordinate input f rom Norwegian research communities and give strategic advice concerning the Research Council of Norway 's focus areas . An important task for the network is to organise meeting places to promote contact , cooperation and knowledge dissemination between the re search communities and increased involvement by the business and public sectors . The network was established in the spring of 2019 and brings Norway 's leading AI communities together . Higher education The universities and university colleges have a high de gree of autonomy . They are responsible for following up the national sectoral goals for the university and university college sector , one of which is to facilitate good access to education . The institutions have responsibility for designing the study progr ammes . The Government can use various means to signal which areas it wants the institutions to give priority to ; for example , by allocating resources to study places earmarked for certain subject areas , such as nursing or cyber security . Since 2015 the Gov ernment has given particular priority to ICT -related programmes . Increased allocations to these programmes allow almost 1,600 more students admission to ICT -related studies every year . 40 Subjects that can be classified as artificial intelligence are part of several study programmes , but are most common in programmes in information technology and cybernetics/robotics . In these programmes – at both bachelor and master level – students may , to varying extents , choose courses in AI or decide to specialise in AI by both choosing AI -relevant subjects and writing their bachelor or master 's thesis in that subject area . Typical s ubjects in these types of study programmes are : algorithms , machine learning , computer vision , deep learning and big data analysis . Some educational institutions also offer dedicated programmes in AI , but up to now these programmes could offer relatively few study places . Since 2018 , however , we see that a growing number of educational institutions are offering separate programmes in AI at both bachelor and master level . Institutions already offering such programmes are expanding the number of study places . More than 350 new study places dedicated to AI , robotics and data science are planned from 2020 , compared to 2017 . More than 400 m aster degree candidates with a clear AI profile are estimated to have graduated every year from 2016 to 2019 . These were candidates from study programmes dedicated to AI and candidates whose choice of course and thesis define them as 'AI candidates'.26 The majority of these students graduated from the University of Oslo and NTNU . In addition , just over 300 bachelor candidates graduate every year with AI profiles . Some of them pursue master programmes in the same subject area . Informal learning arenas : Eik idéverksted Eik idéverksted is a makerspace for technological innovation . The makerspace is a cooperation project between the Norwegian University of Life Sciences ( NMBU ) , Inkubator Ås , the Savings Bank Foundation DNB and the SpareBank 1 Foundation . Eik idéverksted offers a range of courses , workshops , seminars and projects to students and employees at N MBU . The aim is to serve as an active meeting place that is open to the academic , student , local and business communities . Many of the students who partici pate in Eik idéverksted learn to use AI tools at quite advanced levels , even though they do not necessarily have the same in depth knowledge and academic background as students taking formal courses in AI . AI is becoming increasingly accessible because com panies like Google and Facebook offer low -threshold tools in areas such as image processing , natural language processing , prediction , and so on . Sources : Norwegian University of Life Sciences ( NMBU ) , eikide.org 26 Data on , among other things , the number of students and the number of candidates which the institutions report to the Database for Statistics on Higher Education are not tagged to such a level of detail as to enable retrieval of reliable figures on programmes in AI . To gain a picture of the current situation , the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation therefore asked the educational institutions to count t he number of candidates who graduated from study programmes in AI and the number of candidates with an 'AI profile ' . The enquiry regarding the numbers of study places and graduated candidates in AI was sent to all the universities as well as to Østfold Un iversity College , Western Norway University of Applied Sciences , Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences , and Kristiania University College . All of them submitted reports . As well as reporting the number of study places and the number of candidates wh o took examinations at bachelor , master and PhD levels in AI , they also reported on new study programmes in AI and on increases in the number of study places in existing AI programmes . The institutions may have used different definitions of what constitute s an 'AI profile ' or an 'AI programme ' and thus which candidates were counted . 41 Development of study programmes in AI The Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences at the University of Oslo hosts a centre of excellence , the Centre for Computing in Science Education ( CSSE ) , which makes an important contribution to further developing study programmes in AI . The faculty , through CCSE and the Centre for Teaching and Learning in Science and Technology ( KURT ) , offers comprehensive continuing education to schoolteachers in order to integrate programming into school subjects . This is done through the ProFag programming course for schoolteachers . What subjects are taught in schools is a key factor in raising the level of higher education in artificial intelligence , including machine learning , robotics and data science . Source : University of Oslo The number of PhD degrees in topics that can be defined as artificial intelligence is also steadily growing . Moreover , methods from artificial intelligence are increasingly used as tools by PhD candidates and researchers in other areas . As well as seeking candidates with specific training in AI and data science , business and industry is also interested in candidates with sound knowledge in information technology , mathematics and statistics . Candidates like these will possess the necessary prerequis ites for understanding and learning more about AI , either through formal education or through training in the workplace . Need for interdisciplinarity Knowledge of artificial intelligence , and related fields such as ethics and data protection associated wit h AI applications , will be important in study programmes oriented towards the educational sector , health , crime prevention , law and several other fields . For example , an introductory course in artificial intelligence has been established at the University of Bergen , in which students of medicine and bioengineering learn about how AI can be used in clinical practice . One of the aims is to promote interdisciplinary cooperation between physicians and engineers . The universities of Bergen and Oslo also offer co urses in artificial intelligence and machine learning oriented towards social scientists . Institutions of higher education ought to evaluate how topics with relevance to artificial intelligence can be integrated into their programmes in areas that will be affected by artificial intelligence in the coming years . Need for knowledge about study programmes with relevance to artificial intelligence During the work on preparing this strategy , it has become clear that official statistics on higher education are not sufficiently detailed to provide reliable information about the scope of the different study programmes needed to succeed with artificial intelligence in Norway . This knowledge base must therefore be strengthened . The EU is also working on models that can produce better knowledge on this issue , based on official statistics and existing databases . Norway is engaged in this work , and will evalu ate whether new measurements can be based on these models . 42 The Government will  strengthen basic ICT research through the Research Council of Norway  complete implementation of the Technology Initiative escalation plan laid out in Report to the Storting no . 4 ( 2018 –2019 ) Long -term plan for research and higher education 2019 –2028  consider Norwegian participation in relevant EU programmes in the next programme period  take an initiative to encourage research cooperation with the private sector , inspired by the Wallenberg AI , Autonomous Systems and Software Program ( WASP ) in Sweden  set clear expectations for educational institutions to design and adapt thei r study programmes in AI to meet anticipated needs in the labour market and to integrate AI into established study programmes where relevant  establish a knowledge base that makes it possible to monitor trends in study places and candidates in AI 43 3.2 Skills The Government wants digital skills and technology literacy to be given more prominence already at primary and lower secondary school level . Under The Curriculum Renewal ,27 natural science will be made a more exploratory and practical subject already at p rimary school level , with a distinct technology element that also includes programming . Programming will be introduced in more subjects ; among other things , programming and computational thinking skills will be included in the new mathematics subject . The new curricula will come into effect in 2020 . It will take a long time before the children starting school in the autumn of 2020 complete their education and are ready to start work or take further studies , perhaps in technology or artificial intelligence . In the meantime there will be a need to manage the new skill requirements expected of today 's adult population in both their private and working lives . Courses and further education programmes An analysis from 2015 estimated a high probability that 33 pe r cent of jobs in Norway would be automated over the next 20 years . These figures have subsequently been modified , and a 2018 report from the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development ( OECD ) 28 estimated that only 6 per cent of jobs in Norway were at risk of automation . This figure is the lowest of all OECD member countries . It also emerged that Norwegian employees – both those with and those without higher education – were among those who receiv e most training in the workplace . NAV 's Horizon Scan29 deals with the most important societal trends that will affect the future labour market . It shows that the pace of change in the labour market will accelerate . OECD estimates that every fourth job will undergo major changes . Technological developments will likely lead to many new jobs , but will just as likely lead to employees having to change jobs , change the formal relationship they have with employers , and update their skills more often . Opportunitie s for upskilling and reskilling – both in the workplace and through study programmes – will therefore become increasingly important . Development and use of artificial intelligence make up part of this picture . Like elsewhere , technological developments in artificial intelligence are bringing about changes in many jobs ; some work tasks will disappear , while tasks that require other skill types will emerge . Meanwhile , ever fewer jobs will require little or no formal skills . The Government considers it import ant that people who already have jobs be given opportunities to take courses and further education . In 2020 the Government will present a white paper on a skills reform for lifelong learning ( Lære hele livet ) . The objectives of the skills reform are that n o one should be left behind and that more employees should remain longer in their jobs . 27 The Curriculum Renewal refers to the work on renewing all the curricula in primary and lower secondary education and in upper secondary education . The new curricula will come into effect at the start of the school year in 2020 28 Nedelkoska , L. and Quintini , G.

Report 1 2019 44 AI for everyone : Elements of AI Elements of AI is a series of free online courses in artificial intelligence . The course was developed in the spring of 2018 by the Finnish company Reaktor , its Norwegian sister company Feed and the University of Helsinki . The aim of the course is to teach as many as possible about what AI is , what it can and can not be used for , and how to start using methods based on AI . The course co mbines theory with practical exercises , and requires no prior knowledge . Elements of AI has quickly become extremely popular , and ranks top in several overviews of massive open online courses ( MOOCs ) . Eighteen months after it was launched , more than 230,00 0 people had registered to take the course , of which 15 to 20 per cent have completed all the modules . The course has attracted much larger proportions of female students ( 40 per cent ) and students aged over 45 ( 30 per cent ) than is normally the case for ICT courses . In Sweden and Finland the proportion of female students taking the course is more than 50 per cent . Since Elements of AI was launched , the University of Helsinki , which is the host university , has seen increases in the number of ordinary appli cants to ICT programmes and in the proportion of female applicants . A key factor in motivating people to complete the course is the # AIChallenge . The # AIChallenge encourages companies and public agencies to commit to supporting their employees to complete Elements of AI . By the autumn of 2019 more than 450 Finnish and Swedish organisations had taken up the challenge , among them Telia , Nokia , Systembolaget , Nordea , Bonnier , Swedish Tax Agency and Volvo . Elements of AI will be launched in Norwegian in coope ration with NTNU in 2020 . Source : Feed/Reaktor Employers must ensure that their employees possess the necessary skills . This includes assessing the need for continuing and further education . Individual employees must also take responsibility for their own skills development in a labour market with ever increasing requirements . Nonetheless , some skill needs may not be met , and the public sector ought to find new ways of addressing these . To help enterprises meet new skill needs that arise , the Government has established a range of schemes that support t he development and operation of flexible further education programmes . Several programmes in digital skills have already been established as a result of cooperation between universities , university colleges or tertiary vocational colleges and the labour ma rket . The idea is to enable people to undertake this type of further education while they are employed . From 2020 the Government will reinforce these efforts through a new Skills Programme and through increased allocations to a competition -based scheme adm inistered by the Norwegian Agency for International Cooperation and Quality Enhancement in Higher Education ( Diku ) . The target group for the programmes developed with funding from these schemes are employees who need new skills due to restructuring needs c reated by digitalisation and the transition to a green s ociety . 45 Workplace training Norway has positive experiences with handling restructuring in the labour market due to various changes.30 Norwegian employees are good at adapting , and cooperation between employee organisations , employer organisations and the authorities is good . This may be one of the reasons why Norwegian employee organisations tend to seek dialogue on how employees and emp loyers can work together to meet the coming challenges rather than focus their concerns on the potential negative consequences of AI for jobs and work tasks . Several large enterprises have launched their own further education programmes in AI and data ana lysis . For example , DNB bank has offered its employees opportunities to train as data scientists in order to meet the bank 's need for competence in this area . The Government is also cooperating with the employee and employer organisations on an industry p rogramme for the municipal care sector and an industry programme for industry and construction . The costs of the industry programmes are shared among the state , which pays for developing and operating the programmes ; the enterprises , which invest their own resources ; and the employees , who invest some of their free time . The industry programmes will also be included in the Skills Programme in 2020 , and work on the programmes will be strengthened and further developed in cooperation between the partners . Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund : testing AI as a training measure When the Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund ( Lånekassen ) was introducing a new collaboration platform in 2017 , it wanted to find out whether an AI chatbot could make training users of the platform more effective . Lånekassen decided to use a technology s upplied by the Norwegian company Boost.ai , a market leader in conversational AI . Because testing the chatbot involved all Lånekassen employees , they all gained insight into what a chatbot is and how it is trained . After two weeks , Lånekassen 's employees h ad performed close to 1,500 chats with the robot . The system made an important contribution to the launch of the collaboration platform , as well as illustrating how use of AI created an opportunity to involve a whole organisation . This measure is an exampl e of successful public – private cooperation on using new technology and modern development methodology . The test project has also provided experience transfer for other public agencies such as Vy , NAV and the Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Manage ment ( DFØ ) .

Report 1 2019 46 Student projects as a measure to access new skills and for recruitment The Norwegian Tax Administration has in recent years hosted summer projects using AI , such as Pattern Recognition in Cryptocurrency and AI -assisted Tax Returns . The objective of these projects is to test new technologies . Participants are recruited from technology study programmes in AI , machine learning , programming and statistical methods , among others . The projects not only provide the Norwegian Tax Administration with an op portunity to conduct interesting pilot projects in relevant areas ; they also give the agency the chance to present itself as a potential workplace for students who will be highly sought -after in the labour market once they graduate .

The Government will evaluate how industrial policy instruments can best be designed to support potential value creation and u se of AI in the business sector . Public agencies ought to actively explore the potential of the technology , and increased interaction between the public sector and the business sector should promote innovation and value creation . 4 Enhancing innovation capacity using AI Norway can take a leading position in applying artificial intelligence , particularly in areas where we already are well posi tioned and have strong business and research communities , such as health , oil and gas , energy , the maritime and marine industries and the public sector . The foundation we lay in the form of access to good infrastructure , data sharing , research and competen ce building will also provide a good starting point for increased innovation and value creation for small but technologically advanced companies . The largest public agencies already serve as a driving force in AI by actively exploring the potential that l ies in this technology . The Government will facilitate s haring of best practice across sectors and enterprises . Increased interaction and cooperation between the public and business sectors , and between research communities and the business sector , are vital to unlocking the innovative potential of applying artificial intelligence in the form of both established and new models of cooperation . 48 The public sector ought to actively explore opportunities in the market in connection with procurements , and inn ovative public procurements should be used wherever appropriate . To facilitate innovative solutions , agencies ought to focus on the ir needs rather than on specific products or services . 4.1 Industrial policy instruments The authorities play an important r ole in facilitating business development , also with regard to AI . However , the business sector also has a responsibility to develop and adopt technologies that can create better , more profitable services or more efficient operations . The underlying assumption is that companies and enterprises invest less in research and development than what is profitable for society as a whole . As part of Norway 's research and innovation system , public authorities therefore facilitate innovation throu gh grants and other schemes administered by the system of policy instruments for research and innovation . Several policy instruments currently available promote research in , and development , testing and commercialisation of , artificial intelligence . Suppo rt for the early phase , where more emphasis is placed on research and research based innovation , is usually provided through the Research Council of Norway . Innovation Norway has a responsibility to promote innovation , value creation and growth in business and industry through , among other things , financial contributions and expertise . In recent years Innovation Norway has arranged the Tech City Executive Accelerator ( TEA ) initiative for companies oriented towards AI and IoT . The aim is to make executives i n expanding Norwegian companies aware of the opportunities for leveraging AI and I oT . TEA is based in London . The Industrial Development Corporation of Norway ( S iva ) facilitates innovation through infrastructure such as business gardens , incubators and in itiatives such as the Norwegian Catapult scheme . Investinor is a state -owned venture investment company whose purpose is to improve access to capital in the early -stage market ( the market for investment capital for companies in the process of developing ne w products or processes ) . Export credit and guarantee schemes help Norwegian businesses enhance their competitiveness in the international market . Innovation project : Machine learning in seismology Earth Science Analytics AS leads an industry innovation project that receives funding via the Research Council of Norway 's PETROMAKS 2 programme Machine Learning in Geoscience . The project shows how digitalisation and artificial intelligence are in the pro cess of transforming the seismic industry . Today geologists spend around 70 per cent of their time on seismic interpretation . Artificial intelligence could automate some parts of the interpretation process . This would make retrieving relevant information from seismic data far easier and more efficient . The technology can also be combined with tools for analysing well data . This will help the oil companies make better decisions based on large amounts of reliable data . Source : Ministry of Petroleum and Energy 49 Digital21 Digital21 is a strategy developed by and for businesses . The goal has been to make recommendations to the authorities on how businesses can better develop and benefit from competence , technology , research and development in order to succ eed in digitalisation . An important message in the strategy is that Norway can not be best at everything , and should therefore give priority to the technology areas where Norwegian business and industry can profit most . Digital21 highlights artificial intel ligence , big data , the Internet of Things and autonomous systems as particularly important technologies for Norway in the time ahead . Sourc e : digital21.no Some countries have introduced grant schemes for businesses that start up AI projects . In Sweden , for example , Vinnova has established a scheme to which companies and public enterprises can apply for grants of up to SEK 500,000 to start up their first AI project . Norway has no schemes specifically for R & D in AI ; instead we have a broader scheme , SkatteFUNN , through which Norwegian companies can apply for tax deductions on R & D costs . SkatteFUNN is a rights -based scheme with simple application processes and reporting requirements . Forskerpool [ Researcher Pool ] is a scheme affiliated to SkatteFUNN to which businesses can apply for up to 50 hours of assistance from a researcher to develop an idea or get feedback on a problem . This scheme may be particularly relevant for SMEs , which often lack th is type of in -house expertise . In AI , where there is a shortage of personnel with advanced skills , schemes like these where resources are shared can help more companies gain access to the expertise they need to start their projects or pilots . Business clu sters represent a policy instrument that can be suitable for promoting business development in AI . Innovation Norway , the Research Council of Norway , and Siva currently fund a cluster programme . The business community takes on the roles of leading and coor dinating the business clusters , but research institutions and public agencies are often members . Cluster for applied AI In Halden , eSmart Systems , the Institute for Energy Technology ( IFE ) , Østfold University College and the research and innovation company Smart Innovation Norway have taken the initiative to develop a new cluster , the Cluster for Applied AI . The ambition is to create an optimal platform for developing Norwegian companies ' international competitiveness and sustainable social development through applied AI . The purpose of the cluster is to create new jobs and sustainable development based on rapid development and application of AI . Key focus areas will be technological development , commercialisation , ethics , security and accessibility . The cluster will facilitate the sharing of data , infrastructure and other technologies that its members would otherwise be unab le to invest in .

DigitalNorway cooperates with research and educational institutions , business clusters and several of Norway 's best compe tence and innovation communities . Among other things , the organisation provides tools for companies that want to make the transition from idea to product or service , and networks for sharing knowledge and experiences . The Conversion Engine service helps c ompanies build their in -house expertise in digitalisation and advanced production . Together with Smart Innovation Norway , NCE iKuben and NCE Kongsberg Innovasjon , DigitalNorway leads the work on the Conversion Engine for digitalisation while NCE Raufoss ha s corresponding responsibility for manufacturing/ advanced production . The aim is to help small and medium -sized enterprises throughout the country succeed in their digital transformation . Innovation Norway supports the programme . Source : DigitalNorway There are also good examples of the business sector launching its own initiatives . Measures such as the AI Village in Trondheim , where several companies have joined forces to leverage synergies and create a stronger community , are good examples of how coo peration within the business sector can produce positive effects . Review of the system of policy instruments In 2018 the Government launched a comprehensive review of the system of business policy instruments.31 The purpose is for Norway to derive maximum value creation and economically sustainable jobs within sustainable parameters from the resources that are channelled through the system of policy instruments . EU policy instruments for AI targeting SMEs : Digital Innovation Hubs Digital Innovation Hubs ( DIHs ) is a policy instrument that was launched by the European Commission in 2016 to help small and medium -sized enterprises ( SMEs ) to digitalise faster . The first generation of DIHs was created under Horizon 202 0 . Four Norwegian DIHs have been set up , affiliated with GCE NODE in Agder , SINTEF , Oslo Cancer Cluster and Digital Norway , all of which are active enablers for SMEs . In the transition to the new EU programmes for 2021 –2027 , a new generation of larger and more binding DIHs will be introduced . These will be one -stop shops , and will cover an ecosystem ( national and international ) that can offer expertise and competence and contribute to enabling SMEs in particular to become digital and leverage the potential of artificial intelligence . Funding for the projects will come from the Digital Europe Programme , among others . The DIH programme and Norway 's catapult scheme share some common features . The Government has established Norwegian Catapult , a scheme that gives Norwegian industry access to test facilities in order to enhance innovation and value creation . 31 Updated information on the review of the system of business -oriented policy ins truments is available ( in Norwegian ) at www.regjeringen.no/vmg 51 NOK 125 million was allocated to the scheme in the 2019 national budget . Siva has given priority to further developing the catapult scheme in 2019 , in cooperation with Innovation Norway and the Research Council of Norway . In Norway the clusters will be key participants in the DIHs that are set up . One important task for the system of policy instruments will be to further develop complementarity between the hubs , the cluster programme and the catapult scheme . Intellectual property rights Protecting intellectual property rights is important for ensuring that the AI market develops in the right way . Any uncertainty about ownership of the various elements that make up solutions based on AI ( data , development framework , pre -trained algorithms , etc . ) , how they are licensed or how access to the solutions is paid for , will have negative impacts . The Government wants Norwegian companies to make informed and competent decisions regarding protection , use and enforcement of their intellectual assets and rights , and to have a professional and conscious approach to the way they handle the rights of others . Norwegian companies should secure the increased market access and value creation which professional protection and use of copyright law can afford them . Protecting their ownership rights can be particularly decisive in connection with internationalisation . The Ministry of Trade , Industry and Fisheries has begun mapping competence levels and needs in the area of intellectual property rights in Norwegian industry , and will assess whether the guidance offered on the system of policy instruments is adequate . Public agencies can find it particularly difficult to know how to deal with rights when development of an AI -based solution is conducted through cooperation between the public sector and a private company : for example , how should a public agency handle ownership and user rights in a partnership where a commercial party develops and trains algorithms using the public agency 's data ? This type of issue will likely arise in the future , and perhaps especially so in connection with using health data for commerci al purposes . One important exception here , of course , is open data , which may freely be used by both commercial and public actors , pursuant to the Norwegian Licence for Open Government Data ( NLOD ) or under a Creative Commons licence . Google DeepMind and the National Health Service ( NHS ) in the UK In the UK the National Health Service ( Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Trust ) has cooperated with Google DeepMind on developing an algorithm that can identify eye diseases based on images of the eye . The agreeme nt makes DeepMind the owner of the final system but entitles Moorfields to the right to use it free of charge for a given number of years after it is approved for clinical use . Source : Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Trust 52 Standardisation Norway can contribute to ensuring that artificial intelligence develops in the desired direction by exerting influence on international standards related to AI . Such influence is exerted by participating in international standardisation activities and by c hairing working groups in areas that are important for us . At global level , AI activities are conducted in the standardisation organisations ISO and EIC and at European level in CEN and CENELEC . It is most often the large companies that take an active part in standardisation activities . The threshold for participating in this type of activity can be high for many SMEs for various reasons , such as travel costs or the time involved . Standard Norway has created a mirror committee ( SN/K 586 Kunstig Intelligens ) to follow up international standardisation activities in AI . The committee is composed of representatives from research , business and industry , national authorities and various interest organisations . The Government will  work towards enabling the D igital Innovation Hubs to help SMEs get started on applying AI  engage in dialogue with Digital Norway on how it can enable SMEs to take more advantage of the potential of AI  promote the work on international standardisation activities related to AI , particularly with regard to stimulating SMEs to participate in these activities  develop guidelines , including proposals for standard agreement clauses , on how public agencies should deal with ownership rights when cooperating with the business sector on de veloping artificial intelligence 53 4.2 AI-based innovation in the public sector The Government believes there is vast potential for the public sector to rationalise and create better services through digitalisation . Artificial intelligence is one aspect of this . In the future the public sector will use artificial intelligence to deliver more targeted and user -adapted services , enhance the social benefit of its own activities , rationalise operations and work processes , and reduce risk . Artificial intelligenc e in the public sector can contribute to :  more relevant advice and services to citizens in different situations in life  better decision -making support for public -sector employees  rationalising processes and optimising resource utilisation  improving the qu ality of processes and services by automatically detecting possible deviations  predicting trends based on data from both agencies and their environments  natural language processing for sorting and categorising , and for translating between different langua ges and language forms Use of AI in the public sector is still in an early phase , however . A survey32 shows that many agencies are still in the planning or testing phase , where they try to find out what AI can be used for . Some agencies have begun testing through proofs of concepts . The survey shows that more than half of the agencies regards organisational culture , legal and regulatory issues , and data protection and security as the major challenges with respect to AI . Lack of competence is highlighted as another challenge . For example , agencies can find it difficult to assess which areas are suitable for AI . One area that raises several dilemmas is the use of AI for control purposes . Such controls can involve , for example , identifying individuals who may b e violating regulations ( that is to say where an algorithm identifies a high probability for this ) . For applications like these , consideration must be given to rule of law and protection against self-incrimi nation for individuals subjected to regulatory c hecks . The risk and consequences of false positives – i.e. , of someone being wrongly identified and of the undue hardship this would impose on them – must be part of a data protection impact assessment , which must be included when a solution is under evalu ation . Such assessments related to the use of AI in public administration can prove challenging , particularly if the agency lacks the relevant in -house expertise . Uncertainty over regulations for processing personal data , relevance to the Public Administr ation Act or assessments of when it is acceptable to use A I may make agencies unduly reticent . This may deprive the public sector of important opportunities to improve its services or rationalise its processes . The Government will therefore ask the Norwegi an Digitalisation Agency to prepare guidance on this matter , in cooperation with the Norwegian Data Protection Authority . 32 Broomfield , Heather and Reutter , Lisa ( 2019 ) : Kunstig intelligens/data science : En kartlegging av status , utfordringer og behov i norsk offentlig sektor Første resultater . [ Artifical intelligence/data science : A mapping of status , challenges and needs in Norway 's public sector . Initial results ] . September 2019 54 Projects using AI in public administration The Government wants public sector organisations to facilitate experimenting with artificial intelligence to gain knowledge about and experience in the technology . Trial projects or pilots in AI will provide valuable experience that can be used when evaluating large -scale projects and can enhance unders tanding of the technology at all levels in the organisation . Artificial intelligence is one of many important tools for developing sustainable public administration in both central government and the municipal sector . Cooperation and exchange of best prac tice across organisations will contribute to better insights into AI , and experiences gained by the large agencies , which often have their own IT and analysis units , can help smaller organisations get started on AI projects . The municipal sector is in a unique position when it comes to potential cooperation , because all municipalities have an obligation to provide the same services to their inhabitants , which means they hold datasets covering the same areas . The possibility to share best practice and to cooperate on procurements and training measures may therefore be particularly important for the municipalities . Cooperation on data , algorithms and competence in AI may also create possibilities to see interrelationships across sectors . Examples of projects using AI in the public sector Several public agencies have conducted projects in which they have used artificial intelligence : Artificial intelligence in residence verification The Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund ( Lånekassen ) has conducted a project using artificial intelligence to select students for residence verification . In 2018 Lånekassen ’ s residential verification process covered 25,000 students , of which 15,000 were selected using artificial intelligence ( machine learning ) and 10,000 were selected randomly ( control group ) . The results showed that the selection made using machine learning was twice as effective at identifying students who had not documente d previously submitted residence information compared to the control group . Automatic posting of invoices Customers of The Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Management ( DFØ ) spend considerable time and resources on posting incoming invoices due to uncertainty about the correct posting . In some cases this can lead to invoices being paid after the due date and can create extra costs for the agency in the form of interest and charges . DFØ is currently testing solutions from two companies , one of which involves an accounting robot that uses AI to propose the correct posting . The model is trained using historical data before making a prediction of the posting based on a combination of historical data and information obtained from the actual invoice . Sources : Norwegian State Educational Loan Fund and Norwegian Government Agency for Financial Management The Government will  develop guidance on responsible use of artificial intelligence in public administration  facilitate cooperation and exchange of experience and best practice for AI in both central and municipal administration  establish a new programme for interaction between startups and the public sector  present a white paper on innovation in the public sec tor The Government will therefore ask the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency to facilitate cooperation in AI for example by establishing common use cases/user journeys and sharing of best practice . Public -private partnerships Norway 's public sector procures goods and services worth more than NOK 500 billion annually . These procurements can be used to promote innovation and use of new technologies . A study condu cted by Menon33 shows that most public procurement processes are conducted without any market dialogue and without encouraging suppliers to supply systems that are radically new and innovative . The companies report that young , innovative companies in partic ular find it difficult to know what they need to do to win contracts . An innovation partnership is a procurement procedure that facilitates product and service development through cooperation between buyers and developers/suppliers . Innovation partnerships are used for procuring solutions that are not currently available in the market . Preliminary experiences show that startups and technology companies win assignments in innovation partnerships more easily than in other public tendering processes . One of t he measures in the Government 's digital strategy34 is to establish a programme for increased interaction between the public sector and start -up companies , modelled on similar programmes in the United States and the United Kingdom . Such a programme would als o benefit companies whose activities are based on artificial intelligence . 33 Menon Economics ( 2017 ) : Midtveisevaluering av nasjonalt program for leverandørutvikling [ Midway evaluation of the National Programme for Supplier Development ] 34 Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation ( 2017 ) : One digital public sector . Digital strategy for the public sector 2019 –2025 « Ghosthouse » , h.o . ( INT ) Photo : Ars Electronica/ Martin Hieslmair The Government wants Norway to lead the way in developing and using AI with respect for individual rights and freedoms . In Norway , artificial intelligence will be based on ethical principles , respect for privacy and data protection , and good cyber security . 5 Trustworthy AI Norway is known for the high level of trust citizens have in each other and in public and private institutions . The Government wants to maintain and strengthen this trust at the same time as artificial intelligence is adopted in new and innovative ways . The Government believes that :  artificial intelligenc e that is developed and used in Norway should be built on ethical principles and respect human rights and democracy  research , development and use of artificial intelligence in Norway should promote responsible and trustworthy AI  development and use of AI in Norway should safeguard the integrity and privacy of the individual  cyber security should be built into the development , operation and administration of AI solutions  supervisory authorities should oversee that AI systems in their areas of supervision ar e operated in accordance with the principles for responsible and trustworthy use of AI 57 5.1 Issues related to artificial intelligence Developing and using artificial intelligence can create challenges and raise many complex questions . This particularly applies to AI that builds on personal data . Big data versus data minimisation A certain amount of data is needed to develop and use arti ficial intelligence . At the same time , one of the key principles of data protection is data minimisation , which requires the amount of personal data collected to be limited to what is necessary for fulfilling the purpose for collecting it . Consequently , th e need for large datasets can conflict with the principle of data minimisation . Although enterprises planning to implement a project based on AI will want to obtain as much data as possible , the starting point must be to select a relevant sample and a data set that is sufficiently large . Enterprises can also consider whether there are other more privacy -friendly methods of gaining access to the personal data needed , such as anonymised data , synthetic datasets or various encryption methods . The Norwegian Dat a Protection Authority has published a guide on artificial intelligence and privacy which covers this and other issues.35 Data quality It is not only the amount of data that is important for artificial intelligence ; the quality and structure of the data mus t also be good . Any errors in the data can have an impact on the analyses performed . Moreover , there must be metadata describing the content of the different data fields . A good start is for individual organisations to put their own house in order36 , meanin g that they gain an overview of what data they manage , what the data means , what it is used for , what processes it is used in , and whether legal authority exists for sharing it . One challenge to quality that particularly applies to artificial intelligence is what is known as bias . Bias occurs if we have datasets which only contain information about part of the relevant source data . If an algorithm that is meant to recognize images of dogs is only trained using images of dogs playing with balls , the algorit hm may reason that it can not be a picture of a dog if no ball appears in the image . Similarly , it is problematic if an algorithm meant for facial recognition is trained on images of faces from a single ethnic group . Bias can occur for other reasons ; for e xample , a training dataset for supervised learning may contain bias resulting from human misjudgements or historical bias in the source data ( on account of , for example , the conventional view of men as holders of certain types of positions , or if the data contains more images of women than men by a kitchen sink ) . Artificial intelligence can also be influenced by who defines the problems . 35 Norwegian Data Protection Authority ( 2018 ) : Artificial intelligence and privacy . www.datatilsynet.no/en/regulations -and-tools/reports -on-specific -subjects/ai -and-privacy/ 36 Difi ( 2018 ) : Veileder for orden i eget hus [ Guide to putting one 's own house in order ] . 58 Lack of transparency One challenge with artificial intelligence is the lack of transparency in some solutions based on d eep learning . Some deep learning algorithms can be likened to a 'black box ' , where one has no access to the model that can explain why a given input value produces a given outcome . Most systems based on AI are not black boxes , however , and render it possib le to understand and document how decisions are made . In areas where explainability is important , an alternative approach to deep learning might be more appropriate . At the same time , much research is being conducted in the field of 'explainable AI ' , whic h aims to make black box algorithms explainable . This is not the same as publishing the code behind an algorithm or allowing full access to full datasets , because such an approach may breach intellectual property rights and data protection laws . Instead , e xplainable AI can analyse what data had significance for the outcome and what significance the different elements had , and thereby explain the logic behind the outcome . Autonomy Finally , the fact that artificial intelligence is characterised by autonomy , a nd that it can make decisions and initiate actions without human interaction , presents a challenge . Although the degree of autonomy will vary , it nonetheless raises questions about responsibility for the consequences of such decisions and how such autonomy can be limited . The initial discussions on ethics for artificial intelligence originated in issues of autonomy .37 5.2 Ethical principles for artificial intelligence In its Global Risk Report 2017 , the World Economic Forum characterises artificial intelligence as one of the emerging technologies with the greatest potential benefits but also the greatest risks . There is therefore a need to continuously discuss what is responsible and desirable development and what we can do to prevent undesirable development in this area . The European Commission set up an expert group which has drawn up ethical guidelines for trustworthy use of artificial intelligence.38 The guidelines are based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU and on international human rights law . The purpose of the guidelines is to promote responsible and sustainable development and use of artificial intelligence in Europe . For development and use of AI to be defined as trustworthy , the European Commission 's high -level expert group be lieves that it must be lawful , ethical and robust . On this basis , the expert group has proposed seven principles for ethical and responsible development of artificial intelligence . The Government will adopt these principles as its basis for responsible dev elopment and use of artificial intelligence in Norway . 37 See for example Isaac Asimov 's three laws of robotics . Asimov , Isaac ( 1950 ) : 'Runaround ' . I , Robot ( The Isaac Asimov Collection edition. ) . New York City : Doubleday 38 Independent High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence set up by the European Commission ( 2019 ) : Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI 59 The principles largely address artificial intelligence that builds on data from or that affects humans , but they are also relevant for industrial use of AI built on data that does not constitute personal data . Satisfying all seven principles simultaneously can prove challenging . Tensions may arise that create a need to make trade -offs . Such trade -offs should be addressed in a rational and methodological manner . Where no ethically acceptable trade -offs can be identified , the development and use of the AI solution should not proceed in its current form . All decisions made regarding trade -offs must be reasoned and documented . If unjust adverse impacts occur in a solution built on AI , mechanisms shoul d be in place to ensure that such impacts can be reported . Particular attention should be paid to vulnerable persons or groups , such as children . 1 ) AI-based solutions must respect human autonomy and control The development and use of artificial intelligenc e must foster a democratic and fair society by strengthening and promoting the fundamental freedoms and rights of the individual . Individuals must have the right not to be subject to automated processing when the decision made by the system significantly a ffects them . Individuals must be included in decision -making processes to assure quality and give feedback at all stages in the process ( 'human -in-the-loop ' ) . 2 ) AI-based systems must be safe and technically robust AI must be built on technically robust sys tems that prevent harm and ensure that the systems behave as intended . The risk of unintentional and unexpected harm must be minimised . Technical robustness is also important for a system 's accuracy , reliability and reproducibility . 3 ) AI must take privacy a nd data protection into account Artificial intelligence built on personal data or on data that affects humans must respect the data protection regulations and the data protection principles in the General Data Protection Regulation . 4 ) AI-based systems must be transparent Decisions made by systems built on artificial intelligence must be traceable , explainable and transparent . This means that individuals or legal persons must have an opportunity to gain insight into how a decision that affects them was made . Traceability facilitates auditability as well as explainability . Transparency is achieved by , among other things , informing the data subject of the processing . Transparency is also about computer systems not pretending to be human beings ; human beings mu st have the right to know if they are interacting with an AI system . 5 ) AI systems must facilitate inclusion , diversity and equal treatment When developing and using AI , it is especially important to ensure that AI contribute to inclusion and equality , and t hat discrimination be avoided . Datasets that are used to train AI systems can contain historical bias , be incomplete or incorrect . Identifiable and discriminatory bias should , if possible , be removed in the collection phase . Bias can be counteracted by put ting in place oversight processes to analyse and correct the system ’ s decisions in light of the purpose . 60 6 ) AI must benefit society and the environment Artificial intelligence must be developed with consideration for society and the environment , and must hav e no adverse effects on institutions , democracy or society at large . 7 ) Accountability The requirement of accountability complements the other requirements , and entails the introduction of mechanisms to ensure accountability for solutions built on AI and for their outcomes , both before and after the solutions are implemented . All AI systems must be auditable . The Government wants public debate on the ethical use of artificial intelligence and on what applications of artificial intelligence we want to adopt in Norway . Norway has a number of bodies whose mandate is to invite public debate on t echnology and ethics , such as the Norwegian Data Protection Authority , the Norwegian Board of Technology , and the Norwegian National Committees for Research Ethics . Privacy by design and ethics Algorithms can be controlled by facilitating access or audit , but it is more appropriate for developers as well as users to build privacy and ethical considerations into systems from the outset . Such a mindset has already been established with regard to privacy . Privacy by design is a key requirement in the General Data Protection Regulation , and means that consideration must be given to privacy in all phases of development of a system or solution . This is so as to ensure that information systems meet the requirements of the Personal Data Act and safeguard the rights of the individual . Likewise , ethical considerations should be built into algorithms during development . Among other things , it will be important to assess whether an algorithm may lead to discrimination and whether it is sufficiently robust to withstand manipulation . Ethical evaluations may also call for considering potential environmental impacts and whether a system contributes to achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals . Work on privacy by design and ethics require those who work on solutions bas ed on AI to possess or acquire the necessary competence . Higher education institutions ought to evaluate how privacy and ethics can be integrated into their programmes in , for example , information technology and data science . Artificial intelligence and r esearch ethics The act relating to the organisation of work on ethics and integrity in research ( Lov om organisering av forskningsetisk arbeid ) imposes a duty of care on researchers and research institutions to ensure that all research be conducted in acco rdance with recognised standards for research ethics . Research institutions have a responsibility to ensure that candidates and employees receive training in recognised standards for research ethics and that everyone conducting or participating in research be familiar with them . The National Committee for Research Ethics in Science and Technology recently submitted a report on research ethics in which it proposes nine principles for AI research in three areas:39 39 Den nasjonale forskningsetiske komité for naturvitenskap og teknologi ( 2019 ) : Forskningsetisk betenkning om kun stig intelligens 61 A ) Responsibility for development and use of auto nomous systems : Research in AI must safeguard human dignity , assign responsibility , be explainable , and promote informed public debate . B ) Social implications and responsible research : Research in AI must acknowledge uncertainties and ensure broad involvement . C ) Big data : Research in AI must protect privacy and the interests of individuals , ensure reproducibility and quality , and promote equal access to data . Challenges for consumers Use of AI offers many advantages to consumers , such as the development of an ever increasing range of new services that simplify everyday life . But it also presents challenges with respect to privacy , transparency and consumer rights . Consumers are particularl y vulnerable when AI is used to develop personalised services and targeted marketing based on collecting and processing consumers ' personal data . There is growing concern internationally that businesses are failing to take consumers ' privacy seriously enou gh . A survey from Consumers International40 shows that consumers appreciate what AI technology can do ; it gives them independence , entertainment and motivation in new and interesting ways . But the survey also shows that consumers are unsure about how their personal data is used and who is behind the data processing . They seek more clarity and control . When services and marketing are made increasingly personalised , consumers risk being subjected to discriminatory treatment and arbitrary non -transparent deci sions such as price discrimination . Moreover , personalised marketing and other commercial practices developed using AI can manipulate and mislead consumers into making decisions that are not in their interests . AI affects many aspects of consumer 's social life and will encompass different sectors of society . The use of AI raises legal issues under various sectoral legislation , particularly in competition , privacy and data protection , and consumer protection . It is therefore important that the relevant supe rvisory authorities cooperate on this issue . They should develop competence and information , and participate in international forums such as the Digital Clearinghouse , the European forum for consumer , competition and data protection enforcement bodies . In the white paper on the consumer of the future ,41 the Government announced that it will create a similar cooperation forum at national level : Digital Clearinghouse Norway . Regulation of artificial intelligence in the consumer sector Norway has a tradition o f strong consumer protection laws . Efforts are being made in Norway and the EU to provide consumers with strong and enforceable rights that are adapted to digital life . As part of these efforts , the EU has adopted a number of regulatory acts that will stre ngthen consumer rights online , such as the proposed package of measures called the New Deal for Consumers . While these regulatory acts 40 Consumer International ( 2019 ) : Artificial intelligence : Consumer experiences in new Technology 41 Meld . St. 25 ( 2018 -2019 ) Framtidas forbrukar – grøn , smart og digital . [ Report to the Storting no . 25 ( 2018 -2019 Consumer of the future – green , smart and digital ] 62 do not specifically address AI , the European Commission has stressed that AI will be one of the key areas in the time ahe ad.42 Norwegian authorities have been closely monitoring the EU 's work on modernisation of consumer rights and will continue to do so . International cooperation on ethical and trustworthy AI Norway is engaged in an array of international forums that work o n strategies and guidelines for ethical and trustworthy artificial intelligence , among them the UN , EU , OECD and the Nordic Council of Ministers . United Nations Norway participates in processes , activities and discussions across the UN system dealing with applications of AI . Thematic areas in which AI is given attention span from eliminating hunger , combating climate change and efforts to promote good health for all to discussing disarmament and international security.43 European Union Norway , represented by the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation , has participated in EU activities related to AI from the start , and was involved in , among other things , preparing the European Commission 's Coordinated Pl an on Artificial Intelligence from December 2018 .44 The EU is working towards human -centric and trusted AI . Norway participates in this work and sits on the steering group that is developing a coordinated approach to AI together with the European Commission and the member states . The European Commission is expected to submit a legislative proposal on AI regulation in 2020 . A new regulatory framework for AI is expected to build on the ethical principles for developing and using AI published by the EU 's high -level expert group in April 2019 , on which the Government has based its ethical principles for AI . Norway will be actively involved in the work carried out on any future regulatory framework for AI . OECD The Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Deve lopment ( OECD ) is working on AI and has published several reports on the topic . Norway , represented by the Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation , has participated in OE CD 's work on preparing a recommendation on artificial intelligence .45 This was finally approved on 22 May 2019 . The recommendation identifies key values for trustworthy AI , namely : inclusive growth , sustainable development and well -being ; human -centred values and fairness ; transparency and explainability ; robustness , security and safety ; an d accountability . In addition , OECD makes recommendations pertaining to R & D in AI , fostering a digital ecosystem for AI and shaping public policy on AI . The importance of building human capacity and preparing for labour market transformation is also highli ghted . 42 European Commission ( 2018 ) Communication from the commission to the European Parliament , the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee – A new deal for consumers 43 In 2018 the International Telecommunication Union ( IT U ) published a summary of UN activities on AI : handle.itu.int/11.1002/pub/8120d5d5 -en 44 European Commission ( 2018 ) : Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence ( COM ( 2018 ) 795 final ) 45 OECD ( 2 019 ) : Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence , OECD/LEGAL/0449 63 Furthermore , the OECD points out the importance of international cooperation for ensuring ethical and trustworthy AI . Council of Europe The Council of Europe is concerned with the potential impacts of AI on human rights . The European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) has as of 2019 not yet heard any cases in which artificial intelligence has been the central issue , though it has touched on the topic in some contexts . In the autumn of 2019 the Council of Europe set up an ad -hoc committee to examine the op portunities and risks posed by AI in respect of human rights . Norway , represented by the Ministry of Justice and Public Security , participates in this work . Nordic Council of Ministers and Nordic –Baltic cooperation Nordic cooperation on digitalisation wil l promote the Nordic and Baltic countries as a cohesive and integrated digital region . Through binding cooperation and projects , the Nordic countries will find solutions to problems encountered by citizens and businesses , promote innovative technologies an d services , and make it easier to develop new services for individuals and businesses throughout the region . Nordic – Baltic agreements have been signed on closer cooperation on 5G , AI and data sharing . The Government will  encourage development and use of artificial intelligence in Norway to be based on ethical principles and to respect human rights and democracy  encourage industry and interest organisations to establish their own industry standards or labelling or certification schemes based on the principles for responsible use of artificial intelligence  encourage the educational institutions to consider how privacy and ethics can be given a central place in their programmes in artificial intelligence  expect the supervisory authorities to have the competence and authority to supervise artificial intelligence systems within their areas of supervision in order to , among other things , ensure compliance with the principles for responsible and trustworthy artificial intelligence  establish a cooperation forum for consumer , competition and data protection enforcement bodies : Digital Clearinghouse Norway  continue to participate in European and international forums , including the EU 's work towards creating a regulatory framework to promote responsible and tr ustworthy use of artificial intelligence and towards modernising consumer rights in light of digital developments  stimulate public debate on the ethical use of artificial intelligence 64 5.3 Security To ensure a well -functioning digital society , we must min imise the risk of being affected by adverse cyber incidents . The Government therefore considers cyber security to be a priority area . In January 2019 the Government presented a national strategy for cyber security46 and a national strategy for cyber securi ty competence.47 The cyber security strategy defines goals for five priority areas :  Norwegian companies shall digitalise in a secure and trustworthy manner , and improve their capability to protect themselves against cyber incidents .  Critical societal funct ions shall be supported by robust and reliable digital infrastructure .  Enhanced cyber security competence shall be aligned with the needs of society .  Norwegian society shall improve its capability to detect and manage cyber attacks .  The police shall enh ance its capability to combat cyber crime . The Ministry of Justice and Public Security and the Ministry of Defence have overarching responsibility for following up the National Cyber Security Strategy for Norway . The individual ministries are responsible for ensuring that the strategy ’ s priorities and measures are followed up in their respective sectors . Cyber security and artificial intelligence have two aspects : security in solutions based on artificial intelligence , and solutions based on artificial in telligence for enhanced cyber security . The competence needs in these areas will largely overlap . There is also a need for in -depth specialisation in security architecture for protecting AI systems , and for specialisation in algorithms/big data for using A I to protect IT systems and society . Security in AI-based systems Implementing an AI system entails applying conventional technologies such as sensors , communication networks , data centres , big data and software . An AI system will inherit vulnerabilities from these technologies and will also introduce new vulnerabilities as part of the new AI -based solution . In this respect , AI systems are no different from conventional IT or from conventional methods of working on cyber security . As with other IT systems , a structured , holistic approach to cyber security is needed before an AI system is deployed . The Norwegian National Security Authority 's basic principles for cyber security provide all Norwegian organisations with a good starting point for identifying what they should consider in their security activities , regardless of size , maturity and competence . 46 Ministries ( 2019 ) : National Cyber Security Strategy 47 Ministry of Justice and Public Security ( 2019 ) : National Strategy for Cyber Security Competence 65 Artificial intelligence in law enforcement The Norwegian Police University College and NTNU in Gjøvik are cooperating on a project that examines the use of different forms of artificial intelligence for analysing big data , aimed at detecting , preventing a nd investigating economic crime . The objective of the Ars Forensica project is to produce new knowledge that can improve prevention , investigation and prosecution of incidents without compromising privacy and the rule of law . Some examples of the research challenges are : i ) vast amounts of electronic data that need to be analysed ii ) fragments of evidence that are hidden in chaotic environments iii ) varying quality in digital trails , and possibilities to plant/distort digital trails iv ) dynamic environments and continuall y changing situations/contexts v ) lack of knowledge , and vi ) decisions characterised by uncertainty and conjecture The project is funded by the Research Council of Norway 's IKTPLUSS programme . Sources : NTNU/Ars Forensica For many organisations , AI as a service will be provided by external parties with the necessary competence and computing power . This can create challenges in terms of transparency , integrity , accountability and traceability . This must be taken into account when procuring the service . Both the Norwegian Digitalisation Agency and the Norwegian National Security Authority have issued guidance material on security in connection with outsourcing and procuring cloud services . An AI -based IT system must be trustwo rthy as well as robust , secure , safe and accurate . Depending on the system 's purpose , error or manipulation can in some cases have significantly more far -reaching consequences for an AI system than for a conventional IT system . This must be taken into acco unt when performing a risk assessment of such systems . Protection of digital infrastructure The existing early warning system for digital infrastructure has been used to detect targeted cyber attacks for almost 20 years . The Norwegian National Security Authority is now developing new sensor technology that will build on and eventually replace the sensors used in the existing early warning system . A new platform will be developed to use artificial intelligence and machine learning on the data collected . The platform will enable automatic analysis of any malware detected as well as automatic sharing of results .

This also applies to organisations engaged in security activities and in cyber se curity in particular . Most security organisations regard the use of AI systems as necessary for identifying threats and threat agents , and for being able to withstand and manage cyber attacks . AI-based cyber security solutions contribute to faster detecti on and management of incidents and to more precise and detailed analysis . Machine learning and data -driven technology can also help prevent vulnerabilities in software development . Simula researches technologies aimed at helping software developers predic t vulnerability in source code during development and thereby prevent security holes which subsequently could be exploited by threat agents . The Government will  develop Norway 's capacity to detect and respond to cyber attacks using AI  develop the Norwegian National Security Authority as a tool for guidance , problem solving and cooperation , with the aim of building its expertise in securing AI systems and in using AI for enhanced cyber security Published by : Ministry of Local Government and Modernisation Additional copies may be ordered from : Norwegian Government Security and Service Organisation publikasjonsbestilling @ dep.dss.no Phone : 22 24 00 00 Publication no . : H -2458 EN Cover : « SEER : Simulative Emotional Expression Robot » , Takayuki Todo ( JP ) , Ars Electronica /vog.photo All pictures in the report are from exhibitions at the art centre Ars Electronica www.ars.electronica.art and www.flickr.com/arselectronica Print : Norwegian Government Security and Service Organisation 01/2020
