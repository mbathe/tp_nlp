Sign your name AI decolonial Manyfesto This manyfesto is a provocation , a question , an opening , a dance about a future of AI technologies that is decolonial . We call it manyfesto , since it reflects some visions among many , and we hope to invite exchange , conversation , and the development of statements from people affected by AI technology . We begin with the challenge posed by the language we use to talk about AI : language that has emerged , as much of the technology has , dominated by Western male voices , whiteness , and wealth . We seek to uncover , to question , upend , and reinvent the assumptions underlying this language , even as we use it . “ Artificial ” and “ intelligence ” are loaded terms , their definitions subject to cultural biases . AI is a technology , a science , a business , a knowledge system , a set of narratives , of relationships , an imaginary . Across each facet , our effort is to undo the colonial erasure of non-Western ways of being and knowing . The word “ decoloniality , ” too , resonates differently in different communities , including with Indigenous peoples and those for whom colonialism is not a history but a present reality . Some reject the term decolonial in this context . We acknowledge both its use and its rejection . We do not seek consensus : we value human difference . We reject the idea that any one framework could rule globally . We reject the Western-normative language of “ ethical ” AI and suggestions of “ inclusivity ” that do not destabilize current patterns of domination and address power asymmetries . We reject as half-measures any principles meant to tweak , reinforce , and whitewash the status quo , merely blunting its devastation . They fail to acknowledge how the social and the technical are interwoven , and technologies have immaterial as well as material impacts over specific gendered , racialized bodies and territories . Decoloniality rejects the divorcing of the material and immaterial , of feeling from being , knowing , doing or living . Notions of decolonial governances will emerge from community and situated contexts , questioning what currently constitutes hegemonic narratives . Decolonialilty is not merely diversity and inclusion ; removing the echoes of coloniality in AI will require reparations for present and past material and epistemic injustice and dispossession . These reinventions of AI governance will acknowledge the expertise that comes from lived experience , and create new pathways to make it possible for those who have historically been marginalized to have the opportunity to decide and build their own dignified socio-technical futures . Decolonial governance will recognize , in a way that Western-centric governance structures historically have not , how our destinies are intertwined . We owe each other our mutual futures . Our humanity is relational , defined by how we are tied to one another . Technology has an important role in those relationships . Creation , art , stories and sensitive experience are some of the paths that we must explore in order to foster the decolonial imagination . We seek to center the engineering , design , knowledge-production , and dispute-resolution practices of diverse cultures , which are embedded with their own value systems . Our urgency arises from humans ’ capacity to use AI as a knowledge system to create irrefutable “ algorithmic truths ” to reinforce domination . In doing so , other systems of knowledge production and other visions are denied and erased , as are other peoples ’ agency , autonomy , and contestation . In this way AI coloniality extends beyond data colonialism : AI implies material extractivism , and the use of AI has the capacity to shape reality . Designed in an unequal society , these systems can be employed to reproduce those inequalities . Built with an emphasis on efficiency rather than dignity , they can do irreparable harm . In insisting on a decolonial AI , we stand for the right of each historically marginalized community to reshape reality on their terms . Our methods will evolve , sensitive to needs and opportunities , but our aim is to create and hold a resonant forum for learning and exchange from and between voices silenced by colonialist structures and the coloniality in force through socio-technical systems .
