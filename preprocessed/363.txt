individuals therefore simply assessing classifyin individuals based characteristics age sex height could considered profiling regardless predictive purpose gdpr inspired identical definition profiling council europe recommendation recommendation recommendation excludes processing include inference nevertheless recommendation useful reference tool specifically description three distinct stages profiling data collection automated analysis identify correlations applying correlation individual identify characteristics present future behaviour stages represents process falls gdpr definition pro
