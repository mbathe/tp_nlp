This post is part of a series on data ethics . “ Oaths ? We don ’ t need no stinkin ’ oaths ” ( with apologies to Humphrey Bogart in “ Treasure of the Sierra Madre ” ) . Over the past year , there has been a great discussion of data ethics , motivated in part by discomfort over “ fake news , ” targeted advertising , algorithmic bias , and the effect that data products have on individuals and on society . Concern about data ethics is hardly new ; the ACM , IEEE , and the American Statistical Association all have ethical codes that address data . But the intensity with which we ’ ve discussed ethics shows that something significant is happening : data science is coming of age and realizing its responsibilities . A better world won ’ t come about simply because we use data ; data has its dark underside . Learn faster . Dig deeper . See farther . Join the O'Reilly online learning platform .

Learn more The recent discussion frequently veers into a discussion of data oaths , looking back to the ancient Hippocratic Oath for doctors . Much as we appreciate the work and the thought that goes into oaths , we are skeptical about their value . Oaths have several problems : They ’ re one-shots . You take the oath once ( if at all ) , and that ’ s it . There ’ s no reason to keep it in the front of your consciousness . You don ’ t recite it each morning . Or evaluate regularly whether you ’ re living up to the ideals . Oaths are a set of very general and broad principles . Discussions of the Hippocratic Oath begin with the phrase “ First , do no harm , ” words that don ’ t actually appear in the oath . But what does “ do no harm ” mean ? For centuries doctors did very little but harm ( many people died because doctors didn ’ t believe they needed to wash their hands ) . The doctors just didn ’ t know they were doing harm . Nice idea , but short on the execution . And data science ( like medicine ) is all about execution . Oaths can actually give cover to people and organizations who are doing unethical work . It ’ s easy to think “ we can ’ t be unethical , because we endorsed this oath. ” It ’ s not enough to say “ don ’ t be evil. ” You have to not be evil . Oaths do very little to connect theories and principles to practice . It is one thing to say “ researchers must obtain informed consent ” ; it ’ s an entirely different thing to get informed consent at internet scale . Or to teach users what “ informed consent ” means . We are not suggesting that the principles embodied in oaths aren ’ t important , just that they don ’ t get us to the endpoint we want . They don ’ t connect our ideas about what ’ s good or just to the practices that create goodness and justice . We can talk a lot about the importance of being fair and unbiased without knowing about how to be fair and unbiased . At this point , the oath actually becomes dangerous : it becomes a tool to convince yourself that you ’ re one of the good guys , that you ’ re doing the right thing , when you really don ’ t know . Oaths are good at creating discussion—and , in the past year , they have created quite a lot of discussion . The discussion has been tremendously helpful in making people aware of issues like algorithmic fairness . The discussion has helped software developers and data scientists to understand that their work isn ’ t value-neutral , that their work has real impact , both good and bad , on real people . And there has been a vigorous debate about what self-government means for data scientists , and what guiding principles would last longer than a few years . But we need to take the next step , and connect these ideas to practice . How will we do that ? In 2009 , Atul Gawande wrote The Checklist Manifesto , a short book on how not to make big mistakes . He writes a lot about his practice as a surgeon . In a hospital , everyone knows what to do . Everyone knows that you ’ re supposed to scrub down before the surgery . Everyone knows that you ’ re not supposed to amputate the wrong leg . Everyone knows that you ’ re not supposed to leave sponges and other equipment in patients when you close the incision . But mistakes are made , particularly when people are in stressful environments . The surgeon operates on the wrong leg ; the sponge is left behind ; and so on . Gawande found that , simply by creating checklists for basic things you shouldn ’ t forget , these mistakes could be eliminated almost completely . Yes , there were some doctors who found the idea of checklists insultingly simple ; they were the ones who continued making mistakes . Unlike oaths , checklists connect principle to practice . Everyone knows to scrub down before the operation . That ’ s the principle . But if you have to check a box on a form after you ’ ve done it , you ’ re not likely to forget . That ’ s the practice . And checklists aren ’ t one-shots . A checklist isn ’ t something you read once at some initiation ceremony ; a checklist is something you work through with every procedure . What would a checklist for data science and machine learning look like ? The UK Government ’ s Data Ethics Framework and Data Ethics Workbook is one approach . They isolate 7 principles , and link to detailed discussions of each . The workbook asks a number of open-ended questions to probe your compliance with these principles . Our criticism is that their process imposes a lot of overhead . While anyone going through their entire process will certainly have thought carefully about ethical issues , in practice , asking developers to fill out a workbook with substantive answers to 46 questions is an effective way to ensure that ethical thought doesn ’ t happen . We believe that checklists are built around simple , “ have we done this ? ” questions—and they are effective because they are simple . They don ’ t leave much room to wiggle . Either you ’ ve analyzed how a project can be abused , or you haven ’ t . You ’ ve built a mechanism for gathering consent , or you haven ’ t . Granted , it ’ s still possible to take shortcuts : your analysis might be inadequate and your consent mechanism might be flawed , but you ’ ve at least gone on record for saying that you ’ ve done it . Here ’ s a checklist for people who are working on data projects : ❏ Have we listed how this technology can be attacked or abused ? ❏ Have we tested our training data to ensure it is fair and representative ? ❏ Have we studied and understood possible sources of bias in our data ? ❏ Does our team reflect diversity of opinions , backgrounds , and kinds of thought ? ❏ What kind of user consent do we need to collect to use the data ? ❏ Do we have a mechanism for gathering consent from users ? ❏ Have we explained clearly what users are consenting to ? ❏ Do we have a mechanism for redress if people are harmed by the results ? ❏ Can we shut down this software in production if it is behaving badly ? ❏ Have we tested for fairness with respect to different user groups ? ❏ Have we tested for disparate error rates among different user groups ? ❏ Do we test and monitor for model drift to ensure our software remains fair over time ? ❏ Do we have a plan to protect and secure user data ? This checklist isn ’ t without its problems , but it ’ s a start ; feel free to use it and modify in your projects . It covers most of the bases that we ’ ve seen discussed in various data oaths . Go over the checklist when starting a product so the developers know what ’ s needed and aren ’ t surprised by a new set of requirements at the last minute . Then work through it whenever you release software . Go through it , and actually check off all the boxes before your project hits the public . Oaths and codes of conduct have their value . The value of an oath isn ’ t the pledge itself , but the process you go through in developing the oath . People who work with data are now having discussions that would never have taken place a decade ago . But discussions don ’ t get the hard work done , and we need to get down to the hard work . We don ’ t want to talk about how to use data ethically ; we want to use data ethically . It ’ s hypocritical to talk about ethics , but never do anything about it . We want to put our principles into practice . And that ’ s what checklists will help us do .
