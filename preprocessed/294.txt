enterprise field around long time past five years shifted dramatically thanks faster computation smarter algorithms importantly exponential growth data machine learning subfield software systems learn data experience greatest impact enterprise amazon ceo jeff bezos said letter shareholders past decades computers broadly automated tasks programmers could describe clear rules algorithms modern machine learning techniques allow tasks describing precise rules much harder course machine learning automate existing businesses processes changes businesses form strengthen relationships customers using data machine learning businesses turn every interaction opportunity learn people want value macro level machine learning optimize margins directing budget dollars human resources customers outreach engagement generate highest return risks requires enterprises use customer data new ways making appropriate data usage one key responsibilities people feel shocked learn sensitive information leaked suspicious sense businesses want manipulate behavior powerless automated system denies product without explanation trust constant earned years lost instant executives ultimately responsible striking right balance business risk legal reputational opportunity leaders need clear mental model means effectively arbitrate business risk stakeholders make right decisions world major technology advances like challenge existing models becoming increasingly difficult framework comes presents privacy security ethics choices businesses face using machine learning consumer data breaks things various small decisions teams need make building machine learning system agile approach ethics risk management aligns agile software development practices importantly framework neither regulatory

may biggest disruptive technology advance see lifetimes implementing responsible responsible consumer enterprise machine learning systems work start addressing ethics risks machine learning helps everyone common understanding machine learning systems work mean everyone needs become machine learning scientist grasp nuances different algorithms need grounded intuitions necessary ask good questions machine learning systems create useful mappings inputs outputs mappings called models mathematical functions equations form input output admittedly however equations much complicated could use rules define mappings rules take lot time write usually handle lot cases machine learning computer programmers longer write update mappings inputs outputs computers learn mappings data computer learns value seeing lots system presented new inputs seen uses mappings learned make useful guess corresponding output mappings certain always generalize perfectly new data machine learning

transform model output action feedback loops happen businesses keep track difference expected versus actual outcomes use difference improve prediction accuracy time ethics risk questions arise across
