Information technology comes in many forms and implementations . We believe the basic principles of accessibility for human input and devic e output developed for computers , the World Wide Web , computer applications , visual displays , and aural and tactile devices have wide applicability for innovative devices in all forms . This set of principles aims to promot e accessibility , usability , and digital inclusiveness . These principles are a tool that designers , developers , and policy makers can use to assure that the promise of computing can be enjoyed to the maximum extent possible by all members of society . Implement Accessibility and Usability fo r the Digital Age : Accessible and usable technologies extend beyond web and mobile applications . Accessibility and usability for the digital age should support and encompass accessible ICT in all its forms and assistive technologies . Build Accessibility in from the Beginning : Incorporating accessibility and usability from conception can help reduce issues once technologies are deployed and affecting individuals â€™ lives . This also avoids difficult and costly retrofitting . Promote Awarene ss and Clarity About Compliance : Improving accessibility of ICT can often be a relatively inexpensive process . Educational resources aimed at improving awareness o f accessibility requirements can reduce resistance and increase compliance . Encourage Tool and Software Development : Tool and software development make it easier for developers and content providers to design accessible technologies . Improved tools for testing and auditing accessibility might provide clearer feedback and assistance in improving ac cessibility , thus simplifying the process of bringing ICT into compliance . Promote Innovation and Accessibility : Promoting innovative architectural technical solutions that encourage entities to get creative in the way they provide access can help foster a n affinity for and commitment to accessibility and usability rather than dismissal . Foster Digital Inclusiveness : A technology -centered society must consider that individuals may have a range of accessibility concerns associated with mobility , vision , hearing , cognition , disabilities and changes in abilities associated with aging . Current and emerging ICT and assistive technologies should consider all of these audience s and plan for appropriate accessibility . Emphasize the Importance of Privacy and Sec urity : The ubiquity of ICT and assistive technologies broaden s the scope and scale of their impact . Privacy and security are instrumental in ensuring robust and reliable technologies for individuals with disabilities .
