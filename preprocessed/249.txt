Introduc tion Artificial intelligence ( AI ) is advanced digital technology that enables machines to reproduce or exceed some of the skills that require intelligence when performed by humans . This includes tec hnologies that give machines the ability to learn and ad apt , hear and interact , reason and plan , optimise procedures and par ameters in order to extract knowledge from huge amounts of data and operate autonomously . Artific ial intelligence is a reality that is already influencing people ’ s decisions , safet y , marketing and communication strategies and even medical treatments . Although m achines do not have generalist intelligence yet and neither has it been possible to give them common sense , they possess intelligence for very specific tasks that surpass the efficiency of human intelligence . This is creating an enthusiastic surge in the adoption of this discipline in many areas of our lives , although th e ethical and legal impacts have not been evaluated in depth , a fact that poses a risk . In recent years , artificial intelligence has become one of the most significant technological trends with a cross -cutting capacity t o change many areas : society , economy , industry , culture , ecology , mobility , public administration a nd ethics and its cross -cutting nature implies having to consider all the possible stakeholders . The contribution and convergence of different views is both enriching and necessary for the sustainable and comprehensive development of artificial intelligence . The artificial intelligence sector is expected to grow considerably between 2020 and 2030 . According to estimations , by 2021 80 % of online interactions between smart bots ,1 powered by artificial intelligence , and humans , by way of chats or applications that operate with the voice , will be automated , thus offering a unique and personalised experience . The same year , over 90 % of companies around the world are expected to have adopt ed some kind of solution or AI application . Some of the most notable applications will be in the field of cybersec urity , business intelligence , market analysis , among others . In this regard , several countries have already implemented an AI strategy , under which they orchestrate strategic investments to boost their artificial intelligence capa bilities . These countries include the United States , Israel , Canada , China , Singapore , South Korea , India , New Zealand , and in Europe , the United Kingdom , France and Finland . They all have similar strategies that coincide with the ethics of their applicability , th e significant role that has to be played by public services and the need to promote research , training , and academic and entrepreneurial talent . Along these lines , on 25 April 2018 , the European Commission adopted its artificial intelligence strategy for E urope2 which marked the start of a coordinated plan with Member States to encourage the development and use of artificial intelligence in Europe . Within this framework , the Commission requested Member States to approve their respective national AI strategi es and focus them on four key areas : increase investment , make more data available , foster talent , and ensure trust in AI . 1 A bot ( a diminutive of robot ) is a program that imitates human behaviour , which performs automated tasks and communicates wit h users . The level of sophistication of the integrated AI can vary , depending on the nature and number of ta sks it performs . 2 https : //ec.europa.eu/spain/barcelona/news/press_releases/180425_ca . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 4 Coordination needs to be stronger to convert Europe into the world leader of the development and implementatio n of advanced , ethical and saf e artificial intelligence . Catal onia has a long history as a leader in technological innovation and talent development , starting with the first industrial revolution and the first railway , which included achieving numerous social , industrial and economic milestones , and ending up in this specific field with the creation of the MareNostrum ,3 one of the most internationally renowned supercomputers . The Barcelona Supercomputing Center has recen tly received funding from the EC to build the MareNostrum 5 , which will multiply the machine ’ s current power by 17 and convert it into Europe ’ s most powerful supercomputer . Catalonia is also a leader in the field of artificial intelligence , demonstrated by the excellent scientific and academic community of international prestige , which places Catalan universities , research and technology centres at the forefront of this field in Europe . This document clearly shows that Catal onia has the capa bilities and pot entialities to place the country in a privileged position to lead the development and adoption of artifici al intelligence in Southern Europe and convert it into a global technological pole of attraction in artificial intelligence ; for these reasons , the go vernment of Catalonia has put priority on preparing the Catalan Artificial Intelligence Strategy and setting it into motion . The Catalan Artificial Intelligence Strategy is an initiative coordinated by the Catalan ministry of Business and Knowledge , with the participation of the different ministries of the government of Catalonia . The Strategy will deploy a multi -sectoral , cross -cutting people -centred plan that prioritises sectors such as health , mobility , sustainab ility , productive economy , the agri -food sector and public services , and it will be established in an action plan that revolves around the pivotal elements listed below . • Ecos ystem : promote a governance model that supports the development of a coordinated ecosystem of artificial intelligence connected to the rest of the world ; • Research and innovation : boost research and innovation by applying specific instruments and establishing syne rgies among public authorities , specialised research and innovation centres and organisations that use artificial intelligence intensively ; • Talent : crea te , attract and retain specialised t alent that fosters the development of artificial intelligence soluti ons and transfer of knowledge to society , while training citizens and professionals of other sectors to be ready for its impact ; • Infrastructure and data : have the necessary infrastructures for the development of artificial intelligence and provide secure access to public and private data ; • Adop tion of artificial intelligence : promote the incorporation of artificial intelligence to drive innovation in public administration and strategic sectors , including agri -food , health care and well being , the environmen t , mobility , tourism , culture and industry ; • Ethics and society : promo te the development of ethical artificial intelligence that respects applicable legislation , is compatible with our social and cultural norms and focuses on people . 3 https : //www.bsc.es/ca/marenostrum/marenostrum . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 5 The Strategy was drawn up by a working group that , besides members of the government , counted on the participation of some of the country ’ s most relevant artificial intelligence experts , who gave their opinion of the current situation and future development of artificial intelli gence in Catalonia . The experts who formed part of the group were specifically : - Prof. Dr Ricardo Baeza -Yates , CEO of NTENT , director of Graduate Data Science Programs at Northeastern University in Silicon Valley ( US ) and professor of Information Technology at Pompeu Fabra University ( UPF ) - Prof. Dr María Casado , professor of Philosophy of Law , director of the Observatory of Bioethics and Law , UNESCO chair in Bioethics . Facult y of Law at Barcelona Universit y - Prof. Dr Ulises Cortés , of the Computer S cience Department of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia ( UPC ) . Scientific coordinator of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center of the High Performance Artificial Intelligence Group - Dr Sergi Figuerola , Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of the i2CAT Foundation - Prof. Dr Karina Gibert , professor of Intelligent Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research Center ( IDEAI -UPC ) , Vice Dean for Big Data and Data Science of the Official Professional Chamber of Informatics Engineering of Catalonia ( COEINF ) - Prof. Dr Elisabet Golobardes Ribé , professor and researcher of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science . Engineering Department , La Salle - Ramon Llull University - Dimosthenis Karatzas , associate director of the Computer Vision Centre - Dr Josep Lladós , dire ctor Computer Vision Centre - Prof. Ramon López de Mantaras , director of the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute ( IIIACSIC ) . Assistant professor at the Western Sydney University and University of Technology Sydney . - Dr Josep Maria Martorell , associate director of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Joan Mas , director of the Digital Technologies Division at Eurecat - Dr Marc Torrent Moreno , director of the Big Data Centre of Excellence in Barcelona . Eurecat - Prof. Dr Oriol Pujol , Vice -Rector for Digital T ransformation at Barcelona Universit y The working group ’ s conclusions formed the basis of Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy , known as CATALONIA.AI , which considers everything Catalonia contains , offers and makes available to become an internationally recognised example of successful artificial intelligence deployment , without forgetting the policies that the government of Catalonia will set in motion to accomplish the objective . This document starts by explaining what art ificial intelligence is and describes its impact on society and the present status of its deployment at an international level . It then provides an analysis of Catalonia ’ s current capa bilities in this field and ends by describing the goals and actions asso ciated to the different areas of activity of CATALONIA.AI , which foresees the work carried out jointly by public and private sectors , the academic sector , research and innovation centres , organisations , foundations and international bodies to ensure an eth ical development of artificial intelligence in Catalonia , which translates into a social and economic improvement for the country and its citizens . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 6 2 . Artificial intelligence and the impact of its deployment 2.1 Artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science , dedicated to the development of algori thms , that enables a machine to make intelligent decisions , o r at least behave with a human -like intelligence . AI shares concepts and techniques with other acad emic disciplines , such as mathematics . The concept of artificial intelligence is defined in many ways , although the most common definition was given by John McCarthy , who in 1956 affirmed that ‘ it is making a machine behave in ways that would be called intelligent if a human were so behaving ’ . On the other hand , Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein define artificial intelligence as ‘ a system ’ s ability to correctly interpret external data , to learn from such data , and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks through flexible adaptation ’ . Artificial intelligence can be applied in an endless number of fields and sectors ; its potential contributions –some of which are already in use and are very significant – mean its development and applicability involve disciplines such as ethics , law , psychology , philosophy , economy , digital marketing , engineering , health care , sociology , biology and many others . For this reason , one of the most important and consequential values of artificial intelligence is the work of multi -disciplinary teams , with different views but seeking the same goal . The multi -disciplinary nature of artificial intelligence is just one of its characteristic features , as mentioned above , but there are more : the c apacity to catalyse solutions to different kinds of problems , the close tie with computational capacities , the need for sufficient and accurate data and , finally , human talent and creativity to achieve the desired g oals . Artificial intelligence is one of the disciplines with the greatest power and influence over the model of society and economy in the future and t his transforming power will have a notable effect on economy . According to studies , in 2030 artificial intelligence will increase the gross world product by an additional 15.7 billion dollars4 and in Spain , it could increase the GDP by 0.8 % . As regards employment , the conception of jobs , work and industrial processes , the same as in the case of education an d all public services in general , will have to adopt new models and consequently undergo a transformation . The change is already underway and governments and public authorities need to exercise the responsibility that corresponds to them , fostering and adopting an extensive use of artificial intelligence and putting priority on ethics , so as to improve people ’ s well -being , ensure security in solutions development , protect natural resources , eliminate gender inequality , provide access to technology and i nformation , while guaranteeing transparency and preventing undue use of data and/or algori thms . In this regard , several countries alr eady have an AI strate gy that they use to or chestrate strategic investments , aimed towards boosting their artificial intelligence capa bilities . These countries include 4 ‘ Sizing the prize . What is the real value of AI for your business and how can you capitalize ’ , drawn up by PwC . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 7 Figure 1 . National artificial intelligence strategies classified by year of implementation . Source : ‘ An Overview of National AI Strategies ’ - Politics + AI the United States , Israel , Canada , China , Singapore , South Korea , India , New Zealand , and in Europe , the United Kingdom , France and Finland . They all have similar strategies that coincide with the ethics of their a pplicability , the significant role of p ublic services and the need to promote research , training , and academic and talent . These strategies are strongly supported by a budget that mostly comes from public institutions , but with a notable private c omponent . Along these lines , on 25 April 2018 , the European Commission approved a communication that de tails the planned actions for a European a rtificial intelligence strategy , through a coordinated plan with Member States to foster the development and use of artificial intelligence in Europe . With this plan , which was presented on 7 D ecember 20185 , the European Commission set t he objective to mobilise €20 billion of public and private investment for the 2018 -2020 period . Within this framework , the Commission has requested Member States to adopt their respective national artificial intelligence strategies , defined in mid -2019 , and that the strategies focus on four key areas : increase investment , make more data available , fo ster talent and ensure trust in artificial intelligence . 2.2 Artificial intelligence around the world The U nited States ( US ) is the clear leader of the artificial intelligence market . It evidently has the strongest artificial intelligence ecosystem in ter ms of funding , number of companies and global reach . A total of 40 % of AI companies are located in America , although the figure would be higher it we took into account that the most relevant AI companies have a sales office or headquarters in the United States , while their main technology team s are based in another place , such as Poland , Israel or France . America ’ s leadership is the result of a mature , well -funded and pros perous digital ecosystem , as shown 5 http : //europa.eu/rapid /press -release_IP -18-6689_es.htm . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 8 Figure 2 . Global distribution of AI start -ups Source : Asgard & Roland B erger by Silicon Valley and the metropolitan areas of New York and Boston . Over 16 governmental agencies give financial and political support to AI companies ( incl uding the DARPA , the CIA and the NSA ) . The U nited States also has renowned universities ( Stanford and MIT ) , in additi on to large corporations with p owerful research capacity ( Google and DeepMind , Microsoft , Facebook , Amazon , Apple and IBM ) . The United States is a model to follow as rega rds how a technological industry can grow strongly when there is a convergence of governmental stimulation , applied research carried out by universities and corporations , entrepreneurship , private funding and a prosperous market . It is worth mentioning that the migration policies of the current US government are resulting in a certain human capital flight in the artificial intellig ence rese arch sector towards other ecosystems . Canada is particularly attractive . According to the analysis of existing data , China is in second position . Approximately 11 % of AI companies are located in the country , which has publicly announced its intention to become the world leader in artificial intelligence by 2030 ( AliBaba , Baidu , Huawei and ZTE are examples of huge Chinese corporations ) . Artificial intelligence forms part of its ambitious five-year development plan and t he government is going to invest billio ns of Chinese yuan in research centres in Beijing and Shenzhen . The initial market is well -funded , and valuations are even higher than in Silicon Valley . China shows the highest growth in the number of scholarly articles published and it has launched numerous AI -related initiatives , demonstrat ing that with governmental support , adequate funding and a clear strategy , a country can become a n influential AI player in only a few years . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 9 Israel is a leader in technology , ranking third in AI solutions . With o nly 8.5 mil lion citizens , it has a market share of 11 % , the same as China and has 40 times more AI companies per capita than the market leader , United States , which places Israel in the front line of artificial intelligence at an international level . One o f the reasons for this leadership is the close connection between the defence industry and the digital sector , although Israel is well -known for its long history of tech companies , not only for artificial intelligence . There are excellent universities ( Tec hnion , Bar -Illan , Ben -Gurion and Jerusalem ) and a strong business ecosystem in Tel-Aviv . The United Kingdom has a market share of 7 % , which places the country at the forefront of artificial intelligence in Europe . It is well -positioned at an international level as regards obtaining and attracting funding , talent and research . Lond on is a global financial hub ; therefore , funding of AI companies in the United Kingdom is significantly higher than in other European cou ntries . Furthermore , for years the UK government has been creating a powerful entrepreneurship and investment environment focused on this sector , and it also has excellent universities ( such as Oxford and Cambridge ) . Canad a is another leader in the field o f artificial intelligence and is currently number five on the Global AI country ranking . Although Canada promotes entrepreneurship -friendly pol itics , its market share is surprisingly similar to that of other countries ( 3.8 % ) , Japan ( 3.1 % ) , Fran ce ( 3.1 % ) and Germany ( 3 % ) . All are strong economies with a large domestic market . However , compared by size of economy , France and Germany ’ s efforts to develop AI industry leadership capacity are small in contrast to the United States , China , and Israel . The same hap pens in many other countries such as India ( 9 ) , Spain ( 13 ) , Brazil ( 17 ) and Russia ( 20 ) . Most of these countries have a huge deficiency of AI companies and unless they invest considerably more effort and capital to reduce their deficiency in artificial int elligence , they will have to depend on AI solutions from China , the United States and I srael . It is worth noting t hat the government of Catalonia , through ACCIÓ , provides an opportunity to establish international relationships with these ecosystems by way of its network of 40 offices aimed towards encouraging internationalisation , technological cooperation and innovation . At the end of 2018 Europa presented its AI4EU project6 in Barcelona . AI4EU is the European Union ’ s benchmark AI project and is the Europe an footprint within the global context of artificial intelligence , which seeks to develop a European AI ecosystem , bringing together the knowledge , algorithms , tools and resources available and making it a convincing solution for users . Catalonia ’ s partici pation in this project is headed by the BSC-CNC , the UPC and ATOS , which are joined by o ther relevant initiatives promoted by the European AI community , such as CLAIRE7 and ELLIS ,8 that aim to promote a network of AI labs in Europe . 6 https : //www.ai4eu.eu 7 https : //claire -ai.org 8 https : //ellis.eu Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 10 2.3 Sectors impacted by artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence is a technology that o ffers great potential and financial prospects in all markets . According to a study by PwC ,9 the financial impact of artificial intelligence on the total global GDP will come from f our sources : increa sed productivity from business automating processes ( including use of robots and autonomous vehicles ) ; increased productivity due to businesses augmenting their existing work force with AI technologies ( assisted and augmented intelligenc e ) ; the previous factors will result in saving time and cutting production costs ; i ncreased consumer demand resulting from the availability of personalised and/or higher -quality AI -enhanced products and services . As mentioned above , artificial intelligence is a technology that stands out for its cross -cutting impact ; therefore , its uptake will gradually increase in many dif ferent sectors , including the following :  ICT and cybersecurity  Citizen d efen ce and s afety  Health care  Tourism and leisure  Industry 4.0  Automo tive industry  Banking and finance  Retail The figure below shows some of the ways that artificial intelligence will impact these sectors at short , medium and long term , according to the tech nology report ‘ Artificial Intelligence in Catalonia ’ , drawn up by the government of Catalonia . 9 ‘ Sizing the prize .

Available capa bilities in Catalonia Catal onia has the capabilities and potentialities to position the country in a privileged position to lead the development and adoption of artificial intelligence in Southern Europe and convert it into a global technological pole of attraction in artificial intelligence . To understand what this position represents from an international perspective , it is necessary to bear in mind the different capabilities inherent in Catalonia , such as its knowledge ecosystem , ecosystem of technology companies and its scientific and technological infrastructure . The following sections describe each one of the capabilities that make Catalonia into an ideal place for developing , testing and deplo ying artificial intelligence . 3.1 Knowledge ecosystem Catalonia ’ s top vector in artificial intelligence is related to the promotion of knowledge . The region has a knowledge ecosystem that would enable it to head the deployment of artificial intelligence with guaranteed success . Its universities , research teams and departments , applied research centres , technology centres and associations demonstrate Catalonia ’ s existing potential . 3.1.1 Universit ies The Catalan university system is made up of 12 unive rsities : seven are public , four are private and one is a virtual university . A total of 26,300 lecturers give classes to over 237,000 students , who are offered about 1,300 university degrees , divided into bachelor ’ s , master ’ s and docto ral degrees . Figure 5 . Catalan university map Source : Government of Catalonia Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 13 These bodies offer specia lised training . Indeed , they have brought together their knowledge , driven technology creation and worked on research and technology transfer projects related to ar tificial intelligence . By way of illustration , the figure below shows the main research centres and groups of the different Catalan universities that develop artificial intelligence or work with AI intensively . The annexe of this document contains a detailed explanation of the i nvolvemen t of Catalan universities in AI develop ment in the region . 3.1.2 Research and innovation centres The Catalan research and innovation system is currently made up of internationally renowned research and technology centres . These centres are structured into two interrelated networks : firstly , the CERCA10 network , which groups together Catalan research centres and is managed by the CERCA Institute , using its own means and the technical services of Catalan government bodies and , secondly , the TECNIO11 network , focused on the transfer of te chnology , which joins research groups , CERCA and 10 http : //cerca.cat/ 11 http : //www.accio.gencat.cat/ca/ serveis/innovacio/tecnologia -per-a-lempresa/tecnio/ Figure 6 .

By way of illust ration , the figure below shows the main research and technology centres of the Catalan knowledge ecosystem that work with artificial intelligence . Annexe II of this document contains detailed information about the work carried out by each one of these centres related to AI development . 3.1.3 Participa tion in the H2020 Framework Programme Catal onia is the region of Spain that has received the hi ghest number of grants from the European research and innovation funding programme , Horizon 2020 . According to information obtained on 30 April 2019 by the CDTI ( Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology ) , during the 2014 -2019 period Catalan entities received a total of € 1,013,004,988 to subsidise Horizon 2020 projects . This figure represents 2.71 % of the programme ’ s implemented budget and 29.23 % of the total subsid y received by Spanish entities . As regards information and communications technology ( ICT ) , Catalan entities have also played a significant role and have received a total subsidy of € 85,961,783 , which represent s 2.87 % of the total implemented budget and 28.84 % of the funds awarded to Spain . The 10 Catalan entities t hat have received funding for information and communications technologies are the following ( listed in order according to the size of the grant , starting with the highest amount ) :  Barcelona Supercomputing Center ( MareNostrum )  Polytechnic University of Catalonia ( UPC )  Pompeu Fabra University ( UPF )  Eurecat Foundation Figure 7 . Technology and research centres that work with artificial intelligence in Catalonia .

Visitors are offered an interactive view of th e activities of Catalan entities related to science and innovation projects supported by European funds and the dynamic evolution of the collaboration networks between each entity . 3.1.4 Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence Professor Ramon López de Mántaras brought artificial intelligence to Catalonia in the 1980s . It quickly propagated and spread all over the region , resulting in the consolidation of a tight -knit scientific community that revolved around artificial intelligence . In 1994 , the Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence ( ACIA ) 13 was definitively established . The ACIA is a non -profit associa tion created with the purpose of promoting artificial intelligence in the Catalan society . Its main goal is to support communication between the p rofessionals and 12 http : //unics.cloud/ris3/mcat 13 https : //www.acia.cat Figure 8 . The RIS3 -MCAT Platform Source : Government of Catalonia Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 16 organisations that participate in artificial intelligence and promote social , cultural , scientific economic and governmental awareness of artificial intelligence . The ACIA was created 25 years ago with the aim of being a meeting point for all researchers who were already working in this new and unknown field . The entity was formed on 28 March 1994 and the Articles of Association were approved . During the summer of that year , the first edition of the Association ’ s magazine was published ( the ACIA Bulletin , later called NODES14 ) and the entity began to organise the Young Researc hers ’ Meetings that would later become the International Con ference of the ACIA . Nowadays , the ACIA brings together the greater part of this scientific community , as well as former students and professionals of the sector . At present , the Associa tion has over 220 individual and institutional memb ers , it has published more than 60 magazines and books , and has organised 22 international con ferences . Although the association belongs to a small region , since 1995 , it has been a member of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence , now known as E urAI , and since 1998 it has organised its annual international con ference , the CCIA15 , yet again acting as a pioneer , with some of the proceedings published by one of the most prestigious publishing hou ses , IOS Press . The ACIA organises and participates in dissemination activities including the YoMo , the celebration of the 60th anniversary of artificial intelligence and the Association ’ s 25th anniversary , among others . On 8 March 2019 , the ACIA created a working group aimed towards narrowing the gender gap in the AI sector ( donesIAcat ) . It also sponsors conferences , awards prizes to doctoral theses and master ’ s dissertations , and grants to attend conferences . As regards international scientific leadership , the fact that the ACIA has 10 EurAI Fellows is highly relevant . The EurAI Fellows programme dates back to 1999 and is a very selective programme that has honoured less than 3 % of its members ; Spain has 16 EurAI Fellows , of which 10 a re from ACAI , and only France , Germany , the United Kingdom and Italy have more fellowships than Catalonia . 3.2 Ecosystem of technology companies 3.2.1 The ICT industry in Catalonia ICT is one of Catalonia ’ s most dynamic sectors . It has one of the most important industrial clusters in Europe , with a group of highly competitive software developers , which provides the region with a high capacity to create innovative solutions adapted to the reality of each vertical of the industry or services , in addition to the fact that these solutions are validated and even co -created by future users before they are launched onto the market . In 2018 , the Catalan ICT industry was made up of a total of 15,757 companies , a figure that had grown by 4.5 % in respect to 2017 and increased by a remarkable 27 % since 2013 . Between them , they create 14 https : //nodes.acia.cat 15 https : //agenda.uib.es/29216/detail/ccia2019.html Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 17 106,900 jobs ( 2018 ) and have a turnover of € 16,667 mil lion ( 2016 ) , a figure that has increased by 14 % in the last t wo years .

The diagram below includes the main facts associated to the Catalan start -up ecosystem . 16 https : //www.eu -startups.com/2018/11/top -15-europes -biggest -startup -hubs -in-2018/ 17 http : //s tartupshub.catalonia.com/ Figure 10 . Catalan start -ups expressed in figures ( November 2018 ) Source : Analysis of the Barcelona & Catalonia Start -up Hub , 2018 – Government of Catalonia Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 18 In fact , Barcelona is considered the third -favourite start -up hub by 20 % of European founders , who would choose the city to establish their emerging company , after London and Berlin , as ranked by the Startup Heatmap Europe 201818 . Therefore , the ecosystem i n the ICT industry is the result of an unprecedented capacity to bring enterprises together and it stands among Europe ’ s most competitive and dynamic hubs . By way of illustration , the following picture shows a map of the main companies and players in the C atalan ICT industry . 3.2.2 Catal an digital hub , an attractive region for foreign investment The fDi Magazine published by the Financial Times has recognised Catalonia as the most attractive region in southern Europe in terms of foreign investment for 2018 and 2019 .19 This is one of the most prestigious international rankings used by multina tionals to stu dy future business investment projects . It is worth noting the investments made by multina tionals and start -ups of the ICT industry ( 28.6 % of the total in 2017 ) , a sector that creates wealth and qualified jobs with a strong growth potential , which demonstr ates the pulling effect of the technology sector for the Catalan economy . As a whole , investors perceive Catalonia and Barcelona as a very attractive place to invest . The region is rated globally at 3.7 , on a scale of 1 to 5 , with 5 being ‘ very attractive to invest ’ . Asian companies are 18 https : //www.startupheatmap.eu/ 19 http : //catalonia.com/newsletter_news/news/2018/financial -times -recognises -catalonia.jsp Figure 11 .

Source : Sectoral snapshot ‘ The ICT Industry in Catalonia – Government of Catalonia Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 19 those that best rated the region , with 3.73 points , followed by European and American companies , with 3.70 and 3.65 points respectively . A significant number of large multinationals have chosen Catalonia , particularly the Barcelona metropolitan area , to establish their ICT centres : technology -based centres of excellence and digital hubs that provide a service at an international level . In the last three years , the region has attracted centres belonging to Zurich , Axa , Visa , Roche , Allianz , Asics , Lidl , Media Mark and Nestlé , as well as centres owned by technology companies , including Oracle , Cisco , Facebook , Amazon , Microsoft , Satellogic , Siemens , Deloitte , Moodle , Gartner , Igg , Zoughtworks , GFT and NTT Data , among others . These new centres are added to a long list of multinational ICT centres located in Catalonia , which have already positioned Barcelona and Catal onia as one of the world ’ s most important digital connection centres , as shown by this figure : 3.2.3 The AI sector in Catalonia In June 2019 , the government of Catalonia published a techn ology report , ‘ Artificial Intelligence in Catalonia ’ , which defines the ecosystem of companies , universit ies , research and innovation centres that support the AI sector in Catalonia . According to the study , there are 179 companies in Catalonia operating in the field of artificial intelligence . These enterprises currently employ 8,483 people and have a combined turnover of €1.336 billion for activitie s linked to artificial intelligence . The sector is mostly made up of businesses formed by entrepreneurs , of which 63 % are start -ups . According to their segment of the value chain , they are distributed as follows :  Algorithm developers ( 19 )  Consult ancy firm s ( 19 )  Software or device developers ( 134 )  Service providers ( 7 ) Figure 12 . Multinational companies with digital hubs in Catalonia ( February 2019 ) Source : sectoral snapshot ‘ The ICT Industry in Catalonia – Government of Catalonia Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 20 By way of illustration , the following picture shows the map of the companies and players in the Catalan AI ecosystem . 3.3 Scientific and technolog y infrastructures 3.3.1 Scientific i nfrastructures Catal onia has powerful and unique scientific infrastructures at the disposal of both the Spanish and foreign scientific , technological and industrial community . Below are the most strategic scientific infrastructures for developing a rtificial intelligence in Catalonia . - Barcelona Supercomputing Center ( BSC -CNS ) Barcelona Supercomputing Center -Centro Nacional de Supercomputación ( BSC -CNS ) is a scientific facility that offers high performance computing ( HPC ) services and manages MareNostrum , one of the most powerful supercomputers in Europe , located in the Torre Giron a chapel . BSC-CNS is at the service of the international scientific community and the industries that require HPC services . Its multidisciplinary research team and computational facilities –including MareNostrum – convert BSC-CNS into an international centre of excellence in e -Science . Figure 13 . Companies and agents of the AI ecosystem in Catalonia ( June 2019 ) Source : tech nology report ‘ Artificial Intelligence in Catalonia ’ – Government of Catalonia Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 21 Since its creation in 2005 , BSC -CNS has played an active role in fostering HPC in Catalonia and Spain as an essential tool for international competitiveness in science and engineering . The centre manages the Spanish Super computing Network ( RES ) and is a hosting member of the Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe ( PRACE ) . The centre actively participates in the main European HPC initiatives , in close cooperation with other European supercomputing centres and is one o f the institutions most actively involved in setting the EuroHPC joint undertakings into motion . On 7 June 2019 , the European Commission announced that it would invest €100 million in MareNostrum 520 a pre -exascale machine with peak power 17 times higher th an the current supercomputer , MareNostrum 4 , and 10,000 times higher than the supercomputer that began the saga in 2004 , MareNostrum 1 . The decision guarantees Barcelona a leading position in the future map of supercomputing in Europe . - L ’ Anella Científica ( Scientific Ring ) The Anella Científica is an academic and research telecom munica tions network that connects about 80 institutions related to research and innovation , which enabl es users to exchange and process big data in a secure environment . Besides connectivity , with different speeds and modalities , the member institutions are offered numerous additional services . The Anella has a core with a link at 100 Gbps between i ts core nodes ( Campus Nord and Itconic ) that finish in 5 ports , of which one is for the CATNIX neutral Internet exchange point . Each node is connected at 10 Gbps . The Consorci de Serveis Universitaris de Catalunya – CSUC ( Consortium of University Services of Catalonia ) directly manages th e optical technology , switches and routers that enable interconnection between the nodes and connected institutions with a fully dedicated architecture as regards fibres and systems . The Anella Científica is connected to the Spanish academic network , RedIRIS , and via this network it is connected to the other academic networks in Europe and the rest of the world . It is also connected to the Catalonia Neutral Internet Exchange Point ( CATNIX ) , which provides commercial suppliers with excellent connectivit y . 3.3.2 Technolog y infrastructures Thanks to the efforts of public and private entities , Catalonia has first -class technology infrastructures too , which are already operating throughout the entire region . The cross -cutting nature of artificial intelligence fits in perfectly with the strategy to add functionalities to these infrastructures so they may act as a whole to support the fields and sectors where this technology is applied . Described below are the m ost strategic technology infrastructures for the development of artificial intelligence in Catalonia . 20 https : //ja.cat/IRpd7 Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 22 - Public network of optical fibre throughout the territory The government of Catalonia is promoting the deployment of the public network of optical fibre throughout the entire region , so as to provide its own network for corporate connectivity and make use of the surplus network to offer services to telecommunications operators with optimum conditions of competitiveness , thus promoting the development of ad vanced digital technologies . The network currently encompasses over 4,500 km that can provide an effective point of presence in 254 Catalan municipalities . The framework of the National Pact for the Digital Society includes a plan to roll out the public network of optical fibre to connect all the capitals of administrative divisions by 2020 , so as to provide an effective point of presence in all Catalan municipalities and areas of economic activity by 2023 . The plan is to provide 8,500 km of optical fibre o pen to telecommunications operators . In this way , the offer of dark fibre wholesale services and active circuits for deploying the services provided by telecommunications operators in geographical areas , traditionally disadvantaged by the digital fracture , seeks to ensure that the new technology is not only born and rolled out in urban areas concentrated near Barcelona , but to also deploy it in rural environments away from the metropolitan area . The main objective is to convert Catalonia into a connected t erritory that makes use of technology and digital information and uptakes new technological proposals for mobile devices – such as 5G technology – to lead the innovation of public services , accelerate economic growth and promote a more intelligent , sustain able and integrated society . Figure 14 . The public f ibre optic network in Catalonia ( 2023 ) . Source : Government of Catalonia Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 23 - Data Processing Centres The government of Catalonia is the principal consumer of the country ’ s computer systems ; as a result , the tender of the new ICT model put out by the government in 2012 , which combined all the government ’ s Data Processing Centre ( DPC ) infrastructure services , meant that the best DPC infrastructure in the country was deployed in Catalonia . Furthermore , international DPC infrastructure and cloud -based platforms belonging to companies such as IBM , HP , T -Systems and Mediacloud were implemented in Catalonia when the companies that had been awarded the DPC infrastructure services executed their i ndustrial plans . These were added to the first -rate DPC infrastructures that had previously existed in the country . Consequently , in Barcelona and surrounding areas there are three main zones with a concentration of top -notch DPC infrastructure ( Parc de l ’ Alba , Zona Franca/are @ 38 and 22 @ Barcelona ) which positions the region as one of the most important concentrations of Data Processing Centres in Europe . These are i nfrastructures that are at the service of the public and private sector so it may develop dig ital transformation projects and programmes that require processing big data , thus establishing a fundamental asset for developing artificial intelligence in Catalonia .

Threats SWOT Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 25 4 . CATALONIA.AI : the Catalan artificial intelligence strategy The government has put priority on promoting artificial intelligence and aims to su pport the deployment of AI technology , thus making Catalonia a renowned pole of attraction for research , innovation and talent , companies and investors in the field of artificia l intelligence . Through this objective , the government is promoting artificial intelligence in Catalonia . Under the name of CATALONIA.AI , it will deploy a programme of specific actions to strengthen Catalonia ’ s AI ecosystem and lead knowledge creation , social and business application and create solutions based on artificial intelligence aimed towards fostering economic growth and improving people ’ s lives . Catal onia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy is coordinated by the Secretariat for Digital Polic y of the Ministry for Digital Policy and Public Administration of the government of Catalonia , with the direct collaboration of the Secretariat of Business and Competitiveness and the Secretariat of Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and K nowledge , and the participation of the remaining ministries . 4.1 Objecti ves and values CATALONIA.AI is fully aligned with the European objectives associated to the deployment of artificial intelligence and it will consequently promote all the capabilities of the Catalan ecosystem referred to in the previous section , of public or private origin , cooperation , innovation and internationalisation , so as to establish its leadership in southern Europe and become a top player in the global environment . The goals associated to the deployment of the Strategy are listed below :  Boost the AI ecosystem in Cat alonia  Position Catalonia as one of the driving forces of artificial intelligence in Europe  Convert Catal onia , particularly Barce lona , into a global AI hub  Crea te , retain and attract specialised t alent in artificial intelligence in Catalonia  Boost research and innovation in artificial intelligence in Catalonia  Crea te , ma intain and govern an easily accessible open data repository  Encourage companies and institutions to adopt artificial intelligence  Train professionals and citizens to use artificial intellige nce  Explain to citizens that artificial intelligence will have a positive impact on their well -being  Promo te a sustainable , comprehensive , secure and fair development of artificial intelligence in Catalonia Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 26 CATALONIA.AI assumes the values of the Barcelona Declaration for the Proper Development and Usage of Artificial Intelligence in Europe21 and fully agrees with the recommendations on artificial intelligence provided by the High -Level Experts of the European Commission . Said recommendations are contained in the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI22 and the Montreal Declaration for a Responsible Development of Artificial Intelligence ,23 which place people , whether they are developers or users , in the centre . Artificial intelligence needs to be able to increa se people ’ s capabilities , not replace their intelligence , and has to help increase individual and collective well -being . In this regard , CATALONIA.AI will promote the development of artificial intelligence in such a way that  It benefits people , societies a nd the planet  It is p lural , divers e and comprehensive in its sources of knowledge  It is s ecure and trustworthy throughout its life cycle  It is applied sensibly  It is r espons ible for its actions  It is t ransparent in its decisions  It respects privacy  It complies with civil , legal and democratic systems  It is aligned with human values  It focuses on people  It is controlled by people 4.2 Strategic pivotal elements of the action plan CATALONIA.AI will deploy a multi -sectoral , cross -cutting plan that focuses on people ; prioritises sectors such as healthcare , mobility , sustainability , productive economy , the agri -food sector and public services ; and will be established in an action plan that revolves around the pivotal elements listed below : • Ecos ystem : promote a cross -cutting governance model that supports the development of a coordinated ecosystem of artificial intelligence connected to the rest of the world . • Research and innovation : boost research and innovation by applying specific instruments and establishi ng synergies between public authorities , specialised research and innovation centres and organisations that use artificial intelligence intensively . • Talent : create , attract and retain specialised talent that fosters the development of artificial intelligen ce solutions and transfer of knowledge to society , while training citizens and professionals of other sectors to be ready for its impact . • Infrastructure and data : have the necessary infrastructures for the development of artificial intelligence and provide secure access to public and private data . 21 https : //www.bdebate.org/sites/default/files/barcelona -declaration_v7 -1-eng.pdf 22 https : //www.huntonprivacyblog.com/ ? attachment_id=17432 23 https : //www.declarationmontreal -iaresponsable.com/ Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 27 • Adop tion of artificial intelligence : promote the incorporation of artificial intelligence to drive innovation in Public Administration and strategic sectors , including agri -food , healthcare and well being , the environment , mobility , tourism , culture and industry . • Ethics and society : promote the development of ethical artificial intelligence that respects applicable legislation , is compatible with our social and cultural norms and focuses on people . The lines of action and initiatives associated to each one of the six pivotal elements are shown below : 4.2.1 Ecos ystem One of the key elements for AI development is having a strong and coordinated ecosystem where the different agents are connected to enable them to create synergies , complement each other when tackl ing large projects , promote existing initiatives or create new ones . This ecos ystem is made up of universities , research and innovation centres , public bodies , companies , investors and support institutions . Its governance , and the relationship between each other and other existing ecosystems have to make Catalonia into a renowned pole of attraction in artificial intelligence . 4.2.1.1 Crea tion of a cross -cutting and open govern ance structure One of the priorities of the Catalan strategy is to create an organisation whose operations will focus on heading the promotion of the Catalan AI ecosystem . This structure will be responsible for governance of the Catalan strategy and , among other matters , this will involve managing the resources , infrastructure , talent , opportunities , alliances and ensure that the established plan and strategy is accomplished with transparency , equality and ethics . CATALONIA.AI has to be the front door for AI research and innovation projects and initiatives , as well as associated solutions and developments . CATALONIA.AI has to be the frame of reference of cutting edge technology and must represent the entire community of people who create and use knowledge , with the ability to establi sh connect ions . It should also be able to receive local and international funding , align collaborations between public and private stakeholders and establish cooperation between leading international entities in this field . In this regard , an open , plural , transparent and multidisciplinary community will be created under the umbrella of the Strategy in progress , known as CATALONIA.AI ALLIANCE . This alliance will enable players to share knowledge , create and attract ideas and challenges , carry out research , exchange experiences in a participative and coordinated manner with other communities involved in advanced digital technologies , with the capacity to receive funding from Catalonia , Spain and abroad , as well as generate collaboration and knowledge transfer projects . The AI ecosystem is structured around three main areas : the first involves creating knowledge and research of excellence , the second is associated to transfer ring technology to the market and creating impact and the third focuses on creating the ecosystem that will support the creation and growth of start -ups and new solutions . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 28 4.2.1.2 Catal onia as an international AI pole of attraction One of the basic objectives of the CATALONIA.AI Strategy will be to boost international cooperation by establishing collaboration agreements with other ecosystems , associations , companies , universities , and international research and innovation centres of excellence , thus making it possible to create an d develop projects , create joint programmes and benefit from international programmes s uch as Horizon Europe24 or the new programme , Digital Europe ,25 which will drive Europe ’ s future in the next few years , among many other existing possibilities . Barcelona ’ s position as a global l eader in digital technologies , particularly because it is the world capital of mobile technology ( Mobile World Capital26 ) and due to its first -class international con gresses , such as the Mobile World Congress ( MWC Barcelona27 ) , Smart City Expo World Congress28 and IoT Solutions World Congress ,29 together with the existence of infrastructure and first -class research and innovation centres ( including the Barcelona Supercomputing Center ) , are all elements of maximum visibility that will dra w companies , research and innovation centres that are at the forefront of artificial intelligence , so as to establish operational hubs or create joint projects , thus s ignificant ly increas ing the quality of projects produced by the ecosystem as a whole and collaborations with the innovative , entrepreneurial and investigational network that previously existed in our country . Within this context , it would be worthwhile to create a n advanced catalogue of technologies , CATALONIA.AI TECHNOLOGY , which would include technology -based companies , research and innovation centres , knowledge -creati ng companies and success stories of our ecosystem , thus boosting Catalonia ’ s presence in international events and providing leading international business decision -makers and investors with a well -structured and attractive critical mass and showing how technological development in artificial development impacts our society and people ’ s well -being . In a similar way as the other major events related to advanced digital techno logies held in Barcelona every year , it will be necessary to study the possibility of bringing close or granting an international AI event to Catalonia . In addition , work will be accrued out to promote the development of international events related to art ificial intelligence in line with those that already exist , such as the AI & Cognitive Systems Forum30 that forms part of the IoT Solutions World Congress , the International Congress of the Catalan Association of Artificial Intelligence or the BigData Congr ess,31 organi sed by Eurecat . As regards the CATALONIA.AI Strategy and the associated international component , a network of international ambassadors and AI project hunters will be created , a s well as an advisory council . Both will be made up of renowned leaders from the world of research and innovation in artificial intelligence , researchers , advisors and business managers with proven experience in international 24 https : //ec.europa.eu/info/designing -next-research -and-innovation -framework -programme/what -shapes -next-framework programme_en 25 https : //ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/commission -welcomes -agreement -digital -europe -programme -2021 -2027 26 https : //mo bileworldcapital.com 27 https : //www.mwcbarcelona.com 28 http : //www.smartcityexpo.com 29 https : //www.iotsworldcongres s.com 30 https : //www.iotsworldcongress.com/congress/tracks -themes/ai -cognitive -systems -forum -2/ 31 https : //bigdatacongress.barcelona/ Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 29 projects and markets , either from Catalonia or outside , or e ntities , companies or institutions with which collaboration is already underway or could be of interest . Likewise , as part of the internationalisation strategy , in addition to the presence of CATALONIA.AI in international events , government delegations abr oad and the International Network of Trade and Investment Offices will collaborate in order to ensure contact with people and entities of the highest level and promote the creation of opportunities and projects for Catalan entities and companies that work in this field . 4.2.1.3 An attractive country for national and international AI investment In recent years the presence of international companies and investors involved in advanced digital technologies has increased exponentially in our region . In this reg ard , the decision taken by different multinationals to establish their digital operations in Catalonia must not be ignored by the international ecosy stem , and it is therefore necessary to make it known and consequently take advantage of the opportunities it offers . In this regard , both CATALONIA.AI TECHNOLOGY , mentioned above , and the direct collaboration of the Agency for Business Competitiveness ( ACCIÓ ) , in charge of the foreign investment programme , Invest in Catalonia ,32 have to be able to boost the kno wledge transfer processes and improve the connection of technology created in the region with national and international economic , social and business sectors with the capacity to invest in individual or cooperation AI-based project s. This capacity must no t only translate into having favo urable locations or technologies , noteworthy research and innovation centres , or companies with products under development , but must also imply setting up favourable tax measures and encourage digitisation between companies as a fundamental element of present and future competitiveness . The CATALONIA.AI Strategy includes promoting different actions geared towards encouraging cooperative or financial investment , especially in technology -based companies , research and innovatio n centres and groups . This will be achieved by setting up tax incentives or loans with favourable conditions , for example , those linked to connection programmes with the European Investment Bank or the European Commission ’ s Investment Plan for Europe . Likewise , following other experiences in our region , priority will be given to holding Investment Forums or Investment Readiness Series as part of the activities carried out by the Barcelona & Catalonia Sta rtup Hub , the previously mentioned congresses or others associated to AI sectoral applications . An application will also be created , CATALONIA.AI INVESTMENT , which will include information about investors , professionals and companies that wish to invest in digital technologies , especially in relation to artificial intelligence . This application will enable potential investors or licensees to be in direct contact with technologies under development and , furthermore , specific actions will be carried out to at tract new investors to the system and training programmes will be offered with the purpose of structuring an investment network with interest in the knowledge created in Catalonia in the field of digital technolog ies as a whole , and particularly in artific ial intelligence . 32 http : //catalonia.com Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 30 4.2.2 Re search and innovation The competitiveness of Catalan companies largely depends on improving the productiv e model and increasing associated productivity . This change requires firm ly supporting research and innovation , considering all the stakeholders in the Catalan system and , instead of seeking excellence , it needs to tackle real problems , especially in relation to knowledge transfer and the professional management of the associated activities . In the present context , the key fac tors of Catalonia ’ s international competitiveness are excellent basic knowledge and the capacity for technological development in artificial intelligence . In this regard , the different agents of research and innovation that work with artificial intelligenc e need to be promoted and coordinated , so Catalonia may become a pole of attraction in the creation and transfer of knowledge towards the different productive sectors . 4.2.2.1 Conne ction and strengthening of AI research and innovation entities The Catalan research and innovation system has a high number of public and private research and innovation groups , institutes and centres that specialise in artificial intelligence ; however , greater coordination and joint work is required to create sufficient critical mass to respond to the social needs and business challenges of the different areas of action . In this regard , a centralised or network -based operational structure will be created or adapted with the purpose of promoting s ynergies between groups , institute s , universities , companies , research and innovation centres specialised in artificial intelligence , thus creating synergies and collaborations to boost joint activity at home and abroad . The members of the structure will work together to define the priorit y objectives in this field , in line with social and industrial requirements and encouraged by the new European research and innovation programmes for oncoming years . An Advanced Research and Innovation Programme in the field of artificial intelligence will also be promoted in order to give additional support to research groups , institutes and public centres that carry out AI projects in Catalonia . Challenges will be established aimed towards resolving social or business issues related to artificial intellig ence with adequate monitoring of the developed activities . This programme may be linked to the advanced digital technologies programme and will have the clear purpose of developing innovative solutions for industry that respond to real needs previously identified by associations and business entities , thus complementing the challenges provided by the governmental bodies associated to the previously mentioned programme . Like previous projects , they will be of a collaborative nature and will be exclusively addressed to public research and innovation centres , as well as technology -based companies that are in the process of technological development . One of the programme ’ s priorities will be to combine different digital technologies , for example , artificial in telligence with the internet of things ( IoT ) and blockchain technologies , exploring the distributed intelligence models also related to future 5G networks . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 31 Final ly , great importance will be placed on supporting business R & D+i in AI , especially when it is carried out by companies with their own innovation centres or that plan to implement them in Catalonia in the near future . Support will be given to actions a imed towards setting up industrial pilot projects , prototypes or proof of concepts in real environm ents of advanced technology , seeking funding for innovations associated to business growth , fostering participation in international projects and making use of tax incentives . In conclusion , a double task aimed towards promoting and funding business initiatives that have taken the firm decision to create wealth and create employment in Catalonia . 4.2.2.2 Opening of the Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence Catalan companies and institutions need an immediate reference to be able to see for t hemselves how artificial intelligence will impact the different sectors of action and to receive the necessary guidance when they first adopt artificial intelligence , especially in the case of SMEs . Within this context , the Centre of Excellence in Artifici al Intelligence ( CoE AI ) will enter into operation , following the model of the Digital Innovation Hubs33 set up by the European Commission . Said centre will provide companies and institutions with a reference and will work at their service to demonstrate the benefits of AI and accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies when applying artificial intelligence and using data created by the system as a whole . The CoE AI , created as a network -based service centre , will become a key element of CATALONIA.AI in relation to promoting knowledge transfer and executing joint projects between knowledge -creating entities and companies and user institutions , which demand innovative AI solutions . As regards SMEs , the centre will promote an AI application programme that will include activities focused on dissemination and awareness -raising , providing consulting services and guidance for digitisation , as well as offering support in the implementation of projects by way of digitisation vouchers used to implement ICT solutions , especially in the field of artificial intelligence . 4.2.2.3 AI knowledge transfer to boost business innovation More and more companies are choosing open innovation as part of their business strategies , whether it is due to long development time s , in the case of the pharmaceutical industry , or because staying at the forefront requires continuous technological updates , as in the case of the ICT industry . In respect to advanced technologies , like artificial intelligence , the specific circumstances are related to the latter , and therefore require a continuous development effort , particularly in the search for new applications for specialised sectors . Within this context , it is essential to boost the mutual commitment of companies and public AI resear ch and innovation entities by creating mixed public -private networks , institut es and units so as 33 http : //s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/digital -innovation -hubs Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 32 to create strategic alliances , set up innovative joint projects , not just services , take advantage of the pulling effect of large companies and encourage a rat ional use of existing resources , infrastructure and technology platforms . Likewise , boosting clusters or the participation of sectoral business associations in the application of digital technologies will spread their use as a basis of industrial competiti veness , while developing new business models with an international outlook . In this regard , beyond the creation of possible programmes or collaboration projects , it is also important to make use of previously existing programmes , such as the Industrial Doctorates Plan ,34 CERCA Gínjol35 or the Knowledge Industry ,36 with a special view that emphasises advanced digital technologies , particularly artificial intelligence . A pending challenge related to the system as a whole , a key factor for knowledge transfer , also in artificial intelligence , is to drive a specialised map of capabilities to be able to connect technologies , services and local companies with international environments , as well as detect existing weaknesses in the business network and strengthen th e identified fields of action , either as creators or users . This map applied to artificial intelligence will help make better use of the current capabilities of the Catalan research and innovation system , will foster collaboration between companies and pri vate and public institutions and facilitate talent attraction and retention , domestic and international investment and technology , thus creating economic and social value . Another key element in the relationships between knowledge -creating companies and pu blic entities is trust , in the real technological capability and in terms of development . It is therefore necessary to position Catalan universities and research and innovation centres as outstanding and trustworthy suppliers for companies , based on the de velopment of own technology , establishment of public and private collaborations and service provision . This positioning in the AI field will be accompanied by a definition of objectives and the establishment of innovation -based indicators that could have e ffects on the implementation of specific mechanisms that boost these activities , such as the creation of centres of excellence similar to those mentioned above . It is worth noting the necessary effort for promoting the incuba tion , ac celeration and internationalisation of technology -based companies , especial ly those arising from the research and innovation centres of the public system with AI-based tec hnologies or which are directly applied to the productive sectors where there is an availability of existing tec hnologies . In this regard , together with ACCIÓ , assessment programmes will be implemented to validate the business model , validate and attract the first customers and seek funding to obtain the necessary boost and be recognised as stakeholders of interest by medium and large -sized companies . Another outstanding feature is the collaboration that could arise with the previously existing acceleration and incubation programmes in the country , such as those linked to Programa Catalunya Emprèn ( Embark Catalonia Programme ) 37 driven by the ministry of Business and Knowledge or The Collider programme38 of Mobile World Capital 34 http : //doctoratsindustrials.gencat.cat 35 http : //ginjol.cerca.cat 36 http : //universitatsirecerca.gencat.cat/ca/03_amb its_dactuacio/Transferencia -de-coneixement/programa -industria -delconeixement/ 37 http : //catempren.gencat.cat 38 https : //thecollider.tech Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 33 Barcelona , a s well as others of the private sector , such as Seedrocket , Conector , Ship2B , Wayra and BStar tup , which include own public and private initiatives that could be highly relevant for the Strategy . 4.2.2.4 Innovative public procurement as an AI development path Through the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and the initiatives related to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology ( EIT ) ,39 especially the EIT Digital Community ,40 in recent years the European Commission has developed different innovative public procurement projects , particularly in the healthcare sector , which are added to public initiatives habitually carried out in our system through the Public Procurement Platform . Together with pre -commercial public procurement , still under development , t his action is constitutes a fundamental element for the future of artificial intelligence in Catalonia , not only because of the public funds it involves but also due to the mobilisation of the existing technologies in the productive network , the boost of proofs of concept in different fields and the participation of the set of stakeholders of the research and innovation system . With the wish to convert Catalonia into a leading pole of attraction in artificial intelligence in oncoming years , the CATALONIA.AI Strategy and the Advanced Digital Technologies Programme have established as priority that the services of the government of Catalonia put out to tender by the different ministries must respond to challenges of Public Administration as a mechanism to attract collaborative projects and proposals from public and private research and innovation age nts as a whole . In this regard , priority will be given to entities responsible for the project with equipment , prototypes and/or AI innovation projects when the request for proposal is issued and , especially if these projects have been developed within the framework of European initiatives or have been funded by programmes associated to RIS3CAT o r similar . The ultimate goal is to ensure that AI technologies impact the government ’ s different departments and respond to both current needs and new services and projects of the different ministries . Preference will be given to tenderers with their own equipment that can be used in related projects in different testing environments , such as health , agriculture , mobility , industry , culture and education , among other s. 4.2.3 Talent The existing talent in Catalonia is a necessary and indispensable resource for promoting the development of the AI ecosystem ; it is therefore strategic for the region to provide citizens and professionals with the required competencies and capabilities to effectively apply artificial intelligence in Catalonia . Within this context , it is essential to have adequate training that guarantees the deployment and uptake of the tec hnologies associated to artificial i ntelligence in order to continuously produce new professionals that fulfil social and business requirements . 39 https : //eit.europa.eu/ 40 https : //www.eitdigital.eu/ Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 34 4.2.3.1 Talent management in AI : creation , attraction and retention Programmes for research talent in AI Initiatives for improving the offer of universities will be promoted and supported with courses , seminars , master ’ s degree and postgraduate degrees in the technology and non -technology fields related to artificial intelligence with the purpose of satisfyin g the needs of current and future professionals . Within this context , university -business collaboration mechanisms will be implemented with the purpose of better -adjusting the curriculum to social and business requirements that boost innovation and researc h centred on providing technological solutions . As regards official postgraduate courses , master ’ s and doctoral degrees in artificial intelligence , specific action will be taken to know the situation in the different universities and promote top -quality , professionalising and participative programmes partly funded by institutions and companies that use the technologies in different fields of activity , while considering the possibility of establishing one or more inter -university courses . The action will be carried out by a working group consisting of representatives of universities , knowledge -creating entities and entities that use AI technologies , so as to exchange knowledge , experiences and establish appropriate content and the most effective collaboratio n mechanisms . At the same time , work will be carried out to internationalise the courses , with the purpose of attracting international students and foster ing relationships with top -level entities and specific content . This will be achieved by way of the Erasmus+ programmes through the KA241 collaborative actions and Initial Training Network ( ITN-Marie Curie42 ) , respectiv ely , as well as others that could be implemented in our system in the future , with a view to predoctoral researchers ( R1 ) . In relation to tea ching and research staff involved in advanced digital technologies , especially artificial intelligence , who have reached junior postdoctoral ( R2 ) and senior p ostdoctoral ( R3 ) stages , with the inclusion of Catalan and interna tional talent that is currently distributed all over the world in foreign research centres , specific actions will be carried out with the purpose of creating a proprietary programme , CATALONIA.AI TALENT , based on some of our successful models , like the current ICREA SÈNIOR43 or previous ICREA JÚNIOR , which may benefit from co -funding opportunities offered by smart specialisation programmes and the European Social Fund , the real co -funding options of research and innovation centres and the activities associated to the Marie Cu rie programme within the Horizon programme , especially the Cofund scheme .44 This will guarantee more resources and increased presence of advanced digital technologies in general , and artificial intelligence in particular , throughout our research and innovat ion system . Programmes for innovati ve talent in AI In recent years , the Catalan university and research system has reached renowned levels of excellence . Now is the time to deploy suitable actions to transfer the accomplished level to society , especial ly to the productive and business network , mostly consisting of SMEs , in such a way the knowledge may 41 https : //eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus -plus/actions/key -action -2-cooperation -for-innovation -and-exchange -good -practices_en 42 https : //ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/ 43 https : //www.icrea.cat/es/la -seleccion -de-icrea 44 https : //ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/co -funding -programmes_en Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 35 also create wealth , employment and social improvement . Within this context , it is essential to encourage professionals in universities and research and innov ation centres to work together with experts from companies , foster permanent contact by forming joint teams and favour knowledge transfer . The development of research and innovation in Catalonia is structured into different levels , universities , centres , n etworks , departments , consolidated groups and , lastly , individual researchers , which form a complex ecosystem that is not always well coordinated . As regards this point , the announcement of grants to support the activities of research groups45 ( SGR ) provide s the opportunity to have an advanced map of the existing groups and , in the case of artificial intelligence , those that work in any area of knowledge . To th is end , a ctions will be performed focused on boosting training and attracting projects related to these groups , while working on a similar map for private knowledge creating entities , companies and user institutions . Subsequently , work will be carried out to take maximum advantage of the opportunities offered by the Industrial Doctoral programme implem ented a few years ago in Catalonia , which has leading names from Spain and Europe . The programme will act as a preferential path to connect public centres , institutions and companies interested in digital transformation and the application of AI technologi es . The results obtained and eventual synergies could b e the embryo of new appro aches to attract talent , for example , by establishing mixed public private AI units or specific consortiums . In parallel , thanks to European funds associated to initiatives suc h as RIS3CAT , Cofund and own resources of the private sector , and as part of the CATALONIA.AI TALENT programme , work will be carried out on an initiative for attracting digital talent to enable permanent contact between research and innovation centres and companies , possibly within the framework of CATALONIA.AI COMMUNITY or associated sectoral networks , thus providing investigational and innovation mobility , following models such as Tecniospring , Beatriu de Pinós Empresa , Connect -EU , Marie Curie Incoming and Outcoming Grants , and Torres Quevedo , in connection with incubators , innovative companies and national and international research and innovation centres . A final very significant fact , albeit rather under -developed , is the lack of professionals dedicated to connection within the research and innovation system , other than the people working in offices where research results are transferred . The majority of these people have hardly any experience in the digital field and even less in AI technologies . In thi s regard , the support obtained from universities as a result of the announcement of grants to carry out knowledge -transfer and assessment unit projects is the first step for strengthening activities centred on connecting the system as a whole , although it is insufficient if we l imit ourselves to the general field of digital actions , and artificial intelligence in particular , while excluding the rest of research and innovation centres . For this reason , there are plans to promote an activity as part of the CATALONIA.AI TALENT programme and co -funded by other receiving centres , with the purpose of incorporating digital innovators , who will work in a network and manage innovation and digital knowledge -transfer in a specific area of action , such as innovators o r 45 http : //agaur.gencat.cat/ca/beques -i-ajuts/convocatories -per-temes/Ajuts -per-donar -suport -a-les-activitats -dels-grups -de-recerca SGR Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 36 entrepreneurs in residence to attract ideas and new projects to be developed , as a reference for companies and institutions interested in digital technologies and linked to artificial intelligence . Collabora tion with the Barcelona digital talent alliance To ensure Barcelona and Catalonia ’ s competitiveness as a technological pole in advanced digital technologies as a whole and , specifically , artificial intelligence , the government of Catalonia in collaboration with other public and private institutions has set into motion the BARCELONA DIGITAL TALENT46 alliance , with the idea of positioning Barcelona as a place with the capacity to create , retain and attract talent with the necessary knowledge and capabilities to develop this new industry . Barcelona Digital Talent is an alliance created with the purpose of positioning the city of Barcelona as a pole of digital talent , thus responding to the lack of specific talent in the city and the increase of technology -based businesses that need profiles with digital comp etencies . Barcelona ’ s experience is highly relevant for the entire region ; consequently , work will be carried out with other members of the alliance to create other poles within Catalonia that can replicate the experience and form other alliances between companies , public bodies and training centres , similar to the one described for Barcelona . This territorial digital component , which will be included in the CATALONIA.AI TALENT programme , will give preference to talent associated to AI development and will spread this ability to create , retain and attract talent to the rest of Catalonia . The work established in the programme will have three facets : promote digital technologies throughout the region , know the existing professional profiles and identify busin ess requirements . Likewise , training programmes will be drawn up to satisfy existing need s and will focus on training wellqualified professionals , ranging from university courses to vocational training programmes and the development of vocational training in these fields of knowledge . Final ly , working in direct contact with companies and user institutions , priority will be placed on developing a professional career in artificial intelligence and in identifying Barcelona and Catal onia as an international pl ace of reference . All these activities may be co -funded in collaboration with the Servei d ’ Ocupació de Catalunya ( Catalan Employment Service ) , by way of the innovative and experimental project programme , use of funds from the European Social Fund , initiati ves associated to the Erasmus+ programme and own resources from the interested private sector . Program mes for entrepreneurial talent in artificial intelligence Artificial intelligence will make it easier to create new applications that may be offered in different fields of the productive and social network . This will entail the appearance of new companies and entrepreneur ial programme s , whose objective is to implement and market these technologies in different sectors , as a renewal point of the Catalan pr oductive network , particularly as regards knowledge -creators and making professional development really possible for scientists and innovators in Catalonia . 46 https : //barcelonadigitaltalent.com Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 37 In this regard , as part of the Embark Catalonia Programme of the government of Catalonia and the associated Xarxa Emprèn network , projects will be promoted to foster entrepreneurial talent in the AI environment , while putting priority on this technology in existing programmes in Catalonia that are directed towards fostering technological development ; fo r example , the I NNOVAR Programme through start -ups,47 driven by ACCIÓ o r the Knowledge Industry Programme developed by AGAUR . An e xample o f this kind of initiative is the programme called AI4ALL , Artificial Intelligence Applied to Industry ,48 promoted by the UAB Research Park , the Computer Vision Center and the Autonomous University of Barcelona with the purpose of bringing AI technologies closer , create new market ideas and help boost Catalonia ’ s competitiveness in this field . This initiative forms part of the programme to promote specialised entrepreneurship in the territory ( a pre -accelerator programme ) and constitutes an embryo of great value as regards developing a programme with a general scope . The work will be carried out in collaborati on with the territory , the Catalan Employment Service and the institutions that use AI technologies , rather than coordinating with other existing public or private initiatives . In this regard , a programme of reference will be promoted based on existing goo d practices , in collaboration with public and private stakeholders , especially training centres , research and innovation centres , business associations and entities that use AI technologies . In the same way , taking advantage of the opportunities linked to European programmes , efforts will be made to create an entrepreneurial community in the field of AI technologies , based on the possibilities offered by the Erasmus+ programmes . This will be a chieved by strategic alliances , programmes developed by consortiums and the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Medium -sized Enterprises programme ( COSME49 ) , through the Erasmus programme for young entrepreneurs , which will enable exchanges between new entrepreneurs and experienced European entrepreneurs through the creation of consortiums . In this regard , an initiative associated to Advanced digital technologies will be developed , especially artificial intelligence , which includes the European coun tries that have made the most progress in the subject . Training in artificial intelligence for everyone Artificial intelligence forms part of our daily lives and in the future , it will have an even greater impact on all industries and individuals . Everyone will have the chance to understand what artificial intelligence really is and the way it could impact our lives ; for this reason , it is a priority to democratise the knowledge of these technologies and empower citizens so they may play a more active role in its deployment . In this regard , CATALONIA.AI includes the implementation of a training programme for citizens , to teach the basics of artificial intelligence to anyone interested in this technology . The programme will consist in offering free courses th at will adjust to each student ’ s needs and capabilities , taking advantage of existing educational technologies , such as massive open online courses , classroom -based and online employment and ongoing training programmes , as well as other activities that may be 47 https : //barcelonadigitaltalent.com 48 http : //www.accio.gencat.cat/ca/serveis/innovacio/startups -i-innovacio -disruptiva/innovar -a-traves -de-startups/ 49 https : //ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cosme_en Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 38 carried out throughout Catalonia , drawing on collaboration with the corresponding public bodies of the ICT network50 and CatLABS network ,51 which already exist , or working in cooperation with technological parks and training entities . To develop this initiative , an agreement will be established with similar international initiatives that have a successful track record , like the course created by the company Reaktor and the University of Helsinki , Elements of AI ,52 which already has 170,00 students from 110 different countries . Besides the programme ’ s dissemination campaign , agreements will be made with companies and Catalan institutions so they may promote training among their collaborators , therefore reaching the maximum number of entities and citizens in the country . Foster vocations in artificial intelligence In a digital society it is absolutely necessary to train both present and future users . In this regard , schools and the younger students need to know , have contact and be familiar with cutting -edge technological tools , such as artificial intelligence . Children feel drawn towards a vocation during the ir first years at school . This mean s having to design an effective vocational plan in artificial intelligence within the framework of the STEMcat Plan , implemented by the government of Catalonia . The Plan should not only include activities in primary and secondary schools : working with families , giving talks , organising workshops , providing support networks , carrying out specific activities in schools and preparing the corresponding teaching and audio -visual material , but it should consider redesigning primary and secondary curriculum plans to include content that stimulates computational thinking and prepares students for artificial intelligen ce , incorporating gender perspective and training teaching staff to introduce this content . Likewise , within the field of vocational training , it is necessary to guarantee training pathways that are directly linked to Catalonia ’ s social and economic requir ements , placing special emphasis on advanced digital technologies , not included at present as a training speciality in intermediate and higher level training program mes of the Information and Communications family , apart from specific profiles like cyberse curity and bioinformatics . Given the lack of digital talent detected , it is indispensable to establish a specific programme in advanced digital technologies , at intermediate and higher level vocational training , which ensures a better and fuller inclusion in the employment market and takes advantage of the poten tialities currently offered by the dual vocational training , among other aspects to consider . 4.2.3.2 Boost the role of women in artificial intelligence The extremely low presence of women in the technology industry is a well known fact . According to a study drawn up by the Catalan Women 's Institute ,53 only 30 % of the jobs in the Catalan ICT industry 50http : //www.punttic.gencat.cat / 51http : /catlabs.cat/ 52https : //www.elementsofai.com/ 53 http : //dones.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Noticia/Dossier -TIC-2019 Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 39 are held by women . Bearing in mind that the report publish ed in November 2018 by the European Center for the Development of Vocational Training54 forecasts that by 2025 , 84.5 % of jobs will be in the technological field , the low presence of women in the industry means that in the near future , they will run the huge risk of being excluded from employment for gender reasons . In the field of universities , the number of men studying information and communications technologies is four times higher than the number of women ; in the case of computer engineering , one of the core degrees in the field of artificial intelligence , the situation is worse , as there is only one woman for every 10 men studying this degree in Catalonia . The last factor of the equation is that artificial intelligence is an emerging sector in full grow th . In fact , according to a report published by Randstad , the demand of technological professions in Europe will increase every year by 14 % until 2025 , and artificial intelligence is at the head of this movement . Thus , the number of professionals required by AI is much higher than the number created by universities . At the moment , there is a significant lack of professional s , which practically determines full employment in the sector . Consequently , we are faced by a picture where there are not enough women at all levels of the ICT industry , especially in decision -making positions , and the ir presence in university degrees that qualify them for this sector is extremely low . However , the re is room to reverse this trend as the offer is sufficiently large for eve ryone . It is important to work towards rebalancing the presence of women in the sector for a number of reasons : 1 . The intention is to comply with article 32 of Act 17/2015 , of 21 July , on effective equality between women and men and establishes measures to ensure equality between men and women in access to work , vocational training , professional promotion and working conditions . 2 . Given the lack of professionals qualified to work in the general ICT industry , the re are huge opportunities to access the employme nt market of this sector , particularly for women . Consequently , in view of the trend of the employment sector , access to the employment market is guaranteed for women with technical qualifications . 3 . A plural view always enriches the exercise of professions and ICT is not an exception . A feminine view is necessary to build a comprehensive and equalitarian future . Women ’ s perspectives create quite a conclusive differentiating factor : according to Forbes , whenever women have led projects and/or companies , they have overcome situations of crisis with greater success . There are basically two critical points in this aspect : very few girls have a technological vocation , so their interest in technolog y-based professions needs to be awakened and they must be encourage d to study scientific and technical degrees , and women encounter difficulties when it comes to exercising leadership in the sector , which implies promoting the participation of women in the management of organisations in technological fields . 54 http : //www.cedefop.europa.eu/ Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 40 Catal onia is aware of the situation and a first network of agents is currently tackling the problem . The government is deploying the Pla Dona TIC ( Women 's ICT Plan ) , promoted by the Catalan ministry for Digital Policy and Public Administration , thus providing a n inst itutional protective framework for boosting female presence in the ICT industry . In recent years , emblematic entities of the AI sector have set a benchmark with their gender structures in these matters , for ex ample , the Col·legi Oficial d ’ Enginyeria Informàtica de Catalunya ( Catalan Association of Computer Engineering ) and the gender gap commission , Dones COEINF , the Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence and the donesIAcat working group and the UPC with its Aquí STEAM programme , which , in tu rn , collaborate with other entities to study the gender gap in artificial intelligence and computer engineering and help reduce it . In this regard , the CATALONIA.AI Strategy will focus on drawing up an action plan that will be developed within the framework of the Pla Dona TIC , implemented by the government of Catalonia , with the collaboration of different existing initiatives . The plan will have the following objectives :  Encourag e early vocations in technology ;  Balance the presence of women in ICT training and skills within the field of vocational training , university studies and postgraduate courses ;  Foster ongoing training that requalifies women so they may enter the AI sector ;  Ensure women have equal rights to access employment in the sector ;  Enable mechanisms to encourage women to continue exercising the profession within the field of artificial intelligence throughout their entire working lives ;  Encourage companies , entities , and public and private bodies to establish professional careers that enable women to reach leadership positions with equal opportunities ;  Especially prevent the flight of female talent and encourage migrated human capital to return .  Establi sh a legal order for gender -related actions in the field of artificial intelligence and technologies in general to increase the effectiveness of actions aimed towards achieving the objectives described above in which women and men collaborate together under th ese guidelines . It is important at all levels to make known and give visibility to successful women , both in schools and the Catalan society in general . This may be carried out on a small scale by giving ta lks in the different forums mentioned above , awarding prizes to recognise the achievements of women in technology ( there ar e already a few in Catalonia ) , or at a larger scale , by means of actions on social media , coordinated with well -known influencers or influencers like YouTubers or YouTube personalities with the highest number of followers , writing stories or comics where women appear with technological roles and their presence in the media , news programmes or series where visibility is given to these leading names or which show what it means to develop a profession in the field of artificial intelligence . As regards leadership , the development of a plan to support women ’ s working lives in the AI field that combines services related to professional guidan ce , requalification , ongoing training , work -life balance and professional promotion that respects the specific conditions of female s in professional development and the system of valid accreditations . Incentives for companies with female managers , Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 41 subsidy programmes in the field of artificial intelligence led by women ( at either a professional or research level ) could effectively help reverse the current trend in the sector . A fourth pivotal element will be the establish ment of mechanisms to identif y and qu antify the flight of female talent in the past and institutional actions will be designed to facilitate the return of this talent . Several small actions are currently underway in many fields : schools , companies , entities and institutions that work in this direction , donesCOEINF , donesIAcat , the fent.talent platform and the Aquí STEAM programme are just a few examples , though there are many more . It is essential to identify , arrange and coordinate these actions , strategically integrating them into more effective instruments in the Catalan society , so they may work as a whole with greater strength , thus increasing their impact , which will be appropriately monitored and measured . As mentioned above , the establishment of a general regulation would help mult iply the effect of this network , which is already in operation . It is worth pointing out that all these actions will only be possible if they are performed by women and men working together . Furthermore , even if the necessary resources are provided , the ac tions w ould not be possible without the tireless work carried out by volunteers , who are currently moving them forwards Consequently , both women and men , as well as institutions need to be made aware of the matter . 4.2.4 Infrastructures and data One of the European Commission ’ s priorities in its strategic proposal for the development of artificial intelligence in Europe is precisely making the access to data easier and more secure to be able to explore and deploy all the potentialities of artificial intelligence . In fact , without quality data it would not be possible to properly develop artificial intelligence ; therefore , the Catalan strategy also considers that accessing and sharing data with the aim of developing products and services with artificia l intelligence is one of the first priorities . 4.2.4.1 Promo tion of laboratories and infrastructures The rapid evolution of the market , not only in the field of artificial intelligence , but also in the general technology field , and a need to search for go od solutions to problems that must be fast and smooth when accessing the market , as well as capable of adapting to the market ’ s reality translates into the need to create a prototyping environment that allows to share experiences , data , algorithms , modules , computer capacity , etc . in order to test and adapt solutions to the market . CATALONIA.AI LAB will be implemented as a sharing and testing environment that acts as a window open to ideas and surrounding initiatives , which can then be gathered and classifi ed : social innovation by people for people . It has a dual purpose , to promote the technology sector offering access to infrastructure and boost open innovation with companies and public bodies through t heir participation in pilot tests . The work in this field will also count on the collaboration of specialised research and innovation agents to provide the projects with existing computer and data -analysis infrastructure ; for example , the Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 42 Barcelona Supercomputing Center , Institut de Robòtic a i Informàtica Industrial , the Industrial Platform 4.0 or the labs and demonstration area of the Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence , among others . 4.2.4.2 Access and sharing of data One of the essential and differentiating components of an ar tificial intelligence system are the necessary data to feed any AI system and its appropriate training process . The quality of the data set , the iterations and the suitability of the algorithm training are very important in any AI project . As regards this p oint , the following actions will be promoted :  Publi sh and make available quality open data and improve local research groups ’ access to the information and enable the use of verified information that helps develop the best solutions possible .  Promo te and participate in markets of correct and secure data with other AI communities and ecosystems . The volume and diversity of the data largely contribute to the quality and excellence of the results obtained .  Promo te the production and donation of open an d private data as a fundamental right of the person and as a legacy of quality and social benefit . 4.2.5 Adop tion of artificial intelligence Although at first AI techniques were created with large technology -related companies in mind , more and more companies and public bodies are starting to adopt AI -based solutions . This is due to different factors : better and cheaper computer capacities , increased and better features in mechanical and repetitive processes , increased availability of corporate and ex ternal data , development of prediction capacities and an increasingly more positive correlation between applicability and benefits . In this regard , one of the most important pivotal elements of CATALONIA.AI will be to foster and accelerate AI adoption proc esses in Catalonia ’ s different industrial sectors , as well as in Public Administration itself . 4.2.5.1 Public Administration as a pioneer in the application of artificial intelligence Public Administration is a major data creator , manager and container ; th erefore , it has to lead and set an example as a user of artificial intelligence . The objective is to become an intelligent , efficient and transparent administrator with digital , proactive and personalised public services that simplifies the relationship be tween citizens and optimises their management through process automation . The application of artificial intelligence at the service of the public offers citizens direct and indirect benefits . The direct benefits include those resulting from the application of artificial intelligence to respond to citizens ’ specific needs . Artificial intelligence facilitates and speeds up customer services , it Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 43 makes it easier to fill in forms , pay taxes , diagnose illnesses , take decisions and protect personal data , etc . This new typology of solutions redounds in indirect benefits , improving the quality of public service s , whether it simplifies processes , increas es efficiency , controls fraud , optimises r esources or enables smart management . The Catalan Public Administration has to be the driving force behind AI solutions . Guided by the different government ministries , together with the pertinent bodies it has to gradually adopt AI solutions . However , the goal will only be achievable if it has reliable data and a suitable testin g environment for improving public services ; it will also be necessary to promote a set of initiatives aimed towards accelerating the uptake of innovative technologies when using the data and artificial intelligence , which include the following : Opportunit y detection programme To enable Public Administration to boost the use of AI technology , a first line of action will be to set up a programme to detect and analyse use cases and improvement opportunities for the different departments and bodies of the gove rnment of Catalonia . The goal is to determine how the government of Catalonia and citizens will benefit from technologies of this kind , in regard to specific applications . AI observatory for Public Administration Given the speed at which these kind of technologies are developed and implemented around the world , an AI observatory will be set up , which will take charge of identifying , classifying and analysing the trends , evolution , technological development and deployment of artificial intelligence , both in Catalonia and abroad , as well as assess the different initiatives underway in Catalonia and share the conclusions and created knowledge . Development of use cases In view of the different points mentioned in this section , the government of Catalonia wi ll promote the development of proofs of concept and projects that use AI technologies in the different governmental areas , with the purpose of improving public digital services . In this regard , an interministerial working group will be created that will be in charge of identifying , prioritising and boosting the deployment of this technology in the different departments and bodies of the government of Catalonia . CATALONIA.AI CHALLENGE In order to involve developers , entrepreneurs , start -ups , and small and medium enterprises of Catalonia ’ s AI ecosy stem so they may create new technological solutions , there are plans to launch CATALONIA.AI CHALLENGE , a competi tion that connects the problems and challenges raised by Public Administration with the proposals offe red by the Catalan AI ecosystem , in order to develop proofs of concept and innovative solutions that respond to the outlined challenges . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 44 4.2.5.2 The development of artificial intelligence in strategic sectors The characteristics of AI tec hnologies will lead to the appearance of new products and services specifically aimed towards key economic sectors , including transport , health , the manufacturing industry , logistics and the media , thus enabling them to make use of the benefits of disruptive innovations and improve their competitiveness in comparison to other international environments . Likewise , AI technologies are frequently in the pipeline , although there are already effective products in the market ; consequently , different technological waves are expe cted , meaning that continuous cooperation between the different stakeholders of the ecosystem is even more important . In this regard , a sectoral revitalisation programme will be set in motion to attract business and social challenges , with the aim of devel oping specific services and solution s adapted to existin g needs . Cocreation activities will be carried out to generate proposals that join the supply and demand in different sectors into a single space , so as to analyse potential use cases , view success s tories and identify required proofs of concept , taking advantage of existing programmes or new options that could appear . W ithin this context , the connection activities may be developed as scientific -business forums or gatherings , or through connections with clusters and associations that guarantee maximum effectiveness and sectoral representation , together with the support of the differ ent government departments and local public bodies that promote technological initiatives of a sectoral nature . It is th erefore a matter of identifying the main use cases applicable to artificial intelligence in each sector , disseminate them among businesses and accompany them in their implementation process . Whenever necessary , companies will be encouraged to carry out r esearch and innovation in artificial intelligence , whether it is internal or external ( in this case especially fostering technology transfer with the TECNIO Centres ) . The centre of excellence in artificial intelligence referred to above will be the most suit able environment for starting many of these initiatives . The development of this sectoral revitalisation programme will involve prioritising field s where artificial intelligence is used , according to the leading sectors of RIS3CAT , which does not rule out development in strategic projects in other fields . The priority sectors are initially the following : Agri-food industry The agri sector ( agricultur e , livestock , fishing and silviculture ) and agri -food ( manufacture of food and drink ) represent s 17 % of the Catalonia ’ s industrial gross domestic product ( GDP ) . During the last 20 years , the sector ’ s transformation capacity has converted the agri -food industry into a fundamental part of Catalan manufacturing and , at the same time , into one of the main driving for ces behind the change and transformation of the region ’ s economic model . With over 3,500 companies , the agri -food industry is the industrial branch in Catalonia with the highest turnover , it is the main export sector and is Europe ’ s top agri -food cluster . The application and use of artificial intelligence would focus on optimising natural resources and from the very beginning it is closely linked to the internet of things ( IoT ) , which would increase the efficiency and traceability of agricultural operation s. Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 45 The energy saving and optimisation of natural and own resources open up a wide range of possibilities to be explored . Considering the weight of the sector in Catalonia , this would be one of the priority sectors to develop . Health and well -being The hea lth sector is one of the fields where the use of artificial intelligence has the longest history and a greater projection . This prioritisation is based on two main vectors : i ncreased life expectancy and the projected savings from using artificial intellige nce in health . In the mental health field , artificial intelligence can contribute with innovative non -invasive diagnostic procedures to identify illnesses before symptoms appear and help with profitable triage techniques . Speech and writing analyses are a lready used among other techniques to detect changes in behaviour and even suicidal tendencies . AI -powered social robotics could provide alternative therapies that go beyond conventional treatment ; for example , helping people who suffer autism spectrum dis order . The wide variety of existing medical data ( for example , the clinical records of people living in Catalonia ) , protocolisation of diagnoses and treatments , advances in computer vision and speed with which a large amount of information can be interpreted , used and accessed , in addition to current trends in preventive and personalised medicine , mean that there is a wide field of re search for artificial intelligence and it can provide a high amount of value . Furthermore , the pharmaceutical industry is one of the sectors that benefits from these techniques by using supercomputing and simulation to create and assess new medicinal produ cts . Experienced -based cultural industries The sector known as experiences comprises tourism and culture . The technology applied to these two industries can improve and increase productivity and promote offers and services , while providing information abo ut the offer of competitors and the behaviour of potential customers . In this regard , AI techniques have great potential in specific topics such as marketing , social media management , personalisation of experiences , customer loyalty , improvement of the exi sting offer , etc . Another feature worth pointing out , of a cross -cutting nature , is that artificial intelligence can be used to analyse and interpret existing data gathered from all this activity , thus improving future plans and strategies . Mobilit y This s ector encompasses all the agents that work to develop solutions to make mobility and transport more sustainable : the automotive industry ( manufacturers and suppliers ) , railway industry , physical infrastructures , transport and infrastructure operators , flee t managers , the logistics industry and advanced mobility of people , ICT services ( mobile technologies , V2X communications , self-driving cars , etc . ) , energy distributors , the energy supply industry ( electric vehicle charging points , alternative fuels , etc . ) , public bodies and other institutions with authority in the management and safety of transport in Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 46 Catalonia , or promoters , legislators or users of corporate fleets , universities , research centres and technology centres , as well as individual or collecti ve users , for private means or as a company/entity . Self-driving vehicles , new means of transport , traffic planning and management , such as the adaptive traffic signal control system , are just a small example of the fields of application of data convergenc e , the internet of things and artificial intelligence . Redu ce pollution , prevent accidents and provide everyone with transport and the possibility to move around are the priorities of this field . Energ y and sustainability Technology can become a catalyst f or social innovation , the internationally approved common framework to orchestrate the action of responsible technology in society , within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . These are the SDGs ( Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 ) On 25 Septem ber 2015 , the United Nations identified the 17 sustainable development goals that act as guidelines for social and business action . The fact that the United Nations recognises the use of data as a mechanism for revolution ising social systems has led to dif ferent international data -based initiatives ( for example , data4sdg.org and undatarevolution.org ) to approach this matter . For this reason , artificial intelligence plays a key role in the development of this new framework and the implementation of the SDGs , one of the government ’ s priorities . The con tribution to circular economy , the fight against climate change and sustainable energy are fields where artificial intelligence can and must contribute more . Industry 4.0 Industry 4.0 will transform design , production systems and the products themselves . It is estimated that connectivity between all the systems ( known as cyber -physical systems ) throughout the value chain and going beyond a single company , along with the interaction between the different parts , machines and humans , will make production systems 30 % faster and 25 % more efficient . Furthermore , it will take mass customisation of products to new levels . Manufacturing will go from automated individual parts to fully integrated automated facilities th at communicate between each other . It will be possible to compile and analyse data between machines , which will lead to faster , more flexible and efficient processes to produce higher -quality goods at a lower cost . This will increase productivity , foster i ndustrial growth , modify the workforce profile and redefine the dynamics of global competitiveness in companies and regions . Artificial intelligence associated to industry 4.0 will play a fundamental role , as it facilitates the transformation of data into knowledge by creati ng expert systems based on algorithms , predictive models or machine learning solutions , so as to analyse data and facilitate decision -making , or also incorporate smart functions into their components or associated systems , to access their full traceability , their customisation according to customers ’ requirements or the generation of new disruptive business models based on the collection , analysis and use of the created data . In conclusion , to increase competitiveness within in dustry 4.0 , artificial intelligence will have a decisive role . Within this field , the government of Catalonia is promoting the I ndustry 4.0 programme to encourage technology transformation in companies established in Catalonia , including services and the Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 47 technological capabilities associated to the use and implementation of solutions for AI -based companies . 4.2.6 Ethics and society It is necessary to guarantee that the uses of artificial intelligence are focused on humans ’ well -being : artificial intelligenc e must be developed , applied and used with an ethical purpose based on fundamental rights , our social and cultural values , and the ethical principles of beneficence , autonomy of human beings , justice and the necessary explainability of their results . Impor tant grounds when working towards achieving a really secure artificial intelligence . The design of new applications and tools based on artificial intelligence must pay special attention to situations that affect vulnerable groups , such as children , disabled people , elderly people or minorities , or asymmetric situations related to power or information , such as those between employers and employees or companies and consumers , and be aware that artificial intelligence , even if it offers considerable ben efits for people and society , it could have a negative impact . Public Administration and society need to be aware of these matters of special concern . Mechanisms and requirements need to be incorporated to ensure the security of artificial intelligence , and must include elements to be able to audit and evaluat e algorithms , procedures and traceability of the use of these technologies . Artificial intelligence should be used in a responsible , sensible and secure way and must include ethical reasoning , in terms of following and maintaining tradition and the European differentiating fact for everything that affects people and their development , as well as guarantee ing justice , transparency and lawfulness . 4.2.6.1 Crea tion of the AI Ethics Observatory Among other fields , CATALONIA.AI has to stand at the helm of ethics and good practices in the use and design of artificial intelligence . It must not o nly adhere to the ethics guidelines for secure artificial intelligence presented by the European Commission , the Barcelona Declaration of March 2017 and Montréal Declaration of December 2018 , but also propose actions , ideas and principles to safeguard ethi cal and legal principles centred on people ’ s well -being , the ultimate goal of artificial intelligence . The Observatory will create a working group that will investigate ethical impact , establish guidelines to publish the best practices in this field and sh are this knowledge and work with other international bodies , especially The Partnership on AI55 and The AI4EU Platform . 4.2.6.2 Promo tion of spaces to debate and reflect upon the impact of AI on society There is absolutely no doubt that artificial intellige nce will impact our society , although people are beginning to ask if the impact will be positive or negative . In this regard , society is starting to demand 55 https : //www.partnershiponai.org Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 48 a certain ethical framework that defines the basic principles for a sustainable and responsible development of artificial intelligence ; as a result , competent institutions and leading groups in the subject have begun to respond to this social demand . It is important to open this debate to society as a whole , not just leave it in the hands of experts ; spaces should be provided where people can reflect upon the purpose of artificial intelligence and how it benefits citizens . These spaces for reflection must include dissemination activities and , at the same time , be in contact with other international co mmunities so they can join in the debate . These actions need to result in a true story that puts an end to the false ideas surround ing artificial intelligence and clarifies the benefits and risks we will face if we do not ensure the technology is developed in an ethical and responsible manner . In this regard , CATALONIA.AI will collaborate with the Digital Future Society programme ,56 implemented by the Mobile World Capital Barcelona , which includes a global think tank focused on analysing the impact of techno logy on society . One of the main topics under study is the impact of artificial intelligence . The goal is to connect the local ecosystem and the conclusions obtained in Catalonia with international agents and experts participating in the programme . In addi tion , citizen science activities will be launched with collaboration of the CatLABS network , driven by the government of Catalonia with groups to stimulate the activities , where citizens may experiment with artificial intelligence for themselves and provide us with their own conclusions . An example of an activity in this field is ExperimentAI ,57 promoted by the Computer Vision Center and the Autonomous University of Barcelona in the Library Living Lab of Sant Cugat . The project ’ s main purpose is to hel p democratise universal access to knowledge and innovation for everyone , by starting up a co -creation space to enable citizens , different social stakeholders and professional groups to respond to the challenges society face as the result of c omputer vision technology and artificial intelligence . 56 https : //digitalfuturesociety.com/ 57 http : //librarylivinglab.cvc.uab.cat/calendar/experimentai -the-impact -of-artificial -intelligence -in-society/ ? lang=es Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 49 5 . Conclusions It is evident that artificial intelligence plays a leading role in a technological revolution that will considerably transform society and economy . Catal onia has to develop and execute a strategy in this regard that is capable of turning this transformation into an important contribution that will benefit society and the business and economic network of the entire territory . Catal onia has excellent capabilities that make it a n ideal country to stand at the forefront of artificial intelligence . These capabilities include research and innovation capacity , the available supercomputing , robotics and telecommunications infrastructures that already exist , research centres with a consolidated reputation , capa city and experience , a notable posi tion as a country for attracting investment and talent , start -ups and previously established companies , a first -rate digital ecos ystem and the fact that Barcelona is the World Mobile Capital and venue of the world ’ s most important technology fairs . The government has put priority on promoting artificial intelligence and aims to support the deployment of AI technology , thus making Catalonia a renowned pole of attraction for r esearch , innovation and talent , companies and in vestors in the field of artificial intelligence . With this objective , the government is promoting Catal onia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy . Under the name of CATALONIA.AI , it will deploy a programme of specific actions to strengthen the AI ecosystem existing in Catalonia and lead knowledge generation , social and business application and create solutions based on artificial intelligence aimed towards fostering economic growth and improving people ’ s lives . Catal onia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy is coordinated by the Secretariat for Digital Polic y of the Catalan Ministry for Digital Policy and Public Administration of the government of Catalonia , with the direct collaboration of the Secretariat of Business and Com petitiveness and Secretariat of Universities and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge , and the participation of the remaining ministries . CATALONIA.AI will deploy a multi -sectoral , cross -cutting strategic plan that focuses on people , which prioritises sectors such as healthcare , mobility , sustainability , productive economy , the agri -food sector and public services , which will be built around the pivotal elements listed below : • Ecosystem : promote a cross -cutting governance model that supports th e development of a coordinated ecosystem of artificial intelligence connected to the rest of the world . • Research and innovation : boost research and innovation by applying specific instruments and establishing synergies between public authorities , specialis ed research and innovation centres and organisations that use artificial intelligence intensively . • Talent : create , attract and retain specialised talent that fosters the development of artificial intelligence solutions and transfer of knowledge to society , while training citizens and professionals of other sectors to be ready for its impact . • Infrastructure and data : have the necessary infrastructures for the development of artificial intelligence and provide secure access to public and private data . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 50 • Adoptio n of artificial intelligence : promote the incorporation of artificial intelligence to drive innovation in public administration and strategic sectors , including agri -food , healthcare and well being , the environment , mobility , tourism , culture and industry . • Ethics and society : promote the development of ethical artificial intelligence that respects applicable legislation , is compatible with our social and cultural norms and focuses on people . Catal onia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy must be shared by all the bodies that form part of Catalan Public Administration , as well as the agents of the private sector , since artificial intelligence will lead to transformations and changes in fields that cross the borders of technology , research and investigation and include people , ethics , the employment environment , the legislative field , education , public services and the transformation of productive sectors .

Artificial intelligence in Catalan universities Section 3.1.1 Universit ies identifies the main research groups or centres in different Catalan universities that develop artificial intelligence or work intensively with this technology . Detailed information regarding the implication of Catalan universities in AI development is provided below . - Polytechnic University of Catalonia ( UPC ) The UPC particularly stands out in AI field . Intensive research on artificial intelligence carried out by different groups of the UPC , s ome of which have been pioneers in this area for 40 years , led to the creation in 2017 of the specific research centre for Intelligent Data Science and Artificial Intelligence ( IDEAI -UPC58 ) , which dedicates its efforts in resolving real problems related to the most immediate economic and industrial context . This centre acts as an umbrella that joins competencies of a wide s pectrum in this discipline and complementary approaches . It is important to point out that one of the groups that forms part of IDEAI , the Knowledge Engineering and Machine Learning Group ( KEMLg59 ) , is one of the first AI research centres in Catalonia and it in 1985 , it introduced the PhD in Artificial Intelligence , the first in Spain . Managed by the UPC , it led to the creation of the inter -university master ’ s degree in artificial intelligence that from the beginning has been a pproached with a comprehensive perspective for Catalonia . The course is coordinated by the UPC , UB and URV and attracts a high number of international students . The activity of the IDEAI -UPC research centre focuses on seven strategic lines of application : educa tion ; environmental and sustainability systems ; inclusi on , health and well -being ; ind ustry 4.0 ; digital society ; econom y ; ethics and responsibility , with th e intention to foster talent and innovation and address the ethical aspects surrounding the discipline . To face the current challenges in these areas , the IDEAI -UPC research centre boosts research and technology transfer in the following fields of artifici al intelligence and intelligent data sc ience : - Machine learning algorithms : this line of research defines the basic nature that brings together the different research groups . These systems have the capacity to learn and improve from experience , without havi ng to be explicitly programmed . Work is carried out in fields such as the development of smart agents , analysis of social structure dynamics , construction of formal models to define norms and rules for ecommerce , design of information flow processes , reaso ning based on tempor al episodes , argumentation methods , hybrid methods between statistics and artificial intelligence , Bayesian networks , case -based reasoning , supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques , identifica tion and construction of know ledge models , knowledge representation , ontologies , social media , Semantic Web , web services , etc . 58 https : //ideai.upc.edu/en 59 https : //kemlg.upc.edu/ca Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 54 - Data science and data engineering : research on methodologies to find , process , analyse and extract relevant knowledge contained in data to support decision -making , among other features . - Natural language and voice processing systems : this line centres on language processing , mainly written and spoken . The wide variety of problems related to language processing ranges from basic processing tasks ( morphologica l , syntactical and semantic analysis ) to applications of a higher level ( information extraction , machine translation , automatic summarisation , question answering , dialogue systems , etc . ) . As regards voice , specialised techniques are used to recognise disco urse from audio signals and conceptualise it with the previously described natural language tools , as well as construct verbal discourse using specialised databases . This is one of the few scientific fields that needs to develop specific resources for each language . IDEAI -UPC has resources in different Community and non Community languages . - Intelligent systems to support decision -making : this line of research works on the creation of algorithms , cognitive models and intelligent visualisation to effectively support decision making by individuals and/or companies . The areas of application where IDEAI -UPC has experience include healthcare , environmental processes and systems , social and internet based systems , and the industrial and business sector . - Computer vision : with expertise in visual signal processing techniques to analys e and represent visual content , used in interaction [ interf aces , smart -rooms ) , biomedical imaging and remote sensing , audio -visual production and security . The centre ’ s experience in representation of content includes video compression and indexing in accordance with international standards , such as MPEG -4 and MPEG -7 . - Cognitive systems and computational thinking : this line of research is the result of combining the experience of the di fferent groups that form part of the research centre in the development of computer systems capable of employing different forms of knowledge to think autonomously and/or semi -autonomously , often in social environments and in cooperation with other intelli gent tools ( including humans ) . - Applications used to ( i ) identif y and define real , more complex problems that require really intelligent solutions ; ( ii ) ac hieve feedback in the developments performed ; and ( iii ) interac tion with the surrounding industrial a nd socio -economic network , thus adding value . The UPC ha s created a complex network of international alliances with other universities , research institutions and companies that draw up new projects and support a high number of initiatives in which the word collaboration is the key element . A global and interconnected world that fosters Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 55 sharing knowledge and experiences is the background of the action of these alliances without borders . - Autonomous Uni versity of Barcelona ( UAB ) The UAB campus has two leading AI centres : The Artificial Intelligence Research Institute ( IIIA60 ) and the Computer Vision Center ( CVC61 ) . The Artificial Intelligence Research Institute ( IIIA ) was founded in 1994 by a group of res earchers from the Department of Artificial Intelligence of the Centre for Advanced Studies in Blanes ( CEAB ) . The IIIA is a member of the CSIC , which is an ‘ a ggregated entity ’ of the International Campus of Excellence ( UAB -CEI ) and has nearly 50 researchers and engineers . Annexe II describes this centre in greater detail . El Computer Vision Center ( CVC ) was founded in 1995 by the government of Catalonia and the Autonomous University of Barcelona . It focuses on research in the field of computer vision and is a leader in the creation of knowledge in this field , with over 130 researchers , advanced hardware and software resources for computer vision . The centre covers an area of 2,000 m2 dedicated to R & D of excellence . Annexe II describes this centre in greater detail .

TRL -IULATERM , Linguistic Resource Technologie s - IULATERM , has specialised in text annotation and classification to extract linguistic data and develop machine -learning technology to construct linguistic resources : the set of necessary linguistic data to make applications for each language . It also focuses on the production and open publication of linguistic resources for Catalan , English 60 https : //www.iiia.csic.es/ca/presentation 61 http : //www.cvc.uab.es/ ? lang=ca Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 56 and Spanish , among other languages , in different areas of application : health , legal , etc . COLT , Computational Linguistics and Linguistic Theory , de velops m ethods for inducing representations of meaning based on data about how people use language s , also with machine learning technologies for language modelling . The group ’ s project , AMORE : A distributional model of reference to entities ( ERC Starting Grant 715 154 ) , studies modelling the phenomenon of linguistic reference and how to improve the inducement of relationships between concepts and extralinguistic context when understanding speech .  Interactive machine learning : is a branch of machine learning concer ned with sequential decision -making problems , where the goal is to design algorithms that optimize performance during the learning procedure itself , while facing an unknown and potentially non -stationary environment .  Learning theory : is the science of ana lysing machine learning problems and algorithms , with the purpose of characterising the hardness of various learning scenarios and construct algorithms with demonstrable performance guarantees .  Probabilistic graphical m odels : are graph -based representatio ns to compactly encode probability distributions over high -dimensional spaces . The group focuses on how to efficiently answer queries ( inference ) and how to learn the graph structure from data ( learning ) .  Autonomous robotics : includes the development of c omplete software architectures as well as the creation of base methodologies and tools for new advanced features . The group combines reactive behaviour and motion planning with task planning , and use reasoning mechanisms to create robotics systems for chal lenges like RoboCup .  Constraint satisfaction problems ( CSP ) : these problems consist of a set of variables , a domain of values than can be taken by the variables and a set of constraints that specify the restrictions of the values that can be taken simulta neously by the variables . The task is to decide whether there exists an assignment of variables to values that satisfies all the constraints .  The WSSC ( Web Science & Social Computing ) research group uses machine learning , big data and data science to addr ess internet and social problems . - Universit y of B arcelona ( UB ) The Universit y of Barcelona identifi es artificial intelligence as a strategic cross -cutting field . For this reason a multi -disciplinary cross -cutting structure was created to promote research , teaching , dissemination and transfer in advanced analytics , machine learning , data science and artificial intelligence that can strengthen the synergies between a ll associated areas of knowledge . Catalonia ’ s Artificial Intelligence Strategy 57 AI research at the University of Barcelona studies the multiple facets of artificial intelligence , from its computer -related aspect to its ethical , legal and social implications , as well as its neurological foundations . The main initiatives in this field are detailed below .  Algorithmic and computational perspective : the UB has two specific groups for the mathematic , algorithmic and computational study of artificial intelligence : the Computer Vision and Machine Learning Gr oup at UB , centr ed on machine learning and deep learning and their application to computer vision , and the Virtual Worlds , Visualization and Artificial Intelligence group , focused on virtual worlds , person -machine interaction and multi -agent systems . The m embers of the previous groups form part of the Institute of Mathematics of the Universit y of Barcelona ( IMUB ) and the Universit y of Barcelona Institute of Complex Systems ( UBICS ) .
