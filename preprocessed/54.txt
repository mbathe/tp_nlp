DDP-YD/ETD ( 2020 ) 170 Strasbourg , 1 December 2020 Seminar Artificial Intelligence : How can youth take part ? online 23 - 27 November 2020 Declaration on Youth Participation in AI Governance 2 This declaration is the outcome of the work done by the young people , participants of the seminar Artificial Intelligence : How Can Youth Take part ? organised by the Youth Department of the Council of Europe , between 23 and 27 November 2020 . It is positioned within the wider framework of the Council of Europe ’ s youth policy and initiatives that link Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) and democratic citizenship . The declaration explor es issues , challenges and roles that stakeholders can play to secure and enable the participation of young people in AI governance processes at all levels . Considering the impact of AI systems on everyday life , in addition to the accelerated trends and risks due to COVID19 , the present Declaration highlights : a ) The exclusionary consequences of the fast-paced development of AI technologies driven by the private sector that leave many stake holders , especially youth actors and human rights activists , but also policy makers , behind , and result in normatively questionable and ineffective self -regulation in the private sector b ) The need to develop and ensure l egal safeguards both by international organisations through existing or new legal instruments and by national governments responsible for securing and implementing them at national level c ) The a bsence of youth in the emerging AI governance processes as a denial of the right to participation in democratic pro cesses which impedes a whole sector from co -shaping the discourse about development , assessment , implementation and regulation of AI technologies d ) The imperative to respect ethical principles which must be at the core of all AI developments and deployment ( transparency , justice and fairness , responsibility , safety and security , privacy ) e ) The need to assess the value of AI technologies on the impact of their consequences and benefits on individuals and soc iety . Not all social and economic problems need to be anchored in technological solutions . Based on these elements and the full set of conclusions that result ed from the seminar , the declaration invites the existing youth structures to engage actively in AI governance and calls on the Council of Europe , its member states , national , regional and local authorities to take action upon the following priorities : 1 . Youth Participation - Safeguard and promote quality and meaningful youth participation in all AI Governance processes , recognise and position young people as rightful stakeholder s that stand on the same level as AI experts and private representatives , and other groups , by 3 - ensuring access to AI governance processes at all levels , local , regional , national and European - including young people in existing structures such as digital transformation councils , smart city strategies and councils , multidisciplinary advisory boards dealing with the development and deployment of AI -technologies , etc . - supporting the establishment of new forms of youth participation – such as Youth Labs , Open Creative Spaces – in cooperation with various stakeholders , within schools , academia , and techno logy companies . 2 . AI Literacy and Education - Support the democratisation of AI as a complementary approach to all AI governance processes . First , t his includes demystifying the complexity of issues and making algorithms understandable and interpretable , breaking the culture of AI “ impenetrability ” . Second , it means ensuring equal access of young people to AI -related value -based knowledge , skills and competences needed to participate in and co -shape the AI discourse , by - increasing awareness on the use of AI while focusing on understanding the impact of AI systems on human rights , including social rights , and on the well -being and dignity of young people - supporting the skills development of young people , thereby facilitating the transition to an increasing ly automated society - supporting educators and teachers in advancing their digital skills needed to empower young people in dealing with AI technology - enabling a “ maker culture ” and empowering you ng people to engage in identifying and developing solutions based on AI technologies that can further improve their quality of life - educating engineers and technical experts on human rights -based approaches to technology development and on democratic gover nance - anchoring AI literacy in formal education , in order to reach young people from an early age . For this , an international or European AI curriculum for teacher training and school education should be developed - ensuring AI literacy initiatives are affordable and accessible to all young people , from all socio -economic backgrounds , to avoid further ing existing digital gap s. 3 . AI Governance - there is a need to put the respect for human rights and democracy at the cent re of AI policies and to safeguard principles of social inclusion and diversity , by : - ensuring that the language used in these processes is accessible and clear for all citizens , including those with no technical background 4 - proposing evidence -based policies that consider young people as a specific category and mandating intersectional audits on the possible impacts of specific policies on different groups , before a policy is adopted . - including specifically the youth sector in public consultation s on AI use and regulation 4 . Creating Synergies - Foster cross -sectoral and multi stakeholder cooperation between AI , educational and youth stakeholders among others , by - ensuring th at cooperatio n between youth and stakeholders in AI Governance is the rule rather than the exception - harmonising AI and youth policies , by creating links between AI and youth priorities , in all processes .
