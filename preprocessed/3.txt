ernment automated systems means kinds algorithmic systems beyond scope including signiﬁcant jurisdictional gaps canada adm directive limited federal government automated systems means whole areas government private sector adm development outside scope governance thus largely unregulated including adm systems used provincial governments municipalities police services public agencies private sector criminal justice canada adm directive include automated decisionmaking systems federal criminal justice system contrast european commission proposal include detailed provisions identifying systems law enforcement administration justice thus subject detailed expansive regulatory requirements additional weaknesses include prohibited systems unlike european commission proposal canada adm directive explicitly identify prohibited priori systems subject greater regulation directive legislation canada adm directive obviously legislative legislation formal regulations necessary provide foundational governance framework systems would also ensure changes governance framework subject legislative public review finally legislation would establish level public legal accountability commensurate issues rights stake comparing models strengths weaknesses proposal several strengths proposal discernible first fact european commission first world consider regulation scale advantage giving direction looked states necessarily influence moreover big players like china canada without european market refuse comply especially true proposal extraterritorial effect applies even ais provider outside territory european union long systems placed market output produced system used union second content proposal commission positioning according competence competence shared member states article tfeu basis article tfeu internal market therefore main purpose regulation organize rules placing market goods services incorporating use regulating market setting rules advantage directly mandatorily influencing deployment solutions way dangerous products like drugs marketed addition imposing requirements market afterwards better protects users ais applied third approach instead sectorial approach certainly good method approach makes possible specifically consider risks fundamental rights health safety seems relevant consider impact ais rather assume one sector activity dangerous another however statement must nuanced fact annexes iii identify ais risk based sectoral approach targeting sectors education human resources law enforcement public services benefits example approach leads prohibiting certain uses encouraged principle even content scope questionable seems essential states position indicating uses socially acceptable fourth appropriateness omnibus approach integrates public private sectors questioned two sectors may eventually merit different rules provision use ais case crucial require rules sectors however rely canadian example distinguishes two sectors different areas personal information ais federal public administration see private public actors increasingly partnering area digital data exchange makes difficult even ineffective enforce legislation omnibus approach also found gdpr facilitates implementation efficiency regulation fifth noted european legislator tried respond advance criticism regulation kills innovation providing rules encourage organizing regulatory sandboxes well measures support small companies sixth also noted european legislator concerned risks manipulation opinion emotions well content modifications issues related protection democracy freedom opinion also dignity person even risks may seem future fundamental consider seventh penalties strong essential regulation taken seriously especially already digital american chinese giants markets comparing models strengths weaknesses hand several weaknesses proposal also apparent first weakness european commission goal proposal mainly provide framework placing products market protect individuals social risks generate fundamental rights thus present proposal particular charter fundamental rights mentioned explanatory memorandum little place text appears recitals text article concerning transparency certain ais recital states extent adverse impact caused system fundamental rights protected charter particular relevance classifying system rights include right human dignity respect private family life protection personal data freedom expression information freedom assembly association consumer protection workers rights rights persons disabilities right effective remedy fair trial right defense presumption innocence right good administration addition rights important highlight children specific rights enshrined article charter united nations convention rights child elaborated uncrc general comment regards digital environment require consideration children vulnerabilities provision protection care necessary fundamental right high level environmental protection enshrined charter implemented union policies also considered assessing severity harm system cause including relation health safety persons charter also applicable law enforcement activities recital provisions recitals important interesting however remembered binding help interpret text court justice cjeu may rely recitals may wish give greater prominence charter often done digital matters protection personal data second weakness limited scope ais prohibited considered socially unacceptable article foresees four cases application although many others would likely generate significant risks moreover cases narrowly defined excluding equally dangerous situations example article prohibits placing market putting service use social rating aiss public authorities even though private actors could make use aiss difficult see would less dangerous reprehensible third weakness found section prohibits use remote biometric identification systems facial recognition publicly accessible spaces purpose law enforcement circumstances narrowly defined also three exceptions provided first two acceptable targeted search specific potential victims crime including missing children prevention specific substantial imminent threat life physical safety natural persons terrorist attack third opens possibility using facial recognition types crimes directly related national security questionable economic crime fraud fourth weakness aiss listed restrictively appendices iii listing locks assumptions especially since annex iii lists eight areas defines cases covered example field education vocational training two situations considered systems intended used purpose determining access comparing models strengths weaknesses natural persons educational voca tional training institutions systems intended used purpose assessing students educational vocational training institutions assessing participants tests commonly required admission educational institutions ais therefore narrowly defined however noted european commission empowered adopt delegated acts article update list annex iii adding systems within eight areas also adding new areas ais equivalent greater risk harm adverse impact posed systems already referred annex iii article fifth weakness goal proposed regulation frame requirements putting ais market provides minimum obligations monitoring sharing information incidents malfunctioning however incidents potential cause harm people ais applies proposed regulation provide liability rules favor understood goal proposal would important refer liability rules council directive concerning liability defective may apply nevertheless amended sixth weakness governance rules extremely complex example notifying bodies set certify ais addition national supervisory authorities national market surveillance authorities european board must cooperate still created take time resources system functions properly seventh weakness current proposal reactive rather proactive futureproof commission seems defined high risks systems whose harm already documented length past years however many potential systems could high risk designs misaligned disloyal general given current framing law likely would added annex iii incidents already occurred finally regulation effect soon shall apply months
