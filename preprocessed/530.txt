Despite the proliferation of these `` AI principles , '' there has been little scholarly focus on understanding these efforts either individually or as contextualized within an expanding universe of principles with discernible trends.To that end , this white paper and its associated data visualization compare the contents of thirty-six prominent AI principles documents side-by-side . This effort uncovered a growing consensus around eight key thematic trends : privacy , accountability , safety and security , transparency and explainability , fairness and non-discrimination , human control of technology , professional responsibility , and promotion of human values . Underlying this “ normative core , ” our analysis examined the forty-seven individual principles that make up the themes , detailing notable similarities and differences in interpretation found across the documents . In sharing these observations , it is our hope that policymakers , advocates , scholars , and others working to maximize the benefits and minimize the harms of AI will be better positioned to build on existing efforts and to push the fractured , global conversation on the future of AI toward consensus .
