Estonia ’ s National AI Strategy – Government of the Republic of Estonia – July 2019 1 Estonia ’ s national artificial intelligence strategy 2019-2021 July 2019 In May 2019 , an expert group led by Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications ( MKM ) and Government Office presented proposals on advancing the take-up of artificial intelligence ( AI ) in Estonia aka for Estonia ’ s national AI strategy ( hereinafter : strategy ) 1 . This current strategy has been prepared based on these proposals , as a plan on how to implement the expert group ’ s recommendations . It was adopted at Cabinet meeting on 25 July 2019 . The strategy is a sum of actions that Estonian government will take to advance the take-up of AI in both private and public sector , to increase the relevant skills and research and development ( R & D ) base as well as to develop the legal environment . This strategy is also Estonian national AI strategy in the European Union ’ s coordinated AI action plan context , synchronised with and supporting relevant EU-level activities . A steering group led by MKM and consisting of representatives of government agencies and key stakeholders will coordinate and monitor the implementation of this strategy , including discuss and plan for additional actions upon need . Once a year , an overview of implementation of the strategy will be presented to e-Estonia Council ( the governmental committee overseeing digital society development ) . The budget allocation of action items in the strategy represents existing funding for activities , not potential needs . In future years , the strategy implementation overview will also include in retrospect any additional funds directed to support of AI activities under existing funding mechanisms , if such contribution depends on applications and can not be determined in advance ( e.g . funding measure is not targeted directly at AI activities but the latter are potentially eligible ) . According to the current strategy and based on existing knowledge , Estonian government will invest at least 10M euros in 2019-2021 to implementation of AI strategy in its different directions .
