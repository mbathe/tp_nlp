The company you are applying to says you can have a much easier application process if you provide them with your username and password for your personal email account . They can then just scan all your emails and develop a personality profile based on the result . No need to waste time filling out a boring questi onnaire and , because it ’ s much harder to manipulate all your past emails than to try to give the ‘ correct ’ answers to a questionnaire , the results of the email scan will be much more accurate and truthful than any conventional personality profiling . Wouldn ’ t that be great ? Everyone wins—the company looking for new personnel , because they can recruit people on the basis of more accurate profiles , you , because you save time and effort and don ’ t end up in a job you don ’ t like , and the company offering the profiling service because they have a cool new business model . When our colleagues in Finland told us that such a service actually exists , our jaws dropped . We didn ’ t want to believe it , and it wasn ’ t reassuring at all to hear the company claimed that basically no candidate ever declined to comply with such a request . And , of course , it is all introductionpage 6 Automating Society perfectly legal because job-seekers give their informed consent to open up their email to analysis—if you believe the company , that is . When we asked the Finnish Data Protection Ombudsman about it , he wasn ’ t so sure . He informed us that his lawyers were still assess-ing the case , but that it would take a couple of weeks before he could give his opinion . Since this came to light just before we had to go to press with this publication , please go to our website to discover what his final assessment is . / Is automation a bad thing ? In many cases , automating manual processes is fantastic . Who wants to use a calculator instead of a spreadsheet when doing complex calculations on large sets of numbers ( let alone a pen , paper and an abacus ) ? Who would like to manually filter their email for spam any more ? And who would voluntarily switch back to searching for information on the Web by sifting through millions of entries in a Yahoo-style catalogue instead of just typing some words into Google ’ s famous little box ? And these examples do not even take into account T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 7 the myriads of automated processes that enable the infrastructure of our daily lives—from the routing of phone calls to automated electricity grid management , to the existence of the Internet itself . So we haven ’ t just lived in a world of automated processes for a very long time ; most of us ( we ’ d argue : all of us ) enjoy the many advantages that have come with it . That automation has a much darker side to it has been known for a long time as well . When in 1957 IBM started to develop the Semi-Automated Business Research Environment ( SABRE ) as a system for booking seats on American Airlines ’ fleet of planes , we can safely assume that the key goal of the airline was to make the very cumbersome and error-prone manual reservation process of the times more effective for the company and more con-venient for the customers . However , 26 years later , the system was used for very different purposes . In a 1983 hearing of the US Congress , Robert L. Crandall , president of American Airlines , was confronted with allegations of abusing the system—by then utilised by many more airlines—to manipulate the reservation process in order to favour American Airlines ’ flights over those of its competitors . His answer : “ The preferential display of our flights , and the corresponding increase in our market share , is the competitive raison d ’ etre for having created the system in the first place ” . In their seminal paper “ Auditing Algorithms ” , Christian Sandvig et al . famously proposed to call this perspective Crandall ’ s complaint : “ Why would you build and operate an expensive algorithm if you can ’ t bias it in your favor ? ” external [ IN 1 ] In what is widely regarded as the first example of legal regulation of algorithmically controlled , automated decision-making sys-tems , US Congress in 1984 passed a little-known regulation as their answer to Crandall ’ s complaint . Entitled “ Display of Information ” , it requires that each airline reservation system “ shall provide to any person upon request the current criteria used in editing and ordering flights for the integrated displays and the weight given to each criterion and the specifica-tions used by the system ’ s programmers in constructing the algorithm . ” / A changed landscape If a case like this sounds more familiar to more people today than it did in 1984 , the reason is that we ’ ve seen more automated systems developed over the last 10 years than ever be-fore . However , we have also seen more of these systems misused and criticised . Advances in data gathering , development of algorithms and computing power have enabled data ana-lytics processes to spread out into fields so far unaffected by them . Sifting through personal emails for personality profiling is just one of the examples ; from automated processing of traffic offences in France ( see p. 70 ) , allocating treatment for patients in the public health system in Italy ( p. 88 ) , automatically identifying which children are vulnerable to neglect in Denmark ( p. 50 ) , to predictive policing systems in many EU countries—the range of applica-tions has broadened to almost all aspects of daily life . Having said all this , we argue that there is an answer to the question 'Is automation a bad thing ? ' And this answer is : It depends . At first glance , this seems to be a highly unsatisfactory answer , especially to people who need to make decisions about the questions of how to deal with the development , like : Do we need new laws ? Do we need new oversight insti-tutions ? Who do we fund to develop answers to the challenges ahead ? Where should we invest ? How do we enable citizens , patients , or employees to deal with this ? And so forth . But everyone who has dealt with these questions already knows that it is the only honest answer . `` Why would you build and operate an expensive algorithm if you can ’ t bias it in your favor ? ” forwardpage 8 Automating Society Introduction / Why automated decision -making instead of Artificial Intelligence ? One of the first hard questions to answer is that of defining the issue . We maintain that the term automated decision-making ( ADM ) better defines what we are faced with as societies than the term ‘ Artificial Intelligence ’ , even though all the talk right now is about ‘ AI ’ . Algorithmically controlled , automated decision-making or decision support systems are procedures in which decisions are initially—partially or completely—delegated to another person or corporate entity , who then in turn use automatically executed decision-making models to perform an action . This delegation—not of the decision itself , but of the execu-tion—to a data-driven , algorithmically controlled system , is what needs our attention . In comparison , Artificial Intelligence is a fuzzily defined term that encompasses a wide range of controversial ideas and therefore is not very useful to address the issues at hand . In addi-tion , the term ‘ intelligence ’ invokes connotations of a human-like autonomy and intention-ality that should not be ascribed to machine-based procedures . Also , systems that would not be considered Artificial Intelligence by most of today ’ s definitions , like simple rule-based analysis procedures , can still have a major impact on people ’ s lives , i.e . in the form of scoring systems for risk assessment . In this report , we will focus on systems that affect justice , equality , participation and public welfare , either directly or indirectly . By saying systems instead of technologies we point to the fact that we need to take a holistic approach here : an ADM system , in our use of the term , is a socio-technological framework that encompasses a decision-making model , an algorithm that translates this model into computable code , the data this code uses as an in-put—either to ‘ learn ’ from it or to analyse it by applying the model—and the entire political and economic environment surrounding its use . This means that the decision itself to apply an ADM system for a certain purpose—as well as the way it is developed ( i.e . by a public sector entity or a commercial company ) , procured and finally deployed—are parts of this framework . Therefore , when an ADM system like SyRI is used in the Netherlands to detect welfare fraud ( see p. 101 ) , we not only need to ask what data it uses , but whether the use of this data is legal . We also need to ask what decision-making model is applied and whether it has a certain problematic bias , i.e . because it used a biased data set or was developed by people with underlying prejudices that were not controlled for . Other questions then arise : why did the government come up with the idea to use it in the first place ? Is it because there is a problem that can not be addressed in any other way , maybe due to its inherent complexity ? Is it because austerity measures led to a situation where there are no longer enough case workers , so automation is used as an option to save money ? Or is it because of a political decision to increase pressure on poor people to take on low-paying jobs ? / The focus of this report All these aspects need to be taken into account when asking whether automation can help solve a problem . This is why we decided to focus on four different issues in this report : W How is society discussing automated decision-making ? Here we look at the debates initiated b y governments and legislators on the one hand , like AI strategies , parliamentary commissions and the like , while on the other hand we list civil society organisations that engage in the debate , outlining their positions with regard to ADM.Algorithmically controlled , automated decision-making or decision support systems are procedures in which decisions are initi-ally—partially or comple-tely—delegated to another person or corporate entity , who then in turn use au-tomatically executed decision-making models to perform an action.forward T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 9 W What regulatory proposals exist ? Here , we include the full range of possible governance measures , not just laws . So we ask whether there are ideas for selfregulation floating around , a code of conduct being developed , technical standards to address the issue , and of course whether there is legislation in place or proposed to deal with automated decision-making . W What oversight institutions and mechanisms are in place ? Oversight is seen as a key factor in the democratic control of automated decision-making systems . At the same time , many existing oversight bodies are still trying to work out what sectors and processes they are responsible for and how to approach the task . We looked for examples of those who took the initiative . W Last but not least : What ADM systems are already in use ? We call this section ADM in Action to highlight a lot of examples of automated decision-making already being used all around us . Here , we tried to make sure that we looked in all directions : do we see cases where automation poses more of a risk , or more of an opportunity ? Is the system developed and used by the public sector , or by private companies ? / The goals of this report When we set out to produce this report , we had four main goals in mind : 1 . T o show that algorithmically driven , automated decision-making ( ADM ) systems are already in use all over the EU . So far , the discussion around the use of these systems , their benefits and risks , has been dominated by examples from the US : assessing the recidivism risk of criminals determining whether they are released on parole or stay in jail ; teachers being fired based on their automatically calculated performance sc ores ; people in minority neighbourhoods paying higher car insurance premiums than people from wealthy areas with the same risk . So we want to make clear what similar and other ADM systems are in use in the EU , in order to better inform the discussion about how to govern their use . 2 . T o outline the state of the political discussion not just on the EU level , but also in the member countries . We all know that Europe ’ s diversity can be a burden when it comes to information flow across borders , especially because of 24 different official languages . So it was clear to us that we needed to change this situation as best we could by providing indepth research from member countries in a shared language accessible to policy makers on the EU level . We approached this challenge in the best of the Union ’ s traditions : As a crossborder , trans-disciplinary collaboration , pooling contributors from 12 different countries who speak their countries ’ language ( s ) and understand their societies ’ cultural contexts . 3 . T o serve as the nucleus for a network of researchers focusing on the impact of au tomated decision-making on individuals and society . This network includes journalists specialising in the nascent field of algorithmic accountability reporting , academics from economics , sociology , media studies , law and political sciences , to lawyers working in civil society organisations looking at the human rights implications of these developments . We will attempt to build on this first round of research and extend the network in the com ing years because it is crucial to also include the many countries not covered in this initial report.page 10 Automating Society Introduction 4 . T o distil recommendations from the results of our findings : for policy makers from the EU parliament and Member States ' legislators , the EU Commission , national governments , researchers , civil society organisations ( advocacy organisations , foundations , labour unions etc . ) , and the private sector ( companies and business associations ) . You will find these recommendations on page 13 . / The scope of this report We view this report as an explorative study of automated decision-making both on the EU level and in selected Member States . It contains a wide range of issues and examples that justify a closer look , more in-depth research and discussion1 . W Geography : For the initial edition of this report , we were not in a position to cover all 28 Member States . Instead , we decided to focus on a number of key countries , while making sure that the EU as a whole would be properly represented . Also , we deliberately excluded examples of applications coming from outside the EU . We all know that not only GAFA ( Google , Amazon , Facebook and Apple ) but also IBM , Microsoft , Salesforce and other US companies have a dominant market share in many sectors and also in European countries . Still , we confined ourselv es to companies from Member States to better showcase their important role in automated decision-making . W T opic : As laid out in the section “ Why automated decision -making instead of Artificial Intelligence ? ” , the definatory framework on which this report is based is still in an early phase . Therefore , much of the discussion between the contributors centred around the question whether a certain example fits the definition and should be part of the report or not . Most of the time , when there was latitude , we decided to err on the side of including it—because we see value in knowing about borderline cases at a stage when all of us are still trying to make sense of what is happening . When looking at examples framed as ‘ AI ’ , ‘ big data ’ or ‘ digitisation/digitalisation ’ —like the plethora of AI and big data strategies , politically convened commissions and so forth—we focused on aspects of automated decision-making and decision support whenever they were referenced . In case automation as a term was not used , we still scanned for key concepts like discrimination , justice , equity/equality to take a closer look , since automation processes tend to be hiding behind these keywords . W Depth : Contributors to the report had approximately five days to research and complete their investigations . This means that they were not in a position to do any kind of investigative research , file freedom of information requests , or follow up resolutely in case companies or public entities denied their requests for information . We would like to express our enormous gratitude to those who contributed to this report . As you can imagine , compiling it was a very special venture . It required a lot of expertise , but also spontaneity , flexibility and determination to piece this puzzle together . As always , this also means it required , at times , quite a lot of tolerance and patience when deadlines neared and pressure mounted . We consider ourselves lucky to have found all this in our 1 If funding permits , we would like to extend this exploration to all EU countries in the future . So if there is anything you know of that you think should have been part of this report , please tell us by writing to eu-adm-report @ algorithmwatch.org.Most of the time , when there was latitude , we decided to err on the side of including an example— because we see value in knowing about borderline cases at a stage when all of us are still trying to make sense of what is happening.forward T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 11 colleagues . You can learn who they are in more detail in the information boxes underneath the country chapters . We are also greatly indebted to Becky Hogge and the entire team at OSF ’ s information programme . When we approached Becky with the idea to produce this report , she was not only immediately willing to take the risk of embarking on this journey but she also saw the application through in almost no time . As a result , we were able to sei ze this opportunity to provide valuable input at a decisive stage of the debate . / Many shades of grey In closing , let ’ s come back to the case of the company offering to create a profile by scan-ning your email . It seems to be a clear-cut case of a misuse of power . If someone is looking for a job , how can they be in a position to freely give their consent to a procedure the com-pany filling a position wants them to undergo—especially if this is something as private as analysing their personal emails ? This seems to be a highly unethical , if not illegal , proposal that we can not possibly accept . Now consider the following scenario : The reliability of the tests that recruiters ask candidates to take is highly controversial due to their social desirability bias , meaning that people tend to give answers not in the most truthful manner but in a manner that they think will be viewed favourably by others . The company argues that this bias can be minimised by looking at a corpus of emails that is very hard to manipulate . Imagine that this claim is supported by sound research . In addition , the company argues that candidates ’ emails are never permanently stored anywhere , they are only passed through the company ’ s system in order to apply its analysis procedure to them and then disappear . Also , no human will ever look at any individual email . Now imagine this procedure is audited by a trusted third party—like a data protection authority , an ombudsman , a watchdog organisation—who con-firms the company ’ s claim . Lastly , imagine that all candidates are provided with information about this process and the logic of the underlying profiling model , and then given the choice whether to undergo the ‘ traditional ’ process of filling out questionnaires , or to allow the company to scan their emails . Given all these assumptions , would this change your mind regarding the question whether we can approve of this procedure , whether we should legally permit this procedure , and probably even whether you personally might consent to such a procedure ? Mind you , we ’ re not going to give away what our decision is . Instead , we ’ ll leave you to contemplate the countless shades of grey in a world of automated decision-making and hope that you are inspired by reading this report . Brigitte Alfter , Ralph Müller-Eiselt , Matthias SpielkampOffering to create a profile by scanning your email seems to be a clear-cut case of a misuse of power . But is it ? forwardpage 12 Automating Society Introduction In this report we have compiled findings from 12 EU member states and the level of the EU . In all countries , we looked at the debates focused on the development and application of automated decision-making systems . We identified regulatory strategies and compiled examples of ADM systems already in use . Based upon these findings , we have the following recommendations for policy makers in the EU parliament and Member States parliaments , the EU Commission , national governments , researchers , civil society organisations ( advo-cacy organisations , foundations , labour unions etc . ) , and the private sector ( companies and business associations ) . These recommendations are not listed in order of importance and we have refrained from referring to specific examples . Focus the discussion on the politically relevant aspects . ‘ Artificial Intelligence ’ is all the rage right now , ranging from debates about relatively simple rule-based analysis procedures to the threat of machine-created ‘ super-intelligence ’ to humanity . It is crucial to understand what the current challenges to our societies are . ‘ Predictive analytics ’ , used to recommendations T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 13 forecast maintenance issues on production lines for yoghurt , should not concern us too much—except maybe when it relates to the allocation of research grants . However , predic tive analytics used for forecasting human behaviour , be it in elections , criminal activity , or of minors , is an entirely different story . Here , we need to guarantee that these systems are identified as crucial for society . They must be democratically controlled by a combination of regulatory tools , oversight mechanisms , and technology . The debate around AI should be confined to current or imminent developments . There is a lot of discussion around the ideas of ‘ artificial general intelligence ’ , ‘ super-intelligence ’ , ‘ singularity ’ and the like . As attractive as these discussions may appear to some , right now they are based on mere speculation and therefore they are a distraction from the most pressing question : how to deal with current developments ? Consider automated decision-making systems as a whole , not just th e technology . Auto mated decision-making processes are often framed as technology . As a result , the debate revolves around questions of accuracy , data quality and the like . This risks overlooking many of the crucial aspects of automated decision-making : the decision itself to apply an ADM system for a certain purpose , the way it is developed ( i.e . by a public sector entity or a commercial company ) , and how it is procured and finally deployed . These are all part of the framework that needs to be reflected when discussing the pros and cons of using a specific ADM application . This means that we should ask what data the sys tem uses , whether the use of this data is legal , what decision-making model is applied and whether it has a problematic bias . But we also need to ask why companies or governments come up with the idea to use specific ADM systems in the first place . Is it because of a problem that can not be addressed in any other way , maybe due to the inherent complexities associated with the problem ? Have austerity measures led to a situation where there are not enough resources for humans to deal with certain tasks , so automation is used as an op tion to save money ? Empower citizens to adapt to new challenges . There are a number of ways we can en hance citizens ’ expertise to enable them to better assess the consequences of automated decisionmaking . We would like to highlight the Finnish example : in order to support the goal of help ing Finns understand the challenges ahead , the English-language online course Elements of Artificial Intelligence was developed as a private-public partnership and is now an integral part of the Finnish AI programme . This freely available course teaches citizens about basic concepts and applications of AI and machine learning . Almost 100,000 Finns have enrolled in the course to date , thus increasing public understanding of AI and enabling them to par ticipate in public debate on the subject . On the course , some societal implications of AI are introduced , for example , algorithmic bias and de-anonymisation , to underscore the need for policies and regulations that help society to adapt more easily to the use of AI . Empower public administration to adapt to new challenges . Public administration not only procures a lot of automated decision-making systems , it also u ses them for purposes that have a big impact on individuals and society , i.e . border control , crime prevention and welfare management . Public administration must ensure a high level of expertise inside its own institutions in order to either develop systems themselves , or at least be in a position to meaningfully oversee outsourced development . This can be achieved by creating public research institutions , i.e . in cooperation with universities or public research centres , that can teach and advise civil servants . Such institutions should also be created at the EU level to assist Member States.page 14 Automating Society Recommendations Strengthen civil society involvement . Our research shows that , even in some large Member States , there is a lack of civil society engagement and expertise in the field of ADM . This shortcoming can be addressed by a ) civil society organisations identifying the consequenc-es of automated decision-making as a relevant policy field in their countries and strategies , b ) grant-making organisations earmarking parts of their budget for ADM , developing fund-ing calls , and facilitating networking opportunities , c ) governments making public funds available to civil society interventions . Make sure adequate oversight bodies exist and are up to the task . Oversight over automated decision-making systems is organised by sector . For example , there are different oversight bodies for traffic ( automated cars ) , finance ( algorithmic trading ) , and banking ( credit scoring ) . This makes sense , since many systems need to be looked at in their respec-tive contexts , with specific knowledge . It is doubtful , though , that many of the oversight bodies in place have the expertise to analyse and probe modern automated decision-mak-ing systems and their underlying models for risk of bias , undue discrimination , and the like . Here , Member States and the EU are called upon to invest in applied research to enable ex-isting institutions to catch up , or to create new ones where needed . In addition , parliaments and courts need to understand the fact that it is they who need to oversee the use of ADM systems by governments and public administrations . Therefore , they also need appropriate assistance in order to empower them to live up to the task . Close the gap between Member States . Many countries in the EU have developed strategies for ‘ digitisation/digitalisation ’ , ‘ big data ’ , or ‘ Artificial Intelligence ’ . Still , some countries are lagging behind when it comes to discussing the consequences that autom ated decisionmaking can have on individuals and society—either because of a lack of resources , or because of differing priorities . Since the question of whether and how ADM systems should be used very much depends on the cultural context , expertise in Member States is needed . Some Member States should invest more in capacity building . The EU is doing a lot in this regard , i.e . by developing its own recommendations via the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI . In addition , Member States can use this report to get an idea of what is going on in other countries to see whether there is a need to catch up . If that is the case they can use this as an opportunity to create structures and mechanisms that help decision makers and the general public learn from leading countries . On the national level , this could happen in the form of intergovernmental working groups or bi- and multi-national cooperation . At the EU level , the EU Commission should continue to offer forums like the European AI Alliance to further this goal . Don ’ t just look at data protection for regulatory ideas . Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation ( GDPR ) has been the focus of many discussions about automated decision-making in recent years . A consensus is starting to develop that a ) the reach of Article 22 is rather limited ( see page 42 ) and b ) that there are use cases of ADM systems that can not be regulated by data protection ( alone ) , i.e . predictive policing . These systems can have effects on communities – like over-policing – without the use of personal data , so the GDPR doesn ’ t even apply . At the same time , since no individual is discriminated against if a neighbourhood slowly turns into a highly patrolled area , anti-discrimination laws are of no help either . There needs to be a discussion about how to develop governance tools for these cases . In addition , stakeholders need to look at creative applications of existing regulatory frameworks , like equal-pay regulation , to address new challenges like algorith-mically controlled platform work , also known as the Gig Economy , and explore new avenues for regulating the collective effects of ADM altogether . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 15 Involve a wide range of stakeholders in the development of criteria for good design processes and audits , including civil liberty organisations . In some of the countries we surveyed , governments claim that their strategies involve civil society stakeholders in the current discussion in order to bring diverse voices to the table . However , it is often the case that the term civil society is not well defined . It can be legitimately ar gued that the term civil society also includes academia , groups of computer scientists or lawyers , think tanks and the like . But if governments use this broad definition to argue that ‘ civil society ’ is on board , yet civil liberty organisations are not part of the conversation , then very important viewpoints might be missed . As a result , there is a risk that the multi-stakeholder label turns out to be mere window dressing . Therefore , it is critical that organisations focused on rights are included in the debate.page 16 Automating Society Recommendations EUROPEAN UNIONT aking Stock of Automated DecisionMaking in the EUAutomating Society – Latavia Hungary Serbia GreeceBELFAST The EU funded DANTE and TENSOR projects plan to offer law enforcement agencies a platform for „ planning and pre vention applications for early detection of terrorist activities , radicalisation and recruitment “ and aim to offer far reaching “ automated functionalities ” .

Maze donia EURO pEAN UNION By Kristina Penner The EU is a lot of things : It is a union of 28 Member States that has a commission , a parliament , a council of national ministers , the Court of Justice , and a couple of other institutions . It has many funding programmes for research and development , committees such as the European Economic and Social Committee ( EESC ) , an ombudsman and agencies like one for fundamental rights . In addition , there are scores of business and civil society pressure groups , professional societies and think tanks that try to interact with the EU institutions or influence policy making . So when we started looking into where automated decision-making ( ADM ) is currently being discussed in the EU and what regulatory proposals already exist , we had many direc-tions in which to look . Some places were obvious : The EU ’ s Declaration of cooperation on Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) , the Commission ’ s Communication Artificial Intelligence for Europe , its High-Level Expert Group focused on AI , the European parliament ’ s resolution on robot ics and the European Economic and the Social Committee ’ s opinion on Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) . These all state that the aim of using ADM is to simultaneously maximise the benefit to society , help business , spur innovation and encourage competition . The term Artificial Intelligence is commonly used in discussions , however upon closer inspection it becomes clear that it is algorithmically controlled ADM systems that are at the centre of many of these debates . The EU ’ s algo : aware project is a case in point . Its mandate is to analyse “ opportunities and challenges emerging where algorithmic decisions have a significant bearing on citizens , where they produce societal or economic effects which need public attention . ” 1 This perspective should be welcomed , as it focuses on a key question : How much of our autonomy are we willing to cede to automated systems ? And it begs another question : Do we have the appropriate safeguards in place to help us understand what we ’ re doing and enable us to stay in control of the process ? One of these safeguards , the General Data p rotection Regulation ( GD p R ) , has been hailed as one of the most powerful tools the EU has come up with to address automated decisionmaking . However , many experts now agree that it has shortcomings ; others fear that , when it comes to tackling the challenges posed by ADM systems , the GD p R may not be of any help at all . Therefore , it could well be time to look in a different direction to discover other means that can be used to deal with these challenges . EU employment equality law could be one such direction . Alternatively , long-existing regulations , such as the Financial Market Directive with its rules for high frequency algorithmic trading , might serve as a model . Last but not least , civil society and standards bodies have begun to play an active role in shaping the discussion . 1 The project ’ s first v ersion of its so-called “ state-of-the-art report on algorithmic decision-making “ was published too late for consideration in this publication—it is available at https : //www.algoaware.eu/wpcontent/uploads/2018/08/AlgoAware-State-of-the-Art-Report.pdfpage 18 a utomating s ociety european Union LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalPolitical de Bates on as Pects of a U tomation – eU ro P ean i nstit U tions / Declaration of cooperation on Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) On April 10 , 2018 , twenty-five European countries signed the Declaration of Cooperation on Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) external [ eU 1 ] with the stated goal to build on “ the achievements and investments of Europe in AI ” external [ eU 1 ] , as well as progress towards the creation of a Digital Single Market . In the declaration , participating Member States agree to shape a European approach to AI , increase public and private investment , and commit to publish a coordinat-ed plan on AI before the end of 2018 . While the declaration focuses on increasing “ com-petitiveness , attractiveness and excellence in R & D in Al ” , it also states that the signatories want to foster the “ development of AI in a manner that maximizes its benefit to economy and society ” and “ exchange views on ethical and legal frameworks related to Al in order to ensure responsible Al deployment . ” With regard to automated decision-making processes , the signatories commit to “ ensure that humans remain at the centre of the development , deployment and decision-making of Al , prevent the harmful creation and use of Al applica-tions , and advance public understanding of Al ” . In addition , the accountability of Al systems is supposed to be increased . / Communication on Artificial Intelligence for Europe Two weeks after the publication of the Declaration of cooperation on Artificial Intelligence , on April 25 , 2018 , the European Commission published a Communication on Artificial Intel-ligence for Europe . external [ eU 2 ] Following the previously adopted declaration , it elaborates on the three pillars outlined as the core of the proposed strategy : 1 . Being ahead of technological developments and industrial capacity and strengthening public and private actors , including not only investments in research centres , but also the development of an “ AI-on-demand platform ” to provide data and resources for the creation of a data economy2 . T o increase preparedness for socio-economic changes—by modernising education and training systems—supporting labour market transitions3 . T o develop AI ethics guidelines and to ensure legal clarity in AI based applications ( an-nounced for 2019 ) Although the Communication does not differentiate between AI and other systems of ADM in some parts of its strategy outline , clear indications of responses to ADM can be found in specific measures and policy packages introduced by the Communication . Preparing for socio-economic changes The Communication states that its goal is “ to lead the way in developing and using AI for good and for all ” and to follow an approach that “ benefits people and society as a whole ” . The main steps and measures outlined in the initiative focus on competitiveness and invest-ments . It also pledges to encourage diversity and interdisciplinarity ( “ diversity and gender balance in AI jobs ” ) . The Communication explicitly addresses the risk posed by automated decision-making : “ Some AI applications may raise new ethical and legal questions , related to liability or fairness of decision-making ” . These risks are to be mitigated mainly by AI eth-ics guidelines ( see below in this chapter ) and by providing guidance on the interpretation of the p roduct Liability Directive . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 19 research and innovation on responsible and explainable ai “ AI systems should be developed in a manner which allows humans to understand ( the basis of ) their actions . [ … ] Whilst AI clearly generates new opportunities , it also poses challenges and risks , for example in the areas of safety and liability , security ( criminal use or attacks ) , bias and discrimination . ” external [ eU 2 ] The Commission announced that it will support ( basic and industrial ) research and innova-tion in fields built on the guiding principle of “ responsible AI ” , including investment and encouragement of research and testing in sectors such as health , security , public adminis-tration and justice , with the goal to enable policy makers to gain experience and to devise suitable legal frameworks . Research on the development of explainable AI systems—and unsupervised machine learning in order to increase transparency and minimise the risk of bias and errors—is only planned beyond 2020 . One starting point is a pilot project 2 commissioned by the EU Commission on algorithmic awareness building . Recognising that algorithms play an increasingly important role in decisions of relevance to public policy , the Commission procured an in-depth analysis into algorithmic transparency . This aims to raise awareness and build an evidence base for the challenges and opportunities of algorithmic decisions . The project ’ s objective , among oth-ers , is to design or prototype solutions for a selection of problems . These include policy re-sponses , technical solutions and private sector and civil society-driven actions in response to the challenges brought by ADM , including bias and discrimination . Building a European Data Economy and creating a European Artificial i ntelligence-on-demand-platform Already embedded in the Digital Single Market strategy—translated into proposals for action in its mid-term review , and now applied to AI—the EU Commission is striving to establish and continue the expansion of a “ common European data space ” . external [ eU 4 ] Identifying data as a key ingredient for competitive AI , the EU plans “ a seamless digital area with the scale to enable the development of new products and services based on data ” . This is to be realised , in particular , by increasing the accessibility and re-usability of public sector information , the proposal to amend the p ublic Sector Information ( p SI ) Directive being a core element . external [ eU 5 ] The second comprehensive initiative in this regard is the creation of a European AI-on-demand platform aiming to strengthen a European AI community , which is already taking shape as AI4EU external [ eU 6 ] ( see below ) . The European Commission aims to facilitate the re-use of PSI such as legal , traffic , mete-orological , economic and financial data throughout the European Union . This will be done by harmonising the basic conditions that make p SI available to re-users , to enhance the development of Community products and services based on p SI , and to avoid distortions in competition . Stakeholder concerns are especially related to the necessary protection of personal data , especially in sensitive sectors such as health , when they take the decision on the re-use of p SI ( see paragraph on the ED p S ) . 2 The project algo : a ware external [ eU 3 ] aims to engage with a range of stakeholders and seeks to map the areas of interest where algorithmic operations bear significant policy implications . So far , they have produced a series of reports , blog posts , case studies , infographics and policy developments . They aim to provide a platform for information , and a forum for informed debate on the opportunities and challenges that algorithmic decision-making can provide in commercial , cultural , and civic society settings.LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 20 a utomating s ociety european Union the development of ethics guidelines The Communication—and the proposed implementation process behind the EU Initiative on AI—addresses ethical and legal questions . It states that the basis for work on these ques-tions will be the EU ’ s values laid down in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU . By the summer of 2019 , the Communication foresees the creation of a framework for all relevant stakeholders and experts—see European AI Alliance and High-Level Expert Group in this chapter—who will draft the guidelines , addressing issues such as future of work , fairness , safety , security , social inclusion and algorithmic transparency . More broadly , the group will look at the impact on fundamental rights , including privacy , dignity , consumer protection and non-discrimination . The development of the AI Ethical Guidelines will build on the Statement on Artificial Intelligence , Robotics and ‘ Autonomous ’ Systems by the European Group on Ethics in Science and New T echnologies ( EGE ) external [ eU 7 ] 3 . They will tackle questions on “ liability or potentially biased decision-making ” . It affirms that the EU must develop and apply a framework to pro-tect ethical principles such as accountability and transparency , to reach the indicated goal to become “ the champion of an approach to AI that benefits people and society as a whole ” . external [ eU 2 ] The development of the draft is accompanied by assessments from the EU Fundamental Rights Agency ( FRA , see below ) , and the evaluations of the EU Safety framework . The Commission is planning to systematically monitor AI-related developments , including policy initiatives in Member States in order to develop an AI index to inform the discussion . By announcing work on a coordinated plan with Member States by the end of the year— also strongly focusing on competition and economic aspects—there is a risk that many of these newly created bodies and consultation processes will be insufficiently incorporated into the implementation framework . The following statements and resolutions are also referred to or announced in the Communication , but not included in this report : W Statement on Artificial Intelligence , Robotics and ‘ Autonomous ’ Systems of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New T echnologies ( EGE ) external [ eU 7 ] W Communication on the future of connected and automated mobility in Europe external [ eU 8 ] W A renewed European Agenda for Research and Inno vation—Europe ‘ s chance to shape its future external [ eU 9 ] / european e conomic and s ocial c ommittee opinion on ai The European Economic and Social Committee ( EESC ) is a consultative body of the Europe-an Union and an advisory assembly ( Article 300 TFEU ) . It is composed of “ social partners ” and economic and social interest groups—namely : employers/employers ’ organisations , employees/trade unions and representatives of various other interests . 4 external [ eU 10 ] 3 The EGE is an independent advisory body of the p resident of the European Commission . 4 The Committee was set up b y the 1957 Rome Treaties in order to involve economic and social interest groups in the establishment of the common market and to provide institutional machinery for briefing the Commission and the Council of Ministers on European issues . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 21 In May 2017 , the EESC adopted a so-called “ own-initiative opinion ” on the “ consequences of artificial intelligence on the ( digital ) single market , production , consumption , employ-ment and society ” that was taken into account in the EU Communication on AI . In compari-son to other papers and communiqués on the EU AI initiative , it presents a very precise , specific and in-depth analysis of different types and subfields of AI ( narrow/general AI ) and its parameters and consequences . The committee provides general recommendations , including a human-in-command approach for “ responsible AI ” . It identifies eleven areas where AI poses societal and complex policy challenges , namely : ethics , safety , privacy , transparency and accountability , work , education and skills , ( in- ) equality and inclusiveness , law and regulation , governance and democracy , warfare and super-intelligence . external [ eU 11 ] In the paragraph on “ Transparency , comprehensibility , monitorability and accountability ” , the document deals with actions and decisions of AI systems ( through algorithms ) in peo-ple ’ s lives . The EESC argues that the acceptance , sustainable development and application of AI is based on the ability to understand , monitor and certify the operation , actions and decisions of AI systems , including retrospectively . The committee therefore advocates for transparent , comprehensible and monitorable AI systems whose operations have to be ac-countable , including retrospectively . In addition , the EESC demands that recommendations be made to determine which decision-making procedures can and can not be transferred to AI systems , and when human intervention is desirable or mandatory . The opinion offers a critical and substantial analysis of ethical questions , like embedded bias in AI development . It highlights the responsibility of humans to ensure that accuracy , data quality , diversity and self-reflection are taken into account in the design of AI , and to reflect on the environment in which it is applied . The EESC calls for a “ code of ethics for the development , application and use of AI so that throughout their entire operational process AI systems remain compatible with the principles of human dignity , integrity , freedom , privacy and cultural and gender diversity , as well as with fundamental human rights ” . The committee also asks for the “ development of a standardisation system for verifying , validat-ing and monitoring AI systems ” on a supra-national level . / eP r eport on c ivil l aw r ules on r obotics / e P c ommittee on r obotics In January 2017 , the European parliament adopted a report with recommendations to the Commission on Civil La w Rules on Robotics ( 2015/2103/ ( INL ) external [ eU 12 ] ) . The report covers a wide range of different areas , such as liability rules , ethical principles , standardisation and safety , data protection , human enhancement or education and employment . IT also provides a Code of Ethical Conduct for Robotics Engineers and a Code for Research Ethics Committees . The European Commission was asked by the Committee on Robotics to use its findings and recommendations as guidelines for the implementation of the EU AI strategy . This included the creation of a legal framework to address the use of AI and robotics for civil use . It specifically mentions that the “ further development and increased use of automated and algorithmic decision-making undoubtedly has an impact on the choices that a private person ( such as a business or an internet user ) and an administrative , judicial or other pub-lic authority take in rendering their final decision of a consumer , business or authoritative nature ” , therefore “ safeguards and the possibility of human control and verification need to be built into the process of automated and algorithmic decision-making ” , including “ the right to obtain an explanation of a decision based on automated processing ” . external [ eU 12 ] page 22 a utomating s ociety european Union In this context , a public consultation with an emphasis on civil law rules was conducted by the parliament ’ s Committee on L egal Affairs ( JURI ) to seek views on how to address the challenging ethical , economic , legal and social issues related to robotics and AI develop-ments . external [ eU 13 ] The consultation did not contain questions about automated or algorithmic decision-mak-ing , neither in the general public nor in the expert version of the questionnaire . However , some submissions explicitly referred to “ algorithmic discrimination “ and “ transparency of algorithmic decision-making “ . In addition , there was a mention that fundamental rights “ would be at risk if unethical practice is facilitated by virtue of algorithms focused on com-mercial gain , for example because humans ‘ allow ’ or ‘ rely ’ on robot sorting techniques that are discriminatory and may be unfair and undermine dignity and justice ” . Another respond-ent wrote : “ While the EU has started to address and regulate in the EU General Data p rotection Regulation , the use of automated individual decision-making systems , such as profiling , further work is needed to fully understand the functioning of these systems and [ to ] develop adequate safeguards to protect human rights and dignity . ” A highly controversial proposal appears in paragraph 59f of the resolution . It calls for the creation of “ a specific legal status for robots in the long run , so that at least the most sophis-ticated autonomous robots could be established as having the status of electronic persons responsible for making good any damage they may cause , and possibly applying electronic personality to cases where robots make autonomous decisions or otherwise interact with third parties independently ” . A group of around 285 “ political leaders , AI/robotics research-ers and industry leaders , physical and mental health specialists , law and ethics experts ” signed an open letter on “ Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ” external [ eU 14 ] , criticising the idea as misguided from a technical , ethical and legal perspective . Both the EESC ’ s opinion ( see above ) in its article 3.33 external [ eU 15 ] and UNESCO ’ s COMEST report on Robotics Ethics of 2017 in its article 201 external [ eU 16 ] state that they were opposed to any form of legal status for robots or AI . / european Union a gency for fundamental r ights The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights ( FRA external [ eU 17 ] ) is the EU ’ s centre of fundamental rights expertise . Established in 2007 and based in Vienna , it is one of the EU ’ s decentralised agencies set up to provide expert advice to EU institutions and Member States . The FRA is an independent EU body , funded by the Union ’ s budget , and is a member of the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI . Stating that the intersection of rights and technological developments warrants a closer analysis , the FRA actively examines two aspects of automated—or data-driven , as they call it—decision-making : Its effects on fundamental rights and the potential for discrimination in using big data for ADM . In 2018 , the FRA started a new project o n “ Artificial Intelligence , Big Data and Fundamental Rights ” , with the aim of contributing to the creation of guidelines and recommendations in these fields . external [ eU 18 ] In a focus paper they point out that “ When algorithms are used for decision-making , there is potential for discrimination against individuals . The principle of non-discrimination , as enshrined in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ( EU ) , needs to be taken into account when applying algorithms to everyday life . ” external [ eU 19 ] It also suggests potential ways of minimising this risk , like a strong inter-disciplinary approach : “ Although data protection principles provide some guidance on the use of algorithms , there is more that needs to be considered .

In this way , a truly fundamental rights-compliant approach can be developed . ” The project is collecting data on the fundamental rights implications and opportunities related to AI and Big Data in order to support development and implementation of policies . The agency will further analyse the feasibility of carrying out online experiments and simulation case studies using modern data analysis tools and techniques . In December 2018 , the FRA published an update external [ eU 20 ] of their “ guide on preventing unlawful profiling ” from 2010 . The update takes into account legal and technological developments and the increased use of profiling by law enforcement authorities . The guide also widened its scope to include border management , and it offered “ practical guidance on how to avoid unlawful profiling in police and border management operations . ” / ai 4 e U – e uropean ai -on-demand platform The main elements of the AI4EU project5 external [ eU 22 ] are the creation of a European AI-ondemand platform and the strengthening of the “ European AI community ” . Other areas of action are called “ Society and European Values ” , “ Business and Economy ” , and “ AI Research and Innovation ” . The platform is supposed to “ act as a broker , developer and one-stop shop providing and showcasing services , expertise , algorithms , software frameworks , develop-ment tools , components , modules , data , computing resources , prototyping functions and access to funding . ” Among a long list of activities to reach this goal is the development of a “ Strategic Research Innovation Agenda for Europe ” , including ethical , legal and socio-economic aspects . With regard to ADM , it remains to be seen what the establishment of the AI4EU Ethical Observatory will look like . Its mandate is to ensure the respect of human centred AI values and European regulations . / High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence T o support the implementation of the European strategy on AI , the Commission appointed 52 experts , including representatives from academia , civil society and industry to the High-Level Expert Group on AI ( AI HLEG ) . external [ eU 23 ] The group is tasked to prepare ethics guidelines6 that will build on the work of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New T echnologies , and of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights ( see both in this chapter ) , published as the group ’ s first deliverable in December2018 . The guidelines will cover issues such as fairness , safety , transparency , the future of work , democracy and more broadly the impact of AI and automated decision-making on the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights , including : privacy and personal data protection , dignity , consumer protection and non-discrimination . 5 The project website was updated just after the editorial deadline .

The AI HLEG ’ s recommendati ons will feed into the policy development process , the legislative evaluation process , and the development of a next-generation digital strategy . Overall , the AI HLEG serves as the steering group for the European AI Alliance ’ s work ( see below ) , and it interacts with other initiatives , helps stimulate a multi-stakeholder dialogue , gathers participants ’ views and reflects them in its analysis and repor ts .

It calls for products to be law-compliant by default and that “ risks , such as discrimination , loss of privacy and autonomy , lack of transparency , and enforcement failure are avoided . ” Looking into the danger of discrimination , it points out that consumers are categorised and profiled with an increasing degree of precision . “ The risk of discrimination , intended or unin-tended , resulting from data input that is not relevant enough to reach a correct conclusion , persists . The user may be deprived of a service or denied access to information , implying se-vere societal implications . ” This categorisation leads to the different treatment of each user , either in prices they receive , or deals and services they are offered , based on the association of the customer with a certain group . The report addresses the questions of how ADM pro-cesses can be audited , and what appropriate measures for correcting errors could look like . Commenting on the EU Communication on AI , BEUC criticises that there is no intent to update consumer rights laws with transparency obligations . Such obligations would help to ensure that consumers are informed when using AI-based products and services , particu-larly about the functioning of the algorithms involved , and their rights to object to auto-mated decisions . On the other hand , BEUC applauds the EU Commission ’ s plan to improve consumer access to their own health data . / claire CLAIRE ( Confederation of laboratories for Artificial Intelligence research in Europe ) is an initiative from the European AI community and was publicly launched on June 18 , 2018 with a document signed by 600 senior researchers and other stakeholders in Artificial Intelligence . external [ eU 31 ] It seeks to strengthen European excellence in AI research and innovation , and proposes the establishment of a pan-European Confederation of Laboratories for Artificial Intelligence Research in Europe , aiming for a “ brand recognition ” similar to the European Organisation for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) . part of CLAIRE ’ s vision is to “ focus on trustworth y AI that augments human intelligence rather than replacing it , and that thus benefits the people of Europe . ” LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 26 a utomating s ociety european Union / European Association for Artificial Intelligence The European Association for Artificial Intelligence EurAI ( formerly ECCAI ) external [ eU 32 ] was established in July 1982 , as a representative body for the European Artificial Intelligence community .

It remains a matter of controversy among experts regarding what the GDPR defines as a “ decision ” or what circumstances and which “ legal effects ” have to occur for the prohibition to apply . It further does not reflect the diversity of ADM systems already implemented , including various scenarios in which people are involved , who consciously or unconsciously implement ADM or follow the recommendations unquestioningly . external [ eU 39 ] Therefore , critics and rights advocates are questioning the scope and effectiveness of the application of Art . 22 to ADM. external [ eU 40 ] They see little room for manoeuvre when it comes to explicit , well-defined and effectual rights , especially against group-related and societal risks and the impact of automated decision-making systems . Also , concerning its interpre-tation and application to ADM , it lacks authoritative guidance . external [ eU 39 ] EDRi criticises the dilution of the right not to be subjected to automated decisions in Art . 20 of the GDPR leading to a lack of safeguards against the negativ e effects of profiling on data subjects ’ privacy , among others . external [ eU 41 ] Nevertheless , privacy International points out in their report “ Data Is Power : Profiling and Automated Decision-Making in GDPR ” that for the first time in EU data protection law the concept of profiling is explicitly defined ( Art . 4 ( 4 ) ) .

But there is a lively debate about what the impact of the regulation on the development of ADM will look like . Complementary approaches to strengthen measures within the GD p R and alternative regulatory tools are discussed to rectify already implemented ADM systems , e.g . by using regulation already in place ( consumer protection law , competition law , and media law ) . external [ eU 40 ] The European Data protection Board ( ED pB ) external [ eU 42 ] , which replaced the Article 29 Working Party ( WP29 ) on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of personal Data , is responsible for the de velopment and publication of ‘ guidelines , recommendations and best practices ’ on the GD p R from the EU side . external [ eU 42 ] The European data protection bodies ’ 9 Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purpose of Regulation 2016/679 ( developed by WP29 , endorsed by the ED p B , last revised and adopted in February 2018 ) suggest not only more comprehensive definitions of both concepts and their possible implications , but also general and specific provisions .

The directive regulates the processing of personal data by criminal law enforcement authorities and further agencies responsible for the prevention , investigation , detection and prosecution of criminal offences . It is intended to ensure , in particular , that the personal data of victims , witnesses , and suspects of crime are duly protected . The directive applies key principles and provisions of the GD p R to European criminal law enforcement authorities , though with adjusted requirements and specified exceptions . Law enforcement data protection officers , for example , are to be designated and must face the same responsibilities as others with this position under the GD p R. On the other hand , a more complex requirement is the differentiation of personal data based on facts from those based on assessments ( Art . 7 ) . Regarding automated individual decision-making , it states in Art . 11:1 . “ Member States shall provide for a decision based solely on automated processing , including profiling , which produces an adverse legal effect concerning the data subject or significantly affects him or her , to be prohibited unless authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which provides appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of the data subject , at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller . 2 .

The ED p S , as an independent supervisory authority , has the responsibility to monitor the processing of personal data by EU institutions and bodies , advise on policies and legislation that affect privacy , and cooperate with similar authorities either at the national or interna-tional level to ensure consistent data . external [ eU 50 ] The Supervisor and Assistant Supervisor were appointed in December 2014 with the specific remit of being more constructive and proactive . In March 2015 , they published a five-year strategy external [ eU 51 ] setting out how they intended to implement this remit , and to be accountable for doing so . In the strategy they first recognise : “ Big data challenges regulators and independent authorities to ensure that our principles on profiling , identifiability , data quality , purpose limitation , and data minimisation and retention periods are effectively applied in practice . Big data that deals with large volumes of personal information implies greater accountability towards the individuals whose data are being pro-cessed . people want to understand how algorithms can create correlations and assumptions about them , and how their combined personal information can turn into intrusiv e predictions about their behaviour . “ external [ eU 51 ] The ED pS ’ action plan to tackle these and more challenges include the following : W p romoting technologies to enhance privacy and data protection W identifying cross-disciplinary policy solutions W increasing tr ansparency , user control and accountability in big data processing W de veloping an ethical dimension to data protection W mainstreaming data protection into international agreements W speaking with a single EU v oice in the international arena W adopting and implementing up-to-date data protection rules W increasing the accountability of EU bodies processing personal information , and W facilitating responsible and informed policymaking Their objectiv e and mandate is to ensure that data protection is integrated into proposals for legislation that affects privacy and personal data protection in the EU . The European Commission consults the ED p S before it adopts a proposal for new legislation that is likely to have an impact on individuals ’ right to the protection of their personal data . The ED p S also provides advice on EU initiatives that are not legally binding so-called EU soft law instruments . It issues comments and opinions related to proposals for legislation that are addressed to all three EU institutions involved in the legislative process . In addition , it pub-lishes recommendations or comments on their own initiative , when appropriate , and when there is a matter of particular significance . external [ eU 52 ] The ED pS may also intervene before the EU courts either at the Court ’ s invitation or on behalf of one of the parties in a case to offer data protection e xpertise . Moreover , the ED p S monitors new technologies or other societal changes that may have an impact on data protection.LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-society external T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 31 On July 10 , 2018 , the ED pS issued an Opinion on the European Commission ’ s proposal for a new directiv e on the re-use of Public Sector Information ( PSI ) . It provides specific recommendations on how to clarify the relation and coherence of the p SI Directive with the exceptions outlined in the GD p R. external [ eU 53 ] In its opinion on the proposal , the ED pS points out the relevance of the revision of the pSI Directiv e as part of the EU vision on “ Good Big Data ” and emphasises how the smart use of data , including its processing via Artificial Intelligence , can ha ve a transformative effect on all sectors of the economy . At the same time , the ED p S demands that the legislator better address stakeholder concerns related to the necessary protection of personal data , especially in sensitive sectors such as health , when they take the decision on the re-use of p SI ( for example , clarifying the risks of re-identification of anonymised data and the safeguards against those risks ) . In that context , the ED p S recalls the data protection-relevance of the key principles that , according to the European Commission , should be respected in the context of data re-use , namely ( i ) minimised data lock-in and ensureing undistorted competition ; ( ii ) transparency and societal participation on the purpose of the reuse vis-à-vis the citizens/data subjects as well as transparency and clear purpose definition between the licensor and the licensees ; ( iii ) data protection impact assessments and appropriate data protection safeguards for reuse ( according to a ‘ do no harm ’ —under the data protection viewpoint—principle ) . Additionally , it provides for further recommendations on anonymisation and its relation to costs and data protection . It also focuses on a data protection impact assessment ( D p IAs ) for sensitive sectors , such as healthcare , while taking into account an ‘ acceptable re-use policy ’ . Some of the ED p S 's output relevant to ADM includes : W As part of its Ethics Initiativ e , the ED p S conducted a public consultation , lasting from June to July 2018 , showing the need to re-think the role of data in the digital era along with questions like “ What does the right to privacy mean in an age of continuous and ubiquitous tracking , measuring , and profiling ?

This framework could be applied to protect workers in a situation where work-related decisions are not taken by a human being , but ( semi- ) auto-matically by an algorithm , since this is a potential source of discrimination . The framework doesn ’ t just include formally employed persons , as many national regulations do , but has a wider approach , so it may also be applicable to platform workers as well . In addition , the recent Egenberger decision of the ECJ established that anti-discrimination applies to all as-pects laid down in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union , namely sex , race , colour , ethnic or social origin , genetic features , language , religion or belief , political or any other opinion , membership of a national minority , property , birth , disability , age , or sexual orientation .

This is to be achieved by means of so-called “ Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems ” ( C-ITS ) . These C-ITS would be installed as boxes in vehicles , cars and roads , and connected to traffic control centres . In particular , the EU turned its attention to Japan , where C-ITS has been operating successfully since 2016 . The regulation is supposed to ensure that drivers of vehicles equipped with this technology will be informed of “ 13 dangerous situations in stationary and moving traffic ” . Vehicle movements are to be coordinated in order to , for example , trigger braking manoeuvres and “ drastically reduce ” frequently occurring accident sequences . In the second phase , further infrastructure is to be integrated into ‘ intelligent ’ data exchange , like charging stations , parking spaces and park and ride areas . By mid-2019 , a “ 100 % guaranteed reliability of the warning notices ” is intended to create more legal certainty for automobile manufacturers , road operators and companies in the 13 The European Union ( EU ) Regulation ( 1025/2012 ) that settles the legal fr amework for standardisation , has been adopted by the European parliament and b y the Council of the EU , and entered into force on 1 January 2013. external [ eU 66 ] LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 34 a utomating s ociety european Union telecommunications sector .

These developments represent the gradual moving away from a “ country-centric ” approach towards a “ person-centric ” approach . external [ eU 78 ] Though strongly criticised by civil society and data protection bodies ( see below in this paragraph ) , and accompanied by the request for technological reviews external [ eU 79 ] , the implementation of an overarching interoperable smart border management system is on its way . eu-LISA , the “ European Agency for the Operational Management of large-scale IT Systems in the Area of Freedom , Security and Justice ” , is now managing the “ strengthened ” databases and applications VIS , SISII and EURODAC together . external [ eU 80 ] This is leading to T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 35 the creation of a “ biometric core data system ” external [ eU 81 ] , with three more systems under construction or currently being discussed : W A new centr alised version of the European Criminal Records Information System which will also include third-country nationals ( ECRIS-TCN ) . W The adapted European T ravel Information and Authorisation System ( ETIAS ) . external [ eU 82 ] . This is a pre-travel authorisation system that comes into force in 2021 . It includes an “ individual risk assessment ” process based on a “ background and eligibility questionnaire ” for visa-exempt travellers . It cross-checks with EU databases and the “ ETIAS watchlist ” . The applications are processed automatically . 14 W Complemented b y the Entry-Exit System ( EES ) external [ eU 83 ] , which is currently under development and will be operational by 2020 , EES will be used by border guards and consular officers . Member States law enforcement authorities and Europol will also have access to it . eu-LISA is the agency mandated to implement “ technical upgrades ” of these IT systems . It runs pilot projects and training , e.g . on the use of identification and verification technolo-gies for border control . Reflecting on the interoperability of EU information systems to freedom , security and justice the European Data p rotection Supervisor stresses “ that interoperability is not primarily a technical choice , it is first and foremost a political choice to be made , with significant legal and societal implications in the years to come ” . It sees a “ clear trend to mix distinct EU law and policy objectives ” . external [ eU 84 ] It follows the criticism of ME p Marie-Christine Vergiat who claimed that a “ presumption of irregularity ” underlining this system replaces the as sumption of innocence . external [ eU 85 ] Michael O ’ Flaherty , the director of the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights , addressed the High-Level Expert Group on Information Systems and Interoperability and scrutinised the effect of “ flagged ” hits—this is the only knowledge that an entry for a specific person exists in a specific database , for example in the European Criminal Records Information System ( ECRIS-TCN ) —and if a “ flagged ” hit may further influence decisions taken about an individual . O ’ Flaherty also underlines that “ there is the risk of discriminatory profiling . The data contained in IT systems can be used for risk assessment or profiling . Risk assessment or profiling is not a violation of funda-mental rights , but discriminatory profiling is . The chance of this taking place increases if IT systems are interoperable , as several data categories revealing sensitive data such as , race , ethnicity , health , sexual orientation , and religious beliefs can then be accessed simultane-ously for profiling purposes . ” external [ eU 86 ] With this in mind , see the paragraph on iBorderCtrl , a project on an “ Intelligent portable Border Control System ” below . 14 When there is a hit in one of the EU security databases or a question is answered positiv ely , the data will be manually checked and the risks individually assessed within four weeks . persons posing a risk will be refused entry , having the right to appeal.page 36 a utomating s ociety european Union / iBorder c trl – “ i ntelligent Portable Border c ontrol s ystem ” iBorderCtrl external [ eU 87 ] 15 is a system designed to screen non-EU nationals at EU borders . It is supposed to determine whether a person is telling the truth in an automated interview with a virtual border guard , conducted before the person arrives at the border , i.e . from home . If they pass this screening process , they can pass the border without further investigation . If there is suspicion that a person is lying , then biometric information is taken at the border control point , such as fingerprints and palm vein images , and the person is passed on to a human agent who will review the information and make an assessment . iBorderCtrl is currently being tested in Hungary , Greece , and Latvia , where those countries have borders with non-EU countries . external [ eU 88 ] In the first phase—pre-screening with automated checks—third-country nationals register online , upload pictures of their passport , visa , and proof of funds , then they use a webcam to answer questions from a computer-animated border guard avatar . This is described as “ a short , automated , non-invasive interview , subject to lie detection ” and aimed to “ improve performance in comparison to human agents , as it correctly adapts to traveller ’ s profiles ” —meaning it is personalised to the traveller ’ s gender , ethnicity and language . In a “ unique approach to ‘ deception detection ’ ” the system “ analyses the micro-gestures of travellers to figure out if the interviewee is lying . ” external [ eU 89 ] Besides the fundamental question of the scientific accuracy of lie detectors , the group of 32 people who tested the avatar was not representative and contained the risk of racial bias : the majority were men ( 22 ) , and they were mainly white Europeans . Only 10 had an Asian or Arab background . After asking 13 questions , the average accuracy of the system in rela-tion to a single question is 75 % , meaning there is a potential 25 % error rate . external [ eU 90 ] Travellers at this stage are further informed “ of their rights and travel procedures “ and provided with “ advice and alerts to discourage illegal activity “ . At stage two—at the border itself—border officials “ automatically cross-check information , comparing the facial images captured during the pre-screening stage to passports and photos taken on previous border crossings . ” Afterwards , the risk score of the traveller is supposed to be recalculated . “ Only then does a border guard take over from the automated system . ” external [ eU 91 ] One of the stated aims of the system is “ to reduce the subjective control and workload of human agents and to increase the objective control with automated means that are non-invasive and do not add to the time the traveller has to spend at the border ” . The applica-tion further foresees the creation of an additional layer for “ bona fide travellers , especially regular travellers into a Schengen-wide frequent traveller programme including a reward system based on number of successful crossings and trouble-free stay ” . external [ eU 87 ] The stated technological framework of the iBorderCtrl system external [ eU 92 ] is to “ empower —through technology—the border guard ” and it in volves : 15 The project has receiv ed funding from the European Union ’ s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 700626 . `` The piloting deployment will end in August 2019 after approximately nine months duration .

W A Risk Based Assessment T ool ( RBAT ) , utilising risk based approaches to intelligently aggregate and correlate all the data collected and the estimated ris k. It then classifies travellers to support the decision of the border guard . This includes a systematic process to stimulate compliance by compressing all the data into meaningful actionable risk scores . W An Integr ated Border Control Analytics Tool ( BCAT ) for advanced post-hoc analytics . W A Hidden Human Detection T ool ( HHD ) to detect people inside various vehicles . iBorderCtrl states that “ regarding the expected accuracy it would be wrong to expect 100 % accuracy from any AI-based deception detection technology , no matter how mature ” , iBor-derCtrl therefore relies “ on many components that address various aspects of the border control procedures , and each provides its own risk estimation for the traveller ” . The system then “ synthesises a single risk score from a weighted combination of components ” . Empha-sising the “ human-in-the-loop principle ” , the makers conclude that “ it is highly unlikely that an overall system of which ADDS is a part will lead to ‘ an implementation of a pseudoscien-tific border control . ’ ” external [ eU 92 ] According to the scientists involved , EU funding ensures that economic interests do not play a role . Nevertheless , the so-called “ success story ” of the Commission on the project ends with : “ [ ... ] ‘ in light of the alarming terror threats and increasing terror attacks tak-ing place on European Union soil , and the migration crisis ’ [ … ] , the partner organisations of IBORDERCTRL are likely to benefit from this growing European security market—a sector predicted to be worth USD 146 billion ( EUR 128 bn ) in Europe by 2020 . “ external [ eU 91 ] 16 On the use of ADDS , apart from the research project , the website adds that “ in a real border check [ it ] can not be based on informed consent .

In general , the current Belgian political discourse uses the terms ‘ Big Data ’ and ‘ Artificial Intelligence ’ ( AI ) . In general , the governmental strategies concerning digitisation and AI are embedded in an economic discourse and are about increasing jobs and supporting companies in the context of Industry 4.0 . Although automation and digitisation has been going on for a long time , in Belgium this has always been characterised by problems with implementation . The result is that Belgium is rather behind the rest of Europe , especially when it comes to digitisation of the public sector . Political de Bates on as Pects of automation – Go ve R nment and Pa R liament / digital Belgium : d igital a genda – feder al Government The federal government does not have a specific strategy concerning AI or ADM , but they did launch “ Digital Belgium : Digital Agenda ” in 2015 .

This can be done , not by inventing everything , but rather by functioning as a living lab for Flemish and international applications . ” So-called priority clusters and Vlaio ( the Flemish Bureau for Innovation and Entrepreneurship ) are supposed to “ take care of knowledge sharing and to establish a network to follow AI trends and translate these to Flemish companies . ” The Flanders government states that there is a need for a broad sensitisation to the disruptive potential of AI technology : “ Both in education and in the corporate world people are working at installing permanent training provisions . In addition , an AI think tank will be established to examine the ethical implications that AI entails . ” Several events have taken place in 2018 under the direction of the minister .

The Danish government takes the position that infor-mation about the ’ logic ’ of automated decisions must be available to citizens . In November 2018 , a group set up by the Danish government— consisting of e xperts from business , academia and civil society—published a set of recom-mendations on data ethics.As part of a larger ” ghetto-plan ” to fight ” parallel societies ” and in spite of public criticism , the Danish government plans to roll out an automated risk assessment system for families with children . DENMA rk By Brigitte Alfter The Danish government states that it wants to actively further the development of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) and related education . The focus is clearly on the potential for economic growth . Activities include support for digital qualifications in general education , funding for research and support for business innovation . A government commission on data ethics has recommended labelling products and services that contain AI-based technology , and it also suggests the creation of a permanent data ethics council . Digital tools , AI , and automated decision-making ( ADM ) systems are being integrated into public administration processes . Many such ADM systems are not discussed by the wider public and are simply considered to be efficient administration . But some cases have led to widespread political debate , such as a surveillance and early warning system for children in vulnerable circumstances . Specialists in civil society and academia call for transparency , accountability , and adjusted legislation that balances both digital efficiency and civil liberties . Politic Al de BAtes on A s P ects of Aut om Ation – g overnment A nd P A rli A ment / digitalisation reform of the public sector On October 23 2018 , the digitalisation reform of the public sector was announced . Its purpose was to better use citizens ’ data , and to use AI to make public administration more efficient and citizen-friendly . external [ dK 1 ] The plan includes a strategy for the public sector , plans for a data ethics council , and the ability for each citizen to see all the data held about him or her , including a log about who accessed this data and when . The plan also points towards providing private companies—such as insurance and banks—access to public data , including citizens ’ data , and thus support the national strategy for digital growth passed earlier the same year . The plan is supported by an investment fund of 410 million Danish Crowns ( €55 million ) for 2018-2022. external [ dK 2 ] Denmark is rather unique in that , since the 1960s , data compiled on citizens has been recorded with a unique identifier , a personal number . The government hopes to use this data when developing Artificial Intelligence based on large data sets . external [ dK 3 ] Though the term automatisation is only mentioned in connection to ‘ routine ’ tasks , one of the explicit purposes of the plan is to use Artificial Intelligence to better service citizens in areas such as medical prediction systems , or better control of fraud . The plan is set to be implemented over the coming years . / national strategy for digital growth A national strategy for Denmark ’ s digital growth external [ dK 4 ] was published in January 2018 with the overall purpose of stimulating growth . The logic is business driven : that digitalisation leads to improved productivity per worker , that about one third of jobs in Denmark can potentially be automated , and that digital developments create new competition for Danish business . The Danish government and two other political parties have allocated 1 billion Danish Crowns ( €134 million ) from November 2017 until 2025 for stimulation and development efforts . In addition , certain tax incentives are offered for new initiatives and development in the field . The activities include a Digital Hub external [ dK 5 ] set up in a public-private-partnership by three ministries and three business organisations : LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 46 Automating s ociety denmark the chamber of commerce , the industry association , and the financial sector . The purpose is to help matchmaking between specialised research , competence and investment , to do further research and to market Denmark as a digitally attractive business environment . Other elements are : a T echnology Pact external [ dK 6 ] that allocates resources to digital education in schools ( this is the single largest sum budgeted ) and includes coding for teachers and children or case-oriented projects in collaboration between schools and local businesses external [ dK 7 ] ; a focus on the use of data as a growth driver , including open public data and public-private data sharing ; revision of existing regulation to make it easier for business to develop and use new technologies ; a catalogue of legislation to be adjusted to the needs of business and consumers and the strengthening of IT security in business . This strategy has to be considered within the context of automated decision-making , even though the strategy does not explicitly mention ADM. / strategy on digital health In January 2018 , Denmark passed a strategy on digital health for 2018-2022 external [ dK 8 ] . The plan is to develop a number of digital or digitally supported services , including automatisa-tion , prediction and ‘ decision support ’ . The government ’ s ethics council , Etisk r åd , advocates a balanced approach with a particular focus on privacy rights . external [ dK 9 ] Doctors ’ organisations are generally in favour of digital developments , though they raise the flag when they see the physician-patient privilege threatened , or when terminology lacks legal clarity . On a more general level , digital developments—including in the health sector and particularly when it comes to ( automated ) predictions—are addressed by data ethic advocates/consultants , external [ dK 10 ] who , for example , point out the dangers of insecurity related to automated predictions . / government strategy for research and education The government strategy for research and education from December 2017 external [ dK 11 ] emphasises the use of digital technologies . This covers both the development of entirely new technologies and the application of digital technologies in business and in the public sector . Among other initiatives , the government is also working towards a national centre for digital technologies . / Public authorities ’ digitalisation strategy In May 2016 , public authorities at the national , regional and local level—including admin-istrative bodies such as ministries as well as implementing bodies like public hospitals , schools etc.—decided on a digitalisation strategy 2016-2020. external [ dK 12 ] However , this strategy did not explicitly include automated decision-making . Politic Al de BAtes on A s P ects of Aut om Ation – c ivil s ociety A nd Ac A demi A A number of fora in Denmark discuss digital growth , opportunities , needs and ethics . Most of them address this on a general level , however some address automated decision-making in particular . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 47 / Siri-Commission The Siri-Commission was initiated by a social liberal politician and the union of engineers . Its leading group external [ DK 13 ] consists of high level trade union and business representatives predominantly . Its purpose external [ DK 14 ] is to look into growth and job opportunities connected to Artificial Intelligence and to raise awareness of the effects of such changes on Danish society . In September 2011 , the Siri Commission published a report prepared by a data ethics consultancy with a number of recommendations , including for example the require ment that there should always be humans to have the last word , for privacy and data ethics to be built into any design by default , to fight data bias , to use AI in an inclusive way , and to develop standards on how to explain algorithms . external [ DK 15 ] / Think tank DataEthics The think tank DataEthics was founded in 2015 by four women with backgrounds in law , journalism , and business .

[ DK 22 ] The seven principles of the agreement concern 1 ) clear rules , 2 ) digital communication , 3 ) automated administration , 4 ) shared terminology and reuse of data , 5 ) safe and secure data handling , 6 ) use of public infrastructure and 7 ) prevention of abuse and mistakes . The independent legal think tank Justitia raised concerns about a number of elements , including automated case management by public authorities . In particular , Justitia flagged the lack of rules in which cases would continue to determine when a human is needed to make a decision , and the lack of transparency in automated decision-making which would allow greater scrutiny . Justitia also raised concerns that digitalisation guidance did not suf ficiently take into account the legal security and privacy of citizens . external [ DK23 ] page 48 Automating Society Denmark / implementation of the gd P r in d enmark Denmark implemented the GDP r with legislation that came into force on May 23 , 2018. external [ dK 24 ] However , a minority group of four centre-left parties in the Danish parliament were critical of the legislation when it was adopted . They said that the public authorities ’ right to access and to combine the personal data of citizens was too intrusive , and that it meant that there was no obligation to inform citizens . external [ dK 25 ] external [ dK 26 ] The minority group protested against the “ far reaching possibilities ” of combining data from different au-thorities , for example “ place of living , nationality , missed doctor ’ s appointments , unemploy-ment , mental illness or drug abuse ” . The minority group also emphasised the need to inform citizens about this compilation of data about individual citizens . / Algorithm transparency in automated decisions Along with the implementation of the GDP r , Denmark takes the position that information about the ‘ logic ’ of automated decisions must be a vailable to citizens : “ When the data controller responsible solely has to inform about the ‘ logic ’ of the automated decisions , a more detailed description of the basis for the process can not be demanded . The important thing must be that the affected person can understand the considerations underlying the process and how ‘ the system ’ reaches the various decisions ” . external [ dK 27 ] Legal scholar Hanne Marie Motzfeldt fears that automated decision-making software could be used in public admin-istration , while at the same time there are no control mechanisms in place such as technol-ogy that can trace patterns applied by the software . 1 In her analysis of the fulfilment of necessary ‘ system transparency ’ she refers to existing guidance by the Danish Ombudsman on the obligation of authorities to fulfil all necessary principles for public administration . These include the ‘ officialprincip ’ —the implicit duty to investigate the facts of a case before making a decision . external [ dK 28 ] However , various cases lead her to the—explicitly tentative— conclusion , that administrative law fully secures transparency and control mechanisms.2 Motzfeldt observes a lack of a “ lively and qualified debate ” about the legal aspects on the balance between technical possibilities and a wish for more efficient administration on the one hand , and the price to be paid by citizens ’ trust , including demands for full transpar-ency , on the other . 3 Motzfeldt is the leader of the newly established Centre for Law and Digitalisation at the University of Århus . external [ dK 29 ] Adm in Action / Adm in the d anish administration Automated decisions are applied in Danish administration , often without much ado . For example , student stipends for higher education are decided by combining the student ‘ s online application with the information that he or she is accepted to undertake a course of education that qualifies for such a stipend , and the funds are then transferred to the bank account of the student . This process is based upon the law on study stipends external [ dK 30 ] and attracts little attention . But other fields of ADM do attract attention . 1 Motzfeldt , H. M. ( 2018 ) .

These activities are regulated via data protection laws and overseen by the Danish data protection authority , Data Tilsynet . In a more general comment on the dilemmas of the information economy , Rikke Frank Jørgensen , a specialised human rights expert , points at information imbalances , as well as the need to address the “ fundamental discrepancies between a personalised information economy on one side and a society based upon respect for privacy and data protection ” . 4 credit scoring Following media coverage in 2005 , Data Tilsynet produced a precedent decision for Experian , an international credit scoring company working in Denmark . The decision addressed the parameters for the credit prediction of individuals and companies using scoring systems called ‘ Consumer Delphi ( individuals ) ’ and ‘ Commercial Delphi ( companies ) ’ . According to the company , the parameters used to make the decision included birth date , address and address changes , and open or closed registrations in a debtors ’ register , including the size of the registered debt . In its decision , Data Tilsynet discussed the parameters included and described which parameters should be included and emphasised . In the case of an individual complaint , the decisive parameters for a given decision must be disclosed . external [ dK 31 ] Over the years , Data Tilsynet has repeatedly addressed company permissions , questions from Parliament , and complaints by consumers concerning their credit scoring practices . external [ dK 32 ] Public discussion about the matter is not widespread , though specialised media focusing on digital and computer developments do pick up on the question . Media outlets have , for example , described how banks are capable of targeting customers based on their consump-tion patterns external [ dK 33 ] , or by using interviews with companies offering profiles and predictions . external [ dK 34 ] car insurance Car insurers offer rebates if drivers install a box external [ dK 35 ] to measure speed , acceleration , deceleration and g-force .

Three local authorities had asked for exemption from the usual data protec-tion rules to run an experiment external [ dK 37 ] external [ dK 38 ] to trace children with special needs from a very early stage . The model was named Gladsaxe , after the municipality in the suburbs of Copenhagen . The two other municipalities involved were Guldborgsund and Ikast-Brande , representing a rural , and a mixed rural-industrial community . The purpose was to trace children who were vulnerable due to social circumstances even before they 4 Jørgensen , R. F . ( 2018 ) .

Based on previous use of statistics , the authorities decided to combine information about ‘ risk indicators ’ . The model used a points-based system , with parameters such as mental illness ( 3000 points ) , unemployment ( 500 points ) , missing a doctor ’ s appointment ( 1000 points ) or dentist ’ s appointment ( 300 points ) . Divorce was also included in the risk estimation , which was then rolled out to all families with children . external [ dK 39 ] external [ dK 40 ] After the story about this system was published in Politiken—along with the government ’ s apparent plans to roll out the model all over Denmark—the public reacted strongly . The notion of a points-based system reached far and wide . Many refer to it—in jokes and irony—on a colloquial basis , such as “ Oh no , I forgot the dentist . As a single parent I ’ d better watch out now… ” . In addition , an evaluation scheme of children ’ s well-being and development at kindergarten was unveiled . Individual evaluations were prepared and stored without the knowledge of parents and in breach of existing legislation . external [ dK 41 ] While the latter is data gathering rather than automated flagging—and thus only creates material that can potentially be used for automated risk assessment—the public and political reactions to this scheme were strong , including the reaction from academia . external [ dK 42 ] In spite of the public criticism external [ dK 43 ] , the Danish government planned to roll out the early tracing model from Gladsaxe to the whole country . This is part of a larger ‘ ghetto-plan ’ to fight ‘ parallel societies ’ . It is a plan that sets a number of criteria for a neighbourhood to qualify as a ‘ ghetto ’ and then introduces a series of special measures , such as higher punish-ments for crimes , forcing children into public day care at an early age , lifting the protec-tion of tenants in order to privatise public housing , tearing down entire building blocks and—indeed—applying the automated risk assessment system for families with children . external [ dK 44 ] external [ dK 45 ] In September 2018 the minister responsible mentioned a planned legal act 5 , but by December 2018 the speaker on legal affairs of the government coalition partner Liberal Alliance said to newspaper Politiken that the proposal had been shelved 6 .

One of the problems was lack of insight into the processes : “ Precise knowledge about the functioning of data and business processes that were ‘ cast ’ into the IT systems were largely placed with the IT provider ” and not with the authority itself . Further “ data and systems often were so badly documented that [ the tax authority ] did not have sufficient insights into them ” . external [ dK 54 ] / Predictive policing In the autumn of 2016 , public tender documents and FOI requests obtained by journalists showed that the Danish police and the Danish police intelligence service had ordered a digital system from the US company Palantir . external [ dK 55 ] T ender documents showed that the system should be able to handle and make searchable very different data sources . These include document and case handling systems , investigation support systems , forensic and mobile forensic systems , as well as different types of acquiring systems such as open source acquisition , and information exchange between external police bodies . external [ dK 56 ] external [ dK 57 ] In that context , experts voiced criticism that this was a portent to making ‘ predictive polic-ing ’ possible . external [ dK 58 ] The new digital system for Danish police and Danish police intelligence was adopted as part of anti-terrorism measures . external [ dK 59 ] Two years previously , in 2014 , an automatic license plate control system was introduced by Danish police .

Data already logged about assistance , hospitalisation and from semi-structured text by caretakers were aggregated and combined to create an individual history . By analysing three months back in time , it was possible to predict with 80 percent 8 Motzfeldt , H. M. , p. 231.page 52 Automating s ociety denmark precision when significantly more care would be needed , the municipality claimed . The logging and analysis did not change the need , but allowed for more targeted assistance and planning . Another project concerned the human resources department , where the task was to control whether all relevant information about individual employees was obtained and cor rectly filed . This includes documents such as contracts , work permits and criminal records . The automated solution included a script to find the documents , place them in a cloud plat form , read them with OCR translation , and use a self-made algorithm to find the relevant documents . The automated process was said to be 90 percent accurate due to bad scans of some documents , while manual checks were estimated to be 95 percent accurate .

A free online course introduces basic concepts and applications of AI . Its goal is to help citizens better understand AI and equip them with knowledge to participate in public debates on the subject.online FINLAND By Minna Ruckenstein and Julia Velko Va At the level of Finnish central government , automation is predominantly discussed in relation to Artificial Intelligence . The government ’ s goal is to pool together societal-wide resources to foster developments around AI and automated decision-making . The gov-ernmental AI Programme consists of concrete initiatives to boost economic growth and to revitalise companies and the public sector . An ethical information policy—commissioned to address questions of data ownership and the effects of automat ion on Finnish society— will be finalised soon . Civil society actors , in turn , are concerned with ethical uses of data that underpin automated decision-making . A key actor in the process is an international non-governmental organization , MyData Global , which grew out of a Finnish data activ-ism initiative . Other issues on the agenda are the discriminatory nature of credit scoring and clarifications of mistakes made by automated processes related to tax assessments . Such clarifications are important in the light of ongoing automation projects in the public sector . Social insurance institutions , among others , are struggling to resolve the challenges of ensuring compatibility with existing laws , and with the difficulties in justifying the logic of automated decision-making processes . The start-up sector for ADM solutions is growing rapidly and involves work on a variety of projects including prospective employee personal-ity assessments , health diagnosis , and content moderation of online discussions . Political de Bates on as Pects of auto Mation – Go V e R n M ent and Pa R lia M ent / The Artificial Intelligence Programme The Artificial Intelligence Programme external [ fi 1 ] , commissioned by the Minister of Economic Affairs , was launched in May 2017 and the final AI strategy is due in April 2019 . T o imple-ment the work of the initiative , a steering group was established , chaired by Pekka Ala-Pietilä , CEO and co-founder of Blyk , and former president of Nokia Corporation and Nokia Mobile Phones . The group 's first report , published in October 2017 , introduced AI as an opportunity for Finland to be among the winners of the economic transformation that is believed will revolutionise industries and organizations from transport and healthcare to energy and higher education . The AI Programme describes the application of AI as a societal-wide pressure for rapid transformation that offers opportunities for economic growth and renewal for companies and the public sector , if the opportunities are dealt with in a systematic manner . One of the stated aims of the programme is the formation of “ a broad-based consensus ” of the possibilities of AI to foster “ a good artificial intelligence society ” . A broad consensus on the matter is seen as essential , because of the limited resources of a sm all nation . Therefore , the contributions to the AI field must be implemented efficiently with a consistent empha-sis on economic impact . While specifics of automated decision-making are not mentioned in the AI programme , the simultaneous improvement of service quality and the level of personalization , alongside expected efficiency gains , point to expectations of considerable automation in the provision of public services . The AI programme foresees efficiency increases in service provision as links : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 56 Automating Society Finland the main benefit for the public sector , in particular when it comes to the provision of healthcare services . With the help of AI , services provided by the public administration become free of the confines of time and location . Digital services can utilise appropriate information at the right time , and hence proactive interventions can be made to enhance citizen wellbe-ing . In short , AI is expected to help the public sector to predict service needs , and respond in a timely manner to each citizen ’ s needs and personal circumstances . Key points of Finnish AI strategy The proposed actions for the Finnish AI strategy emphasise the competitiveness of compa-nies through the use of AI external [ fi 2 ] . This goal is supported by various proposals , for instance , by ensuring that Finnish data resources are accumulated and enriched systematically , their technical and semantic interoperability is ensured and that datasets are utilised in all sectors of society . The adoption of AI is simplified with “ platform economy trials ” that bring together companies and research facilities for the piloting of AI solutions . Such piloting is supported by an independent facilitator—the CSC IT Center for Science , a non-profit or-ganization owned by the state ( 70 % ) and higher education institutions ( 30 % ) —which offers computational and data storage resources . In terms of public administration , the AI strategy promotes public-private partnerships and the renewal of public services . In addition , new cooperation models are being estab-lished to boost digital service development . The goal is to build public services that are the best in the world , always available and in any language needed . AI applications are devel-oped to better anticipate and predict service needs of the future . The strategy promises that time consuming queues and telephone appointments will be eliminated by the use of personalised services and digital assistants . Work towards that aim , however , has only just begun . / Elements of Artificial Intelligence The strategy work emphasises that Finns must have access to AI literacy—a guaranteed ba-sic understanding of AI principles . In order to support this goal , an English-language online course called 'Elements of Artificial Intelligence ' external [ fi 3 ] was developed by the Department of Computer Science at the University of Helsinki in partnership with the technology com-pany Reaktor to form part of the Finnish AI Programme . The two parties involved produced the course work pro bono . The course introduces basic concepts and applications of AI and machine learning with the aim of increasing public understanding of AI and better equip-ping people to participate in public debates on the subject . The soc ietal implications of AI , such as algorithmic bias and de-anonymisation , are introduced to underscore the need for policies and regulations to guarantee that society can adapt well to the changes the ever-widening use of AI brings . The course is free for anyone to attend , and close to hundred thousand participants have already signed up . / FCAI – Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence The Finnish AI strategy emphasises the necessity for a Center of Excellence for AI and applied basic research that will attract top-level international expertise . The recently established Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence ( FCAI ) external [ fi 4 ] aims to respond to such a need by becoming a nationwide cross-disciplinary competence centre for AI , initiated by Aalto University , University of Helsinki , and VTT T echnical Research Centre of Finland . The mission is to create “ Real AI for Real People in the Real World ” , a type of AI which operates in collaboration with humans in various everyday domains . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 57 As part of the Center , the FCAI Society external [ FI 5 ] , a group which consists of experts from philosophy , ethics , sociology , legal studies , psychology and art , will explore the impact AI has in all aspects of our lives . Both FCAI Society and FCAI researchers are committed to engaging in public dialogue when considering the wider implications of AI research . / Request of clarification about using automated tax assessments In September 2018 , the Deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman , Maija Sakslin , requested clarification from the T ax Administration about using automated tax assessments . external [ FI 6 ] In 2017 , the Deputy Ombudsman had made two complaints regarding mistakes made by automated processes . In her position paper , the ombudsman writes that in two of her com-plaint settlements , the T ax Administration reported that taxation procedures of self-as-sessed taxes are mostly automated . Although the mistakes made by automated processes had been fixed , the ombudsman is concerned about how taxpayers ’ legal protection , good administration and accountability of public servants are secured in automated taxation decisions . external [ FI 7 ] The ombudsman states that it is problematic that the requests for information letters and taxation decision letters sent by the automated taxation systems do not include any spe-cific contact information , only general service numbers of the T ax Administration . Moreo-ver , the automated taxation process produces no justification concerning the decisions it makes . If there are problems with the decision , the issue is handled at a call centre by a pub-lic servant who has not taken part in the decision-making and has no detailed information about the decision . Based on the two complaints , the ombudsman stated that , in terms of automated taxation , taxpayers ’ legal rights to receive an accurate service and justification of the taxation decisions are currently unclear . The Deputy-Ombudsman has requested the Ministry of Finance to obtain the reports needed from the T ax Administration and the Min-istry to produce their own report regarding the legality of automated taxati on . The report was due in November 2018 . / Report on ethical information policy in an age of Artificial Intelligence In March 2018 , the Ministry of Finance set up a group to prepare a report on ethical ques-tions concerning information policy and AI . A draft of the report was made publicly avail-able and open to comment until the end of October and is currently being finalised . The report discusses policies regarding individuals ' rights to their own data ( M yData ) , openness of AI solutions , and the prevention of adverse effects stemming from automated decision-making on support systems and society . The policy needs are described on a very general level , and any possible regulatory or legislative measures resulting from the report will take place under the next government . external [ fi 8 ] Political de Bates on as Pects of auto Mation – c i V il s ociety and acade M ia / MyData Global In October 2018 , an international association for the ethical use of personal data , MyData Global external [ fi 9 ] , was founded to consolidate and promote the MyData initiative that started page 58 Automating Society Finland in Finland some years ago . The association ’ s purpose is to empower individuals by improving their right to self-determination regarding their personal data . The hum an-centric paradigm is aimed at a fair , sustainable , and prosperous digital society , where the sharing of personal data is based on trust as well as a balanced and fair relationship between individu-als and organisations . The founding of this association formalises a network of experts and stakeholders , working on issues around personal data uses , and they have been gathering in Helsinki annually since August 2016 . As machine learning and AI-based systems rely on personal data generated by and about individuals , the ethics of these technologies have been at the forefront in the meetings of the MyData community . Much like personal data itself , the potential of these technologies for individual as well as collective and societal good is recognised as being enormous . At the same time , considerations of privacy and the rights of individuals and collectives to know what data about them is being used , and for what purposes , as well as to opt out selectively or wholesale , must be taken seriously , argue the proponents of the MyData model . external [ FI 10 ] At the core of MyData is an attempt to bring experts together to find arenas of appropriate intervention in terms of building an ethically more robust society . ReGulato Ry and self -ReGulato Ry Measu Res / Ethical Challenge for Enterprises In terms of the ethics , Finland ’ s AI Programme challenges enterprises to share their un-derstanding and use of ethical principles with the aim of making Finland a model country for the ethical uses of AI . Questions that this challenge external [ fi 11 ] is addressing include the following : Is the data used to train AI biased or discriminating ? Who is responsible for the decisions made by AI ? This work started recently—the kick-off event for companies was held in October 2018 . The aim is to promote self-regulation in companies and formulate principles that define how AI could be used in fair , more transparent and trust-building ways . Leading Finnish enterprises that were the first to join the ethics challenge include the K Group , OP Group and Stora Enso and currently more than fifty companies are participat-ing in the challenge . external [ fi 12 ] oV eRsiGht Mechanis Ms / Non-Discrimination and Equality Tribunal In April 2018 , the National Non-Discrimination and Equality Tribunal prohibited a finan-cial company , specialising in credits , the use of certain statistical methods in credit scoring decisions . The Non-Discrimination Ombudsman had requested the tribunal to investigate whether the credit institution company Svea Ekonomi AB was guilty of discrimination in a case that occurred in July 2015 . The case considered whether the company did not grant a loan to a person in connection to the purchase of building materials online . external [ fi 13 ] Having received a rejection to the loan application , the credit applicant , a Finnish-speaking man in his thirties from a sparsely populated rural area of Finland , asked the company to justify the negative decision . The company first responded by saying that their decision required no justification , and then that the decision had been based on a credit rating made by credit scoring service using statistical methods . Such services do not take the creditwor-links : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternal T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 59 links : You can find a list of all URLs in the r eport compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalthiness of individual credit applicants into account and therefore , the assessments made may significantly differ from the profile of the individual credit applicant . This , the credit company agreed , may seem unfair to a credit applicant . The credit applicant petitioned the Non-Discrimination Ombudsman who then investi-gated the case for over a year . The credit rejection in question was based on data obtained from the internal records of Svea Ekonomi , the credit company , information from the credit data file , and the score from the scoring system from an external service provider . Since the applicant had no prior payment deficits in the internal records of the credit com-pany , nor in the credit data file , the scoring system gave him a score based on factors such as his place of residence , gender , age and mother tongue . The company did not investigate the applicant ’ s income or financial situation , and neither was this information required on the credit application . As men have more payment failures than women , men are awarded fewer points in the scoring system than women and similarly , those with Finnish as their first language receive fewer points than Swedish-speaking Finns . Had the applicant been a woman , or Swedish-speaking , he would have met the company criteria for the loan . After failing to reconcile the case , the Non-Discrimination Ombudsman brought the case to a tribunal . The ombudsman decided that the credit company was guilty of discrimina-tion based on the Non-Discrimination Act . The applicant ’ s age , male gender , Finnish as the mother tongue and the place of residence in a rural area were all factors that contributed to a case of multiple discriminations , resulting in a decision not to gr ant a loan . Discrimination based on such factors is prohibited in section 8 of the Non-Discrimination Act and in the section 8 of the Act on Equality between Women and Men . The tribunal noted that it was remarkable that the applicant would have been granted the loan if he were a woman or spoke Swedish as his mother tongue . The National Non-Discrimination and Equality Tribunal prohibited Svea Ekonomi from continuing their discriminatory practices and imposed a conditional fine of €100,000 to enforce the prohibitive decision . adM in action / Benefit processes at the Social Insurance Institution of Finland ( Kela ) Kela is responsible for settling benefits under national social security programmes . Around forty core benefits are handled by Kela , including health insurance , state pensions , un-employment benefits , disability benefits , child benefits and childcare allowances , student financial aid , housing allowances , and basic social assistance . While benefi ts are an important income source for underprivileged groups in particular , most Finns regardless of income level or social status receive benefits from Kela during their lifetime . Kela hands out benefits of approximately €15.5 billion annually . external [ fi 14 ] While more traditional automated information systems have been used for decision automation in K ela for decades , AI , machine learning and software robotics are seen as an integral part of their future ICT systems . external [ FI 15 ] Ongoing and potential AI developments include chatbots external [ FI 16 ] external [ FI 17 ] for customer service , automated benefit processing , detection ( or prevention ) of fraud or misunderstanding , and customer data analytics.page 60 Automating Society Finland In the case of benefit processing in general , and automated processes in particular , it is required that procedures must conform to existing legislation . From an automation perspective , the relevant phases of the benefit process include submitting the application , prerequisite checks , and the making of the decision . In the applicat ion phase , the system can provide information and advice on benefits . However , benefit legislation can allow for various combinations of benefits to be applied in a given situation and because benefits are interlinked , different combinations may produce different total benefits for the citizen . Therefore , a parameter for automation is how the system should prioritise benefits . Decid-ing which is the ‘ best ’ combination of benefits means deciding what outcome should be prioritised—the client ’ s total received benefits , or some other goal ( political , economic or otherwise ) . The automation of prerequisite checks entails , first , checking whether the information provided is sufficient for decision-making , valid , and trustworthy ; and second , whether other benefits affect , or are affected by the applied benefit . Once these checks have been completed , the decision can be made . In most cases decisions are based on a r egulated set of rules , and machine learning can be taught using validated data Kela already has from previous decisions . A problem that Kela faces as a public organization is how to communicate the results and the reasoning behind the decision-making process to citizens . In the case of automated decision-making , decisions are essentially probabilistic in nature , and models are based on features of similar historical cases . How can decision trees be tr anslated into text that is understandable to the customer ? And how is the probabilistic accuracy of automated decision-making communicated ? In addition to accuracy , one relevant parameter for the customer is response time— this can be measured in weeks when humans process applica-tions , but can be practically instantaneous when an automated system is used . Legislative processes that produce regulation that decisions are based on complicate the automation of the benefit process . Kela ’ s decisions are based on more than 200 pieces of separate regulation , owned by 6 ministries , and spanning 30 years . Separate laws may be semantically incompatible which complicates their translation into code : for example , different regulations contain more than 20 interpretations of ‘ income ’ . In addition , benefit laws change , and automated models need to behave in a new way after the new law comes into force . When new benefits are created , no decision data is available , which means machine learning needs to be taught using , for example , proxy data created specifically for this purpose . This points towards new employee roles that automated decision-making creates in an organization like Kela : in addition to data scientists who supervise and train the systems and analyse data , data validators evaluate decisions made by the systems and refine models based on evaluation , and data creators produce new data to teach the models . external [ FI 18 ] / Child welfare and psychiatry services – the use of predictive AI analytics In an experiment undertaken by the City of Espoo , in cooperation with software and service company Tieto , AI was used to analyse anonymised health care and social care data of Es-poo ’ s population and client data of early childhood education . The goal of the experiment , carried out in 2017 and 2018 , was to screen service paths from the data by grouping to-gether risk factors that could lead to the need for child welfare services or child and youth psychiatry services . external [ fi 19 ] Tieto and Espoo processed data from the years 2002 to 2016 , T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 61 consisting of 520,000 people who had used the services during that time , and 37 million client contacts . The experiment produced preliminary results about factors that could lead to the need for child welfare services or child and youth psychiatry services . For example , the AI system found approximately 280 factors that could anticipate the need for child welfare services . external [ FI 20 ] The experiment was the first of its kind in Finland . Before it , data from public services had never been combined and analysed so extensively in Finland using AI technologies . By com-bining data from several sources , it was possible to review public service customer paths by families , as the city ’ s data systems are usually individual-oriented . The City of Espoo is planning to continue experimenting with AI . The next step is to consider how to utilise AI to allocate services in a preventive manner and to identify relevant partners to cooperate with towards that aim . The technical possibilities to use an AI-based system to alert health and social care personnel to clients ’ cumulative risk factors have also been tested . Yet , Espoo states that ethical guidance regarding the use of an AI system like this is needed . For exam-ple , issues of privacy and automated decision-making should be carefully considered before introducing alert systems for child welfare services . Among other things , Espoo is now dis-cussing ethical questions related to the use of such alert systems with expert organisations such as The Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence ( FCAI ) . As a partner in the experiment , Tieto has gained enough knowledge to develop their own commercial AI platform for its customers in both the public and private sector which raises further ethical questions . / DigitalMinds – Assessing workers ’ personality based on automated analysis of digital footprints The Finnish start-up company DigitalMinds external [ fi 21 ] is building a ‘ third-generation ’ assessment technology for employee recruitment . Key clients ( currently between 10 and 20 Finnish companies ) are large corporations and private companies with high volumes of job applicants . Personality assessment technologies have been used since the 1940s in job recruitment . At first , these came in the form of paper personality tests that were filled in by prospective job candidates to assess their personality traits . Since the 1990s , such tests have been done in online environments . With their new service , DigitalMinds aims to eliminate the human participation in the process , in order to make the personality assessment process ‘ faster ’ and ‘ more reliable ’ , according to the company . Since 2017 it has used public interfaces of social media ( Twitter and Facebook ) and email ( Gmail and Microsoft Office 365 ) to analyse the entire corpus of an individuals ’ online presence . This results in a personality assessment that a prospective employer can use to assess a prospective employee . Measures that are tracked include how active individuals are online and how they react to posts/emails . Such techniques are sometimes complemented with automated video analysis to analyse personality in verbal communication ( see , for example , the HireVue software external [ fi 22 ] ) . The results produced are similar to the ones made by traditional assessment providers , i.e . whether a person is an introvert/extrovert , attentive to details etc . The companies which use this technology do not store any data , and they are required by Finnish law to ask the prospective job candidates for informed consent to gain access to their social media profiles and email accounts in order to perform the personality test . The candidates use a Google or Microsoft login to access the DigitalMinds platform and then they input their credentials themselves , avoiding direct disclosure of these credentials to the company . According to DigitalMinds , there have been no objections to such analysis so page 62 Automating Society Finland far from prospective candidates . A crucial ethical issue that must be considered , however , is around the actual degree of choice that a candidate has to decline access to her personal and former/current work email accounts , as well as to social media profiles in online ac-counts—if a candidate is in a vulnerable position and needs a job , they might be reluctant to decline such an assessment of data that may be very personal , or include professional/trade secrets within emails . In addition , the varied amount of data that is available online about individuals makes comparison between candidates difficult . According to the company , the trustworthiness of the data is not a big issue , if there is a sufficient corpus a vailable online . The company also waives responsibility by suggesting that they do not make actual decisions , but that they automate the process of assessment based on which decisions are made . An important issue that this case raises is the degree to which individuals ’ online digital/information in social media and emails should be considered trustworthy . It potentially harms disadvan-taged groups who may have reasons to have concealed or fake online personalities . / Digital symptom checkers A strategic project of the current governmental programme for “ self-care and digital value services ” , ODA , has developed the OmaOlo ( “ MyFeel ” in English ) service which includes digital symptom checkers . external [ fi 23 ] Such checkers are now available for lower back pain , respiratory infection symptoms and urinary tract infections and there will be many more in the future . external [ fi 24 ] The symptom checkers are based on The Finnish Medical Society Duodecim ’ s medical database and evidence-based clinical practices ’ Current Care Guidelines . In practice , the symptom checker asks simple yes-or-no-questions about patients ’ symptoms and then it offers advice about whether the condition needs medical attention or if self-care is sufficient . The checkers also include questions about acute symptoms that need immediate care . If the patient answers “ yes ” to any acute symptoms , the system recom-mends that they contact emergency services as soon as possible . The OmaOlo service has a disclaimer emphasizing that the aim of the symptom checker is not to produce a diagnosis but to make an evaluation of care needs . This means that it is possible that the assessments made by the symptom checkers are not always accurate , or that they are interpreted as more precise than they actually are . The questionnaires and the algorithms used to analyse them are based on research , when such research is available , or on collective medical care experience . The symptom checkers have been tested in several areas of Finland . In testing , OmaOlo tried to collect as much feedback of the services as possible for further development and validation . Preliminary observations suggest that compared to the assessm ents made by health care personnel , more patients than before are referred to medical care by symptom checkers . The checkers , and other OmaOlo services , will be introduced more generally to the public in 2019 . A new state-owned company , SoteDigi , aims to produce and develop digital health and social care services and will be in charge of the development and the distribution of the OmaOlo services . / Utopia Analytics – Automated Content Moderation on Social Media and e-commerce websites Utopia Analytics external [ FI 25 ] is a Finnish startup that specialises in automating content moderation on social media , public discussion forums , and e-commerce websites . The company links : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternal T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 63 brands itself as working with the aim to “ bring democracy back into social media ” by keeping ” your audiences talking , your online communities safe and your brand authentic ” . The service that they offer is a self-learning AI ( neural network ) which analyses the corpus of data on a given website , and then starts moderating content . At first , moderation is done alongside human moderators who test and ‘ train ’ the decisions of the system . After some time , human moderators take the role of supervisors of the algorithm , and only control its decisions in controversial or less straightforward cases . The service has been used on the Swiss peer-to-peer sales service si te tutti.ch where it moderates sales advertisements for inappropriate or inaccurate content in several languages , as well as on the largest Finnish online forum , Suomi24 . Regarding moderation on Suomi24 , the company reports a quantitative increase in the number of moderated posts—from 8,000 to 28,000—and a related increase in advertisements on the website . It is not clear what kind of content is being moderated in each case and how . It seems that such decisions are contextual and can be set up within a framework of each platform that imple-ments the algorithm .

FrANcE By Nicolas Kayser-Bril French lawmakers ’ first confrontation with ADM came in 1978 , when they introduced a law to ban it unconditionally . The new law granted citizens the right to access and modify their personal data and required corporations and the government to request pre-authorisation before creating databases of people .

Following a law change in 2016 , it became mandatory for all branches of government to make their algorithms transparent . However , journalists who reviewed three ministries discovered that none of them had complied with the regulation . During the state of emergency , under President Hollande ( 2015-2017 ) , laws were passed to allow the police to undertake automated mass-surveillance of internet activity .

Instead , Macron chose to adhere to the following guidelines : T o focus the strategy on health , transport , security and the environment , and to double the number of students in AI ( although no target date was set for this ) , and to act at the European level . In addition , he wants to simplify regulations involving AI experiments and create a €10 billion innovation fund—part of which would pay for work in AI . 1 A 2018 parliamentary report showed that the chaotic situation p rior to 2018 has been fixed . However , at least 11 databases containing personal information—mostly compiled by the intelligence agencies—are not controlled by any organisation . It is unclear as to whether these databases are already being used to detect devious behaviour . However , the military plans to go down this route .

Historically , the c NNum has included high-profile entrepreneurs and think tank employees whose collective Twitter clout gives them an over-sized influence . By its nature , the c NNum is resolutely pro-business , but it has also clashed with the government on issues concerning civil liberties . In particular , it opposed ADM with regard to state surveillance of citizens ( see the r egulatory Measures , Mass Surveillance section for further details ) . In that case , it argued that predictive algorithms would reinforce social biases . external [ FR 7 ] The cNNum did not write its own AI report , but it did contribute in large part to the government ’ s first AI str ategy . This strategy highlighted the need for well-balanced humancomputer interactions , and co-operation between all stakeholders before the deployment of ADM in companies . After a clash with the government in December 2017—when the Minister for Digital Affairs refused to let one expert join the college—the c NNum resigned en masse . external [ Fr 8 ] As a result , the government nominated a new set of experts who were more aligned with its opinions . Some commentators think that this episode might reduce the influence and relevance of the consultative body in the future . / etalab – e ntrepreneurs in the public interest Etalab , the open data outlet of the French government , runs a programme that lets highly educated , tech-savvy youths work as “ entrepreneurs in the public interest ” . This means that they are embedded in the administration for a ten-month period to experiment with new ways of doing things and some of them have worked on ADM. external [ Fr 9 ] However , the impact of this programme is hard to assess . For instance , one entrepreneur—who was embedded in the fraud-tracking service of the Ministry of Finance—said that his algorithm would not replace the legacy system . At this stage , it is unclear whether these public-sector entrepre-neur posts will amount to anything more than glorified internships .

However , this site does not consider ADM to be a key area of interest and it has never led any campaigns ( e.g . petitions , public awareness campaigns ) on the issue . La Quadrature du Net tends to focus on other topics , although it has fought on issues related to ADM indirectly . For example , it started a legal battle to oppose the creation of a biometric database of all French nation-als—something which is a prerequisite for large-scale face recognition—but La Quadrature du Net ended up losing that battle . external [ FR 17 ] / Ne X t i Npact The online news outlet , NEXT INpact external [ Fr 18 ] is one of the very few French newsrooms to consistently follow issues related to ADM on the national and governmental level . Their journalists regularly use freedom of information requests to test transparency laws and they were responsible for the publication of some algorithms used by the state . However , they do not cover the private sector with the same intensity . reGulatory a Nd sel F-re Gulatory measures / algorithm transparency Article L311-3-1 of the legal code of relations between the administration and the public external [ Fr 19 ] states that any decision made using an algorithm must mention the fact that an page 68 a utomating s ociety France algorithm was used . In addition , the rules defining the algorithm and what it does must be released upon request . In June 2018 , the French Supreme Court for administrative matters ( Conseil d ’ Etat ) stated that a decision based solely on an algorithmic system could only be legal if the algorithm and its inner workings could be explained entirely to the person affected by the decision . If this is not possible ( because of national security concerns , for instance ) , then algorithmic decision-making can not be used . external [ Fr 20 ] This piece of legislation was passed in 2016 and became law on September 1 , 2017 . A year later , journalists tried to find cases where this law had been applied , but they could not find any . external [ Fr 21 ] The law authorising the Parcoursup system ( see the ADM in Action section for details ) contains a clause that freed it from complying with this regulation . external [ Fr 22 ] / autonomous driving A law currently being debated in parliament aims to clarify responsibilities around au-tonomous driving . external [ Fr 23 ] The stated goal is to allow tests of fully autonomous vehicles . In May 2018 , the government announced that the necessary legislation will not be passed until 2022 . When signed into law , it will allow autonomous vehicles up to SAE ( Society of Automotive Engineers ) level 4 on all roads ( high automation— i.e . where the system is in complete control of the vehicle and a human presence is not required ) . However , its application will be limited to specific conditions . external [ Fr 24 ] Up until now , car manufacturers have used ad-hoc authorisation to test their vehicles . external [ FR 25 ] / Computers and Freedom Law from 1978 The computers and Freedom Law followed an outcry after a government agency planned to connect se veral databases and use social security numbers as unique identifiers . The result of the argument was the creation of the legal concept of “ personal data ” —and its protection—in France . It has been modified substantially over the years to keep up with technological changes , most notably in 2004 and in 2017 ( in accordance with the GDP r ) . strict limitations on adm Article 2 of the computer and Freedom Law external [ Fr 26 ] states that no judicial decision “ regarding human behaviour ” can be made on the basis of an ADM that “ gave a definition of the profile or personality ” of the individual .

There followed a series of forty-five seminars , discussions and debates which resulted in an 80-pages report external [ Fr 32 ] published in late 2017 . The report attempted to explain the issues under scrutiny , especially regarding ADM . Among the recommendations , which included better ethics education , the report also proposed the creation of a national algo-rithm audit platform . However , this particular recommendation has yet to be discussed in parliament . 2 adm iN actio N / Automated processing of traffic offences Automated processing of traffic offences started in 2003 with the deployment of about 50 radars across France . These now number approximately 4,500 and record over 17 mil-lion offences per year—and the trend is increasing . 3 The gross income from these radars is probably slightly over €1 billion per year , making it one of the most visible ADM processes French citizens are likely to encounter . In 2011 , the Ministry of the Interior created a new government agency to manage radars and traffic offences—the National Agency for the Automated Processing of Offences ( ANTAI ) . Somewhat revealingly , ANTAI does not mention anywhere in its annual report how it complies with article L311-3-1 of the legal code covering relations between the 2 According to a search of nosdeputes.fr and nossenateurs.fr—two websites that allow users to search tr anscribed parliamentary discussions . 3 Observatoire national interministériel de la sécurité routière , “ La sécurité routière en F rance : Bilan de l ‘ accidentalité de l ‘ année 2017 ” external [ Fr 33 ] , 2018 , p. 10 8 , and “ ANTAI , Rapport d ’ Activité 2017 ” external [ Fr 34 ] , July 2018. liNK s : You can find a list of all URLs in the r eport compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 70 a utomating s ociety France civil service and the public .

In its annual report , the oversight body for domestic surveillance ( which only has consultative powers ) stated that it was asked for an opinion on this system , but it provided no information regarding the scope or goals of the ‘ black box ’ . external [ Fr 39 ] / credit scoring The sale of an individual ’ s credit score is forbidden in France.4 credit scoring can only be done within a bank and no in vestigation can be carried out to find out how the scores are calculated.5 cNIL prevents the full automation of credit scoring . One ruling demanded that companies must perform manual checks before someone ’ s name is added to a list of people not paying their dues . external [ Fr 40 ] A file of people who have defaulted on their credit is maintained by the national bank.6 In 2012 , the government pushed for the creation of a database containing all loans between €200 and €75,000 , together with the names of the debtors . Ostensibly , this was to allow lenders to check whether a debtor was already heavily indebted . However , the law was nul-lified on privacy grounds by the supreme court in 2013 . 7 4 Lazarus , Jeanne . “ Pré voir la défaillance de crédit : l ‘ ambition du scoring . ” Raisons politiques 4 ( 2012 ) : 103118 .

Nicolas Kayser-Bril/ Dossier Médical – Personalised health files Health is one of the four priority areas of the government ’ s AI strategy ( see AI strategy of the government in the POLITI c AL DEBATES ON AUTOMATION section for details ) . In a 2018 report external [ Fr 43 ] , Inserm , a government outlet specialising in medical research , stated that the health sector did not use ADM as a whole . However , it added that a few test projects are underway locally or will start in 2019—one of these relates to decision support for the treatment of breast cancer while the other is concerned with complex ultrasound diagnosis . This lack of activity highlights the failure of a project started in 2004 aimed at digitizing and centralising all personal health information in a “ personalised health file ” ( DMP for Dossier Médical Personnel ) . The DMP project was supposed to allow ADM to operate in the health sector . 8 The DMP was criticised by the French court of auditors in 2012 as ill-conceived and very expensive . external [ Fr 45 ] As a result , it was rebranded as the “ shared health file ” ( Dossier Médical Partagé ) . However , it is barely used ( just 600,000 DMPs were created in 2017 external [ FR 46 ] ) . Before this , in 2008 , pharmacists started building their own centr al file of individual drug purchases and some 35 million people are now registered on the service . external [ FR 47 ] The data is used by pharmacists to check possible nefarious drug interactions . Laboratories can also access the database to perform drug recalls . However , the data can not be sold to third parties . / Parcoursup – s election of university students In 2018 , the French government pushed forward a reform whereby universities had the right to turn down applications from prospective students ( previously , anyone with a high-school diploma had the right to enrol ) . The reform was enacted with the launch of an online tool called Parcoursup , which matched the wishes of students with available offerings . On top of the drawbacks that plague many industrial-scale projects ( numerous experts advised that it would be better to spread this reform over a longer period ) , Parcoursup was criticised for the opacity of its decision-making process . When drafting the law that created Parcoursup , the government made sure to protect it from the legal obligation to tell users that decisions were made algorithmically and to make the algorithm transparent . Instead , the government published the source code of the matching section of the platform but remained silent on the sorting part . It is believed that the sorting part uses personal data to help universities select the students who best fit certain courses of study . external [ Fr 48 ] 8 The r ationale of the personalised health file was made clear in a parliamentary report external [ Fr 44 ] on the topic in January 2008 , among others p. 28.Photo : Marion Kotlarskipage 72 a utomating s ociety France Ulmberlin mannheim germanyT aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EUautomating Society – The Alliance of Consumer Protection Agencies pub-lished a set of requirements that automated decision-making processes need to fulfil in order to be in line with consumer protection .

The German AI strategy states that government wants to find ways to “ provide effective protection against bias , discrimination , manipula-tion or other abusive uses , in particular when using algorithm-based predic-tion and decision systems . ” Several German Data Protection Agencies published a joint position on transparency of algorithms , demanding that very sensitive systems should require authorisa-tion by a public agency . GERMANY By Kristina Penner and Louisa We LL In German y , a number of commissions , expert groups , platforms and organisations were set up by government and parliament to assess the consequence of a wider application of Artificial Intelligence . While it is to be welcomed that different stak eholders engage in the debate , this profusion introduces the risk that expert groups end up working in parallel on overlapping issues . In addition , some of these groups have very short timelines to produce outcomes on a wide range of questions . Also , some of these outcomes are supposed to feed into government policy , but the process to accomplish this is at times unclear , especially because there is no specific framework for cooperation , neither to develop joint strategies nor to prepare implementations . Other stakeholder groups are actively working in the field of automated decision-making ( ADM ) . Business associations , academic societies , and a number of civil society organisa-tions have already conducted research and published analyses , discussion and position papers on ADM . There seems to be a consensus that the developments offer a lot of op-portunity to benefit individuals and society , but that there is a lot of work needed to keep the risks in check . PoLitica L de Bates on as Pects of automation – go vernment and Par L iament / german ai s trategy The national AI strategy external [ de 1 ] , which was developed under the joint leadership of the Federal Ministries of Education and Research , Economics and Energy , and Labour and So-cial Affairs , was presented at the “ Digital Summit ” in early December 2018 in Nuremberg . As part of the federal government ’ s implementation strategy for digitisation ( “ HightechStrategie 2025 ” ) , the AI strategy is to be further developed and adapted at the beginning of 2020 “ according to the state of discussion and requirements ” . The foreword summarises the strategy ’ s goals as follows : “ The strategy is based on the claim to embed a technology as profound as Artificial Intelligence , which ma y also be used in sensitive areas of life , ethically , legally , culturally and institutionally in such a way that fundamental social values and individual rights are preserv ed and the technology serves society and mankind . ” At the heart of the document is the plan to make “ AI made in Germany ” a “ globally recognised seal of quality ” . The strategy focuses on three goals : W T o make Germany and Europe a leading location for the development and application of AI technologies and thus contribute to securing Germany ‘ s future competitiveness W T o ensure the responsible development and use of AI for the common good W T o embed AI ethically , legally , culturally and institutionally into society , based on a broad dialogue within society and an active role of politics in shaping the issue LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 74 a utomating s ociety germany In order to develop Artificial Intelligence in a way that is responsible and focused on the public good , the strategy announces a range of measures . The federal government W plans to create an observatory and v ows to campaign for similar observatories on the EU and international level W wants to organise a European and tr ansatlantic dialogue focusing on a human-centric development of AI in the workplace W v ows to safeguard labour rights when AI is deployed and used in the workplace W announces it will activ ely shape the ethical , legislative , cultural and institutional embedding of AI , facilitating a broad dialogue within society W wants to de velop guidelines for the design and use of AI systems in compliance with data protection law in round-table consultations with data protection supervisory authorities and business associations W sa ys it will promote the development of innovative applications that support autonomy , social and cultural participation , and the protection of citizens ‘ privacy W announces the creation of a funding scheme to educate citizens and to sup port the public-minded design of technology W sa ys it will develop the platform “ Lernende Systeme ” into an AI platform to organise a dialogue between politics , academia , business and civil society W pledges to find a European approach to data-based business mode ls that reflect the common values , and their economic and social structure W aims to reflect whether the regulatory fr amework needs to be further developed to secure a high level of legal certainty , and asserts it will promote and require the respect of ethical and legal principles throughout the process of AI development and application The government “ sees itself under the obligation ” to support the development of „ AI made in Germany “ as “ a technology for the good and benefit of state and society ” . By promoting diverse AI applications with the aim to achieve “ tangible social progress in the interest of the citizens ” it aims to focus on the benefits for humans and the en vironment and to continue an intensive exchange with all stakeholders . It also points to AI as “ a collective national task ” , which requires collective action and cross-sectoral measures . T o achieve these goals , the strategy also pleads for stronger cooperation within Europe , especially when it comes to harmonised and ethically high standards for the use of AI technologies . Implications of particular relevance to the participatory and fairness aspects of automated decision-making—which also have strong effects on the regulatory and policy framework for the application of ADM—can be found in the following paragraphs : Section 3.1 , focusing on Strengthening Research in Germany and Europe and section 3.8 , Making data available and facilitating ( re- ) use introduce a “ systematic approach to technology ” that promotes research on methods for “ monitoring and traceability of algorithmic predic-tion and decision-making systems ” , as well as research on pseudonymisation and anonymi-sation methods , and on the compilation of synthetic training data . It states that decisions “ must be comprehensible so that AI systems can be accepted as ‘ trusted AI ’ and meet legal requirements . ” In the section about the labour market ( 3.5 ) , questions about the increasing deployment of AI—and ADM—in the processes of hiring , transfers and dismissals , as well as the monitoring of workers ’ performance or behaviour , are addressed . The authors emphasise that work-ers ’ councils theoretically already have the means , within the framework of their labour representation rights , to influence the application of AI in these fields . They recognise , T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 75 however , that people need to be empowered to exercise these rights , especially in the light of knowledge asymmetries . Here , the government asserts that it will examine whether an independent employee data protection law can create more legal certainty for the intro-duction of respective applications in the workplace . With regard to the objective to Use AI for public tasks and adapt expertise of the administration ( 3.7 ) , the government is hesitant to take a clear stand on the use of AI-based systems . It describes AI as “ an an instrument to contribute information to decision-making that can not be obtained in an adequate timeframe without AI ” , but clarifies that “ police , intelligence and military assessments and decisions based on them will continue to be in the hands of the employees of the authorities . ” The strategy mentions that “ other areas of application are predictive policing ( preventive averting of danger ) , the protection of children and adoles-cents against sexualised violence on the Internet , and the fight against and prosecution of the dissemination of abuse representations or social media forensics for the creation of personal profiles ” , but the strategy does not indicate if and to what extent these could be introduced . Because AI applications will “ increasingly contribute to decision-making in everyday life or control it in the background ” , the government plans to Review the Regulatory Framework ( 3.9 ) for gaps in relation to algorithmic and AI-based decision-making systems , services and products . If necessary , it vows to adapt regulation to make systems accountable for pos-sible inadmissible discrimination and disadvantage . The strategy describes how “ transpar-ency , traceability and verifiability of AI systems “ can be established in order to “ provide effective protection against bias , discrimination , manipulation or other abusive uses , in particular when using algorithm-based prediction and decision systems . ” The government proposes “ to examine the establishment or expansion of government agencies and private auditing institutions to monitor algorithmic decisions with the aim of preventing abusive use and discrimination and averting negative social consequences ” . This is to include the development of auditing standards and impact assessment standards . “ This control system should be able to request full disclosure of all elements of the AI/algorithmic decision-making process without the need to disclose trade secrets . ” The strategy further develops ideas to review existing regulation and standards and enhance “ standardisation ” , especially in regard to classifications and terminologies of AI and ethical standards in line with the “ ethics by design ” approach ( 3.10 ) . / digital c abinet and d igital c ouncil The newly created Cabinet Committee on Digitisation discusses questions of AI and examines answers and solutions feeding into the ( implementation of the ) national strategy . external [ de 2 ] The Digital Council , located in the Chancellery , acts as a consultative body , intended to facilitate a close exchange between politics and national and international experts . Ap-pointed by the government , its members come from a variety of sectors : scientists and practitioners , founders of start-ups and established entrepreneurs . Civil society is not represented . The council members are tasked with finding ways to implement the projects to be defined in the AI strategy . external [ de 3 ] page 76 a utomating s ociety germany / Platform for Artificial Intelligence The Plattform Lernende Systeme ( Platform for Artificial Intelligence ) was launched by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research in 2017 at the suggestion of acatech ( German Academy for Science and Engineering ) , and will end by 2022 . The platform aims to design self-learning systems for the benefit of society . external [ de 4 ] In different working groups , experts from science , industry , politics and civil society analyse the opportunities and challenges of AI , and develop scenarios and roadmaps to inform decision-makers . external [ de 5 ] The working group on “ IT Security , Privacy , Legal and Ethical Framework ” focuses on how AI can be implemented in a way that respects human autonomy , fundamental rights , equal opportunities , and does not discriminate . In general , the group ascertains “ how society can actively participate during the implementation of self-learning , and therefore ADM systems ” . external [ de 6 ] In the context of the German AI strategy , the platform presented its new interactive information website on actors , strategies and technologies related to AI at the national , EU and international level . external [ de 7 ] / Enquete Commission on Artificial Intelligence In June 2018 , the German Bundestag set up the “ Study Commission Artificial Intelligence – Social Responsibility and Economic , Social and Ecological Potential ” . external [ de 8 ] external [ de 9 ] This so-called Enquete Commission is comprised of 19 MPs from all parliamentary parties and 19 external experts appointed by parliamentary groups . external [ de 10 ] The mandate of the commission is to examine the opportunities as well as the challenges of AI and its effects on individuals , society , economy , labour and the public sector . The commission ’ s task is to develop recommendations for policy makers based on its findings in order to “ use the op-portunities offered by AI and to minimise the risks . ” external [ de 8 ] The sectors of public administration , mobility , health , care , autonomy , ageing , education , defence , environment , climate and consumer protection will be at the centre of its inquiries . F urthermore , the commission will analyse the impact of AI on democratic processes , gender equality , privacy protection , economy , and labour rights . One of the crucial issues of the commission ’ s work will be the assessment of regulation for scenarios in which automated decisions about individuals and society are prepared , recommended or made .

In recent years , the conference featured various presentations and discussions external [ de 20 ] about how automated decisionmaking processes change society . / german i nformatics s ociety With almost 20,000 private members and about 250 corporate members , Gesellschaft für Informatik ( German Informatics Society external [ de 21 ] ) is the largest association for computer science professionals in the German-speaking world . In a recent study , the authors analysed what they call “ algorithmic decision-making ” with a focus on scoring , ranging from credit scoring to social credit systems . external [ de 22 ] They recommend intensifying interdisciplinary research into ADM , incorporating ADM in curricula of computer science and law , fostering data literacy in economics and social sciences , developing procedures for the testing and auditing of ADM systems , standardised interfaces , transparency require-page 78 a utomating s ociety germany ments , and creating a public agency to oversee ADM . In a response to the government ’ s AI strategy external [ de 23 ] , the society stated that a European contribution to the development of AI has to be the development of explainable algorithmic decision-making and explainable AI that prevents discrimination . / initiative d 21 Initiative D21 external [ de 24 ] is a network of representatives from industry , politics , science and civil society .

It emphasises that “ people are being evaluated by technical processes in more and more areas of life ” . external [ de 32 ] The Commission looks at how algorithms , AI and digital innovations affect the life of citizens , the economy or society as a whole . It also keeps an eye on what ethical and legal questions arise , and it gives advice on which technologies should be introduced in the future and how the y should be used . In the first paper of recommendations sent to the government , the commission argued that ethics does not “ mean primarily the definition of limits ; on the contrary , when ethical considera-tions are addressed from the start of the development process , they can make a powerful contribution to design , supporting advisable and desirable applications . ” external [ de 33 ] / data Protection a gencies ’ joint position on transparency of algorithms In a joint position paper external [ de 34 ] , the data protection agencies of the federal government and eight German federal states stated that greater transparency in the implementation of algorithms in the administration was indispensable for the protection of fundamental rights . The agencies demanded that if automated systems are used in the public sector , it is crucial that processes are intelligible , and can be audited and controlled . In addition , public administration officials have to be able to provide an explanation of the logic of the systems used and the consequences of their use . Self-learning systems must also be accompanied by technical tools to analyse and explain their methods . An audit trail should be created , and the software code should be made available to the administration and , if possible , to the public . According to the position paper , there need to be mechanisms for citizens to demand redress or reversal of decisions , and the processes must not be discriminating . In cases where there is a high risk for citizens , there needs to be a r isk assessment done before deployment . Very sensitive systems should require authorisation by a public agency that has yet to be created . / draft-law on automated driving In 2017 , the German government proposed the adoption of a law on automated driving . external [ de 35 ] The draft law determines that the driver will hold the final responsibility over the car , even if the system was driving automatically . Hence , drivers must always be able to interrupt the automated driving and assume control themselves . The level of automa-tion can be differentiated into partly automated , highly automated , fully automated and autonomous driving . Autonomous driving is not covered by the draft law . / ethics c ommission on a utomated and n etworked d riving The Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure convened this commission in 2016 to work on ethical questions that arise with the introduction of self-driving cars . external [ de 36 ] Under the premise that the automation of traffic promises to reduce accidents and increase road safety , the commission discussed an array of questions and in 2017 , it published 20 rather abstract principles on automated and networked driving . external [ de 37 ] These principles include the suggestion that automated systems can only be approved if , on balance , they promise to lead to a reduction of harm , and that a public agency for the as-sessment of accidents involving automated vehicles should be installed to gather evidence in order to guide future development.LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 80 a utomating s ociety germany / german e thics c ouncil In order to inform the public and encourage discussion in society , the German Ethics Council external [ de 38 ] organises public events and provides information about its internal consultations . The Council addresses questions of ethics , society , science , medicine and law , and the consequences for individuals and society related to research and development , in particu-lar in the field of life sciences and their application to humanity . In the past , the German Ethics Council has discussed ethical issues related to the health sector . Those discussions focussed on developments in synthetic biology in 2009 , particularly on technological inno-vations and the implications in the field of genetic diagnosis and its use in medical practice 1 in 2012. external [ de 39 ] external [ de 40 ] In 2017 , the Ethics Council published a report on the consequences of automatically collecting , analysing and then inferring insights from large data sets in the health sector . external [ de 41 ] It concluded that these processes lead to stratification – the algorithmic grouping of individuals based on certain characteristics . This can be useful for diagnostics and therapy , but the council cautions against erroneous attribution of data . “ Big Data ” in the context of health promises to be especially fruitful in biomedical research , healthcare provision , for insurers and employers , and in commercial applications . However , the council warns against the exploitation of individuals ’ data , discrimination , the linking of health data to other data by commercial actors , an “ excessive regime of self-control aided by such ser-vices and devices [ that ] can contribute to an exaggerated drive for optimisation detrimental to personal health ” , and privacy breaches . In 2017 , the Council ’ s annual conference focused on “ autonomous systems ” in general , and discussed “ how intelligent machines are changing us ” . external [ de 42 ] / german i nstitute for s tandardisation The German Institute for Standardisation ( Deutsches Institut für Normung e.V . ( DIN ) external [ de 43 ] ) works on standardisation for e-mobility , energy transition , Industry 4.0 , secure online identification , smart cities , and smart textiles . One working group , established at the beginning of 2018 as part of DIN ’ s Standards Committee on Information T echnology and Applications ( NIA ) , focuses on ethical and societal issues concerning AI . external [ de 44 ] Their first step was to draft a working paper on the terminology of AI itself , a topic considered to be of particular importance . The development process of new norms is closed to the public and further details are not yet available . adm in action / automated management of energy infrastructure The transition to renewable energies , technological innovation , and the more flexible trade of electrical energy across Europe continue to change and challenge Germany ’ s energy infrastructure . Smart grids and a growing number of private households producing their own electricity ( so-called prosumers ) only add to the challenge . ADM in the area of distri-bution grids ensures a more resilient supply and enables a smoother feed-in and control of 1 High-throughput procedures of molecular diagnostics ( r apid , automated procedures to analyse a large number of samples ) . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 81 decentralised and fluctuating electricity on different levels . On the transmission grid level , automation has already been in use for some time . It was established to sup port the complex task of distributing , monitoring and controlling electricity flows to ensure system and frequency stability . T oday , the new generation of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition ( SCADA ) systems , are an essential part of this infrastructure . They use machine learning and predictive analysis for real time monitoring and controlling in order to avoid frequency fluctuations or a power supply failure . external [ de 45 ] At the same time , government experts point out that energy supply , as a critical infrastructure , is under special threat from cyber attacks . external [ de 46 ] Advocacy groups also warn against extensive surveillance capabilities that come with the implementation of smart meters in private homes . external [ de 47 ] / credit scoring In Germany , like in many other countries , private credit scoring companies rate citizens ’ creditworthiness . A low score means banks will not approve a loan or may reject a credit card application , and Internet service providers and phone companies may deny service . This means credit scoring has enormous influence on people ’ s ability to meaningfully par-ticipate in everyday life . In Germany , the leading company for scoring individuals , SCHUFA Holding AG , has a market share of up to 90 per cent ( depending on the sector ) , so it wields immense power . The civil society organisations AlgorithmWatch and Open Knowledge Foundation Germany initiated a project called OpenSCHUFA . external [ de 48 ] They asked individuals to donate their SCHUFA scores to the project , so that data journalists and research-ers could systematically scrutinise the process . The results of the analysis were published in late November 2018. external [ de 49 ] Data journalists from Spiegel Online and Bayerischer Rundfunk public broadcasting station identified various anomalies in the data . For instance , it was striking that a number of people were rated rather negatively even though SCHUFA had no negative information on them , e.g . on debt defaults . There were also noticeable differences between alternate versions of the SCHUFA scoring system . The credit report agency offers to its clients ( such as local banks or telecommunication companies ) a score that is specifically tailored to their business segment . In one of the a vailable cases the scores differ by up to 10 per cent between version 2 and 3 , depending on the version of the scoring system the client uses as a reference . This is an indicator that the SCHUFA system itself deems its version 2 to be somewhat lacking . However , version 2 is apparently still used by SCHUFA clients . / “ intelligent video surveillance system ” in the city of m annheim The city of Mannheim in Baden-Wuerttemberg launched an “ intelligent video surveillance ” project , developed in cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute for Optronics , Systems Engineering and Image Evaluation . The technology is not based on face recognition , but on “ automatic image processing ” . external [ de 50 ] Installed sequentially , by 2020 around “ 76 cameras will be used to monitor people in central squares and streets in the city centre and scan their behaviour for certain patterns ” external [ de 51 ] that “ indicate criminal offences such as hitting , running , kicking , falling , recognised by appropriate algorithms and immediately reported to the police “ . In this way , the “ police can intervene quickly and purposefully and save resources in the future ” , says the city ’ s website . Critics warn that the application of such behavioural scanners , here in the form of video surveillance with motion pattern recognition , “ exerts a strong conformity pressure and at the same time generates many false alarms ” , as “ it is also not transparent to which ‘ unnatural movements ’ the algorithms are trained to react .

ITAl y By Fa Bio Chiusi In recent y ears , discussions in Italy about automation have increased both at the institutional level and by the public at large . Academic institutions , mainstream media and civil society have started to debate the consequences of automation in the workplace and on the job market . According to the Italian polling company SWG , 47 % of Italians think auto-mation will destroy more jobs than it will create , while 42 % think the opposite . external [ iT 1 ] Together with this , there is a growing awareness of the role of algorithms , their impact on how information is consumed and how they are used to create propaganda . At the international level , an increasing number of voices are calling for clearly articulated ethics principles to help govern Artificial Intelligence . Italy has long suffered from a cultural and technological ‘ digital divide ’ , and this gap affects the quality of debate on automation at all levels of society . In addition , civil society organi-sations are noticeable by their absence from the debate , and there is no specific entity dedi-cated to evaluate the impact of automation on policy . Automated decision-making came to the fore and gained popular attention through the “ Buona Scuola ” education reforms in 2015. external [ iT 2 ] These reforms included an algorithm for teachers ’ mobility that—as detailed in the section ADM in Action of this chapter—wrongly assigned teachers to new work locations in at least 5,000 instances , according to estimates by the Italian l abour Union . This caused uproar , resulting in several cases being brought before the Italian courts . Algorithmic systems to detect tax evasion have also been a topic of discussion , however , these debates seldom depart from the ‘ Big Brother ’ narrative and are consistently tied to the risk of illiberal and excessive surveillance of taxpayers . This may be one of the cultural reasons why algorithms have not yet been widely adopted . Poli TiCal de BaT es on as P e CT s o F au Toma T ion – Governmen T and Parliamen T / White paper on “ Artificial Intelligence at the service of citizens ” In March 2018 , the so-called Italian Digital Transformation T eam—led by former Amazon VP , Diego Piacentini , and made up of some 30 software developers and other technicians—were tasked with designing “ the operating system of the country ” . They produced a “ white paper on Artificial Intelligence at the service of citizens ” , which highlighted the potential of AI for public administration . external [ iT 3 ] Among the recommendations in the white paper was a suggestion for the creation of a “ National Competence Centre ” .

The group will start operations in March 2019 . Two of the group ’ s goals specifically relate to automated decision-making . They are : “ a comprehensive review of the legal framework with specific regard to safety and responsibility related to AI-based products and services ” , and an “ analysis and evaluation of the socio-economic impact of development and widespread adoption of AI-based systems , along with proposals for tools to mitigate the encountered issues ” . external [ iT 4 ] Poli TiCal de BaT es on as P e CT s o F au Toma T ion – Civil s o C ie T y and aC ademia / Nexa Center for Internet and Society The Nexa Research Center for Internet and Society at the Politecnico Di T orino ( Polytech-nic University of Turin ) , is a research centre focusing on quantitative and interdisciplinary analysis of the impact the Internet has on society . external [ iT 5 ] In their project Data and Algorithm Ethics , Nexa researchers aim to “ identify ethical issues raised by the collection and analysis of large amounts of data ” and “ focus on the problems arising from the increasing complexity and autonomy of some algorithms , especially in the case of machine learning applications ; in this case the focus will be on unexpected and unintended consequences and on the responsibilities of designers and data scientists . ” external [ IT 6 ] ReGulATo R y AND S elf- R e G ul ATo R y Me AS u R e S / Declaration of Internet Rights There is no legislation concerning automated decision-making in Italy . Guidelines and regu-lations are also missing for areas such as autonomous driving , algorithmic transparency and the use of automation in public policy and by law enforcement agencies . However , general principles that might be applicable for ADM do exist within the Italian “ Declaration of Internet Rights ” . This was devised by the “ Commission on Internet Rights and Duties ” in the Chamber of Deputies under the Renzi administration . external [ iT 7 ] The chamber was chaired by l aura Boldrini , who was then the Head of the Chamber of Deputies , and comprised of members of parliament , experts and journalists . The Commission published the Italian Internet Bill of Rights on July 28 , 2015 . Of relevance to automated decision-making is Article 8. external [ IT 8 ] This explicitly states that “ No act , judicial or administrative order or decision that could significantly impact the private sphere of individuals may be based solely on the automated processing of personal data undertaken in order to establish the profile or personality of the data subject ” . In ad- T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 87 dition , the need to avoid any kind of digitally-induced discrimination is repeatedly stated throughout the document , in terms of assuring net neutrality ( Art . 4 ) , “ access to and pro-cessing of data ” ( Art . 5 ) , “ exercising civil and political freedoms ” ( Art . 10 ) , access to platform services ( Art . 12 ) and “ the protection of the dignity of persons ” ( Art . 13 ) . adm in aCT ion / Buona Scuola – algorithm for teachers ’ mobility Within the framework of the “ Buona Scuola ” education reforms , an automated system was designed to evaluate how to manage the mobility of teachers for the 2016/17 academic year . The system was developed by HP Italia and Finmeccanica and cost €444,000 . external [ iT 9 ] The algorithm was supposed to aggregate data on each candidate ’ s score ( “ graduatoria ” ) attrib-uted by law depending on three specific criteria : work experience and roles , 15 preferred destinations , and the actual vacancies . The aim was to provide every teacher with the best possible outcome . The system was supposed to prioritise the score . If teachers had a higher score , then their vacancy preference in a specific location would be considered before teachers with a lower score . Instead , the algorithm picked preferences without considering the scores . As more and more teachers found themselves assigned to destinations they didn ’ t state in their preferences , many became disenchanted with the educational reforms . The resulting con-fusion provoked an uproar and made newspaper headlines . Following the turmoil , a technical analysis ( “ Perizia tecnica preliminare ” ) of the algorithm was performed by a team of engineers from the l a Sapienza and T or Vergata universities in Rome on June 4 , 2017. external [ iT 10 ] The report that followed detailed exactly why the mistakes happened—and possibly why they had to happen . The authors stated that the algorithm was not up to the task of combining teachers and destinations in an automated way , because “ even the most basic criteria of programming that notoriously apply ” to the case at hand “ were disattended ” . In fact , the code was so badly written that the engineers were left wondering how it was possible that the program-mers had designed such a “ pompous , redundant , and unmanageable system ” . The code was filled with bugs that could cause mistakes , such as the ones that happened . The algorithm in question consisted of two parts and one of them was developed in the COBO l programming language . This is a language that was conceived in the early ‘ 60s and was mostly used in the business—not the government—sector . It was a choice that the authors of the technical analysis could not explain—unless one supposes a deliberate will to shield it from scrutiny , through the use of incomprehensible variable names and notes throughout the unusually long and chaotic code writing . This all resulted in several cases coming before the judicial courts throughout Italy , costing yet more of the state 's time and taxpayers ' money . / The “ Abbiamo i numeri giusti ” project Designed by the Università Cattolica del Sacro Cuore in Milan , with the contribution of Merck , the “ Abbiamo i numeri giusti ” ( “ We have the right numbers ” ) project is an automat-page 88 Automating Society Italy ed system . It helps health institutions pick the most efficient and e ffective treatments for patients , while at the same time , it optimises public spending on data and evidence-based grounds . external [ iT 11 ] The system , which aims to maximise patient engagement and medical compliance , will be tested and validated on a nationwide level , starting with trials in five regions ( Emilia-Romagna , Veneto , T oscana , l azio and Puglia ) and using their existing databases . A high level ‘ Advisory Board ’ , made up of institutional representatives at both national and regional levels , members of scientific societies and associations of patients , has been created to produce a report on the results of the experiment and to formulate ideas on how best to proceed . According to Merck , over 200,000 people die every year in Europe because they don ’ t follow their treatment correctly . external [ iT 12 ] / Risk e R – predict the risk of hospitalization “ RiskER ” is a statistical procedure that combines over 500 demographic and health vari-ables in order to ‘ predict ’ the risk of hospitalization . The automated system was developed by the Agenzia Sanitaria e Sociale ( Health and Social Agency ) of the Emilia-Romagna Re-gion together with the Jefferson University of Philadelphia . external [ iT 13 ] It has been used on an experimental basis in 25 “ Case della Salute ” ( public offices where administrative , social and healthcare services are provided at a local level ) , involving some 16,000 citizens and 221 general practitioners . external [ iT 14 ] The aim is to change the hospitalisation process of patients who , according to the algorithm , show higher health risks . external [ iT 15 ] It is hoped that the system will eventually be used in all 81 “ Case della Salute ” in the region . The validation process has shown that the algorithm , which was revised in 2016 , was good at predicting health risks in the 14 years and over age group and especially in older people , where the risks are higher . During the experiment , the algorithm grouped the population according to four risk categories , allowing doctors to identify high risk patients , and to contact , advise and/or treat them before their conditions became critical . Socio-economic variables might also be added to the algorithm in the future to increase predictive power . external [ IT 16 ] The “ RiskER ” algorithm is part of the EU ’ s “ Sunfrail ” program which is aimed at helping the elderly . / S.A.R.I . – facial recognition system The “ S.A.R.I . ” ( Sistema Automatico di Riconoscimento Immagini ) , or Automated Image Recognition System , is an automated decision-making tool used by the “ Polizia di Stato ” , the national police force . external [ iT 17 ] This facial recognition technology has two functions : 1 ) ENTERPRISE , 2 ) REAL -TIME . Through the use of “ one or more ” facial recognition algorithms , the ENTERPRISE function can match the face of an unidentified suspect in an image with facial images stored in databases administered by the police ( which are “ in the order of millions ” , according to the “ Capitolato T ecnico ” for S.A.R.I. , the technical document in which the Interior Ministry detailed the system ’ s desired requirements external [ IT 18 ] ) . It also provides a ‘ rank ’ of similarities among several faces with an associated algorithmic score . The ranking , whose criteria are not transparent to the public , can be further refined by both demographic and descriptive variables , such as race , gender and height.LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternal T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 89 The REA l- TIME function is aimed at monitoring video feeds in real-time in a designated geographical area , and again it matches the recorded subjects to an unspecified ‘ watch list ’ that contains individuals numbering in the hundreds of thousands . Whenever a match is found , the system issues an alert for operators . The first solution was developed by Parsec 3.26 SRL for €827,000 external [ IT 19 ] ; the second was developed by BT Italia S.p.a./Nergal Consulting S.r.l . for €534,000 . external [ iT 20 ] The S.A.R.I . system made headlines in September 2018 , when it was revealed that two burglars in Brescia had , for the first time , been identified and subsequentl y apprehended as a result of the algorithmic matching obtained by the system . This prompted further analyses by law enforcement agents , who later confirmed that the suspects were , in fact , the two men suggested by the automated system . Questions arose as to how many individuals are included in the databases that feed into the algorithmic choices ( the police itself hinted at 16 million people , with no further speci-fication as to their composition ) and why . external [ iT 21 ] There were also questions about the reliability of the algorithmic matching ( in terms of false positives and false negatives ) , the safeguards for matched individuals , the cybersecurity and privacy profiles of the system . / ISA – f iscal Reliability Index Algorithms have slowly made their way into fiscal legislation in Italy . Many instruments have been devised over the last decade , with the aim of automatically checking for tax evasion . Among them is the search for discrepancies between someone ’ s stated income and her/his actual spending patterns ( “ Redditometro ” ) or between declared invoices and standard of living ( “ Spesometro ” ) . external [ iT 22 ] In addition , the forthcoming “ Risparmiometro ” , will try to automatically recognise anomalies between stated income , savings and standard of living by matching information from several databases . As none of these instruments made a difference in combatting tax e vasion , a new fiscal reliability index ( “ ISA ” , Indice Sintetico di Affidabilità ) was created , and it became law in 2016/2017 . The ISA is an arithmetic average of a set of elementary indices of fiscal reli-ability—including coherence with previous fiscal declarations , consistent compliance and an analysis of past and current anomalies—summarised using a 0-10 score that embodies the fiscal ‘ virtue ’ of the analysed subject within a timeframe initially set at the past 8 years . external [ iT 23 ] The idea behind the ISA is to revolutionise the logic of fiscal compliance , shifting from a ‘ punitive ’ approach to one that is based on ‘ rewards ’ for those who have consistently shown fiscal reliability , according to the index . As a result , taxpayers with higher scores will enjoy a reward system that includes an exclusion from certain fiscal inspections , and simpler condi-tions for compliance . / KeyCrime – predictive policing algorithm KeyCrime is predictive policing software based on an algorithm of criminal behaviour analysis . external [ iT 24 ] It was developed over the last 15 years by former investigative police of-LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 90 Automating Society Italy ficer Mario Venturi and designed to automatically analyse criminal behaviour , help identify trends and suggest ways of thwarting future crimes . Reportedly , the system can now sift through some 11,000 variables for each crime . These range from the obvious ( time , location and appearance ) to the less obvious ( reconstructions of witnesses and suspects during subsequent interviews , and even the modus operandi of the criminal ) . external [ iT 25 ] Video feeds are included in the analysed data . The idea behind the software is to rationalise the use of the police force and automatically deploy officers exactly where they are needed . However , this is not done by providing predictions about the areas in which certain crimes are mostly likely to be committed , but by giving clear indications as to where sought-after suspects might be about to strike , and therefore making it easier to apprehend him or her . external [ IT 26 ] In addition , the analytic capabilities of the KeyCrime software are used to attribute a series of crimes to the same suspect . Data gained in actual usage shows that when the number of crimes committed by the same suspect exceed four , the algorithm is 9 % more effective than traditional methods . Over the years , KeyCrime has been successfully deployed in the city of Milan . According to police data divulged to the press in 2015 , this led to a 23 % reduction in pharmacy robber-ies , and a suspect identification rate of 70 % in bank robberies . external [ iT 27 ] external [ IT 28 ] / eSecurity – predictive urban security in Trento This “ eSecurity ” project labels itself as “ the first experimental laboratory of predictive urban security ” . external [ iT 29 ] It was co-funded by the European Commission and coordinated by the eCrime research group of the Faculty of l aw at the University of Trento , in partnership with the ICT Centre of Fondazione Bruno Kessler , the Trento Police Department and the Municipality of Trento . external [ iT 30 ] The project builds on the ‘ hot spots ’ philosophy . This is the idea that “ in any urban environ-ment , crime and deviance concentrate in some areas ( streets , squares , etc . ) and that past victimization predicts future victimization ” . It is an “ information system for police forces and local administrations ” , modelled upon the predictive policing models adopted in the UK and the U.S. , and aimed at providing complex automated assistance to law enforcement agencies and decision-makers . The expanded “ predictive urban security ” model adopted by eSecurity employs algorithms that can : 1 ) use “ past geo-referenced crimes ” and smart city data , 2 ) consider “ the con-centration of victimisation , insecurity and urban disorder at city level ” , 3 ) try “ to not only predict ‘ where ’ and ‘ when ’ specific types of criminality and deviance will occur but also to understand ‘ why ’ they will occur ” , and 4 ) are explicitly aimed at providing data-based insights to policy-makers for ‘ smart ’ and effective urban security planning .

Many of the calls for action in the agenda focus on research into the consequences and ethics of ADM. A report by the Scientific Council for Government Policy concludes that the existing regulatory framework for ADM should be upgraded signifi-cantly in order to provide sufficient protection of fundamental rights and safeguards against erroneous use . In July 2018 , the East Brabant Dis-trict Court , together with Tilburg Law School , appointed a professor to the new special chair in Data Science in the Judiciary . This person will be involved in performing ( small ) experiments and pilots with AI and ADM at the District Court . Some Dutch municipalities use the SyRI “ Risk Indication System ” . Based on certain risk indicators , the soft-ware allegedly detects an “ increased risk of irregularities ” , i.e . whether someone is breaking the law . Some Dutch municipalities use ADM to prevent and detect truancy and early school-leaving by using algorithms that help decide which students should be paid a visit by a school attend-ance officer . Around the Country ThE NEThERLANDS By Gijs van Til In the Netherlands , the impact of automated decision-making ( ADM ) and Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) on individuals and society is predominantly discussed as part of the larger Dutch strategy on digitisation . As a prominent part of this strategy , the Dutch Digital Government Agenda plays an important role in setting out how digitisation of public administration at multiple administrative levels should progress and how ADM and AI could be involved in this process . Rather than policy , many of the steps taken by the government in this field focus on intensive research into regulatory approaches and how public values and human rights can be safeguarded and protected alongside these developments . At the same time , aspects of ADM and AI already play a role in some of the current proposals for regulatory measures , for example , in an act setting out the regulatory framework under the Digital Government Agenda . Civil society and academia , in turn , are concerned about the pitfalls and ethics of the growing use and importance of ADM and AI . Alongside existing actors , such as the Rathenau Institute , and Bits of Freedom , a Dutch Alliance for Artificial Intel-ligence was recently launched to enable multi-stakeholder discussion on the responsible development , deployment and use of AI . Meanwhile , more and more cases of ADM are already in use in the Netherlands . Notable examples include a big data analysis system called System Risk Indication ( SyRI ) , as well as several predictive policing initiatives run by the Dutch police . In addition , the private sector already offers a range of different ADM-based solutions , for example in the field of alterna-tive dispute resolution and credit/risk scoring . Poli Tical de BaT es on as P ec T s of au Toma T ion – Governmen T and Parliamen T Unlike many other countries , no work has been done in the Netherlands on a national agenda specifically focussed on automated decision-making or Artificial Intelligence . In politics , the role of algorithms and ADM in society is being treated as part of a larger discus-sion on digital transformation . Set out below are the parts of the current political debate that focus sp ecifically on the use of ADM and that could have the greatest impact on individuals . / dutch d igitalisation s trategy The Nederlandse Digitaliseringsstrategie : Nederland Digitaal ( Dutch Digitalsation Strategy ) external [ nl 1 ] highlights the opportunities that the use of automated decision-making and Artificial Intelligence bring , in particular , in making all sorts of processes more efficient ( the processes in question are not detailed in the report ) . The strategy stresses the need to keep up with the enormous competition from other countries in the field , and therefore cooperation between the public and the private sector is encouraged . Such cooperation is , for example , given form in the Commit2Data program . external [ NL 2 ] This is a multi-year , national research and innovation programme built on the basis of a public-private partnership . It aims to further develop the use of Big Data around LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 94 a utomating s ociety netherlands LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalthemes such as logistics , health and data handling . The sub-programme Verantwoorde Waardecreatie met Big Data ( Responsible Value Creation with Big Data or VWData ) fo-cuses specifically on research into the responsible use of applied technical and societal Big Data solutions . In the field of Artificial Intelligence , a similar innovation programme is envisaged with the aims of developing knowledge about the technologies behind AI , its application , and the human factor ( ethics , behaviour and acceptance ) . Transparency and explainability of algo-rithms are set to be an important theme in the programme . At the same time , the strategy warns about the risks involved in the use of ADM and AI , for example in terms of autonomy and equal treatment . An entire chapter of the strategy is therefore dedicated to the safeguarding of public values and human rights . The need for their inclusion in the development and use of data and algorithms is emphasised . / agenda d igitale o verheid – d igital Government a genda As part of the larger digitisation strategy , the Dutch government published its Digital Gov-ernment Agenda : NL DIGIbeter in July 2018. external [ nl 3 ] In the agenda , the government sets out how the digitisation of public administration at multiple administrative levels should progress . It acknowledges the increasing use and importance of ADM in public decision-making processes , service provision and governance—for example , in the process of issuing permits . It also encourages experiments in this area by governmental institutions , both on a national and sub-national level . As in the broader Dutch Digitalsation Strategy , the agenda highlights the importance of the protection of constitutional rights and public values in cases where ADM is applied . It also stresses that even semi-automated decisions should comply with the principles of Dutch administrative law . In this light , many of the calls for action in the agenda are focussed on research into the consequences and ethics of ADM in inter alia administrative service provision . some of the research as set out in the digital Go vernment a genda : In August 2018 , a research report instigated by the Dutch government—and conducted by Utrecht University—about the relationship between algorithms and fundamental rights was sent to the Dutch parliament . external [ nl 4 ] The report identifies problems that the growing importance of algorithms brings with respect to fundamental rights . These include the right to privacy , equality rights , freedom rights and procedural rights . The government was sup-posed to react to the report during the summer of 2018 , but , as of November 2018 , they have still not done so . In June 2018 , the government asked the Wetenschappelijke Raad voor het Regeringsbeleid ( Scientific Council for Government Policy , WRR ) —an independent advisory body on government policy whose members include prominent social scientists , economists , and legal scholars—to conduct research into the impact of Artificial Intelligence on public val-ues . external [ NL 5 ] The request mentions the growing impact of AI , both in the public and private sector , and stresses the need for cross-domain research into the impact on public values . Besides the opportunities , the request also mentions specific risks associated with the use of AI , for example , in terms of discrimination regarding vulnerable groups . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 95 The WRR has already published several reports that touch on the societal consequences of the use of ADM . These include the 2016 publication , “ Big Data and Security Policies : Serving Security , Protecting Freedom ” external [ nl 6 ] , about the use of Big Data by the police , the judiciary and the intelligence services . It concluded that the existing regulatory framework should be upgraded significantly in order to provide sufficient protection of fundamental rights and safeguards against erroneous use . Specifically , the report concludes that the use of risk profiles and ( semi- ) automated decision-making should be regulated more tightly . Lastly , the Digital Government Agenda mentions that the Wetenschappelijk onderzoeks- en documentatiecentrum ( Research and Documentation Centre of the Ministry of Justice and Security or WODC ) will carry out research on the regulation and legality of algorithms taking autonomous decisions . The research , planned for 2018 , is supposed to focus on the societal consequences of ADM in the near future and any regulatory interventions that might be required . Results have not yet been published . / dutch c ouncil of s tate – r aad van s tate On August 31 , 2018 , the Dutch Council of State—the highest advisory body on legislation and governance to both the government and parliament—published a critical assessment of the Dutch Digital Agenda and especially of its ADM provisions . external [ nl 7 ] According to the Council of State , the growing importance of ADM carries with it the risk that citizens can not check which rules are being applied . In addition , it is no longer possible to determine whether the rules actually do what they are intended to do . Furthermore , citizens risk be-ing profiled and confronted with decisions based on information of which the source is un-known . The agenda warns of the detrimental effect upon aspects of the Dutch constitution , of issues relating to the rule of law in general , and to the consequences for the position and protection of individuals in particular . As an antidote , the council , among other things , pro-posed that an administrative decision must contain explanations of which ADM processes ( algorithms ) have been used and what data has been taken from other administrative bod-ies . In addition , the council proposes that a human check must be allowed if a citizen objects to an automated administrative decision . This would be done in order to strengthen the position of citizens in automated and follow-up decision-making . A reaction from the government to the assessment was sent to parliament on November 2 , 2018. external [ nl 8 ] The government acknowledges the risks identified by the Council of State and mentions that the assessment is in line with actions and processes already initiated by the government . / The use of Artificial Intelligence in the judicial branch While the Dutch judiciary has yet to implement ADM in any tangible form , steps are being taken to allow it in the near future . The Dutch Digitalisation Strategy has already asked for cooperation between the judicial branch and the scientific field to research ways in which Artificial Intelligence can be applied responsibly . On March 29 , 2018 , the Ministry of Justice and Security organised a round table discussion on the use of Artificial Intelli-gence in the legal field . external [ nl 9 ] Among the participants were scientists as well as delegates from civil society organisations and industry . In July 2018 , the East Brabant District Court , together with Tilburg Law School , appointed a professor to the new special chair in Data Science in the Judiciary . This person will be involved in performing ( small ) experiments and pilots with AI and ADM at the District Court . external [ nl 10 ] The Minister of Legal Protection LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 96 a utomating s ociety netherlands promised to send a letter to parliament in the autumn of 2018 on the possible meaning of ADM and AI for the judicial branch . As of November 2018 , this letter has not been received . Poli Tical de BaT es on as P ec T s of au Toma T ion – c ivil s ocie T y and academia / Bits of freedom Bits of Freedom external [ nl 11 ] is a digital rights organisation focussed mainly on privacy and freedom of communication online . It strives to influence legislation and self-regulation , and to empower citizens and users by advancing awareness , use , and development of freedom-enhancing technologies . The organisation is very active in public and political debates on the use of ADM in , amongst other things , predictive policing , profiling and credit scoring . For example , they took part in the round table discussion on the use of AI in the judicial branch . external [ NL 12 ] More recently , Bits of Freedom ran several campaigns to raise awareness about the growing influence of ADM in modern day society . For example , they presented a Big Brother Award to the Dutch national police for their predictive policing initiatives . Furthermore , they co-initiated h eel h olland Transparant ( All of h olland Transparent ) external [ nl 13 ] , an initiative aimed at illustrating the amount of data gathered by private scoring companies . They did this by making public the personal details of some well-known Dutch people where all the information originated from public sources . / De Kafkabrigade De Kafkabrigade ( The Kafka Brigade ) external [ nl 14 ] tackle redundant and dysfunctional bureaucracy that prevents people from accessing the services they need and that constrains and frustrates public service staff . The Brigade has published a book called De Digitale Kooi ( The Digital Cage ) that illustrates the unwanted consequences of the increasing use of , among other things , automated decision-making mechanisms in public service . / Dutch Alliance for Artificial Intelligence On October 11 2018 , the Dutch Alliance for Artificial Intelligence ( ALLAI ) external [ NL 15 ] was unveiled to the public . The alliance was initiated by three Dutch members of the European High-Level Expert Group on AI : Catelijne Muller , Virginia Dignum and Aimee van Wijns-berghe . The aim of the alliance is to enable a multistakeholder discussion on the responsible development , deployment and use of AI . ALLAI focuses on six broad themes that cover AI ’ s advantages as well as the risks and challenges it brings : high quality AI ; ethics of AI ; social impact of AI ; education and skills ; rights and accountability , and AI for good . / Platform Bescherming Burgerrechten Platform Bescherming Burgerrechten ( Platform for the Protection of Civil Rights ) external [ nl 16 ] is a civil rights NGO consisting of a network of organisations , groups and individuals who join each other in striving to better guarantee and strengthen civil rights in the Nether-lands . It focuses particularly on respect for privacy rights , physical integrity , digital au-tonomy and the right to personal control ( and possession ) of personal data . Among other things , Platform Bescherming Burgerrechten is involved in a coalition that initiated legal proceedings against the System Risk Indication ( Systeem Risico Inventarisatie or SyRi—see ADM in Action ) . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 97 / Privacy f irst Privacy First external [ nl 17 ] is a non-governmental organisation ( NGO ) committed to promoting and preserving the public ’ s right to privacy . The foundation has several focus areas ( e.g . financial , online and medical privacy ) , some of which centre on the growing impact of ADM on society , for example through profiling . Privacy First is also involved in the coalition that initiated legal proceedings against the System Risk Indication ( Systeem Risico Inventarisa-tie or SyRI—see ADM in Action ) . / rathenau i nstitute The Rathenau Institute external [ nl 18 ] is an independent knowledge institute that in recent times has published several influential reports on automated decision-making , Big Data and AI . These reports are frequently mentioned in political debates , for example in a debate that preceded the passing of the Digital Government Act . In 2017 , the institute published a report called “ Opwaarderen . h et borgen van publieke waarden in de digitale samenleving ” ( “ Urgent Upgrade . Protect public values in our digitised society ” ) in which it concluded that digitisation challenges important public values and human rights such as privacy , equality , autonomy , and human dignity . The report warned that government , industry and society are not yet adequately equipped to deal with these challenges . Also in 2017 , the Institute published a report on “ Mensenrechten in het robottijdperk ” ( “ h uman rights in the robot age ” ) . More recently , it published the “ Doelgericht Digitaliseren ” ( “ Decent digitisation ” ) report in 2018 . This report included a collection of blog posts in which experts set out their views on decent digitisation , for example in terms of how we can stay in charge of algo-rithms . On the basis of these reports , the institute formulated four virtues that can help to deal better with digital technology : personalisation , modesty ( i.e . awareness of the limits of digital technology ) , transparency , and responsibility . / Scientific research As set out above , the political debate on aspects of automation has already prompted quite a number of reports and research . In the scientific field , the need to research the impact of automated decision-making across different sectors of Dutch society is acknowledged as well . Such a call can , for example , be found in the Nationale Wetenschapsagenda ( Dutch National Research Agenda ) . external [ nl 19 ] Furthermore , automated decision-making is highlighted in multiple programme lines of the Digital Society Research Agenda by the Associa-tion of Dutch Universities ’ ( Vereniging van Universiteiten or VSNU ) . external [ NL 20 ] Notable recent research includes a report external [ NL 21 ] that is part of a research collaboration between the Universities of Amsterdam , Tilburg , Radboud , Utrecht and Eindhoven ( TU/e ) on automated decision-making , and which forms part of the groups ’ research on fairness in automated decision-making . The report provides an overview of public knowledge , per-ceptions , hopes and concerns about the adoption of AI and ADM across different societal sectors in the Netherlands . Furthermore , a PhD thesis , on Automated Administrative Chain Decisions and Legal Protection , was recently defended at Tilburg University . external [ NL 22 ] The PhD candidate found that in most cases , administrative chain decisions regarding income tax filings or the granting of child benefits severely lacked transparency and contestabili-ty—thereby risking to infringe on fundamental rights as well as on administrative principles of good governance.page 98 a utomating s ociety netherlands reGula Tory and self-re G ula Tory m easures / digital Government a ct The proposal for the Wet Digitale Overheid ( Digital Government Act ) external [ NL 23 ] was submitted to parliament in June 2018 . The act sets out the regulatory framework beneath the Digital Government Agenda , providing rules on , among other things , the power to impose certain ( technical ) standards in the electronic communication of the government ; data and information security ; the responsibility for the management of facilities and services within generic digital government infrastructure ( GDI ) , and digital access to public services for citizens and businesses . / data Processing Partnership a ct In September 2018 , a public consultation was completed on a proposal for the Wet gegevensverwerking door samenwerkingsverbanden ( Data Processing Partnership Act ) . external [ NL 24 ] The aim of the act is to provide a basis for public-private cooperation and to make collaboration between the two easier . This applies to the processing of data , specifically when this processing is used for surveillance or investigation purposes , for example to prevent crimes , or to detect welfare fraud . / Dutch Road Traffic Act 1994 An amendment of the Wegenverkeerswet 1994 ( Dutch Road Traffic Act 1994 ) passed into law in September 2018 . Upon obtaining a licence , this permits experiments with fully autonomous vehicles . external [ NL 25 ] / code Good d igital Governance As part of the Digital Government Agenda the presentation of a Code Goed Digitaal bestu-ur ( Code Good Digital Governance ) is envisaged for mid-2019 . external [ NL 26 ] This code should aim to provide guidance and set out rules for the collection and use of data , and the use of new technologies , in the public space , for example in the context of smart city initiatives . adm in ac T ion / adm in alternative dispute resolution A few private initiatives are available that offer a form of alternative dispute resolution , or arbitration , through a completely digitised procedure . external [ NL 27 ] The cases are handled solely by using digital and algorithm-based processes—the defendant never sees an actual judge . Automated decision-making plays a significant role in these procedures , and these private courts , sometimes mockingly named Robo-judge , are increasingly being used by debt collection companies . Some health insurance companies also apply them by imposing their use on their clients by including arbitration clauses in their terms of use . Recently , this application of digital , privatised dispute resolution has sparked controversy , particularly regarding the lack of due process and the non-transparent nature of such initiatives . The Minister of Legal Protection has been asked questions about this in parliament . external [ NL 28 ] In response , the minister commented mostly positive about digital alternative dispute resolu-tion initiatives and downplayed the risks and detrimental effects . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 99 / credit / risk scoring An increasing number of private companies offer credit scoring services . external [ NL 29 ] These services are used by a variety of clients—such as health care insurance providers , energy companies , internet service providers and phone companies—to rate the creditworthi-ness of citizens . The credit scoring companies gather information on a large scale from a variety of sources to give an automated indication as to whether a potential customer can be trusted . The client of the credit scoring service can subsequently use ADM to decide whether , for example , a potential customer can have insurance or a phone subscription . These private credit scoring companies exist alongside an official and independent financial registration office called Bureau Krediet Registratie ( Central Credit Registration Office or BKR ) . In most cases , the amount of data these companies collect far exceeds the amount available at the BKR . / journalistic reporting ADM in The Netherlands has also found its way into journalism . external [ nl 30 ] Several news outlets have implemented , or are in the process of implementing , ‘ recommender systems ’ . These systems semi-automatically decide which articles are shown to each individual visi-tor or subscriber to a news website . Among these outlets are RTL Nieuws , h et Financieel Dagblad , NU.nl and the Dutch Broadcast Foundation ( NOS ) . Most notable among these is a kiosk-like online platform called Blendle that enables users to read articles from multiple newspapers and magazines on a pay-per-view basis . It recently introduced a subscription model that provides subscribers with twenty tailored articles per day . Apart from a few articles that are hand-picked by editors , the selection of these articles is mainly algorithm-based and dependent on a variety of data points ( e.g . what articles a user has previously clicked on ) . / law enforcement initiatives – Predictive policing At the moment , multiple initiatives are in operation in the Netherlands centred around the use of predictive , algorithm-based methods to anticipate and prevent crimes . Most notably the national Police has—after having run pilots in Amsterdam and The h ague—rolled out a programme called Criminaliteits Anticipatie Systeem ( Crime Anticipation System or CAS ) , which they built themselves . external [ nl 31 ] external [ NL 32 ] The aim of this system is to predict where and when crimes , such as burglary and street robbery , will take place . The system does this by analysing a wide variety of data , such as historic crime rates , data from Statistics Nether-lands , and information about recidivists ( e.g . dates of birth and addresses ) , after which the likelihood of these crimes occurring is indicated in the form of a heat map . Other examples of predictive policing initiatives and pilots are the development of RTIgeweld . This is a risk prediction instrument used to estimate the future risk of violence of all persons appearing in the police ’ s incident registration system . In addition , ProKID is a method that was introduced in 2013 . It is aimed at identifying the risk of recidivism among twelve year olds who have previously been suspected of a criminal offence by the police . / Municipality-level projects In recent times , on the lower administrative levels ( especially in municipalities ) , a broad range of data-driven or algorithm-based initiatives have seen the light of day . It goes be-yond the stretch of this report to give a detailed overview of all developments at this point , but over recent years many municipalities have , for example , launched smart city initiatives . page 100 a utomating s ociety netherlands These initiatives collect a broad range of data from a variety of sources and for a variety of reasons , such as improving safety in entertainment districts and crowd control , but also to regulate air quality and to solve mobility issues . An important development in this regard is the creation by a coalition of ( larger ) municipalities in collaboration with industry and scientists of the NL Smart City Strategie external [ nl 33 ] in January 2017 . ADM is also used in some municipalities to prevent and detect truancy and early school-leaving . This is done by using algorithms that help decide which students will be paid a visit by a school attendance officer . Similar initiatives exist to detect child abuse and/or domestic violence . Other than using System Risk Indication ( see below ) , some municipalities have also developed their own initiatives that revolve around the use of algorithms to detect welfare fraud . These programmes take into account data such as dates of birth , family composition , paid premiums and benefits history , as well as data from the T ax and Customs Administration , Land Registry and the Netherlands Vehicle Authority . Municipalities thus hope to increase the chances of identifying people committing welfare fraud . An overview of initiatives can be found in the 2018 report Datagedreven sturing bij gemeenten ( Data driven steering in municipalities ) external [ nl 34 ] , which was initiated by the Association of Netherlands Municipalities . The report urges municipalities to share knowledge , and encourages them to cooperate in the roll-out of new initiatives . / social Welfare – s y ri Systeem Risico Inventarisatie ( System Risk Indication or SyRI ) is a big data analysis system that runs under the auspices of the Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment . external [ NL 35 ] It is used on request by any of the so-called ‘ cooperation associations ’ . These include state institutions such as the employee insurance provider ( UWV ) , the tax office ( De Belasting-dienst ) , the social security bank ( SVB ) and the immigration authority ( IND ) , as well as a few Dutch municipalities to detect wrongly collected social benefits and other abusive use of the social welfare state . The aim of the system is to combat and prevent the unlawful use or recourse to public money or social security institutions or other income-related state benefits . In order for SyRI to operate , data provided by a citizen ( for example to file a tax return ) is combined with data from a variety of other sources . An algorithm , involving a risk model with several unknown indicators , then determines whether a citizen should be flagged because of an increased risk of irregularities , or potential f raud . In recent times , SyRI has increasingly attracted negative attention . The subject has led to questions to the Minister of Legal Protection by members of the Dutch h ouse of Parliament . external [ nl 36 ] More importantly , a group of civil rights initiatives which gathered under the name Bij Voorbaat Verdacht ( Suspected in Advance ) recently started legal proceedings against the use of the software . external [ nl 37 ] A trial was set to start in the final months of 2018 .

It analysed and then intervened in a case concerning the use of algorithms for profil-ing in unemployment . In January 2018 , the Polish Ministry of Justice introduced a system to randomly allocate court cases to judges . The system is currently the most visible and most-discussed case of ADM used by the public administration . In Wroclaw , one of Poland 's largest cities , a system malfunction caused the algorithm to incorrectly allocate children to nurseries , preschool and schools . The Ministry of Labour and Social Policy introduced an ADM mechanism that profiles unem-ployed people and assigns them to categories that determine the type of assistance a person can obtain from local labour offices . PoLAnD by Alek T A rkowski Policy debates on the issue of algorithms and automated decision-making ( ADM ) have only recently been initiated by the public administration , and they have focused on the related concept of Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) . Before 2018 , there were no s igns of a policy debate on ADM and related issues . However , that changed in spring 2018 , when public interest increased . In April 2018 , Poland was one of the Member State signatories of the Declaration of Cooper ation on Artificial Intelligence , which was spearheaded by the European Commission . external [ Pl 1 ] In June 2018 , the Polish government announced that work will begin on Poland ‘ s AI strategy . In n ovember , the Ministry of Digital Affairs published a document titled “ Proposition for an AI Strategy in Poland ” that includes an action plan for 2018-2019.ADM solutions are employed to a limited extent by the Polish business sector . According to a report published in 2018 by the Sobieski Institute on “ Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Poland ” external [ Pl 2 ] , large Polish IT companies do not yet have the capacity to deploy AI or ADM solutions . Greater capacity to do this can be observed among start-ups , micro , and small and medium-sized companies , especially in the FinT ech sector . In most cases , these solutions are still in the early phases of implementation and business life cycle . Some of the first ADM projects are also being implemented in the public sector . There are few visible signs of discussions that concern social , civic or ethical implications of these solutions . By framing the debate around the general term ‘ Artificial Intelligence ’ , Pol-ish stakeholders are avoiding a more specific discussion about the functioning of algorithms and their influence on decision-making . The debate about business solutions that employ ADM is currently focused on a growth paradigm , and explores the potential for further developing this sector of the economy . Similarly , a debate among academics working in the field of Artificial Intelligence focuses on attaining scientific goals , or obtaining public fund-ing either at the Polish or the European level . Poli TicAl deb ATes on AsPecTs of Au Tom AT ion – Governmen T A nd P A rli A men T / Polish A i s trategy and Action Plan for 2018-2019 At a conference in June 2018 , Jarosław Gowin , Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Sci-ence and Higher Education , declared that Poland will create its own Artificial Intelligence strategy . external [ Pl 3 ] In July 2018 , the Ministry of Digital Affairs invited stakeholders to participate in shaping the Polish AI strategy . Between August and o ctober , around 200 stakeholders participated in four working groups that dealt with issues of data availability , financing , ethics and regulation , and education in relation to AI . o n n ovember 10 , 2018 , the Ministry of Digital Affairs published a report titled Założenia do strategii AI w Polsce . Plan działań Ministerstwa Cyfryzacji ( Proposition for an AI Strategy in Poland . Action Plan of the Ministry of Digital page 104 Automating s ociety Poland LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalAffairs ) external [ Pl 4 ] . The document presents recommendations of strategic and operational goals for the four areas defined above . It also includes a short action plan proposed by the ministry for the years 2018-2019 . It should be noted that the document is not an official strategy—the strategic recommendations have not been in any way endorsed or approved by the government . It remains to be seen if and when the Polish government will present its AI strategy . The issue of ADM has been extensively addressed by the “ Ethics and Law ” working group— although the term is not used directly , as the document mainly uses the general concept of AI . The group defines a need to ensure that as AI solutions are being implemented , basic rights are effectively protected . In addition , knowledge about the social impact of AI should be obtained , ethical standards defined , and high-quality regulation adopted for areas related to the implementation of AI . Transparency and explainability of algorithms are listed as one of the key legal challenges concerning the protection of basic human rights in relation to AI . The proposed 2018-2019 action plan does not include either the implementation of ADM by the public administration or its regulation . The only AI solution proposed in the action plan is a chatbot for the n ational Qualifications Registry . It is telling that the plan includes little mention of regulatory measures for ADM and AI . Regulation is seen only as a means for providing more effective public support for research , prototyping and implementation of AI in the economy . The government has declared that work on Poland ’ s AI strategy will continue in 2019 . / Visegrad 4 countries ’ thoughts on Artificial Intelligence In April 2018 , the V4 Group ( Czech Republic , Hungary , Poland and Slovakia ) published a shared position , titled “ Visegrad 4 countries ’ thoughts on the Artificial Intelligence and maximising its benefits ahead of the release of the European Commission ’ s Communication on the topic ” . external [ Pl 5 ] The document is rather short and general in its nature . Most attention in the document is paid to the issue of the availability of data , its security , and trust in data sources . The document also declares the importance of “ formulating open , executable and recognised international norms concerning the research , development and implementation of ethically designed systems and solutions based on Artificial Intelligence technology ” . The document lists the following priorities : W Digitisation as a priority of the European Union be yond 2020 W A pan-European initiativ e on establishing a framework for opening up data for innovation W o pening the debate about a funding mechanism W Uniform regulatory sandbo xes W Support for the reform of public administr ation in decision-making through AI solutions W consider ation of cybersecurity and trust issues W e xamination of the impact on the EU labour force It should be pointed out that both the regulation of ADM and its use b y the public administration are addressed in these priorities . The regulatory sandboxes are understood as “ digital , virtual environments , in which interested parties from different sectors can experiment with data and algorithms ” . Thanks to these sandboxes , regulatory bodies can observe the development of algorithmic solutions and make informed decisions concern- T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 105 ing their regulation . The issue of the use of ADM by the public administration is not further developed , save for the mention of the regulatory impact assessment as a potential process where ADM could be used . Poli TicAl deb ATes on AsPecTs of Au Tom AT ion – civil socie T y A nd Ac A demi A The issue of algorithmic decision-making has been addressed by Polish civil society organi-sations for several years . In 2018 , ADM became a significant topic of public debate due to on-going European copyright reform and the issue of algorithmic content filters . These or-ganisations are also active in the public debate and consultations connected with Poland ’ s new AI strategy . / Panoptykon foundation The Foundation Fundacja Panoptykon external [ Pl 6 ] was the first to initiate a debate about algorithmic decision-making in Poland . It analysed and then intervened in a case concern-ing the use of an algorithmic system for profiling the unemployed by the Polish Ministry of Labour and Social Policy ( see ADM in Action ) . The Foundation also addresses the issue of algorithms within its broader anti-surveillance activism . / ePaństwo Foundation In 2018 , Fundacja ePaństwo external [ Pl 7 ] launched the “ alG oV rithms ” project , which aims to map the use of ADM by the public administration in Central and Eastern European states . external [ Pl 8 ] The foundation focuses on the use of algorithms by public administration bodies . / Centrum Cyfrowe Foundation The Foundation Fundacja Centrum Cyfrowe external [ Pl 9 ] has been addressing the issue of ADM with regard to content filtering , as part of its advocacy work on the new European Direc-tive on Copyright in the Digital Single Mark et . The issue , dubbed “ ACTA 2 ” ( in reference to the infamous ACTA treaty , which sparked mass protests in Poland ) , became one of the key digital policy issues in the Polish public debate this year , alongside GDPR implementation . In autumn , the Foundation launched a public campaign on the issue , called “ Internet is for the people ” . external [ Pl 10 ] / coalition for Polish i nnovation and digital P oland By 2018 , two major cross-sector coalitions , Koalicja na rzecz Polskich Innowacji ( Coalition for Polish Innovation 1 ) and Digital Poland2 , launched working groups and a programme that dealt with issues related to AI and algorithms . Both of these coal itions are foundations , established with the goal of networking stakeholders ( mainly business , but also civil society or academic institutions ) on issues related to the regulation of digital technologies . These groups were largely formed in response to the growing interest of the government in 1 W ebsite of the coalition : https : //koalicjadlainnowacji.pl/en/ 2 W ebsite of the foundation : https : //www.digitalpoland.org/en/LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 106 Automating s ociety Poland Artificial Intelligence and related issues . However , at the time of writing this report , neither of the two coalitions have published any position papers or recommendations on the issue . reGulATory A nd self-re G ul ATory m e A sures At the moment Poland lacks any regulation on a national level that directly concerns algorithms or algorithmic decision-making . 3 Although several important case studies of the use of ADM can be observed at different levels of government , there doesn ’ t seem to be any attempt to regulate this issue or to define standards . n either exist programmes to raise awareness about the issue or to encourage implementation of ADM solutions . The solu-tions that are employed are also relatively simple algorithmic processes . Adm in Ac T ion / m inistry of Justice – s ystem of random Allocation of c ases on 1 January 2018 , the Polish Ministry of Justice introduced the “ System of Random Allocation of Cases ” ( System Losowego Przydziału Spraw ) , a digital system that , on a onceper-day basis , assigns cases to judges across the country . The system is currently the most visible and most discussed case of ADM used by the public administration . Pilots of the programme were initiated in three cities in 2017 . The launch of the system aligned with controversial reforms of the judicial system in Poland , leading to intense public scrutiny . According to anecdotal evidence , the allocation of cases was not random , with judges receiving extremely varied allocations , often seen by them as unfair . In particular , the random character of the algorithm has been questioned . In 2017 , the Ministry refused a freedom of information request b y n G o s ePaństwo and Watchdog Polska to disclose the source code and the details of the algorithm that powers the system . external [ Pl 12 ] The Ministry has provided explanations on how the system functions and described how the algorithm works , but it refuses to make the source code publicly available . According to the ministry , system administrators have limited permissions and can not interfere with the randomised selection , the working of the programme is overseen by the Appellate Court in Gdańsk , and all operations made by users are registered . The Minister of Justice has de-clared that `` the selection will be made solely by a machine , a computer system that is blind like Themis , and chooses without emotions , without views or biases , and in a manner fully free from possible accusations of corruption “ . external [ Pl 13 ] In mid-2018 , the Ministry admitted that the system has faults and , i n the case of some judges , assigns cases unequally . The ministry promised to introduce changes to the algorithm , yet its exact functioning remains unclear and controversial . external [ Pl 14 ] 3 This opinion is shared b y the authors of the report : Polityka Insight , “ Iloraz sztucznej inteligencji . Potencjał AI w polskiej gospodarce ” , 2018 external [ Pl 11 ] T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 107 / school systems – allocation of children at schools In Wrocław , one of Poland ’ s largest cities , a system malfunction caused the algorithm that allocates children to nurseries to make incorrect selections . The malfunction led to a rare case of public scrutiny of the use of ADM for allocating learners to nurseries , preschools and schools . external [ Pl 15 ] In a typical scenario , a citywide allocation system is used to place chi ldren in preschools . This is done based on information provided by parents , which can include data on such factors as the number of children , single-parent households , food allergies of children , handicaps , and material situation . The functioning of such systems is controversial especially at preschool level , where the lack of a sufficient number of preschools and the lack of any obligation for a child to be in preschool leads to a shortage of available places . Parents therefore feel subjected to an arbitrary system that allocates their children in a non-transparent and possibly unfair manner . There is no data available on the scale at which such systems are employed . o ne of these systems , Platforma Zarządzania o światą ( Education Management Platform ) created by Asseco Data Systems external [ Pl 16 ] , is used by 4,500 schools and preschools in 20 Polish cities . The system offers a range of functions and there is no data available on what percentage of them use ADM solutions for the allocation of learners . These cases of ADM do not seem to draw much public scrutiny . However , anecdotal evidence shows that the decisions made by these systems are of great importance to the parents of children in preschools and schools . / canard s peed c amera s ystem The Centrum Automatycznego nadzoru nad Ruchem Drogowym ( Road Traffic Automation Supervision Centre , CA n ARD ) external [ Pl 17 ] is a nationwide fotoradar ( speed camera ) system . It is connected to an IT system that uses image analysis algorithms to r ead license plates before it automatically fines drivers who are speeding . The centre was created in 2011 within the General Road Transport Inspection ( Główny Inspektorat Ruchu Drogowego ) , and the traffic control infrastructure that uses ADM was launched in 2015 . The system consists of 400 stationary speed cameras , 29 mobile units , 29 road-based traffic measurement systems , and 20 devices that register vehicles crossing intersections at a red light . In August 2018 , the “ Puls Biznesu ” economic journal disclosed that the CA n ARD system fails to fine drivers of electric cars . external [ Pl 18 ] Apparently , incomplete data on electric cars in the CEPiK national vehicle registry led the algorithm to identify electric cars as belonging to a special category ( reserved , for example , for traffic control vehicles ) that were exempt from speeding fines . / Ministry of Labour and Social Policy – profiling of unemployed people In May 2014 , the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy introduced an ADM system that pro-files unemployed people and assigns them to three categories that determine the type of assistance that a person can obtain from local labour offices . external [ Pl 19 ] The profiling mechanism is part of “ Syriusz Std ” —a nationwide IT system created by the IT department of the Ministry—which collects data on people who register as unemployed in labour offices , and on employees and their activities . The decision is made based on data collected through a questionnaire used by an employee of the labour office to question the unemployed person . page 108 Automating s ociety Poland 24 questions are used to collect data on two criteria that are tak en into account : “ distance from the labour market ” and “ readiness to enter or return to the labour market ” . Fundacja Panoptykon , and other n G o s critical of the system , believe that the questionnaire , and the system that makes decisions based on it , profiles individuals based on personal data . o nce the system makes a decision based on the data , the employee of the labour office can change the profile selection before approving the decision and ending the process . According to official data , employees modify the system ’ s selection in less than 1 % of cases . Furthermore , the system has been criticised for a lack of transparency about the distribution of public services , lack of oversight , and the alleged arbitrary nature of decision-making due to the simplification of data obtained from interviews . In addition , the system does not give the subjects of this ADM process the means to obtain data or an explanation concerning the decision , and the labour offices have limited means of analysing and evaluating the ADM process . Initially , the Ministry shared general information about the functioning of the algorithm with the Panoptykon Foundation , which investigated the case and which later made this information public . In 2016 , the Foundation obtained detailed information about the questionnaire and the scoring algorithm through a freedom of information request . external [ Pl 20 ] In the same year , the Polish Commissioner for Human Rights asked the Polish Constitutional Tribunal to determine whether the profiling system is in line with the Polish constitution . However , the issues raised by the commissioner did not concern the ADM component , instead he questioned the lack of a redress mechanism and the basis for collecting personal data . external [ Pl 21 ] The case was solved in 2018 , when the Constitutional Tribunal decided that the system needs to be better secured in a legislative act . external [ Pl 22 ] / national Health fund and fr aud detection In September 2018 , the national Health Fund ( nFZ ) announced that it will implement algorithms to enable closer scrutin y of public health expenditure . external [ Pl 23 ] Currently , regional n FZ offices use two different IT systems that are not integrated , and thus do not enable full data analysis . Data integration is therefore the first step of the project announced by the fund . Using the data , algorithms will compare an individual patient ’ s history of medical pro-cedures with standardised scenarios , in order to discover anomalies—which are potentially caused by fraud at health institutions . The n FZ estimates that by employing algorithms it will shorten the time needed to analyse all contracted health institutions from 16 years to 5 years . / one2Tribe one2Tribe external [ Pl 24 ] is a Polish company that started out as a games developer , and then pivoted into providing a motivational platform based on gamification methods and behav-ioural psychology . In recent years , the company has been developing a machine learning solution that optimises the motivational platform to most effectiv ely improve employee behaviour by appropriately defining challenges and prizes . Recently , they have also begun implementing algorithms that take into account individual work stress as a factor . In all cases , ADM is being used to tailor the system to the individual tr aits and preferences of employees .

The first pub-lication eGovernment in Slovenia describes government databases and services . external [ SI 4 ] The second—Digital Transformation of Slovenia external [ SI 5 ] —also mentions Artificial Intelligence and information infrastructure for future automated systems ( e.g . driving , social security ) . The Ministry for Public Administration is keeping most of the government ’ s and citizens ’ data .

Their only goal is to present their services to as many potential customers as possible . They also claimed that they do not want to interfere with editorial policy in any way . The president of the Slovenian Advertising Chamber external [ SI 9 ] explained that advertisers have to balance their corporate responsibilities and brand values on the one hand with edi-torial independence on the other . However , the Slovenian Advertising Chamber supports the idea of a “ Code of Practice on Disinformation ” —an initiative of European advertisers external [ SI 10 ] proposed to the European Commission in September 2018 . The Code of Practice calls for more transparent media buying practices and recognises the possibility that adver-tisers may involuntarily finance disinformation websites . The two co-founders of the Slovenian content marketing company Zemanta external [ SI 11 ] ( which was recently taken over by the US company o utbrain ) explained the functioning of the advertising “ black box ” and advertising algorithms . They admitted that advertising algorithms can sometimes be gamed and abused by disinformation sites . However , they did not agree with the argument that autonomous advertising mechanisms can be held responsible for financing hate speech . Indeed , the advertiser may be surprised by a certain “ unfortunate ad placement ” . But they argue that it is relatively easy to fix this problem if an advertiser decides to better control its online ads . In short : “ they ( the advertisers ) should learn to bet-ter use their tools ” . Slovenian Prime Minister Marjan Šarec also joined the debate in n ovember 2018 . He published a public statement external [ SI 12 ] and called for the advertisers to reconsider their marketing strategies when their clients promote hate speech ( e.g . racism and homophobia ) . His appeal evoked radically polarised opinions . Political opponents , some advertisers , and right-wing and conservative media commentators accused him of censorship and politi-cal pressure on private companies . left-wing and liber al media critics , on the other hand , embraced the PM 's position that advertisers should not legitimise and finance hate speech . / Petition against automated weapons In october 2018 , a group of scientists , legal and technological experts organised a public debate on AI , autonomous weapons , and the risks of intelligent machines taking o ver the government . external [ SI 13 ] They produced a joint statement and petition against research and the use of autonomous weapons .

The system is used in forensic criminology and it was developed for assessing the risk of violence in adolescents ( aged 12-18 ) , but it was also seen to be effective in predicting the risk of general criminal recidivism . SAVRY plays a role in individual lives , and it influences the youth crime rate , as it can be used in intervention planning , such as clinical treatment plans or release and discharge decisions . Although these kinds of assessments do not intend to discriminate by gender or race , previous studies in the US—where similar systems have been used—have revealed unintended cases of discrimination .

In addition , it discusses the implications of different sources of bias for fairness and performance analysis . Researchers compare the performance of expert assessment with machine learning algorithms that also use information on defendant demographics and criminal history . “ Our dataset comprises observations of 4,752 teenag-ers who committed offences between 2002 and 2010 , and whose recidivist behaviour was recorded in 2013 and 2015 . SAVRY is available for a subset of 855 defendants ” , says Carlos Castillo , a member of HUMAINT . SAVRY is in general fair , while the machine learning models tend to discriminate against male defendants , foreigners , or people of specific national groups , sa ys Castillo : “ Machine learning could be incorporated into SAVRY , but if aspects of algorithmic justice are not taken into account , it could generate an unfair prediction . ” The evaluation external [ SP 19 ] showed that humans were much better than ADM , but that ADM can be more precise with the results . / ris c anvi – an actuarial risk assessment tool RisCanvi is a statistical risk assessment system used in Catalan prisons , similar to LSI-R ( Canada ) , Compass ( US ) and OaSys ( UK ) .

SWEDEN By Anne K Aun A nd Juli A Vel KoV A The Swedish go vernment aims to place the country at the forefront of the technological development around Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) and automated decision-making ( ADM ) . In order to accomplish this , it kicked off several strategic initiatives since 2017 , including ex-tensive government reports on self-driving cars and a commission for Artificial Intelligence . It also provided broad funding for the improvement of knowledge and skills on Artificial Intelligence for universities and university colleges . Besides the Swedish government , there are a number of additional stakeholders who are investing in knowledge production and the development of AI on a large scale . One initiative that should be mentioned here is the Wallenberg Autonomous Systems and Software Programme ( WASP ) . It granted €100 mil-lion to two leading universities in Sweden to develop machine learning , AI , and the math-ematical apparatus behind them over the next eight years . At the same time , automated decision-making is increasingly implemented in public service institutions , especially on the municipality level . However , regulation lags behind this development and the public is largely unaware of automated decision-making in the public sector and welfare institutions . The private sector already offers a range of different ADM-based solutions , ranging from office workflow optimisation , credit scoring and juridical support to self-driving lorries and the automatic detection of dyslexia among school children . Politic Al de BAtes on A s P ects of Aut om Ation – Go V ernment A nd P A rli A ment / swedish A i strategy In February 2018 , the Swedish parliament published a strategy for the national adoption of AI . external [ se 1 ] It is framed as complementing the already existing digitisation strategy . The AI strategy argues that Swedish competitiveness and welfare depend on the development of AI and digitisation . It suggests that AI needs to be implemented in a ‘ sustainable ’ way , which rests on designing applications that are “ ethical , secure , reliable and transparent ” . The strat-egy identifies as a crucial prerequisite the need for more expertise to develop and use AI in different parts of society including companies , municipalities , regional administrations and governmental agencies . It is , however , debatable to what extent different groups in society are actually involved . At present , most of the funding and strategic development takes place in the universities and as support for business environments . The need for expertise is linked to the need for educational institutions to produce experts , particularly engineers . external [ se 2 ] Cybersecurity and collaboration with the defence sector are also outlined as important , as well as building EU-wide partnerships around AI . Engineers are singled out and given priority , even though the strategy admits that the field requires the involvement of other professions . The strategy stresses that automated decision-making by governmental agencies poses moral dilemmas and concerns . The strategy argues that it is necessary to work on AI at a pan-EU level and desirable to achieve both a dialogue and a leading role in setting EU-wide standards , best practices and infrastructure for implementing AI . external [ se 3 ] LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 126 Automating s ociety sweden LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternal/ new governmental committee for coordinated and accelerated development of policies related to the fourth industrial revolution ( 2019-2020 ) In August 2018 , the Swedish government created a committee in charge of developing poli-cies and accelerating automation across industries in Sweden . external [ se 4 ] The government justified the creation of the committee with the accelerated adoption of “ the fourth industrial revolution ” , which it described as characterised by “ constant connectivity , smaller and more powerful sensors , artificial intelligence and machine learning ” . A major task for the group is to suggest policy developments . The committee references the governmental report on autonomous vehicles as an example that articulates important challenges to legislation , i.e . defining rules for not-yet-realised technologies and their areas of application . The com-mittee is expected to support the work of the government by identifying policy challenges , contributing to the reduction of legal uncertainties and to speed up policy development , in particular in the following areas : precision medicine , connected industries ( this refers to ‘ smart ’ factories or industrial manufacturing that has been digitised ) , connected and automated vehicles , transport and systems . The committee is tasked with producing analyses of barriers for the adoption of “ the fourth industrial revolution ” , such as existing regulatory frameworks , to map the need for adjusting existing regulatory frameworks , to continuously come up with suggestions for the government regarding policy developments , promote a dialogue between relevant governmental agencies and regional actors , educa-tional institutions , the non-governmental sector , and business for efficient collaboration concerning policy-developments . It is , however , not stated how , and more precisely which of these actors will be involved . In addition , the committee should seek collaboration with international actors such as EU institutions , the OECD , the World Economic Forum and other countries and international institutions . A referee group with representatives from the state and governmental agencies , regional actors , the business sector and organisations with experience in policy development will be assigned to support the committee . The com-mittee is supposed to produce a mid-term report for the years 2019 and 2020 and a final report is due on December 31 , 2021 . The committee started its work at the beginning of October 1 , 2018 . The Head of the committee is Jon Simonsson , external [ se 5 ] a former entrepreneur and CEO , whose prior work for the government included being head of the section for innovation within the Ministry of Enterprise and Innovation . / Governmental report on policy development related to autonomous driving v ehicles In March 2018 , a governmental committee presented a 1,314-page report external [ se 6 ] that evaluates the legal framework for introducing automated vehicles into ordinary traffic and makes concrete policy suggestions to improve it . The task for the committee was to consider a fast introduction of vehicles with automated functions as part of a radical trans-formation of the transport sector . In the English summary of the report , the authors state its main outcomes as follows : “ In the opinion of the committee , multi-stage development of regulations is required to deal with developments in the field of automated , electrified and digitised mobility so that this development can take place in a safe , sustainable manner . The committee ’ s proposals are intended to commence adaptation of the regulations so that these do not impede the development of new solutions for enhanced attainment of trans-port policy targets . One difficulty regarding this work has involved developing a regulation for a phenomenon that is not yet available on the market , namely fully automated vehicles capable of replacing the driver . The committee has attempted to suggest solutions that provide enhanced opportunities for testing and introducing advanced automated functions in vehicles in the short term , as well as certain fully automated vehicles . However , these so- T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 127 lutions can primarily be used even when a broader introduction becomes possible . ” external [ se 7 ] The suggested solutions include both changes in the current regulations ( for example in the regulation of penalties in traffic and for drivers ’ licences ) , as well as proposals for complete-ly new regulations and laws ( for example a new law and regulation on self-driving cars ) .

Impoverished work refers to work that requires less expertise , shorter training time , work that involves less variation in work operations , but rather involves repetitive tasks , work that does not require a lot of learning and where the employee has less options to work creatively . The report ’ s main conclusion is that most workplaces are characterised by digital taylorism where assignments are increasingly standardised . This , of course , has consequences if standardised assignments are increas-ingly automated . The report refers to a number of positive examples where automation has led to the upskilling of workers and larger variations in work assignments.LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-society externalpage 128 Automating s ociety sweden / the u nion Unionen ( The Union ) is a white-collar union that has conducted opinion polls among its members to map current applications of automation in the service sector .

According to the commentary about the law , an automated decision means a decision made by machines without a person in the public authority taking any active part in the decision-making process . The decision builds upon propositions made in 2014 by a former Swedish committee for e-governance . As the law might be interpreted as being inconsistent with article 22 of the GDPR , an explicit commentary says that the specifics of the law include sufficient protection of individuals and the right to appeal . Even though this change was implemented , the law does not cover the legislative frame-work that governs municipalities . This framework explicitly prohibits automated decisions-systems can only generate suggestions for decisions , but a person needs to approve them and assume responsibility . Indeed , the law makes an explicit distinction between auto-mated decision-making and automated decision support . Where and when to draw the line between both is a topic of debate in Sweden at the moment . Municipal officials say that a change in the law to allow automated decision-making is ‘ desirable ’ . The law requires that a detailed motivation for the reasoning that led to a decision should be attached . A Swedish expert in municipal law suggests external [ se 15 ] that the requirement for motivation sets limits on automation which takes decisions with little consideration of personal circumstances . However , he adds that future systems could be made to cater for such details . In the mean-time , the current legislative framework external [ se 16 ] makes illegal solutions of automated welfare decisions , such as those implemented in the municipality of Trelleborg , and multiplied in other cities in Sweden ( see the ADM in Action section below ) . The lack of such clarity makes the forced relocation of employees , who used to work in the processing of welfare decisions , to other parts of the municipal authority potentially problematic.LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-society external T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 129 Adm in Action / Airhelp – Automation of juridical support Since November 2017 , Airhelp employs an advanced algorithm called Lara to analyse compensation claims from airlines and evaluate in real-time how likely it is that a passenger will be compensated for interference to flight and travel plans . external [ se 17 ] The algorithm bases the decision on a number of variables including flight status , flight stati stics and weather forecast .

A parliamentary inquiry dedicated to the topic of ADM took place in 2018 . It identified the key issues but was thin on specific policy recommendations . Existing legislation has limited bearing on ADM , although reviews in some areas , such as law that would affect self-driving cars , are underway . Several new government institutions are being established which include ADM in their terms of reference . They are aimed variously at support for Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) as a source of economic growth and the development of rules and oversight mechanisms . The government professes its ambition to be a world leader in the research and development of AI and its regulation . Poli Tical de BaT es on as P ec T s of au Toma T ion – Governmen T and Parliamen T / ai s ector d eal Office for Artificial Intelligence In April 2018 , the government announced that it would establish an Office for Artificial Intelligence as part of the “ AI Sector Deal ” . The latter is a package of policies including financial support and tax breaks for research and development , aimed at boosting the Artificial Intelligence industry in the UK . The Office will be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the UK ’ s AI strategy . Demis Hassabis , co-founder of DeepMind , an Artificial Intelligence company now owned by Google , was appointed as an advisor to the Office for AI in June 2018 . The announcement of Hassabis ’ appointment attracted some critical press coverage , which raised the issue of whether it is appropriate for an employee of a private company ( Google ) to be advising the government . external [ uK 1 ] The Office does not yet have a web page external [ uK 2 ] and is currently recruiting staff . external [ uK 3 ] AI Council Also announced as part of the AI Sector Deal , the AI Council will be a counterpart to the Office for AI , composed of “ leading figures from industry and academia ” . external [ uK 4 ] In June LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 134 Automating Society United Kingdom LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternal2018 , entrepreneur T abitha Goldstaub was announced as its chair and spokesperson . external [ uK 5 ] The council is tasked to promote the growth of the AI sector . Centre for Data Ethics & Innovation ( CDEI ) The government is in the process of establishing this new advisory body . It is expected to lead the work of dealing with ethical issues raised by new data technology , agreeing best practice and identifying potential new regulations . The government says it wants to lead the debate on these issues , not just in the UK , but around the world . In its public consultation document on the role and objectives for the centre , ADM is one of three areas identified by the government as an example of an ethical issue raised by the use of data and AI . external [ uK 6 ] While recognising the potential benefits to society of ADM , it mentions discrimination against job applicants and inequities within the criminal justice system as examples of issues that may arise as a result of ADM. One of the six proposed themes for the centre ’ s work is transparency , which is described with reference to the ability to interpret or explain automated decisions . The creation of the centre was announced in autumn 2017 . In June 2018 , the government named Roger T aylor , co-founder of the healthcare data company Dr. Foster , as its chair external [ uK 7 ] , and launched a consultation on the Centre ’ s remit and its priority areas of work . The consultation closed in September 2018 , and a response from the government is now pending . / House of Commons Algorithms in Decision-Making Inquiry The Algorithms in Decision-Making Inquiry external [ uK 8 ] was launched in September 2017 by the Science and T echnology Committee . As a Commons select committee inquiry , it consisted of a series of investigative public hearings carried out by a cross-party group of MPs . Its terms of reference included : W The e xtent of current and future use of ADM across both the public and private sectors W The scope for bias and discrimination in ADM , and how this might be o vercome W Whether ADM can be made tr ansparent and accountable W How ADM might be regulated The inquiry published a report of its findings in Ma y 2018 . It found that the trends for big data and machine learning had led to an increase in the use of ADM across many areas , arguing that algorithms tend to increase in effectiveness and value as more data is used and combined . The report identified many problem areas , but was rarely specific in advocating solutions . Instead , it mostly called on existing or forthcoming regulatory bodies to carry out further research . The report recommended : W Algorithms that affect the public should gener ally be transparent . W New tools for algorithm accountability should be considered , perhaps including codes of pr actice , audits , ethics boards , or certification of algorithm developers . T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 135 W Britain ’ s privacy regulator should be adequately funded . W The publication of Data Protection Impact Assessments should be encouraged . W A procurement model for algorithms should be de veloped . It suggested that the following areas should be reviewed or evaluated further : W The scope for people to challenge the results of ADM W Whether new data protection la ws are needed W Ov ersight of ADM by regulators in specific sectors o ne concrete recommendation was that the government should publish and keep updated a list of where algorithms “ with significant impacts ” are being used in Central Government , along with projects aimed at introducing public service algorithms . The report was not covered in the British press1 , suggesting there is currently little political momentum behind ADM as a national issue . All-Party Parliamentary Group on Artificial Intelligence ( APPG AI ) This informal group of MPs and peers was established in January 2017 . It has attracted sponsorship from a consortium of firms that serve as the group ’ s secretariat through a private company called the Big Innovation Centre . The firms are Accenture , Barclays , BP , CMS Cameron McKenna Nabarro o lswang , Deloitte , EDF Energy , Ernst and Young , KPMG , Microsoft and PricewaterhouseCoopers . external [ uK 9 ] The APPG published the first annual summary of its findings in December 2017. external [ uK 10 ] One of seven ‘ focus areas ’ was accountability . Here the report suggested organisations should be made accountable for decisions made by the algorithms they use ; that the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation ( CDEI ) should establish AI auditing mechanisms ; that ethics boards inside organisations should be incentivised ; and that industry-led international col-laborations were needed , such as a forum on AI global governance , which should lead the global debate . / House of Lords Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence The Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence was formed in June 2017 . It reported in April 2018 and the government published its response in June 2018 . The report was titled AI in the UK : ready , willing and able ? external [ uK 11 ] It was relatively lukewarm towards the idea of algorithmic transparency , arguing that achieving full technical transparency is difficult and often not helpful . It accepted that there would be “ particular safety-critical scenarios where technical tr ansparency is imperative ” , such as healthcare , autonomous vehicles and weapons systems . It said regulators in the relevant sectors must have the power to enforce this . 1 Factiva cuttings search for ‘ algorithms AND decisions ’ in UK national press , 30 October 2018. https : // drive.google.com/file/d/1v7C2N7He0czqwn28O9386TbQZ9TYjROW/view ? usp=sharingLINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternalpage 136 Automating Society United Kingdom However , the report drew a distinction between transparency and the explicability of algorithmic decisions . Here the recommendations were more wary of new ADM technol-ogy , with the committee stating its belief that “ it is not acceptable to deploy any AI system which could have a substantial impact on an individual ’ s life , unless it can generate a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions it will take ” . In cases such as deep neural net-works , this may mean that the system should not be deployed at all , the report suggests . The report also expressed concern about the qualifications to the ADM safeguards in what was then the Data Protection Bill ( now the Data Protection Act 2018 ) , which mean the rules only apply to decisions ‘ solely ’ made by machines . / National Data Strategy In June 2018 , the government announced that it would produce a National Data Strategy “ to unlock the power of data in the UK economy and government , while building public con-fidence in its use ” . external [ uK 12 ] No further details have been announced at the time of writing , although other government initiatives described in the next section , such as the Centre for Data Ethics & Innovation , are laying some of the groundwork for the strategy .

It was published in June 2018 and sets out “ clear principles for how data should be used in the public sector ” . It replaces the earlier Data Science Ethical Framework , which was published in 2016 . The guidance specifically addresses the question of ADM. As guidance , it does not carry the legal weight of statute . external [ uK 21 ] At the centre of the framework are seven data ethics principles . They cover public benefit , legislation and codes of practice , proportionality , understanding data limitations , robust practices and skill sets , transparency/accountability , and responsible use of insights . Principle six is of particular relevance to ADM . Under the heading ‘ Make your work transparent and be accountable ’ , it encourages civil servants to publish their data and algorithms . The framework contains more detailed guidance for each principle and a workbook that civil servants can use to record ethical decisions made about a particular data project . When it comes to algorithms , the workbook suggests publishing their methodology , metadata about the model and/or the model itself , e.g . on Github , an open software repository . When procuring a system involving an algorithm from a private sector supplier , a series of questions is set out for civil servants to ask . These cover a range of issues that can lead to bias or lack of explicability and transparency.page 138 Automating Society United Kingdom / Data Protection Act 2018 The Data Protection Act 2018 ( DPA ) became law in May 2018 . It transposes the GDPR but also goes further than the EU legislation in relation to automated decision-making . The Act states that decisions that “ significantly affect ” an individua l may not be “ based solely on automated processing unless that decision is required or authorised by law ” .When decisions are made solely through automated processing , the act stipulates that data controllers must notify data subjects in writing . external [ uK 22 ] It also provides for a right of appeal against such decisions , under which a data subject can request that the decision be reconsidered or made anew without solely automated processing . Privacy International has argued that the act contains “ insufficient safeguards ” in relation to ADM. external [ uK 23 ] / Review of laws on automated vehicles In March 2018 , the government announced external [ uK 24 ] a review of driving laws “ to examine any legal obstacles to the widespread introduction of self-driving vehicles ” . The review will be conducted by the Law Commission of England and Wales external [ uK 25 ] and the Scottish Law Commission external [ uK 26 ] and is set to take three years . The Law Commissions are state-funded bodies charged with ensuring that the law in gen-eral is “ as fair , modern , simple and as cost-effective as possible ” . It can make recommenda-tions that are then considered by parliament . The commissions said they aim to publish consultation papers by the end of 2018 , which will seek to identify key issues to be investigated . The first year of the project will also include an audit of the current law . The review may lead to increased public debate around self-driving cars and the automated decisions they make . In particular , the Law Commissions say they will highlight decisions to be made around ethical issues . Assuming the commissions identify the need for new legisla-tion , this is likely to push ethical questions around self-driving cars into the political arena . oversi G h T mechanisms / Information Commissioner ’ s Office The Information Commissioner ’ s Office ( ICO ) is the UK ’ s data protection regulator , funded by the government and directly answerable to parliament . It oversees and enforces the proper use of personal data by the private and public sectors . The IC o website provides guidance for organisations on all aspects of data protection , including requirements deriving from the GDPR and Data Protection Act . Its pages on ADM explain the requirements of GDPR Article 22 and encourage businesses to go beyond this , by telling their customers about the use of ADM to make decisions that affect them . external [ uK 27 ] LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-societyexternal T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 139 Under the Data Protection Act 2018 , the ICO was given increased powers to issue fines to organisations that break the law . At the time of writing , the Information Commissioner ’ s Office was still working on updating its advice for data controllers to reflect the content of the DPA 2018 including new provisions relating to ADM. external [ uK 28 ] adm in ac T ion / facial recognition used by police forces The civil society organisation Big Brother Watch has researched the introduction of auto-matic facial recognition systems by police forces in the UK . external [ uK 29 ] These systems take images from CCTV cameras and scan the faces of passers-by to see if they appear on databases of individuals of interest to the police . In a typical application , when the system detects a match , police officers may apprehend the person for question-ing , search or arrest . Unless the match can be readily discounted , human police officers are likely to follow the decision and act on suspicions raised by the system . After raising concerns over its discriminatory potential , Big Brother Watch was granted limited access to observe the operation of the system at the Notting Hill Carnival 2017 . According to the NGO ’ s report , the police said that in the course of a day around 35 people had been falsely matched by the system . In these cases , officers took no action because in reviewing the images it was obvious that the wrong person had been identified . However , “ around five ” people—who later turned out to have been identified by the system in error—were apprehended and asked to prove their identity . Big Brother Watch reported that there was only one true positive match over the entire weekend—but even then there was a catch : “ The person stopped was no longer wanted for arrest , as the police ’ s data compiled for the event was outdated . ” In this case a civil society organisation has been able to draw attention to the flawed use of ADM . But the figures that support their case are not routinely published . It was only through concerted lobbying and tenacity that they were able to obtain them . This shows the important role that civil society organisations can play in ADM accountability . However , in the absence of a central public register of ADM , no one can say how many other systems are being implemented without oversight . / Personalised budgets for social care In the UK , people who need social care—practical support because of illness , disability or age—can approach their local town hall for help . T own halls in England have started using automated decision-making systems to help determine how much money should be spent on each person , depending on their individual needs . The resulting figure is known as a personal budget.page 140 Automating Society United Kingdom The impact of these decisions on people ’ s lives is enormous . There has been no discussion in the media about the specific role of ADM in personal budgets . But thi s BBC report from 2010 external [ uK 30 ] illustrates what is at stake : Graeme Ellis , who is registered blind and is a wheelchair user , has been on a personal budget for more than a year and was originally assessed as needing £21,000 . [ ... ] But then after being reassessed , he got an email from his social worker tell-ing him that his council would have to cut their contribution by £10,000.He told the BBC ’ s You and Yours programme he was frightened he was going to end back in the position he was in four years ago. “ I ’ m frightened about the effect that being housebound will have on my well-being because being able to get out of the house and do things is one of the things that enables me to carry on . ” Since 2007 , governments of both main political parties in the UK have encouraged town halls and the NHS to start using personal budgets . external [ uK31 ] By 2014-15 , around 500,000 people receiving social care through a town hall were subject to a personal budget . external [ uK32 ] It is not known exactly how many people have had their personal budgets decided with the help of ADM . However , one private company , Imosphere , provides systems to help decide personal budgets for many town halls and National Health Service ( NHS ) regions . external [ uK33 ] Its website says that around forty town halls ( local authorities ) and fifteen NHS areas ( Clini-cal Commissioning Groups , which also have the power to allocate personal budgets ) across England currently use the system , and that it has allocated personal budgets worth a total of over 5.5 bn . external [ uK34 ] What is the impact of the ADM ? Research in the Journal of Social Welfare & Family Law external [ uK34 ] found that automated personal budget decisions did not always correspond to people ’ s needs ; that they could be used as a mechanism for implementing spending cuts ; and that the algorithmic nature of the system led to a lack of transparency . The paper serves not only to illustrate how flawed ADM decisions can adversely impact people ’ s lives , but also how ADM systems might be scrutinised and what obstacles are sure to arise in other domains of ADM accountability research . In addition , it shows the importance of the social and political climate in which ADM systems are used . In this instance , it can be argued that an ADM system has served as a Trojan horse for spending cuts and the outsourcing of decision-making to the private sector . This might not have been so if the decision-making rules behind ADM were made transparent to the many charities and campaigning organisations that advocate for the rights of social care service users.LINKS : You can find a list of all URLs in the report compiled online at : www.algorithmwatch.org/ automating-society external T aking Stock of Automated Decision-Making in the EU page 141 / Procurement in the UK public sector For this report chapter , an analysis of procurement notices published in the Official Journal of the European Union ( o JEU ) was conducted.2 This provides a snapshot of some of the areas of the UK public sector where ADM is in use , planned to be introduced or under research and development .
