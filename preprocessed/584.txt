powerful tools data analysis prediction security like past waves extreme innovation one crests debate ethical usage privacy controls likely proliferate far intersection society brought unique set ethical challenges anticipated discussed many years others beginning come light example academics science fiction authors alike long pondered ethical implications machines recently seen problems start

autonomous vehicles wider array activities linked example road conditions make accident one human computer system could avoided flaw particular navigation system navigation systems technology involved driverless car highly complex making difficult test car mechanical parts know enough adequately quantify risks technology rolled global scale fatal crash lion air flight offers another instructive example crash appears caused mechanical sensor error leading airplane computer system forcing nose human pilots appear pulled nose back repeatedly losing fact incident involved computer making flawed

moreover would presumably better able quantify risk accident repeated mechanical failure case complex system examples like highlight ensuring systems built ways transparent enough enable adequate
