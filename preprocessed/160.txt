In this scenario , AI is relevant both as a technology that enables and facilitates financial services and an investment opportunity for the fi nancial industry . The implications of AI will be profound because the financial sector is a crucial ingredient of modern economies , and AI is becoming a general-purpose technology wi th rapid diffusion and market applications . This study investigates ( chapter 1 ) t o w h a t e x t e n t A I i s t r a n s f o r ming decision-making in financial markets and services , including credit markets , stock and money markets , derivatives and futures markets , insurance markets , foreign exchange markets , payment systems , and financial infrastructure markets . This study does not share the futuristic view of completely autonomous and AI-centric financial markets and services , at least any time soon . However , it is recognised that financial operations are ideal for the application of AI and automation . It is illustrated where this process is already in motion , who are the key players , and that AI is transf orming traditional financial activities , also helping new players to offer new financial services . It is explained why and to what extent ( chapter 2 ) the combination of AI and its market applications in the financial sector will be a source of efficiency and prosperity , as it happened with other generalpurpose technologies . It also discusses “ success storie s ” where AI shows its full potential . In particular , the study considers how AI can facilitate access to finance , fight agains t fraudulent financial transactions , customise financial services , and offer new opportunities and jobs in the financial sector . Overall , if properly adopted , AI can be a de mocratisation factor of the financial industry . At the same time , ( chapter 3 ) the several and new challenges emerging with the diffusion of AI in financial markets are identified and discussed . The ad option of AI should not be taken for granted as several factors may limit it . AI sy stems may end up unfairly discriminating in credit markets , for example , or coordinating with a risk of collusion . Explainability and privacy concerns are especially relevant for financial servic es applications of AI . AI brings signific ant changes in the financial sector that will transform the relationship bet ween financial institutions and their clients , the market structure of the industry , and that will displace some of the acti vities currently performed by humans . It will be necessary to learn to cohabitate with new and AI-r elated sources of instability of financial markets . The instinctive reaction to such a long list of comple x issues with AI applications in the financial sector could be that of restricting these applications to a per-se fragile environment such as the financial sector . The study explains ( chapter 4 ) that this atti tude is wrong provided that the issues are properly understood and well addressed . Since the financial se ctor is heavily regulated , and for good reasons , the study discusses how AI interacts with existing regulations and how AI-specific , “ horizontal ” regulations could impact the financial sector . The st udy provides specific re commendations that could put in place to fully harness the benefits of AI in the financial sectors while keeping its challenges under control . These recommendations pert ain to AI regulations and their impact on the financial sector , together with specific recommend ations for financial institutio ns adopting AI solutions and recommendations about managing ri sk in financial markets . Reco gnising that regulators will profoundly influence the adoption of AI in financ ial markets and its applications , the study proposes some recommendations to support the transformation offered by AI , avoiding stifling its innovations and applications for the financial sector . Finally , the study illustrates ( chapter 4 ) what incent ives one could put in place to facilitate safe AI applications for the financial sector and how financ ial markets can , in turn , support with investments the research and development of AI applications . So me interesting best practices are also discussed that could be adopted and further expanded . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 9 PE 662.912 OVERVIEW OF AI AND THE FINANCIAL SECTOR 1.1 . Background This study begins with two observations . First , the financial sector , the combination of financial markets and services , is a necessary building block of mode rn economies . A well-functioning and developed financial sector is vital for the growth and prosperity of modern ec onomies . It mobilises savings and funds towards the most valuing investments , all owing more and better future consumption and further investments . That is , the financial sector is a necessary ingredient for growth . Second , in the last decades , the digital transformation of economie s and societies has progressed very rapidly . This transformation is already occurring in many fields and our daily lives with op portunities and challenges . In this context , Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) is becomi ng a general-purpose technology with implications for virtually all sectors and their business models . The financial sector is not exempt from this process and relates with AI on two dimensions . This sector is experiencing some of the most developed and advanc ed applications of AI , and , at the same time , it provides the funding for developi ng further new AI applications . In this study , the intertwined relationship between AI and the financial sector will be discussed . The focus will be on the developments of AI and the financial sector from around 2010 onward , which is when the renewed interest in rese arch and investments in AI took off again , particularly with the successes in the sub-field of machine learning ( ML ) 1 . In the last ten years , three factors have primarily co ntributed to the renewed interest in AI . First , the significant reduction of the cost of computing and data storage ( espec ially with new possibilities in cloud computing as a service ) lead to a substantial increase in demand for these services . Second , the process of digitalisation has offe red large amounts of data ( Big data ) that , combined with AI generate valuable market applications . Finally , some successful applications of classification algorithms , such as with image recognition and , more recently , in Natu ral Language Processing ( NLP ) , have concretely shown tangible market value . Had AI remained in th e labs and in academia , it would not be the subject of discussion now . The concomitant advancement s in the research on AI and actual market applications are now fuelling the pres ent attention to AI , with a reinforci ng cycle that is investigated in this study . Instead of providing yet another defi nition of AI , it is better to begin this study by discussing the reinforcing cycle between AI and market applications2 . When more data become available for analysis with better tools , the cost of informa tion drops . Such cost reduction im plies a decrease in the price of predictions for decision-making , which means assessi ng the likelihood of future and uncertain events and predicting how to correctly classify , for exampl e , images and credit bo rrowers into different categories ( Agrawal et al. , 2018 ) . De cision-making thus becomes not on ly more precise ( that is , with reduced errors ) and faster , for example , when AI assist s doctors in diagnosing pathologies , but it is also transforming itself . With cheaper predictions , ne w possibilities emerge where decision-making is 1 Interest on AI has followed hype cycles over time , with severa l “ up and downs ” ( the winters of AI ) . See Wooldridge ( 2020 ) for an accessible and thorough description of the history of AI . 2 The European Commission has provided a definition in the rece nt proposal “ Artificial Intellige nce Act ” , EC ( 2021 ) , in Article 3 , “ ‘ artificial intelligence system ’ ( AI system ) means software that is developed wi th one or more of the techniques and approaches listed in A nnex I [ ( a ) Machine learning approaches ; ( b ) Logic-and knowledge-based approaches ; ( c ) Statistical approaches ] and can , for a given se t of human-defined objectives , generate outputs such as content , pr edictions , recommendations , or decisions influencing the environm ents they interact with ” . For a broad discussion about what is AI see Wooldridge ( 2020 ) . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 10 delegated to autonomous systems , such as self-drivi ng cars . Valuable market applications of AI attract investments and generate more data , eventually making AI predictions better and cheaper . This sequence of implications is making AI a genuinely transformative and general-purpose technology , and one can expect the consequences to be at least as profound as with other generalpurpose technologies in the past , su ch as the advent of electricity . AI profoundly affects and transforms decision-making in financial marke ts and services , including credit markets , stock , money and derivative markets , in surance markets , payment systems , and financial infrastructures . The process transfor ms the typical activities performe d in these markets and allows for a new range of financial services , inducing innovations on transactio ns , assets and improving access to financial markets and services . Financial markets and services are the ideal and natural field of application of AI and digitalisation . They are almost by definition immaterial , and all financial services , for example , providing credit to a client , executing a payment , providing insurance coverage , and investing in equity , ultimately rely on information processing . Consequent ly , financial markets have been using algorithms for decades and even before the recent developments of AI . Although various financial markets and services pe rform many diverse activities , they share two key elements : ( i ) the interactions between different and differently motivated players and ( ii ) the information that these players use in making their de cisions . In markets , in fact , “ we are never alone ” because transactions of any type necessarily involv e different sides , such as buyers and sellers . The second key element , information , is the most c rucial driver of financial transactions and risk management . Buyers and sellers are willing to perfor m opposite , apparently contradicting , buying and selling decisions because of differ ent needs and because they hold di fferent information . Information is also the critical ingredient of risk management , that is , the practice of mi tigating the consequences of the stochastic movement of prices and values of assets . For these reasons , the financial sector is now expe riencing a more profound transformation with the diffusion of commercial applications of AI than othe r sectors . Although financial markets and services are still and will remain dominated by humans in the foreseeable future , the diffu sion of AI is coming and fast , with many activities already performed by AI . A recent survey conducted for th e World Economic Forum ( 2020 ) has shown that a large majority of players in finance worldwide ( 85 % ) already use some form of AI and a large group ( 65 % ) expects to become an adopter of AI for mass financial operations3 . A joint survey of the Bank of England and Financial Conduct Authority ( FCA , 2019 ) shows that most financial firms are currently building the infrastructure to deploy large-scale AI , with 80 % already using AI in some form . Applications of AI in the financial sector are also ch anging the type of players populating these markets and their business models , such as with Financial intermediaries relying on digital technologies ( Fintech ) firms and Bigtech firms ( that is , large compan ies that rely on digital technologies in other nonfinancial markets ) 4 . Although the futuristic view of completely autonomo us and AI-centric financial markets and services seems irrealistic , it should be recognised that financial operations are ideal for applying AI and 3 Similar figures have been consistently identified in other rece nt surveys such as the one by the Bank of England on ML applic ations in UK financial markets ( Bank of England , 2019 ) . 4 In 2017 Amazon announced that its lend ing activities reached $ 3 billion in loans to small businesses since 2011 to help them grow their business . See Business Wire , https : //www.businesswire.com/news /home/20170608005415/en/Amazon-Loans-More-Than-3-Billion-toOver-20000-Small-Businesses . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 11 PE 662.912 automation . This process will displace some of the ac tivities performed by humans . However , it can be envisaged that human judgment and oversight will cont inue to play an essential role , certainly for the foreseeable future , in the financial sector . The type of AI that one observes in financial services in the following decades will be “ narrow-AI ” , which is appl ications to specific and well-defined environments . ( It will not be the “ strong-AI ” , which instead should acquire human abilities such as self-awareness and consciousness . ) The demand for huma n judgment will increase , if anyt hing , with the diffusion of AI applications in the financial sector . Regulators worldwide have already noticed that th e interaction between AI and the financial sector can have profound and important co nsequences , with opportunities and risks . For example , the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision published a report ( BCBS , 2018 ) encouraging banks to exploit AI as an efficiency-enhancing technology . In 2017 the Financ ial Stability Board ( FSB , 2017 ) identified several AI applications in the financial se ctor with benefits for individuals and SMEs . However , authorities have also pointed out that AI applicatio ns in the financial sector may also induce some specific risks , as discussed in the following pages . Finally , many financial markets and services are subj ect to regulation and intense supervision . These interventions are specifically designed to maintain market functioning confidence , grant stability , and protect users ( see box 1 ) . The advent of AI in the fina ncial sector will require more scrutiny , as illustrated in the following chapters , consider ing that some financial services are not subject to regulation , such as shadow banking ( see box 1 ) . As in other enviro nments , regulators will profoundly influence the a d o p t i o n o f A I i n f i n a n c i a l m a r k e t s . I t w i l l b e e ssential that lawmakers and regulators deploy their activities supporting and favouring the transformation offered by AI , avoiding stifling innovations and applications in the financial sector .

Key actors at the global level and EU positioning To identify the key countries that combine AI and th e financial sector , one should consider three facts . First , AI is still an innovative tec hnology in finance , which implies that funding AI applications is critical and not granted . Second , financial markets and servic es are already adopting AI solutions , but this is just one of the sectors interested in AI , and thus the presence in a country of a developed financial sector is important but not strictly necessary for the diffusion of AI . Third , th e presence of a solid and vibrant AI industry helps facilitate the adoption of the technology in general and in the financial sector . In terms of investments and number of start-ups on AI , the lion ’ s share in the last five years is with the United States ( US ) primarily , followed by China ( le ss than half of the investme nts in the US ) and at some considerable distance other countries such as Cana da , UK , Israel and few European countries such as France and Germany ( Arnold 2020 , Tech Nation 2020 report ) . The presence in a country of a very developed financ ial sector such as in the US , UK , and some European countries , is not a precondition fo r the diffusion of AI . For example , the dramatic development in China of non-traditional investment pl atforms ( crowdfunding an d crowd-investment platforms ) and digital payments relies more on a large population and complements a less developed banking sector . Also , the bank-centric financial sector of many European countries may impede to the extent that incumbent banks face legacy issues with the traditional technologies they current ly use , making the transition to innovations more expensive . On the other hand , financial sectors that produce vast investment The term “ financial sector ” , includes the markets , institutions , and services that pertain to finance activities , that is , the activities that involve the exchange of financial funds or assets . Specifically , financial markets are the organizations where th ese exchanges take place . They are organised with specific functioning rules ( such as the stock markets , in which case they are called “ exchanges ” ) , and they rely on market infrastruct ures . Financial assets are the different types of funds that are the object of exchan ge , such as credits , bonds , and stocks . Financial institutions are specialised and generally licensed intermediaries , such as banks and mutual funds , that act between and in some cases on behalf of trader s in financial markets . Financial services are explicitly or implicitly provided by financial instit utions to traders , such as matchmaking , maturity transformation , screening , and monitoring . The financial sector is subject to broad and enco mpassing regulation compared with most of the other sectors in an economy . Financial sector regula tion is destined to maintain confidence in the financial system , guarantee its stability and pr otect customers of complex and sophisticated services . The justification for financial regulation s is twofold . Financial markets are characterised by an endemic presence of asymmetric informatio n between players ( traders , and institutions in the financial sector ) that may si gnificantly limit its efficiency . The financial sector can produce strong externalities within itself ( due , for exam ple , to the interconnectedness between financial institutions ) and other sectors ( in case of financ ial market crashes ) . Some financial intermediaries offer lending , but are able to avoid the traditio nal financial regulations affecting banks because they do not fund themselves with standard depo sits . Also considering it s considerable dimension ( $ 50.9 trillion in 2018 , that is 13.6 % of total gl obal financial assets , FSB 2020 ) , these shadowbanking activities can be a source of systemic risk , as shown during the Great Financial Crisis that started in 2008 . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 13 PE 662.912 capacity of risk capital , such as venture and equity capital , like the US and the UK , are more apt to finance AI applications . In addition to risk capital , the other crucial enabling factor for the diffusion of AI is a skilled workforce . According to O ’ Meara ( 2019 ) , in 2018 , the US was le ading for numbers of researchers working in AI ( 28,000 ) over China ( 18,000 ) , United Kingdom ( UK ) ( 7,000 ) , Germany ( 9,000 ) , and for top AI researchers ( measured by the number of citations , 18 % of them located in the US , 5 % in China , 12 % in Germany , 15 % in the UK ) . The AI Index Report ( 2019 ) shows that the countries with the high est AI-related skills in the financial sector are the US and India , followed ( with significantly lower index values ) by France , Germany , UK , Canada , and China . It is also instructive to observe in which AI applicat ions the financial sector predominantly invests . The AI Index Report ( 2021 ) shows that the sectors receiving more inve stments for AI developments are autonomous vehicles ( 10 % ) , drugs ( 6.1 % ) , facial recognition ( 6 % ) , video content ( 4.5 % ) , and finance ( 4 % ) . The World Economic Forum Re port ( 2020 ) shows a stark differ ence between incumbent players and newcomers such as Fintech companies . Fintec h companies use AI to offer new products and services , while incumbents predominantly adopt AI to reduce costs and improve existing products .. As it is known and these data confir m , the European Union ( EU ) is curre ntly not in a leadership position in market applications of AI in general , and the financ ial sector is not an except ion . The causes of this condition are , unfortunately , many and concomitant . First , with few exceptions , the EU is lagging in terms of research on AI . Vibrant research environments are a crucial facilitating factor of AI spin-offs and early applications , such as finance . Second , the source of funding for innovations in the EU relies more on the banking sector and less so on risky capital such as venture and equity capital5 . Since AI applications are still at the early stage and involve significant risks , the bank-centric EU source of funding is not idea l to invest in AI applicat ions , in general , and for the financial sector . Third , the banking sector that dominates European financia l markets is less prone to adopting disrupting innovations such as AI . The exit of the UK from the EU is also problematic , as the UK has a vibrant financial centre and , at the same time , is one of the key players in AI research and applications . Finally , although statistics comparing AI applications in the financial sector across countries are scant , the combination of our previous observations shows that the critical national pl ayers also in this case are the US , China , and the UK . Furthermore , there seem to be no significant ch anges in these conditions . Hence , one can expect to see thes e players dominate AI applications in finance for the next decade unless specific events and new poli cies emerge in the meanwhile . 1.3 . Investments for developing AI High investments and a significan t risk of failure make the development of AI a complex task . According to the AI Index Report ( 2019 ) , in 2019 , glob al private investment in AI was over $ 70 billion , mostly in terms of startup invest ments ( $ 37 billion ) and Mergers and Acquisitions ( $ 34 billion ) . In 2010 , the figure for startups was just $ 1.3 billion with av erage annual growth of more than 40 % to have an idea of the trend . In 2019 ( Statista 2020 ) , the cumu lative funding worldwide of AI applications went mostly on ML ( 45 % ) , then to intelligent robots ( around 10 % ) and similarly to NLP , recommender systems , and less ( 3-5 % ) to speech and video recognition . 5 In 2017 , 50 % and 30 % of the global venture capital went respecti vely to the US and China , whilst Europe just received 8 % of i t ( OECD 2018 ) . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 14 The US has dominated the investment s in AI at least since 2000 , for the number of startups ( more than 3000 in 2000-2016 that is 37 % of the world total see Buchanan and Cao , 2018 ) and funding ( $ 20.7 billion , that is 70 % of world total ) . However , the leadership of the US has been challenged in the last 56 years by China that strongly increased both the number of startups , their funding , and the number of patents and research papers related to AI ( C B Insights , 2018 and Wushen Institute Report , 2017 ) . At a significant distance , there other countries such as the UK and Japan ( interestingly , these two countries were among the top funding countries in the expert system era ) , followed by France , Canada , Germany , Singapore , India , and Israel . In 2017 , European coun tries attracted about 8 % of venture capital in AI worldwide , while the US and China respectively accounted for around 50 % and 36 % ( OECD 2018 ) . Overall , in 2018 the US and China combined accounte d for 90 % of global investment in AI ( Statista , 2021 ) . Despite China ’ s improvements , the US is still domina ting with a robust financial sector that supports and funds AI market developments with venture capita l and private equity fundin g. In general , the US is still leading in terms of resear ch and development ( R & D ) spending in software and computer services spending three times more on R & D than China and the EU combined in 2019 . An interesting element in the US and China race for AI is that of cross- border deals on AI . In this case , since 2016 , the number of US-based startup deals ba cked with Chinese private equity has been 50 % higher than that of Chinese startups ba cked with US private equity capital . The EU ’ s venture and private equity funding are sign ificantly smaller than the US but less so recently ( in 2019 , it was just 22 % of the US funding ) than in the past ( 13 % in 2016 ) . However , the number of deals and Mergers and Acquisitions in AI in Europe is smaller than in the US , with an increasing gap . Funding for AI developments is not all private . Th ere are public funds as well that are significantly impacting the sector . For example , in 2020 , the US announced a plan of ( non-military ) public investments of more than 1 billion . Chinese local governments offer si gnificant financial incentives for AI innovations , and in 2017 the China State Council planned private and public investments and actions aiming at becoming AI world leader in 2030 . The ca se of European funds for AI will be extensively discussed in section 4.4 , but also in this dimension , the European funds for AI are significantly lower than those planned in the US and China . 1.4 . Applications of AI for the financial sector Since the trading object in the fi nancial sector is generally immate rial , AI 's actual and potential applications are numerous . Here these applications are illustrate d , referring to the most common services and activities of financial institutions . 1.4.1 . Applications of AI fo r financial services For financial services , AI is helpful in front-office activities that directly involve financial service customers ( e.g. , lending , investment management , and payment systems ) and back-office activities ( e.g. , capital optimisation , risk management , and market analysis ) . This distinction is helpful because it identifies two groups of activities , accounting for the revenue and the cost stream of financial institutions6 . Lending and credit risk prediction . Financial institutions typically have limited information about prospective borrowers and their riskiness , which ca n be a fundamental problem because asymmetric 6 For examples of companies and their actual market applications of AI in the financ ial sector , see the report of the World Eco nomic Forum ( 2018 ) . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 15 PE 662.912 information leads to market inefficiencies and ev en market breakdown . Fina ncial institutions have relied on credit scores typically based on borro wers ’ payment history to limit these problems . The advent of big data provides other sources of information , known as alternative data , such as social media , utility bills , telecom data , data from smartphone s , or past purchases , that can be factored into richer models to predict risk class . The heterogene ity of these new data sourc es requires new tools to extract information about prospective borrowers , such as ML . The combination of alternative data and better prediction tools allows for quicker lending decisions and better predictions of individual risks with more refined segmentation/cla ssification of potential borrowers7 . The effect on the market is that one can have better and more profitable credit conditions and more borr owers receiving credit . Individuals who would have been considered non-ba nkable borrowers for insufficient information and inaccurate risk predictions ( such as individuals wi th no payment history ) may now receive credit and become a source of profit8 . Credit risk prediction is also relevant in many other circumstances . For example , banks use it to internally assess the riskiness of their assets ( the la rge banks that use the Internal Rating Based method ) , and on this assessment , they have to comply with the capital adequacy ratio . Better prediction of portfolio riskiness allows banks to save on capital requirements and associated costs ( Aloso and Carbò , 2021 ) . Insurance . Financial institutions that provide insuranc e must identify the premia for different individuals and the level of risks . In this case , limi ted information is a problem and may induce insurance companies to ask such high premia that many indi viduals may remain unins ured . Combining ML with alternative data allows insura nce companies to obtain more precise risk assessment , better personalisation of insurance contracts , an d ultimately more a ccess to insurance . Payment systems . AI is already broadly adopted for proce ssing payments , helping to detect fraud , fight money laundering , and making the payment netwo rks more efficient , in fact , a mix of front-end and back-end activities . Fraudulent card payments have increased in the last ye ars up to 1.8 billion in the Single Euro Payments Area ( SEPA ) and $ 14 billion globally9 . It does not thus surprise then that financial institutions have started to implemen t AI solutions for automated and prompt fraud detection , with cost savings and better performances than human intervention . AI is also currently used to predict the amount of cash bank branches mu st hold to meet deposi tors ' needs at the lowest possible cost . Robo-advising and Virtual assistants . Robo-advisors are recommender systems ( see box 2 ) designed to assist private investors in interacting with financial markets . They provide personalised recommendations in portfolio ma nagement . Some banks and big in vestment funds currently adopt them . In 2018 the US market reached $ 540 billion of asse ts managed with robo-adv ising , and this figure will possibly grow by more than 20 % yearly ( Statista 2020 ) . Virtual assistants or chatbots help customers to interact and operate with their financial institutions smoothly , in some cases substituting human interact ion . Chatbots , in particular , are ML algorithms relying on NLP that provide financial service us ers with updated information , solicited but also 7 See Onay and Öztürk ( 2018 ) . Several papers have shown the supe riority of AI algorithms ( such as neural networks , support vect or machines , decision trees , random forest , ) for credit scoring with respect to logistic regression s traditionally used to this p urpose , see for example Königstorfer and Thalmann ( 2020 ) . It is important though to note that the superiority of AI algorithms tends to be spec ific to the environments and the data used . 8 Banks could also use AI and alternative data for more personalis ed offers of deposits , although in this case the issue of asy mmetric information is less relevant . 9 The ECB report referring to the situation in 2016 , see : https : //www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/cardfraud/ html/ecb.cardfraudre port201809.en.html . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 16 unsolicited . They are also a relevant source of addi tional data for AI systems , thanks to their direct interactions with customers . Clie nts could soon use a virtual assistant to bargain with the financial institutions and negotiate financial tr ansactions on the client ’ s behalf . As seen in Figure 1 , in 2019 already 50 % of European banks used AI for direct client interactions , and another third of them are preparing to do so . Box 2 : Recommender systems Source : Author ’ s own elaboration Figure 1 : AI and big data for custom er interactions by European banks Source : European Banking Authority ( EBA ) risk assessment questionnaire ( spring 2019 ) . Asset and risk management . An area where AI is becoming predom inant in financial services is asset management with applications such as identify ing assets to trade , portfolio optimisation , and automated trade execution . In 2018 according to Ba rclay Hedge 's Hedge Fund Sentiment Survey , more than 56 % of hedge funds used AI in investment deci sions with a yearly growth rate of more than 20 % Robo-advisors are a specific application of a c lass of algorithms in the AI toolbox called Recommender systems . These algorithms are prob ably less known than others , and it is worth dedicating a few words to their functioning . Recommender systems are algorithms designed to predict ratings of users for given items , products , or services . Typical applications are videos , songs , books , but also financial assets as with Robo-advisors . The idea is that companies have some information on how much some individuals appreciated certain items that they have consumed . They should predict how much other individuals , who have not consumed these items , would appreciate them based on this information . Based on these predictions , the recommender systems show a personalised subset of items to each individual to help the individuals ’ decisions . There are different approaches to address this pr ediction issue that are particularly effective in handling the enormous number of combinations of individuals and products , such as predicting the most preferred financial assets to invest ac ross hundreds of thousands of different types of assets for possibly millions of clients . These algorithms can dramatically simplify the sear ch and decisions of users/consumers who may not even be aware of the available options . Fo r this reason , they are also a potent tool for companies that can offer better services to thei r users and improve consumer retention . Since users rely on recommendations , there is a risk of manipulation of consumers ’ decisions . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 17 PE 662.912 in the previous three years10 . Others ( 25 % ) were using AI to automate trade execution , and some funds are now entirely managed with AI ( e.g. , Numerai , Ai diyia Holdings , and Taaffeite Capital Management ) . In 2018 , BlackRock , one of the largest asset manageme nt companies in the wor ld , announced an AI lab that could count on a managed portfolio of $ 6.3 tr illion . In some cases , the algorithms for these applications already factor in alternative data so urces such as satellite imagery and social media . AI also offers practical solutions fo r risk classification and conseque nt decisions for risk management . Automation here also plays an important role , like AI/ML tools combined wi th automated decisionmaking , allowing for a seamless process with feedback from the market and risk assessment . ML is also applied to internally assess traditional risk models us ed by financial institutions and identify extreme and unrealistic predictions ( model validation ) . Figure 2 reports the different applications of AI and big data for risk management by European banks . Figure 2 : Risk management with AI and big data of European banks Source : EBA risk assessment questionnaire ( spring 2019 ) . The advantage of AI comparing with traditional asset an d risk management techniques is the ability to feed data to the prediction algorithms that contin uously adapt and autonomously reassesses , with the possibility of integrating au tomated trading decisions . AI-related funds are today one of the sectors that hire most and the be st AI-trained workforce , probably more than the Bigtech firms . These financial firms are so eager for these skills that a severe limit to their developments in the future will be the lack of a skilled workforce . Algorithmic trading . Trading in structured financial markets has been among the first automated financial operations because these markets have wo rk with precise and pre-specified rules . Early applications mainly focussed on increasing the abilit y of trading algorithms to trade and interact with the markets at a very high frequency . Algorithms comp eted to place orders faster than their rivals to gain small arbitrage margins on su bstantial orders . This process and the availability of a large amount of well-structured data naturally invited this sector of financial markets to delve into AI . ML can now help to assess portfolio positions , predicting mark et prices and risk exposure . These new algorithms for trading can identify the best actions and autono mously adjust risky or unprofitable positions . Other applications . Other applications of important back-office activities of financial institutions can be successfully implemented or complemented with AI , with significant cost reductions . Financial institutions that trade in the organised market typi cally consider the market impact of their own ( large ) 10 See https : //www.barclayhedge.com/insider/maj ority-of-hedge-fund-pros-use-ai-machi ne-learning-in-investment-strategies . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 18 marked orders . To avoid the negative impact of th eir own trading decisions , financial institutions manage the timing of their orders . This market impa ct analysis can benefit a lot from AI complementing traditional models using additional sources of information . Banks are also using AI to optimise the geographical networks of branches . Financial inst itutions have duties in detecting fraudulent transactions and must perform anti-money laundering and combat the financing of terrorism , i.e. , Antimoney laundering and combat the financing of terrorism ( AML/CFT ) activities , on behalf of authorities . Trade venues ( i.e. , exchanges of tradable assets ) use AI to monitor their market infrastructure and speed up transactions . Figure 3 shows the use of AI in ot her back-office applications by European banks . Figure 3 : Back-office applications of AI and big data of European banks Source : EBA risk assessment questionnaire ( spring 2019 ) . 1.5 . Evolution of algorithms for len ding markets and financial flows AI has had many phases with ups and downs and di fferent types of algorithms and applications . The first significant market applications started in the eighties and relied on Ex pert systems . These tools were practical and widely adopted . One of the early an d successful applications was an expert system for automated credit authorisation implement by the re tailer Marks & Spencer in the UK . This retailer in 1991 automatically handled 90 % of credit authorisatio ns and controls with the expert system named Behavioural Scoring . Expert systems replicated what wou ld have been complex processing and decision-making by humans , based on a possibly very detailed knowledge base . The type of data they used was mainly sector-specific . In the case of cred it authorisation , in particular , they used data concerning personal demographics , problems with payments , and the flow of payments in the account . Expert systems were also used for investment decisions , retirement planning , and companies trading securities in financial markets frequently used these systems in the US and Japan . However , for the most complex operations like automated port folio management , they remained prototypical . With these early automated decision-making applicatio ns , the first cases of induced market instability appeared , such as a sudden reduction of the Dow Jo nes index in 1987 attributed to algorithms . Then the second winter of AI came in the nighties for a pplications in the financi al sector too . These early approaches and their applications to finance remained limited and did not deliver as expected . In many cases , these applications were also abandoned beca use Expert systems were expensive to set up and maintain . The new developments witnessed since th e last decade are the consequence of the factors discussed in section 1.1 , namely reduced costs of c alculations and data storage , the availability of significant and different data so urces , and new types of algorith ms . The critical technological advancement for the new wave of applications is the autonomous lear ning component of the algorithms , as contrasted with the hard coded knowledge base of Expert systems . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 19 PE 662.912 The financial sector has some characte ristics that make the advent of modern AI developments exciting and compelling . The first is the availability of a va st amount of good-quality data as compared with other sectors . Second , many of the markets in the financial sector have prespecified rules and are nowadays significantly automatised . Third , the enormous value at st ake in the financial sector makes even the tiniest efficiency improvement extremel y valuable and profitable . Digitalisation , market organisation , and the large financial values have produced an environm ent that fits very well with the adoption of algorithms in general an d with AI solutions more recently . As seen , AI applications in the financial sector vary substantially , and as a co nsequence , also the types of algorithms used . In some cases , the speed of processing and automation of decision-making is essential , such as trading in organised financial marke ts . In other cases , the ability to embed alternative data sources is important , such as using an algorithm in use at least from 2015 for lending decisions where the ultimate steps may remain in human ha nds . Since at least 2017 , NLP is the standard approach for a virtual assistant for interacting with clients , shifting the balance from human relationships - a traditional banking model - to robot- client interactions . Since many of the data sources in financial service applications contain personal information , edge computing ( also termed federated computing ) is now seen as an a pproach to preserve privacy to se nsible data . Recommender systems are in use for financial advising since at least 2016 . 1.6 . The AI tech added-value : expe rts vs. learning algorithms The limitations of Expert systems in applications for financial oper ations should not be a surprise . Finance is an activity where building a knowledge base is particularly difficult . The population of individuals is vast and diverse , and the different applications vary considerably , so that the maintenance of Expert systems resu lted being very expensive . The complex coding needed with rulebased Expert systems was particularly complicated . What is more , the value of directly learning from the data , as in modern ML libraries , is substantial for financial services , and this explains the enthusiasm t h a t w e l c o m e d t h e l a s t w a v e o f A I i n f i n a n c i a l markets . Another desirable feature of ML for fina ncial markets is identifying unknown patterns and relations in environments where solid models and theo ries are not available , wh ich is often the case in financial markets . In these cases , unsupervised le arning approaches such as Reinforcement Learning are also effective for exploring an d experimenting , collecting the following data , and autonomously identifying the best trading strategy . In specific applications , such as predicting the pric e of financial assets , the flexibility of ML is an enabling factor . Financial time series are highly non- linear and noisy . Rather than using linear models , as in some traditional regression analyses , ML te chniques such as deep learning models allow capturing the non-linear relationship between cruc ial variables with little prior knowledge from the data . As discussed next , this does not come without drawbacks , such as overfitting and the inability to identify fundamental structural brea ks of the underlying economic conditions . Another advantage of modern AI for financial markets compared to previous “ hard-coded ” approaches like Expert systems is integrating with alternative data sources . There are already applications that factor-in textual information , such as financial news and report s and social networks ( Chan and Chong , 2017 ) . AI systems used to predict prices of assets now of ten involve ( at least ) two modules . For example , one module or a random forest is trained on past data about related assets and then predicts asset price changes . This is often dubbed the market-model mo dule . Then the predictions are passed to the trading module that implements the trading decisi ons based on the realisation of certain observed conditions . This is a common appr oach that has some limitations , however . The predictions transform into decisions that do not necessarily reflect the obje ctive or current constraints ( e.g. , liquidity ) of the IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 20 trading entity . This approach can be improved using Reinforcement Learning , in which case the algorithm merges the learning of the model and the im plementation of the decisions . This approach is also practical as it requires explicitly specifying the objective and the constraints of the trading entity11 . 11 For recent applications of Reinforcement Learni ng in financial markets see Carta et al . ( 2021 ) . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 21 PE 662.912 OPPORTUNITIES FOR AI AND APPLICATIONS TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR This chapter discusses the advantage s and benefits of the applications discussed in chapter 1 . Some “ success stories ” will be illustrated where AI shows it s full potential . The next chapter instead considers the possible issues of these applications . 2.1 . Efficiency for financial markets AI applied to trading in organised financial markets ( e.g. , securities , derivatives , and commodities ) has been one of the first comers in finance . The potent ial gains in terms of efficiency are significant and given a large amount of wealth traded in these markets , even the tiniest increase of earned margin can have a considerable impact on profitability . Thus , it is no surprise that these sectors are hiring intensively and the best AI experts , apparently more than Bigtech comp anies . And the windfall of AI is not only on the profitability of adopters , as more ef ficient financial markets transform into real growth . AI applications for organi sed financial markets also have other sources of efficiencies . Compared to humans , AI algorithms do not experience fatigue , do not make computational errors , and are not subject to the multitude of human bi ases ( Keynes ’ “ animal spirits ” ) th at have been documented in the behavioural finance literature . AI algorithms are faster and can rely on many and alternative sources of data at the same time . Other efficiency gains also emerge with autonomous AI algorithms freeing humans from repetitive tasks , giving them the possib ility to focus on higher-l evel tasks to develop the financial sector . The margin of increase is vast as “ quant funds ” ( that is , funds that rely on algorithms for predictions and trading ) still manage a tiny fraction , slightly ab ove 1 % , of the global equity market ( $ 72 trillion in 2019 , see Shepherd , 2019 ) . It has been estimated ( S tatista and PwC 2020 ) that this increase in productivity in the financial sector could account for up to 10 % in terms of GDP in the next decade , although these are speculative estimates ( see , for example , Beck et al . 2000 ) . In terms of performance , there is some ( early ) evid ence that in recent years AI-managed hedge funds outperformed traditional funds by a significant marg in , also considering risk-adjusted performance . A recent report ( Cerulli , 2020 ) has shown that in 2016- 2019 the return of hedge funds in Europe that were relying on AI was significantly higher than with tr aditional funds . There is also increasing academic literature that compares AI algorithms with traditi onal models to predict asset prices . For example , Chowdhury ( 2020 ) shows that “ ensemble learning ” AI algorithms based on multiple approaches outperform the traditional Black-Scholes method . Currently , it is too early to assess the ability of AI algorithms for trading to make accurate predictions when an unexpected crisis realise s , such that the one induced by the Covid-19 pandemic . However , some commentators ( Cerulli , 2020 ) claim that AI ca n improve predictions in this event compared to traditional and human-based approaches . If confir med , this could be the consequences of two ingredients of AI trading algorithms . First , they dynamically update their prediction modules to current events and continuously adapt to changing market co nditions . Second , they rely not just on financial market data but also on alternative data sources . Some hedge funds actively use information from news articles and social media , and these alternati ve sources of data could have been effective in responding faster to an unforeseen and rare crisis like the Covid-19 pandemic . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 22 2.2 . Access to finance Individuals and firms relatively less known to financ ial institutions and markets have difficulty accessing financial services , causing inefficienci es and is a source of inequality . When only limited information is available on prospective borrower s , financial institutions can not identify worthwhile projects ( e.g . innovation with an Small and medium-sized enterprise or education with a household ) . Pooling several less-known projec ts together , good and bad projects , they can only offer average and unfavourable condit ions . These conditions turn out to be particularly adverse for those who have good projects , which may then prefer to exit the financial market altogether , leaving only the bad projects . The Nobel prize George Aker lof proposed this vicious cycle to explain market failure due to lack of information in a famous paper in 1970 ( Akerlof , 1970 ) . Although the problem of “ asymmetric information ” is not sp ecific to the financial sector ( Akerlof ’ s example was about the second-hand cars market ) , its consequences are dr amatic when applied to finance . Not financed valuable projects mean wasted opportunities for individuals , firms and loss of growth . According to the World Bank ( 2017 ) , 1.7 billion adults ( that is roughly one-th ird of the entire world population ) were “ unbanked ” in 2016 and could not access even the minimal and essential bank services . Specifically , when consid ering the credit market , with traditional credit scoring rules , a potential borrower must have a sufficient amount of historical credit information so that a solid score can be calculated ( in this case , the borrower is called “ scorable ” ) . When a score is not available , a potential creditworthy borrower is often excluded from the credit , which perpetuates the “ unscorability ” of the individual and hi nders access to credit for the future . Improving access to financial services is one of the most significant contributi ons one can expect from AI for the financial sector . AI has enormous potential in addressing this issue because it allows us to better extract information and from multiple sources of data . Some Fintech firms have started to leverage AI precisely to this end and can now target customers that traditional financial institutions , such as banks , would not serve because of lack of information . The advantage of AI applied to financial services ac cess is even more evident in economies , like less developed countries , where the financial sector is st ill incomplete . In these countries , many potential users who had no access to financial services , thus ha ving “ thin ” financial history , are likely to remain excluded . For example , in China , an enormous market for credit , ma ny borrowers do not have credit scores but are now served thanks to Fintech . Fuster et al . ( 2021 ) show how ML can affect credit using a large dataset of 10 million mortgage loans issued between 2009 and 2013 in the US . The authors compare the predictions based on traditional statistical methods used for credit assessment ( e.g. , standard Logit models ) wi th those that could be obtained with ML , such as Random forest . Thes e authors observe that when deciding about a borrower ’ s creditworthiness , ML be nefits more those groups of individuals that are typically disadvantaged , thus granting more access to credit . Gambacorta et al . ( 2019 ) study how AI can improve in estimating the probability of default on credit by a Fintech company in China , also using traditional an d non-traditional variables . They also show that the more information is fed into the algorithms via a longer relationship with the credit institution , the better is the advantage of AI systems . The possibility of leveraging alternative data sourc es , such as emails , purchase activity , and social media , is a significant advantage of AI algorithms . It can give sufficient information to “ kick start ” a Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 23 PE 662.912 creditor ’ s history and give access to financial services . In computer science , this is often referred to as the “ cold start ” issue : when there is little or no information , predictions are imprecise or impossible12 . Overall , AI can be a democratising tool for accessing financial servic es for individuals and firms that would have been otherwise excluded . 2.3 . Fight against fraudulent and illegal exchanges Fighting fraudulent financial transactions takes a considerable amount of re sources in the financial sector and induces signific ant inefficiencies . Just considering cred it card transactions on cards issued in the European payment system , the European Central Bank ( ECB ) ( 2020 ) shows that in 2018 the value of fraudulent transactions amount ed to €1.80 billion in 2018 . Financial institutions are responsible for monitoring and reporting illegal transactions , such as money laundering and financing terrorism . The FCA in UK reports that UK banks spen d £5 billion yearly to address financial crime , and the figure rockets to $ 70 billion for compliance expenditures by US banks ( Buchanan , 2019 ) . The World Economic Forum ( 2018 ) survey in 2014-2016 shows that most financial in stitutions reported incr eased costs in fighting fraudulent and illegal activities an d an increase of 246 % in global credit card fraud loss from 2012 2017 . Failing to meet financial crime requirements , US financial institutions were fined $ 12 billion in 2009 2015 . The advantages of AI in fraud detection are twofold . First , AI tools , in this case in particular ML classifiers , can quickly detect suspicious transactions . This abilit y relies on real-time analysis of vast amounts of transaction data , millions of transactions in fact , in a short time frame . Fast processing is fundamental as transactions require real-time approval , especi ally with cards and POS . Second , the quality of predictions obtained with ML allows to better control the two typical errors in identifying fraudulent financial transactions : false negatives and false-positive cases . In the former cases , the problem is that the system wrongly classifies a frau dulent transaction as non-fraudulent . In the latter , instead , a nonfraudulent transaction is classified as fraudulent and then wrongfully denied . Both types of errors are costly for the banks and the clients . The less obvious false negative is responsible for $ 118 billion losses in retail worldwide in 2015 for wrongly declined transactions ( Javelin , 2015 ) . Thanks to the large amount of historical data , credit card transaction monitoring with AI tools is already quite common and successful in detecting fraud . ML in stead allows speed-up the process , performing it in real-time with self-adjusting rules that auto matically adapt to new data an d identify hidden correlations . Anti-money laundering has proven more challenging to apply AI due to the relatively limited amount of data to train ML algorithms so that many financ ial institutions still rely on traditional methods . However , recent academic research ( Zhang and Turbey , 2017 ) has recently shown some successful applications of AI algorithms ( in particular Artifi cial neural networks ( ANN ) , support vector machines , and random forests ) that outperform classical logist ic regression models , at least when training data contains a relatively high frequency of illegal activities . Interestingly , ML helps predict fraud by managers , such as stock market manipulations ( Hoberg and Lewis 2017 and Cecchini et al . 2010 ) . Overall , AI can significantly improve financial market integrity and strengthen trust , a vital ingredient of the financial sector . 12 Interestingly the flow of information can be two ways , between fi nancial institutions and players in other sectors . For example , Barclays and Amazon have setup a partnership with the intention to merge data in order to have better tools to predict decisions for cre dit approval and consumers ’ needs . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 24 2.4 . Customised services Customisation and personalisation of financial services , as in any other activity , creates value for clients , individuals , and corporations , and financial interm ediaries as well . However , until recently , the personalisation of financial services has been an opti on only for clients with la rge portfolios and wealth . The reason for this is straightforward from an ec onomic viewpoint . Personalising financial services implies relatively high fixed costs associated with the necessity to learn abou t customers ’ preferences , their actual conditions , and needs . These fixed costs prevented the poss ibility to offer customisation of financial services at large , thus excluding SMEs , individuals , and households with relatively small savings . AI is about to change all this as some of the AI tools , particularly ML and Recommender systems , are very effective in identifying individual preference s and contingent needs . With AI , the fixed cost for predictions moves from an individual client-level to the fixed cost of developing the AI systems that are then used for predictions on ma ny clients . The possibility of shar ing the fixed costs of developing AI systems over many clients opens up an unprec edented opportunity to offer customised financial services that were in precedence reserved to the wealthiest . A notable example is Robo-advisin g for asset management . Financial advising performed by humans is a time-consuming and labour-intensive activity . Asset management , in particular , involves asset allocation identifying the target assets , cost-e ffective implementation , regular rebalancing the portfolio , “ behavioural coaching ” ( e.g. , advising to avoid emotion-driven decisions ) , and tax planning . These activities can be addressed with AI tools , combining ML and Recommender systems . Some of the currently most successful Robo -advising platforms offer their services with €0 account minimum balance , meaning that they are accessible to any in dividual , and some of them have their base service offered for free ( earning some fees on more advanced services ) . Another potential advantage of Ro bo-advising compared to human a sset management is the fiduciary relationships between the investor and the advisor . Cases of asset managers ’ misconduct abound , such as financial advisors appropriatin g clients ’ funds or steering invest ments towards those granting the advisors with higher commissions an d unauthorised trading decisions . In principle , a Robo-advisor may be immune from this type of conduct . As discusse d in the next chapter , Robo-advising is not free of risks either , but what matters here is the comparison with humans . The entire industry of asset management can thus benefit from Robo-advising , building , and in some cases restoring trust with clients . 2.5 . Fintech developments and market structure The Financial Stability Board ( FSB ) defines Fintech as “ technologically enabled financial innovation that could result in new business models , applications , processe s or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services ” 13 . Fintech players have been expanding in recent years in payments , lending , asset management , and insurance . The current success of Fintech is due to its ability to exploit AI technology and Bigdata , redu cing fixed costs , search and matching costs , and increasing the quality of their predictions . It is currently unclear which trajectory Fintech pl ayers are taking and their impact on the financial industry in the long run ( see Barba Navaretti et al . 2017 ) . For the present report , it is instructive to observe that Fintech companies currently use a pure-i ntermediation activity , leaving most of the risks 13 See https : //www.fsb.org/work-of-the-fsb/financial- innovation-and-structural-change/fintech/ . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 25 PE 662.912 with the trading parties . For example , in the case of lending , Fintech often us es the “ agency ” model ( or broker model ) , according to which they only pe rform the matching between borrowers and lenders , receiving a commission , but take no risk for the loans that they originate . All risks then remain with the investors and not with the Fintech . Another notable development that Fintech players ar e actively pursuing with their technologies is dealing with “ soft information ” . Typi cally , financial intermediation reli es on two types of information . “ Hard information ” , e.g. , clients ’ payments , transactions , and assets , is codifiable and easily digitalised . This type of information can be seamlessly shared ac ross departments within fi nancial institutions and analysed . However , financial intermediation relies o n “ s o f t i n f o r m a t i o n ” t h a t c a n n o t b e e a s i l y digitalised and is yet very important . For example , a bank branch manager typically would be able to assess the creditworthiness of a client owner of a local SME . Based on ex perience and personal interactions , the bank ’ s manager ca n subjectively assess that the SME ’ s owner is a “ good entrepreneur ” and should then have access to credit . This type of soft information is th e basis of ” relationship banking ” . It is not codifiable and less so transferra ble in its entirety . Some Fintech firms are developing NLP tools that rely on alternative datasets to transform soft inform ation into hard information . The effect on the cost structure of fi nancial intermediation of this tr ansformation can be significant , reducing the fixed costs of personal interactio ns between the intermediary and their clients . The lean approach for financial intermediation of Fintech , together with the mentioned reduction of fixed costs , are the two ke y factors facilitating Fintech developmen t in the financial sector . This process is valuable not only for the new o pportunities that will offer to client s and the efficiency gains but also for the change in market structure that it may induce . Philippon ( 2016 ) has convincingly illustrated that the financial sector has remained expensive for its clients , with fees that , adjusting for quality of services , remained surprisingly unchanged over the last century both in the US and Europe . The heavy regulation of the sector has undoubtedly contributed to freezing the financial sector 's market structure with very few new players and unchanged competition . Fintech could be instead a critical novelty that can make the financial sectors more efficient and more competitive . With this respect , it is instructive to see that most traditional banks , with few exceptio ns , have been relatively very slow in adopting AI . One could say that at the moment , these traditiona l players have been forced into AI , more as a necessity to cope with the arrival of entrants , th an willingly embracing the technological innovations offered by AI . The arrival of Fintech and the associated pressure on all the financial sector is a unique opportunity to move the sector to a more efficient and competitive status with possible substantial benefits for its clients . 2.6 . Regulatory compliance Financial institutions are subject to many regulations with high co mpliance costs . Financial sector regulations include rules aiming to protect consumers from fraud , discrimination , and abuse , reducing the risk of failure of single institutions and pr omoting the financial system 's stability ( see Box 1 ) . For example , one could consider the set of standards identified by th e Basel accords as a simple ( yet imperfect ) measure of the intensity and extent of regulation in the banking sector . These rules went from the 60 pages of Basel I in 1988 to the 616 pages of Basel III in 2010 . Härle et al . ( 2010 ) calculate that to comply with Basel III , a me dium-sized bank would need from 100 to 200 more workers . Dahl et al . ( 2016 ) show that regulatory compliance accounts for 8 % of all ( non-interes t ) costs for small-sized banks and 3 % for medium banks . These are billions of euros . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 26 Although some regulation of the financial sector is necessary , the regulatory burden on financial institutions is heavy , both in te rms of systematic asse ssment of own activities and fines incurred for non-compliance . The highest regulatory costs on the side of institutions ar e operating costs , costs incurred to comply with the regulations , and opport unity costs [ European Syst emic Risk Board ( ESRB ) , 2019 ] . The most relevant operating cost is skilled staff trained explicitly to review procedures and applications to the regulators . On the side of authorities , there are substantial costs too in supervising financial institutions to assess to what extent they comply with the regulations . Opportunity costs are instead the costs of business opport unities that are foregone because of the regulations . Regulations may make certain activities comparatively more expe nsive for the financial inst itutions , preferring to avoid them and move to less expensive but possibly less valuable ones . These regulatory costs may also affect the market structure of the financial sect or . For example , shadow banks ( and , to some extent , Fintech companies ) can profitably operate in certain ac tivities ( e.g. , peer-to-peer lending ) because they are not subject to the same re gulatory burden on these acti vities as traditional banks . Regulators and supervisors of financial institutions are generally aware of the regulatory burden and avoid overburdening with regulations . AI and automati on offer novel possibilities for regulators to put financial institutions in the conditio ns to comply with financial regulati ons at a lower cost . Interestingly , AI can significantly help this , with developments in regulation and supervision , named Regulatory Technology ( Regtech ) and Supervisory Technology ( Suptech ) ( Ehrentraud , 2020 ) , and that involve the use of innovative technology , notably AI and big data analytics . With Regtech , regulators can frame and implement re gulations so that complian ce on the side of the financial institutions can be standardised and auto mated and , similarly , for supervisors who can then automate the verification of compliance . A simple yet effective example is the standardisation of information collection into prespecified templates th at financial institutions can populate over time with automated routines and that supervisors could access through pr operly designed API interfaces . The FCA in the UK explores the possibility of mach ine-readable regulatory handbooks that could allow financial institutions to interpret and exec ute regulations ( Citi , 2018 ) automatically . With Suptech , authorities can effectively perform supervision , for example , using ML to detect anomalous patterns in market outcomes that may signal misconduct and excessive risks . AI offers the possibility to design ” screening algorithms ” that systematically an d continuously monitor financial markets identifying risks and manipulations , with a better balance between false positive and false negative than humans . The Netherlands Bank , for ex ample , uses automated analysis of orders and executions of banks to identify funds transferred to the same recipients via different routes in high-risk jurisdictions . The ECB has set up a Suptech Hu b connecting many stakeholders and national supervisors and developing an NLP project for un structured information analysis . The Division of Economic and Risk Analysis of the SEC in the US and the Monetary Authority of Singapore study ML “ screens ” to detect misconduct and frauds in stock markets14 . In these applications , a two-stage approach is often adopted . With a fi rst activity regularly taking place , unsupervised AI algorithms scan markets looking for general patterns . Once anomal ous patterns are flagged out , supervised ML algorithms step in to predict actual risks . 2.7 . New opportunities and jobs The question about the impact of AI in labour markets has ancient roots . It goes back to the old debate of the possibility to substitute human labour with machines ( possibl y beginning with Plato ’ s Phaedrus , ca . 370 BC , where it was claimed that writing would have displaced human memory ) . It is undoubtedly 14 For other examples of Regtech and Suptech applications see Ehrent raud et al . ( 2020 ) . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 27 PE 662.912 the case that automation can and will substitute hu man labour in certain activities , and this will also happen for the automation associated with AI . This substitution process will be dramatic for the displaced workers and must thus be managed with suitable policies . For example , Grennan and Michaeli ( 2020 ) study the effect of AI on the financial labour market , in particular on sell-side equity analysts , a job increasingly taken over by AI . They show the following : AI intensity used in the analysts ’ company negatively correlates with analysts ’ employme nt , analysts are more likely to drop the analysis of stocks with high AI intensity , th e best analysts either move to stoc ks less covered by AI or leave the profession . At the same time , AI will demand new jobs and create job va cancies at a rate that currently AI education may not be able to fill . The financial sector , in particular , is labour-intensiv e , and the impact of AI on its labour force can be strong but difficult to predict . On the one hand , AI and automation will substitute the typically repetitive and time-consuming tasks in financial se rvices , such as screening and monitoring customers and their accounts , complying with regulations , asse ssing markets , and performing transactions . Also , very labour-intensive activities , such as those as sociated with “ relationship banking ” and soft information , will be soon performed by AI . For exam ple , GIS-Liquid Strategies and asset management company was managing assets worth $ 13 billion with just twelve employees in 2016 ; the financial market analysis company Kensho , established in 2013 and then acquired by Standard & Poor ’ s , was founded with the precise intention of completely substituting human analysts ( Buchanan 2019 ) . On the other hand , AI is already creating new services and new companies and attracting new customers , and all these new activities are expected to create new jobs . The overall and net effect of AI on jobs in the fi nancial sector is currently unclear , and estimates are speculative at the moment . Although in our opinion , the most likely sc enario for the next 5-10 years is an approximately zero net effect15 , it is important to emphasise ag ain that a significant number of workers will be displaced from the financial se ctor , and appropriate policies are in order . 15 Buchanan ( 2019 ) reports estimates for the financial sector wi th 230,000 job reduction worldwide by 2025 , especially in asset management . However , these estimates apparently do not to accoun t for job creation and seems thus significantly biased . The rep ort on AI by Statista 2019 indicates a plau sible close to zero net effect on labour force in financial services . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 28 CHALLENGES As already evident in some of the cases analysed in chapter 2 , AI will in evitably bring significant challenges for the financial sector in parallel with benefits . When an AI algorithm goes from the status of academic research to market applications , new i ssues emerge that were absent in the abstract research environment . Two factors tend to make thes e issues possibly more challenging . First , some of the issues are novel because AI technology and its applications are relatively new . Second , solutions generally require a combination of AI-speci fic skills and sector-specific ones . 3.1 . Adoption hurdles The fact that AI is already available as a technolo gy for the financial sector does not imply that effectively adopting AI for market applications is simple . The survey of the World Economic Forum ( 2020 ) clearly shows that two main problems stand in-between AI and market application , according to the majority ( 80 % ) of interviewe d. The first is the lack of adequate data , both in terms of quality and amount . The second is the lack of AI-related skil ls for fast-growing labou r demand . Other potential issues such as cost of hardware/software , market uncertainty , and ( at least for the moment ) the regulatory burden seem less relevant . The performance of AI applications in finance , in pa rticular , relies on data that in the financial sector tend to be more available than in others . However , as seen , the full potential of many AI applications also relies on the combination with alternative data sources that remain relatively scarce and not well integrated with standard financial data . Then we know that the pr oper choice of the algorithm is essential , and here the diversity of financial applic ations and tasks require a thorough screening of the best options ( Onay and Öztürk , 2018 ) . Finally , the skills of the staff wor king on the AI systems and their familiarity with the financial applications are dete rminant ( Aziz and Dowling , 2019 ) . The scarcity of AIrelated skills is a global phenomenon , but the situation in Europe is worse than in other countries , both for training and in retaining young people with AI skills . Bruegel ( 2020 ) shows that Europe lags in terms of the number of AI-related bachelor 's and post graduate degrees , and the gap with the US has increased . Overall , combining rich data with good algorithms an d staff turns out to be complex , and the risk of falling short of expectations is significant . Another hurdle comes with the di fficulty that traditional financial businesses have in adopting AI approaches and integrate or substi tute them with pre-existing solutions . Even if the changes seem relatively limited and confined to the algorithm to use , such as moving to ML algorithms for credit card fraud detection , the new process may require diffe rent skills and signif icant re-organisations.16 When AI also implies the automation of tasks and substi tution of the human workforce , the resistance to transformation can be so strong that either traditional financial institutions fail to adopt AI or adopt it with external acquisitions . This is one explanation of the many Merg ers and Acquisitions of small AIfocussed startups observed in the last 5-10 years by traditional financial institut ions such as banks and hedge funds . Finally , although specific regulations of AI applicatio ns are rare at the moment , financial institutions must already ensure that their AI systems comp ly with the many sector-specific regulations , as discussed in the following sections . For this purpose , a financial institution that decides to adopt an AI system must monitor it , grant some minimal transp arency and documentation of the system 's activity , 16 For the difficulties with this speci fic case see Butaru et al . ( 2016 ) . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 29 PE 662.912 w h i c h m a y b e d i f f i c u l t i n t h e c a s e o f A I . T h i s h u r d l e w i l l m o s t l i k e l y i n c r e a s e w i t h t h e a d v e n t o f horizontal regulations of AI . 3.2 . Unfairness and discrimination ML algorithms based on specific datasets may lead to decisions that can be considered unfair and discriminatory . In financial markets , this has been shown , for example , with lending decisions . Applying AI tools to the US mortgage market , Fuster et al . ( 2018 ) have shown unequal treatment across different groups of potential borrowers . AI-powered algorith ms predicted a higher probability of default for minority racial groups than more traditional logistic models . In the case of pricing , this prediction would imply charging higher interest rates to these ca tegories . Furthermore , this result occurs with AI algorithms that strictly comply with anti-discriminat ion laws and do not use se nsitive variables such as gender , ethnicity , or religion of the borrowers . Th e AI algorithms were de facto able , using non-linear combinations of other variables such as income , cr edit scores , and loan-to-value ratios to recover the information that a given borrower belonged to one of these protected minorities . The careful reader has indeed noted that these au thors were already discussed in section 2.4 . On that occasion , it has been emphasised that the AI syst ems increased these minority groups ' probability of access to mortgages . This is a clear example of th e complicated trade-off associated with AI systems in financial applications . The AI system offers more access to some financial se rvices than traditional approaches but at discriminatory co nditions . The policy assessment of this outcome is not trivial , as further discussed below . Unfair decisions can also emerge because they ar e already contained in the dataset that the AI algorithms used for training . This po ssibility is even more relevant when considering that AI in financial applications often factor in non-fi nancial information from alternativ e datasets . For example , in peerto-peer Fintech credit platforms , a higher probabil ity of credit is granted when some unverifiable information is made available on the platform , such as a photo of the loan seeker ( Duarte et al. , 2012 ) or specific friendships ( Lin et al . 2013 ) . However , the market has not remained inactive with these discriminatory and unfair outcomes . For example , Ze st Finance , one of the top startups embracing AI for financial markets , has developed a tool that helps borrowers identify and exclude from their credit applications signals that concur with biased credit decisions . 3.3 . Market interactions of AI systems When discussing AI systems , one tends to neglect th at these systems need to interact with humans , a possibly tricky partnership , but they typically in teract with each other . Interactions between autonomous machines are currently the subject of one of the most recent research fields on AI , multiagent systems . If dealing with an autonomous AI system is complicated , having many of them interacting and learning is more so , with possibly un expected outcomes . This is even more relevant for the financial sector , where interactions between diff erent players are the norm , as discussed previously . A critical case in financial markets where this type of interaction certainly takes place is pricing and trading . Organised markets have seen early applicatio ns of algorithmic decision -making . An AI trading algorithm is specifically designed to set the price for the trader in some environments together with desired quantities to trade , and the market respon ds with market-clearing exchanges . In normal competitive conditions , sellers shou ld try to attract buyers with co mpetitive and lower prices . However , sellers may prefer to avoid this co mpetition that erodes their profit s and instead agree to collude , not reducing their prices . Although collusion between human traders has been largely documented in IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 30 financial ( and other ) markets , it is not an easy outcome to organize17 . Each seller has a unilateral incentive to renege the collusive agreement and se cretly undercut others ’ offers . This intrinsic instability of cartels makes them fr agile and requires typically that co lluding firms explicitly exchange ( coveted ) proposals and promises to establish and maintain the agreements . These explicit collusive interactions are also what authorities typically gath er as evidence against colluding firms in antitrust cases . In recent research , Calvano et al . ( 2020a , 2020b , 2021a ) have studied the outcome of market interactions of AI pricing algorithms that auto nomously learn what pricing strategy to use . Interestingly , these authors have shown a stubborn ability of Reinfo rcement Learning algorithms to learn to charge high prices . What is more , they ha ve also shown that sophisticated pricing strategies support these high prices . The strategies that the algorithms autonomously le arn contain implicit and tacit threats of punishment that make the decision to undercut rivals unprofitable . It is as if the strategies learned by these algorithms contained announcements of the type “ I ’ m ready to charge a high price if you also do so , but the moment you underc ut me , I ’ ll punish you with a price drop . So watch out , and let ’ s avoid price wars . ” Notably , this robust collusive scheme is obtained by algorithms autonomously and with no explicit communication so that market authorities would have no evidence of agreement at all . The fact that the algorithms arrive at the collusive agreemen t autonomously and silently may imply that the companies using these algorithms ( and their programmers ) could not be considered responsible for the collusive outcome , at least under the current legal environment . 3.4 . Explainability of AI A general challenge for humans with AI is to keep up with its increasing sophistication . AI tools such as Deep Neural Networks or Reinforcement learning algorithms are complicate d pieces of software . Coders themselves may fail to understand the actual function ing once the algorithms have autonomously learned from data and experience . This is called the black-box or explainability issue of AI and refers to the ultimate difficulty to expl ain the predictions that an AI system reaches18 . According to Bloomberg ( 2017 ) , hedge funds that al ready use autonomous AI algorithms for trading are concerned with deploying them in actual markets for the difficulty they may face with explaining the trading decisions to their clients . Lack of explainability can thus also be an issue for adopting AI systems in the financial sector . The credit market is another environment in whic h the explainability of autonomous algorithmic decisions is essential . When financia l institutions use AI algorithms to make credit decisions , they may fail to explain to their customers , external audi tors , and financial authorities . Butaru et al . ( 2016 ) illustrate how the adoption of AI algorithms for credit allocation can make the entire process nontransparent and potentially unsustainable . Overall , for the financial sector , the lack of explainabili ty is not only a problem per se . It can be ultimately so relevant to become a source of lack of t rust in AI and consequently limited adoption . 17 On the Forex cartel , see https : //ec.europa.eu/competition/elojade/ isef/case_details.cfm ? proc_code=1_40135 . 18 There is a subtle distinction between explainability which refers to the possibility to understand how an algorithm works and interpretability which instead refers to the ability to understand why certain specific decisions have been taken by the algorithm in a given case . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 31 PE 662.912 3.5 . Privacy concerns and public acceptance Leveraging alternative datasets is particularly e ffective for financial appl ications of AI . However , personal data is often contained in these sources of data , and the fact that individuals may be unaware of these different data sources being po oled together rais e privacy concerns . For example , virtual assistants in use with financia l intermediaries rely on a significant amount of information collected with written chats , emails , and verbal conversa tions . If customers of financial services were aware , they would prefer to have th is type and amount of pe rsonal information kept private or not even recorded . The trade-off to addre ss here is between the effi ciency and profitability of the AI systems and the large amount of data they use to obtain superior predictive performance . Also , the lack of trust in how fina ncial institutions handle such va st amounts of personal data may constrain AI developments in financ ial services . Public acceptance of AI may remain limited as long as AI systems in finance are non-transparent in the data they use and in their functioning . 3.6 . Changing relations with customers and regulators Some services in the financial sector , notably those offered by banks to their customers , still rely on traditional approaches . Relationship banking is the term that refers to rela tions between clients and banks that rely on proximity , per sonal knowledge , and informally sh ared information . Especially for clients such as depositors , small in vestors , and SMEs , these relations ar e likely to remain important for at least the next 10-20 years . After th is period , almost all of the banks ’ clients will be “ digital natives ” and ready to interact with digital technologies . Howe ver , in the meanwhile , the process of adopting AI systems and the substitution of human interactions will occur . The contemporaneous presence of older generations of clients and the substi tution of traditional services wi th more evolved AI services may induce a significant mismatch and relegate some clients to downgrad ed financial services . The market may respond with small banks focusing on relation ship banking and proximity services . However , it has been observed that with the arrival of AI in financial services , small banks may become acquisition targets for larger banks ( Barba et al. , 2017 ) . On the other side of the demographic spectrum , ther e is the risk that younger generations interacting with AI systems will not be completely aware of the fu nctioning of AI systems . It could be a substantial risk , for example , when relying too much on the recommendation of Robo-advisor . Recommender systems , for example , may increase the homoge neity of decisions , which in financial market applications could imply a concen tration of risks ( Calvano et al . 2021b ) . The demarcation between practical recommendations and manipulation is , in fact , a thin line . Interactions could be more compli cated also between financial institut ions adopting AI solutions and their financial regulators and supervisors . Many comp etent national authorities have started to develop their Regtech and Suptech tools ( BIS , 2020 ) . The risk here is an increase of fragmentation with different and possibly incompatible solutions for the same pr oblems . Lack of international coordination of regulation in the financial services is problematic , and it has been a significant issue in the past . Institutions such as the Bank for Internationa l Settlements and the complicated process of the European Banking Union testify to the difficulty and importance of dealing with international coordination on financial sector regulation . The fa st and uncoordinated adoption of the Regtech and Suptech tools may take international coordination a step back . This risk is currently real , and Europe should pay great attention and profit from the ( u ncommon ) opportunity to start coordinating this regulatory process at its inception , that is now . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 32 3.7 . Risk for stability Stability is a general concern in th e financial industry , and many of the regulations of the sector are designed to increase and maintain stability at the level of a single financial institution and the macro level . Bodies such as the European Systemic Risk Board , the FSB , and the Basel Committee of Banking Supervision have been established to improve financial market stability . The impact of technologies on fina ncial market ( in- ) stability is not new and not necessarily related to AI . High-frequency trading has increased financial market instability , as documented by the “ flash crashes ” of the New York Stock Exchange in 2010 and 2015 . In these episodes , stock markets lost trillions of dollars in a matter of seconds as trad ing decisions were delegated to super-fast algorithms . Interestingly , in some cases ( for example , in the 2010 flash crash ) , the trading algorithms observed unexpected market conditions that they were not designed to deal with and , consequently , reacted erratically . Financial markets are also quickly reacting to the ne ws with a speed of reaction that with algorithmic trading can become excessive . For example , in 2013 , the Twitter account of a famous press agency was hacked and used to report an attack on the White House falsely . The moment this fake news leaked out , high-frequency trading algorithms reacted in a matter of minutes , trading shares for millions of dollars based on manipulated information and taki ng the Dow Jones Industrial Average index down by 150 points19 . In addition to the consequence of fast automation , AI systems applie d to financial markets can further contribute to instability . These sp ecific sources of risks are a new category and have been noted by financial market authorities ( e.g. , FSB , 2017 ) . First , most AI systems for financial applications are currently untested for financial crises scenario . Te sting in the market can be expensive and itself a source of instability20 . The relatively limited information and la ck of data about AI applications for financial markets in stressed condit ions remain a source of concern . Model testing is essential with AI , especially wh en trying to address the problem of overfitting . Sophisticated deep learning models contain thousands or even millions of parameters that have to be tuned-in ( estimated ) with time - and energy - cons uming learning sessions that their users may want to avoid . A large amount of parameters and the asso ciated non-linearity in the deep learning models is a mixed blessing . On the one hand , they are resp onsible for the superiority over traditional methods in fitting non-linear relationship s between relevant variables ( the so-called Universal Approximation Theorem ) . On the other hand , this flexibility can lead to the problem of “ overfi tting ” . This large number of parameters is determined in the learning phase to fit the market conditions described by the data of the training set . However , these parameters may be unfit for changed market conditions generated by an unexpected , persistent shock . The model then po orly adapts to the new and modified conditions . Overfitting is a well-known issue in computer scienc e and is partially addressed with regularization techniques . However , the problem remains when the no vel market conditions differ significantly from those observed in the past . If this happens , the mo del should be retrained , an expensive process that financial firms using these algorithms may prefer to delay . Coordinated behaviour may be another source of inst ability . Herding can occur with AI on different dimensions . For example , it could be the consequence of adopting si milar types of algorithms that 19 See https : //www.theguardian.com/business/2013/ap r/23/ap-tweet-hack-wall-street-freefall . 20 For example , the fund Knight Capital in 2012 deployed in the market an untested trading algorithm that was responsible of a l oss worth $ 440 million to the fund , in just 45 minutes . See https : //www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/ 2012-08-02/knight-shows-how-to-lose-440million-in-30-minutes . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 33 PE 662.912 would then identify common patterns in the explan atory variables used for prediction . This common modelling issue may occur with financial institutions that outsource their AI systems to the same third parties . Or it may be the consequence of the algori thms being trained on the very same data . Overall , this algorithmic herding and the implied model unif ormity of predictions and behaviour can produce a new type of interconnectedness in fina ncial markets ( Gensler and Bailey , 2020 ) 21 . AI-specific regulations can become a source of homo geneity as well , to the extent that regulations impose some common characteristics to the AI system s in financial markets and inadvertently lead to model uniformity . Homogeneity is not only an issue for large traders in organised financial markets . It can also become an issue in other environments , such as when Robo-advisors rely on the same algorithms and the same data sources . Advising uniformly to many , possibly millions of individuals , Robo-advising may create market imbalances that are reminiscent of the ph enomenon of route congestion when AI mapping algorithms contemporaneously suggest the same drivin g directions to many drivers . Whether this is a real risk remains to be verified , as the availabl e results are mixed . Calvano et al . 2021 show that recommender systems in a general environment m ay increase homogeneity . Using data for asset management in the US , D ’ Acunto et al . ( 2019 ) and Rossi and Utkus ( 2021 ) show that Robo-advisor improves risk-adjusted portfolio re turns and diversification , in some cases reducing the typical homebias in portfolio decisions . A novel source of instability specific to AI systems in financial markets is the so-called feedback loop between the data and the algorithm . AI systems are designed to learn fr om the data and adapt autonomously . When AI algorith ms populate financial markets massively , financial data will incorporate the algorithms ' decision s , which will use these data to learn and update their predictions and decision . This is problematic because it create s an endogeneity issue where models generate data used to update models in a cycle that may behave e rratically . This issue is just now under the radar of academic research , and little is known at this stage . For example , Malik ( 2020 ) has studied ML algorithms that are already used to predict the valu e and pricing of properties . He has shown that the feedback loop between data and an updating ML algorithm creates a “ s elf-fulfilling prophecy ” : the ML system overestimates its prediction accuracy , and its ( human ) users ov er-rely on the system predictions . The risk of generating bubbles in this way is concrete . Finally , a particular reference is for shadow-banking intermediaries adopting AI systems representing a specific source of concerns . Shadow-banking acti vities are very significant ( see FSB 2020 ) but avoid ( most of ) traditional bank regulations because they do not take deposits . The Great Financial Crisis that started in 2008 , has shown that interconnectedne ss within shadow bankin g and the links with traditional and regulated banking sector can be a si gnificant source of systemic risk . The adoption of AI in shadow banking should then be explicitly hand led . AI systems could be used in shadow banking , both on the side of lending ( e.g. , assessing the cr editworthiness of borrowers ) and that of the sources of funding ( e.g. , designing and issu ing collateralised financial credit ) . One particular source of concern is that , differently from traditional banks , shadow ba nks are not subject to regulations , and the increase in risk due to AI systems would go unnoticed in this case . 3.8 . Cyber-risks Automated systems in the financial sector expose to risks of external malicious and unobserved manipulation . Some AI-related and specific issues may occur , especially with the manipulation of data . 21 The attitude to collude of algorithmic pr icing systems discussed in section 3.3 is another example of algorithmic coordination that may lead to interconnectedness . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 34 The academic literature on adversarial ML has sh own that ML algorithms can be relatively easily manipulated by altering ( or “ poiso ning ” ) the data that fed into th e algorithms . For example , image recognition is a workhorse and well- studied environment in ML , and ye t it has been possible to fool sophisticated ML algorithms with da ta manipulation . In a famous expe riment , an ML algorithm that in normal conditions had a minimal erro r rate ( lower than that of humans ) was induced to interpret a stop sign as a speed limit sign by simply altering few pixe ls of the original image and in a way that would go unnoticed to human eyes22 . The implications of data poisoning for the financial sectors are many and should be kept under scrutiny . Th is is especially the case when considering that many financial institutions rely more and more on third-party servic es and they can thus become a target of interest for malicious manipulations . This type of manipulation is relevant not only for market players , but it may also concern the recent developments of Regtech and Suptech . 3.9 . Changing and concentrat ed market structure Although prominent players in the financial sector are developing their AI systems in-house ( or in acquired and controlled companies ) , many small and medium players will rely on third-party services . This is a sensible approach that allows these sm aller companies to leverage common developments of AI systems and share the associated fixed costs . Fintec h companies , for example , often rely on external non-financial providers to perform data analytics . These external companies provide the infrastructure , design and maintain the algorithms , process and store data for many financial and non-financial institutions . In addition to AI sy stems , third-parties relationships m ay also involve data-sharing , as in the case of Business-to-Government , Govern ment-to-Business , and Business-to-Business agreements23 . However , relying on third-parties is a source of risk , as already discussed in sections 3.7 and 3.8 , and it is also a source of specific concer n. The vertical unbundling or outsourcing of essential tech services makes monitoring and supervision of regulated en tities more complicate . Regulations explicitly addressing outsourcing of some activities by financial institutions already exist24 , but problems persist . For example , in the well-known Wirecard case , many subsidiaries of the holding companies relied on third-party operations for AI-related services ( s ee Barba et al . 2020 ) . This structure complicated the supervision of the group , as national authorities could only oversee operations outsourced to thirdparties that were incorporated in the same countr y as the regulator but not in other countries . Although extending regulatory reach can fix th is specific problem , the example shows the complications of the changing market orga nization that AI systems are inducing . As discussed in chapter 2 , AI applic ations are inducing changes in the market structure of the financial sector that are also desirable . The majority of econ omists would agree that in creasing competition is a desirable fact in general . As seen , the financial sect or has been criticised for its limited competition and 22 See https : //spectrum.ieee.org/cars-that-think/transportation/sensors /slight-street-sign-modifications-can-fool-machine-learningalgorithms . 23 See Bertin and Néstor ( 2020 ) . The European Commission has deve loped an European data strategy that contemplates , among other data sharing between the different actors , see https : //ec.europa.eu/info/strateg y/priorities-2019-2024/europe-f it-digital-age/european-datastrategy_en . 24 See the proposal for regulation prepared by the Commission to the EU Parliament and the Council , about digital operational re silience in the financial sector ( European Commission , 2020 ) , EBA ’ s guidelines for banks ’ cloud services outsourcing https : //www.eba.europa.eu/sites/defa ult/documents/files/documents/101 80/2551996/38c80601-f5d7-4855-8ba3702423665479/EBA % 20revised % 20Guidelines % 20on % 2 0outsourcing % 20arrangements.pdf ? retry=1 in the US the FDIC : Guidance for Managing Third-Party Risk ( FIL ) -44-2008 , https : //www.fdic.gov/news/financial-in stitution-letters/2 008/fil08044.html and OCC Bulletin 2013-29 , OCC Bulletin 2020-10 . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 35 PE 662.912 staggering costs . However , one should handle with care sudden market structure changes in finance . For example , it is known that increasing competitio n and reducing profitability in the banking sector may increase banks ’ failures25 . Bigtech companies are also ready to enter the financial sector , or they have already done so , as in China , where the Ant Group moved from e-commerce and now offers payment solutions all over the country . The advantages of Bigtech over traditional financial op erators are at least three . Bigtech can leverage a large amount of data amassed in di fferent activities such as e-commerce , social networks , and search engines . They already have experience with AI te chnologies that they have developed in their nonfinancial markets . Finally , they can rely on signif icant amounts of funds for their investments in the financial sector . The entry of these new players in no t dynamic markets is desirable . However , different from Fintech , Bigtech may induce high market co ncentration and market power . It is known that digitalised markets tend to concentrate ( the tippi ng-market effect or the winner-take-all issue ) , and competition authorities have recent ly started to take action , as with the Digital Market Act and the Digital Service Act of the Euro pean Union that address the lar ge platforms or “ gatekeepers ” 26 . The risk here is that Bigtech players replicate the path of concentration in some financial sector activities . The impact on concentration and market power of AI developments in the financial sector can also percolate in other sectors , as shown in Begenau et al . ( 2018 ) . AI analytics in financial markets reduce the cost of capital for large firms more than fo r small firms , which generates a self-reinforcing mechanism . Cheaper funding enables large firms to grow larger and thus generate more data about their activities . More data , in turn , imply that th e financial sector becomes better and better able to predict the returns of large firms than those of smaller firms , thus offering even cheaper financing to the already growing large firms . This is a virtuous cycle for large firms , of course , but ultimately leads to heavy concentration in the real economy . 3.10 . Funding AI for the financia l sector and in general Developing AI market applications is currently an ac tivity with an uncertain outcome , thus financially risky . In parallel to success stories , there are many ( more ) failures . Financing startups and early-stage co mpanies with high growth potenti al but high risks require specific sources of funding . A developed stock market can pr ovide some of it but is typically not sufficient and not the best way to finance less known and transpar ent AI-related startups . Private equity funding , particularly venture capital , is a better approach as few and specialised investors accept the risks because they get involved in developing ear ly-stage activities in exchange for equity . Another common approach for the growth of AI-re lated companies is acquisition . Large companies , such as Bigtech , often acquire sm all tech companies and provide the funding for full development . An example of this approach is the AI startup Deepmi nd acquired in 2014 by Google and has become one of the most advanced and well-funded compan ies developing advanced AI applications . Considering these sources of fund ing , Europe is not well placed . The equity market in Europe is notoriously under-developed , the mark et for risk capital is also insuffic ient , as was discussed in section 1.3 , and Europe has no Bigtech companies . For th ese concomitant factors , Europe is currently in a second line for developing AI appl ications , as concluded in chapter 1 . This situation is not per se a source of risk , but it is undoubtedly a key challenge for the developments and applications of AI in financial markets . 25 See for example Vives ( 2010 ) . 26 For the proposal of the Digi tal Market Act , see EC ( 2020 ) . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 36 POLICY IMPLICATIONS In chapters 2 and 3 , the benefits and the challenges of AI systems in the financial sector have been discussed . After a background on the regulation of AI in Europe , this chapter discusses the incentives on AI adoption for the financial se ctor , and draws implications for po licies and some recommendations . An outright ban of AI from the financial service is already unfeasible and would relegate Europe to a marginal role in global financial markets , still exposi n g E u r o p e a n c i t i z e n s t o r i s k s o f A I a p p l i c a t i o n s managed abroad . Our opinion is that the benefits of developing AI in the financial sector outweigh , and by far , the risks . Once the risks are controlled , which does no t mean they are eliminated , AI development in the financial sector should be accepted and incentivised . It is important to recap a few general points about the financial sector covere d in the previous pages . First , the financial sector is a global industry wi th highly integrated and interdependent markets . Second , it is a heavily regulated industry ( see Box 1 ) . Third , some prominent players in the financial sector can count on vast amounts of funds for deve loping AI applications and innovations . Finally , higher efficiency of financial markets with AI develo pments generates higher growth , but this does not necessarily imply that all thos e affected will be better off . 4.1 . The regulatory background for AI in Europe Regulations that can explicitly and directly affect AI applications wi th consequences for the financial sectors are rare . In Europe , some pieces of regulation already affect AI applications for the financial sector . The European Markets in Financial Instruments Directive ( Directive 2014/65/EC ( MIFID II ) prescribes that any financial institution that adopts algorithmi c trading must notify the competent authority of its member state and the trading venue27 . The home member state author ity may require details of the algorithms and a description of the un derlying strategies implemented with algorithms . The firm must also keep a record of the algorithms that have been used in specific transactions and allow the authority to monitor compliance . For financial asset trading , the exchanges where transactions occur ( or trading venues ) must fulfil requirements to guarantee the ma rket infrastructure 's resilience and cooperate with traders to test their algorithms in simulated en vironments and provide self-assessment . Also , the European Securities and Markets Authority ( ESMA , 2020 ) has recently launched a public consultation about algorithmic trading28 . Other regulations that already affect AI in Europe pertain to the use and sharing of data , both personal and non-personal data . First , the General Data Protecti on Regulation ( GDPR ) prescribes that individuals in Europe “ have the right to receive an explanation for deci sions based solely on automatic processing , such as automatic refusal of an online credit application ” . Second , the European strategy for data contains broader regulations or proposals that may affect AI applications for th e financial sector , particularly for what pertains to data sharing . Notably , the Open Data Directiv e , substantially amended in 2019 , mandates that data held by public sector bodies must be made available for commercial and noncommercial uses . In particular , the “ high-value data set ” ( Article 13 ( 1 ) of the directive ) , such as geospatial and meteorological data , data about compan ies , and mobility , are of great interest for many 27 The European Directive 2014/65/EU , also known as MiFID II ( and a ssociated regulation MiFIR ) entered into forces in 2014 and a re fully operative since 2017 . It addressed and harmonised the regulation for investment services , increasing competition , investor prot ection and levelling the playing field . 28 See https : //www.esma.europa.eu/press-news/esma-new s/esma-consults-impact-algorithmic-trading . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 37 PE 662.912 applications , including the alternative data set us ed in finance , as seen in the previous pages29 . The European Commission is promoting th e sharing of data , in particular non-personal data and between companies ( e.g . the so called business-to-business da ta ) , which would profoundly impact the use of these data for AI applications in finance and other sectors . During the preparation of this paper , the European Commission has released ( April 21st , 2021 ) its new proposal for broad and horizontal regulation of AI , EC ( 2021 ) , which is the outcome of a series of steps and analyses of the European institutions representing a unicum in the policy of AI30 . The Commission ’ s proposal is important and innovative . Although this is not th e place where to give a complete review , the most relevant implications for the financial sector will be discussed . The proposal relies on a risk-assessment approach according to which AI a pplications should be regulated to the extent they generate risks . It in tends to introduce a list of banned AI applications , another open list of high-risk applications that are subject to significant new regulations , and other AI applications about whom the proposal en courages the use of codes of conduct . In the case of high-risk applications , the regulation requires that AI users must guarantee ( i ) adequate risk assessment and mitigation systems ; ( ii ) high quality of the datase ts ; ( iii ) logging of activity to ensure traceability of results ; ( iv ) detailed documentatio n for authorities to assess compliance ; ( v ) clear and adequate information to the user ; ( vi ) appropriat e human oversight measures to minimize risk ; ( vii ) high level of robustness , security and accuracy . The proposal explicitly touches upon the financial sector on three dimensions . The first reference to the financial sector identifies creditworthiness as a hi gh-risk AI application because of a significant risk of unfair treatment ( Recital 37 ) and Annex III 5b to Ar ticle 6 ( 2 ) ) . The proposal al so contemplates a waiver on regulations for activities performed by “ small scale providers for their own use ” ( Annex III 5b to Article 6 ( 2 ) ) , where the reason for this exemption is the small scale of these provid ers and the presence of some market alternatives . Second , the proposal acknowledges the complication and need to coordinate wi th the financial sector regulations and supervisory activities . In particular , it specifies that when AI systems perform regulated financial services ( for lending but not only ) , the co mpetent authority for the AI regulation should be the financial sector supervisor ( Recital ( 80 ) ) . The co mpliance procedure of AI regulation must integrate into those of financial market regulations ( e.g . , the European Directive 2013/36/EU on credit institutions and investment firms ) . Third , to avoi d duplications , the proposal allows derogating on some of its requirements for high-ris k AI applications when they would be in any case satisfied because of existing financial sector regulations ( Recital ( 80 ) ) . Finally , relevant for the financial sector is the refere nce of chatbots , virtual assistants , as an application that poses a limited risk and is subject to transp arency obligations guaranteeing that users become aware they are interacting with an AI system and can decide to back off . 4.2 . Incentivising innovation of AI for financial markets Public intervention in markets , espe cially if involving public money an d regulations , should always be justified either by the presence of some market ine fficiency or by market outcomes that systematically 29 Directive ( EU ) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information . Also the proposed Data Governance Act ( EC 2020 ) aims at extending the Open Data Directive to data subject to pr otection restraints such as thir d-party intellectual property ri ghts . 30 This proposal is part of the European Strategy on Artificial Intelligence that co ntemplates other documents . The European Com mission , issued a “ White Paper on Artificial Intelligence - A Eu ropean approach to excellence and trust ” , in Feb. 2nd , 2020 ; in April 2019 the European Commission published its Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial In telligence and in June 2019 , a “ Policy and investment recommendations for trustworthy Artificial Intelligence ” ; the EU Commission ’ s High Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligenc e issued several reports , see https : //digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/expert-group-ai . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 38 and substantially diverge from thos e preferred by the society . Incent ives for AI innovation and its applications should not be an exception . As seen in the previous chapters , in Europe , the funds for developing AI market applications are limited , mainly because risk capital , such as equity and vent ure capital , is underdeveloped in the EU . It is not possible to discuss here all the co ncurrent reasons conducing to this outcome . Two are most relevant for our purposes . First , the high tr ansaction costs associated with corp orate failure make risk capital too expensive . Second , pension funds , very active in pr oviding risk capital in other countries like the US , have limited participation in the EU . Addressing thes e issues with appropriate incentives is possible , but such discussion would take us too far for the ai m of the present study . Instead , a more direct and pertinent initiative should further incentivize and mobilize private risk capital for AI by expanding public risk capital to be used for public guaran tees and public-private partnerships . The European Union has many such initiatives , such as those run by the European Investment Fund ( EIF ) . This possibility will be discussed in section 4.4 , which is devoted to best practices . The point here is that more public risk funds should be made available . Another essential factor that is pa rticularly scarce in Europe and th at should be incentivised is the combination of skills and knowledge about computer science and the financial sector . These are skills in high demand globally , and the European higher education system is providing too few graduates with these skills . The difficulty here could be th at individuals may lack information on the job opportunities in these sectors and a general problem of access to a higher education degree . Incentivizing programs providing these skills and enrolment would be thus important , although not sufficient . The relatively limited supply with the requested ski lls is composed of highly mobile workers attracted to the countries offering the best conditions , currently the US and the UK . It would thus not be enough to expand higher education programs on AI an d finance in Europe . It would be necessary to complement this plan with incentiv es to intercept this highly educat ed workforce and creating the best conditions to help them start their en terprises in Europe . It is not an ea sy task as small financial startups find it difficult to compete in hiring talents with la rge financial institutions that can offer high salaries and count on funds for long-term and ambitious research projects . Sandboxing and development hubs for AI market applic ations are also effective and should expand , as foreseen in the recent Commission ’ s proposal . Pilot programs and experiments overseen by competent financial market authoritie s should also be promoted31 . Some interesting proposals for sandboxing and hubs will be discussed in section 4.4 . AI algorithms voraciously rely on data . Fostering access to data is thus fundamental to develop AI applications in the financial sector . The Payment Serv ice Directive II ( PSD2 ) offers an early example of sharing relevant transaction data with simple API interfaces . However , only banks are currently subject to this data accessibility requirement , and nowada ys , the financial sector is populated by many new types of players , such as Fintech and Bigtech . None of these players is currently subject to equivalent disclosure requirements . A level playing field appr oach should be implemented , according to the principle “ same activity , same risks , same rules ” . Data portability is essential in the financial sector , and open access to data should be enforced and expa nded ( with GDPR privacy compliance ) to harness the full potentiality of AI applicat ions in the financial sector . 31 The proposal of an European Digital lab has been articulated in particular by the French Autorité des marchés financiers in 2 020 ( AMF , 2020 ) . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 39 PE 662.912 The European Union is already promoting competitio n and innovation in the financial sector and its technological developments32 . In the case of AI applications , sect ion 3 has illustrated that the impact on the competition of the financial industry is in principle ambiguous . Competent authorities should then closely monitor how the market of AI services fo r the financial sector evolves , particularly thirdparty services and cloud computing . Another highly concentrated marker should be avoided , as it happened with many digital markets . Finally , adequately designed regulations of AI ca n incentivize its adoption , particularly for AI applications in the financial sector . This sector and its services are relatively complex for its customers , and transparency is often limited . To increase publ ic acceptance of sophisti cated AI applications in finance , it is essential to enhance transparency , disclosure , robustness , safety , and security of AI applications in the financial sector . Users ’ awareness should be obtained , clarifying the strengths of AI systems , their weaknesses , and the e fforts to mitigate biases . The pres ence of AI systems open to an independent assessment of AI applications is one of the most promising approaches to increasing acceptance , as described in section 4.4 . 4.3 . Recommendations to improve regulatory impact Here some recommendations are provided that coul d inform regulation of AI applications . These recommendations are organised with a first group being pertinent for th e financial sector applications and a second group relevant for the financial institutions that adopt AI systems . The last group refers to the existing regulations of risk in the financial sector . 4.3.1 . General recommendations for AI regulations and the financial sector 1 . Regulation of AI applications in the financial sector should consider the characteristics and market failures specific to financial markets . This is further developed in the following list of recommendations concerning fi nancial sector regulations . 2 . Regulation of specific AI appl ications for the financial sector should account for the many sector-specific regulations of the financial market . It is crucial to identify the interactions between the two types of regulations on the fina ncial sector and AI , systematically eliminating fragmentation , inconsistencies , and duplications . Assessing the consistency of these different regulations requires interdisciplinary skills th at competent authorities may need to acquire . 3 . Related to the previous point , financial market regulators must keep up with AI developments and their applications in the financial sector . This also requires involving new experts with knowledge and skills both in financial markets and AI . 4 . Financial regulations generally rely on high transparency and openne ss with customers and supervisors to the extent that they may clash with the black-box issue of some AI tools and their applications . The way to address this is not by relaxing the standards of financial regulations , which would create a clash between regulations , but granting that AI ap plications comply and adapt to these higher standards . 5 . Encouraging new players in the fi nancial sector should be a priority of any regulation that affects the financial sector , including those relate d to AI . The financial sector is concentrated with staggering costs of quality-adjusted servic es ( Philippon , 2016 ) . The entry of new players is then a critical modernization factor that sh ould be incentivised and accounted for by 32 See the Digital Finance Package presented in September 20 20 , with a strategy for digital finance and crypto-assets . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 40 regulations affecting the financial sector . In partic ular , AI regulations should avoid stifling entry of new players such as Fintech . 6 . Regulations of AI applications in the financia l sector should account for the new risks and ultimately rely on a cost-benefit analysis . This analysis is essential for two reasons . First , the alternatives to AI systems in finance are not perfect solutions either ( e.g. , human biases in creditworthiness assessment are possible , as di scussed in the previous pages ) . Second , the financial sector comprises global markets , an d regulations may stifle financial firms ’ competitiveness . As further discussed below , the financial sector is already subject to effective stability risk and consumer protec tion oversight , especially in Europe with the development of the Banking Union . It may now be the occasion to push more on innovation , competition which ultimately will benefit financial service customers . 7 . When regulating AI in general and for applications in the financial sector , one should constantly assess the incentives to innovate and develop AI market applications , such as measuring the increased costs for AI applicatio ns . This assessment is critical during the current phase of experimentation of AI applicat ions for the financial sector . 8 . The core set of broadly emerging principles for horizontal regulation of AI ( human oversight , robustness and safety , data protection and priv acy , fairness , transparency , accountability ) 33 is consistent and compatible with the proper func tioning of the financial sector and its sectorspecific regulations . However , given the complexi ty of the financial sector and its regulations , financial market competent authorities should be ultimately responsible for assessing to what extent financial sector regulations effectively cope with these principl es and how they could embed in sectoral regulations . Such an assessment should be systematic , and it is urgent . 9 . As discussed in section 3.7 , shadow-banking activi ties adopting AI repres ent specific concerns for systemic risk . Since these intermediaries mo stly avoid traditional banking regulation and supervision , they can not be asse ssed following the proposal of the previous points 5-8 . Under the EU framework for financial supervision , the financial market authority for assessing the use of AI for shadow-banking is best suited with the activities of EBA , also because of EBA ’ s responsibilities on shadow-banking and on AI for banking institutions , together with monitoring by the European Systemic Risk Bo ard ( ESRB ) that monitors the shadow-banking sector in the EU.34 Specifying the organization of these responsibilities is also urgent . 10 . Market applications of AI are still in the phas e of development and experimentation , and there must be a substantial degree of flexibility of re gulations to adapt to market changes and further innovations . It is also crucial to produce a retrosp ective analysis of the e ffects of regulations on AI on the financial sector at a relatively high frequency for a prompt adjustment when adverse and unexpected effects occur . 4.3.2 . Specific recommendations for activities of financial institutions adopting AI 1 . For financial institutions adopting AI system s , a standalone AI framework seems appropriate where it would be possible to e fficiently insulate the function ing of AI tools in case of 33 See for example in the reports of the OECD see https : //www.oecd.org/going -digital/ai/principles/ and those of the European Commission ’ s AI High Level Experts Group , https : //digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/expert-group-ai . 34 EBA ( 2016 ) issued new guidelines to limit individual exposu res to shadow-banking . The European Commission ’ s Digital Finance S trategy , 24 September 2020 , assigns new responsibilities to EBA in particul ar in relation to AI , digital financial intermediaries and Re gtech and Suptech . See https : //www.eba.europa.eu/financial-innovation-and-fintech . See also the ESRB 2018 report of shadow-banking in the EU , https : //www.esrb.europ a.eu/pub/pdf/reports/esrb.repo rt180910_shadow_ banking.en.pdf . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 41 PE 662.912 malfunctioning . This is essential to grant continuity of essential financial services , especially for payments , lending , an d financial markets . 2 . AI adopting financial institutions should provide sector regulators with complete documentation of the development process of AI systems for their financial market applications , explicitly re porting information about : data ( collection , storage , and data preparation including exploration , cleaning , an d transformations such as normalizations ) , analytics ( in particular model training , tuning , validating , and selection among different models ) , operations ( deployment , testing , monitoring , updating ) . 3 . Algorithms should be rigorously tested before being deployed in financial markets ( off-market testing ) , and once deployed in markets , they must be monitored especially checking their learning process and their adaptation to ch anging market conditions ( in-market testing ) . Specific techniques for AI applic ations to financial markets should be considered , such as backtesting and dynamic testing 35 . Testing must contemplate : ( i ) stressed market conditions , ( ii ) “ adversarial ” conditions , and ( iii ) compliance with market regulations . When third parties perform testing , one must account that AI applications are the outcome of significant investments , and developing companies need to protect their intellectual property rights36 . 4 . External auditing and testing of AI applic ations should guarantee three conditions : independence , no conflict of interest , and specif ic financial market and computer science skills . These are general principles for auditing but are essential in the case of the financial sector , given the substantial economic interests around it . Section 4.4 discusses as this could be done by presenting some practical and relevant cases . 5 . When relying on third-party AI services , financ ial institutions should , in any case , remain responsible for some activities . In particular , they should guarantee due diligence about data ( legitimacy of sources , quality , and biases ) , tran sparency and explanations to customers , some control over the AI service , and also guarantee some control on the side of financial service customers ( for example , opt-out options ) . Thir d-party should be responsible for testing and monitoring the algorithms are di scussed in the previous points . 6 . Financial institutions adopting AI should be acti ve in disclosing their AI applications to their service customers , also improving clients ’ aw areness and knowledge about AI applications . They must consider the inform ation needs of their clients and effectively communicate about AI in line , for example , with credit risk disclosure and investment advice services . 7 . When imposing and requiring ex-ante explainability of AI applications for the financial sector , it is necessary to consider that these restrict ions may substantially im pair the possibility of effectively using AI algorithms for financial applications , especially with self-learning algorithms . Instead , it seems preferable fo r these applications to require post-hoc explainability , monitoring and assessing outcom es and performances of the algorithms expost . 8 . Some elements of the internal governance of AI applications should be requested of users in the financial sector , particularly a clear definition of roles , adequacy of skills , and accountability 35 Back-testing ( already in use with quanti tative finance ) is based on the idea of re peatedly testing the prediction model ( for example measuring some prediction error ) by retraining it with a portion of the currently available data and test it on the rest of the data that has not been used for training . Another approach is dynamic testing th at is meant to validate the application by simulating the use and functioning of the algorithms as it could work in actual applications . 36 Interesting developments for testing may exploit the idea of Zero-knowledge proofs , a method for verifying some properties of the algorithms without disclosing too many ( possibly zero ) of its details . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 42 in the decision process . In the case of third-pa rty services and standard due diligence , financial sector institutions must fully understand the te rms of conditions with their AI providers and must monitor and internally assess the external AI services they purchase . 4.3.3 . Specific recommendations for financ ial sector regulations of risk Activities in the financial sector are subject to tw o broad types of risks : micro or firm-level risk and macro or systemic risks . Accordingly , regulations in the financial sectors can be organised into two groups addressing these two risks , leading respec tively to micro-prudential policies and macroprudential policies . Applicat ions of AI in the financial sectors ma y have implications for both types of risks and policies . 1 . Buffer regulations of financial institutions , such as capital adequacy rules , are designed to absorb shocks and reduce the risk of bank run s. When some relevant decisions in a financial institution are delegated to AI sy stems with impact on buffers ( e.g . , using ML for a bank ’ s assets risk assessment in the Internal Ratings Based approach ) , the systems ’ robustness should be checked , also benchmarking with other more tradit ional methods . In the alternative , it may be helpful to consider adjusting the buffers and other micro-prudential regulations for those financial institutions that adopt these AI systems . 2 . Related to the previous point , ri sk models used by financial in stitutions are often subject to regulatory oversight . This activity should begi n incorporating the diffusi on of AI applications for risk modelling and address explainability . Curre ntly , the assessment of risk models is based on the description and documentation of the mode ls adopted . With AI models , it seems better to move from this formalisti c approach to assessing the outcomes . This is undoubtedly a significant change in the micro-prudential a pproach that requires collaboration between supervisors and financial institutions . Traditional models for risk assessment could still be used to guarantee benchmarking and backup . 3 . For the first years of adopting AI systems , regulations could contemplate redundant and backup systems ready to enter in use if principal AI systems fail to deliver the expected outcome ( which could happen for errors and or adversaria l attacks , for example ) . Financial institutions , especially if they provide system-wide infrast ructure , should ensure reliable AI systems . Safeguards and redundancy of AI could oper ate similarly to those for information and communication technologies ( ICT ) in the financial sector37 . 4 . When financial institutions deeply engage in AI applications , they should prepare and share with regulators the “ internal mapping ” of their AI applications . These mappings should identify interdependencies within the organization that emerge with datasets and algorithms for different applications . 5 . Concerning macro-prudential regulations , financ ial institutions should also provide “ external maps ” of their use of AI , includin g descriptions of their dependen cies on external sources such as datasets , algorithms , and externa lly acquired AI and cloud services . 37 See European Commission Financial services – improving resilience against cyberattacks ( new rules ) . https : //ec.europa.eu/info/law/better-regula tion/have-your-say/initiatives/12090-Financia l-services-improving-resilience-against cyberattacks-new-rules- . Also the ECB currently sees ICT and cyber risk as a priori ty one of its key Supervisory Priorities for 2020 . The ECB specifically carries out IT on-site inspec tions and requires some significant banks and operators providing payment systems and infrastructure to report cyber incidents . See a summary of ECB priorities at https : //assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/12/ssmsupervisory-priorities-2020.pdf . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 43 PE 662.912 6 . Putting together the external ma ps of AI , competent financial market regulators should build a view of the systemic interconnections of financ ial activities related to AI applications . They should publicly report on these system-wide de pendencies due to AI and , if needed , adapt existing macro-prudential policies accordingly . 7 . To avoid model uniformity and its risks ( see se ction 3.7 ) , regulators should propose and allow multiple approaches to comply with regulations . 8 . Although Regtech and Suptech initiatives should be welcome , the risk of uncoordinated developments is real , as well as its costs . Some minimal international coordination should be considered , beginning with harmonised definiti ons and shared knowledge of techniques and approaches ( e.g. , setting a common standa rd for machine-readable documentation ) . 4.4 . Examples of best practices Policies explicitly designed for AI and the financia l markets are scant in Europe and the rest of the world . Nevertheless , three examples of policies ar e illustrated to be considered best practices to follow and further develop . 4.4.1 . Supporting factors for AI in the financial sector . As previously discussed , the scarce factors for deve loping AI and market applications in finance are the skilled workforce and the capital for investment . Some initiatives are now illustrated that were successful in fostering the availabi lity of these scarce factors . The endemic limitation of risk capital in Europe is a problem for developing AI market applications , and policy interventions should addre ss it . The European Commission has also emphasised this with the mid-term review ( EC ( 2017 ) ) of the Capital Market Union ( CMU ) . There are already some successful initiatives that should further ex pand . The efforts in the CMU towards a single European capital market of the European Commission would undo ubtedly help increase the availability of risk capital in Europe . The European Investment Fund ( EIF ) is a part of th e European Investment Bank group and is designed to offer risk capital , guarantees , an d lending to support SMEs in Europe38 . The fund already manages €100 million for AI activities with venture debt contracts39 . In 2020 the fund launched a new initiative specific to AI ( worth €150 million ) of co-investments in partnership with private equity funds . This has quickly attracted attention to the setup of 6 new ve nture capital funds specifically for AI and private equity funds from Austria , Finland , Germany , Luxemb ourg , and the Netherlands , at an expected overall investment capacity of €700 million . It is a success story , but it does not surprise that these activities attracted attention , and they are certainly welcome . The lack of private equity fundin g in Europe is endemic , and markets are eager to finance innovation in AI . The success of this initiative , however , is limi ted by the dimension of the fund . The estimate is that it would help financ e 20-30 SMEs in Europe at the current amount40 . This is not enough to significantly impact and help Europe re gain leadership in AI and market applications . The 38 See https : //www.eif.org/what_we_do/ the-eif-in-2020/index.htm . 39 Venture debt is a type of debt that is granted typically to purchase equipment , even if the company does not currently show s ignificant cash flows nor has assets to be used for collaterals . This debt contract often contemplates warrants on the equipment or the ri ght to acquire equity , in order to compensate for the high risk . 40 See the press release of the European Commission , March 2021 , https : //digital-strategy.ec.europ a.eu/en/news/new-eu-financinginstrument-eu150-million-support-europea n-artificial-intelligence-companies . IPOL | Policy Department for Economic , Scientific and Quality of Life Policies PE 662.912 44 EIF has a broad mandate , probably too vast , and focusi ng more of its resources on AI-related activities seems worth considering . There are other few relevant initia tives to support risk capital at the country level that could help develop AI , such as the German 'High Tech G ründerfonds ' and the 'Austria Wirtschaftsservice Gesellschaft ' . The German fund , for example , was established in 2005 , counting on €900 million . It invested in more than 550 operations ( although not sp ecifically on AI ) , attracting additional private investments for €2 billion . The other scarce factor for market applications of AI is a skilled workforce . European universities have excellent educational programs in co mputer science and finance , but , as explained previously , they are insufficient . Education is another case in which pu blic-private partnerships could be effective . An exemplar case is the new Schwarzman College of Co mputing at Massachusetts Institute of Technology co-financed by the Schwarzman investment fund . Pa rtnerships between universities and the financial industry on AI applications should be explored in Europe as well . 4.4.2 . Experimenting with AI in financial markets Especially in this early phase of market adoption of AI in financial markets , sector authorities should guide with assessments41 . Some financial market authorities have already issued position papers on AI . It has already been mentioned some in the previous pages , such as the FSB ( 2019 ) and the Bank of England ( 2019 ) 42 . The European Supervisory Authorities , ES MA , EBA , and EIOPA , issued an early joint paper in 2018 on big data and AI in the financial sector ( ESA , 2018 ) . Although these position papers wer e important , they should be updated because AI and its financial market applications are quickly evolving . Furtherm ore , the information they could provide and the guidance would be more significant if they were prepar ed to collaborate with su bjects with specific AI knowledge . This type of partnership between financia l sector authorities and ce ntres specialised in AI has fruitfully taken place , such as the collaboratio n between the FCA and the Alain Turing Institute for AI in the UK43 . Another interesting case of regula tors ’ engagement is with the idea of sandboxes . Although they spread quickly worldwide ( UNSGSA , 2020 and European Parliament , 2020 ) , a clear assessment of these many and diverse initiatives is not available . The su ccess cases are typically those where the authorities also provided a significant amount of resources to monitor the sandbox deve lopments effectively and provide regular guidance and advice . In terms of firm s that have entered the sandbox , one of the most successful cases is that of FCA in the UK . The sandboxing approach relies on the idea of assessing in a cont rolled environment the consequences of waiving some of the regulations that firms would otherwise be subject to . The sandboxing approach has been spelt out with details in the European Commission 's proposal ( EC 2021 , Articles 53 and 54 ) . A related but different approach is described in De Andrade and Kontschieder ( 2021 ) , although not explicitly designed for the financial sector . The idea is to testbed specific new regulations about AI and assess their market implications and costs of implemen tation by directly involv ing the firms that should live with them . Although the current implementation of this idea has been so far limited to a case study 41 These reports are useful to the extent they are independent and organically generated by auth orities . Delegating the preparat ion of these reports to external subjects seems much less useful both for th e readers and for the authorities themselves in developing inter nal skills . 42 See also the earlier paper by the Mo netary Authority of Singapore ( 2018 ) . 43 See https : //www.turing.ac.uk/news/ai-t ransparency-financial-services . Artificial Intelligence market and capital flows | Artifici al Intelligence and the financial sector at crossroads 45 PE 662.912 where only the firms ’ view was relevant , this is a pr omising and novel approach that could be extended , including the view of other stakeholders . 4.4.3 . Independent assessment of AI Authorities should play a role in facilitating intera ctions and the exchange of ideas . The Federal Trade Commission in the US ( FTC ) , for example , orga nizes showcase meetings for applications and developments about AI , da ta security , and privacy44 . During these events , researchers have the opportunity to illustrate to a broa d audience some of the issues , for ex ample , on AI and discrimination and possible solutions in specific market applications . These events are helpfu l on several dimensions . They increase awareness about AI and its market a pplications by providing “ real-life ” examples . They help companies use AI to identify specific issues with independent vetting of their activities and propose solutions . Finally , they allow authorities to remain updated about cutting-edge applications of AI . Independent assessment of AI a pplications should be incentivis ed and certainly not opposed . Academic researchers can play a crucial role in th is and should access AI systems deployed in the market to test them . In 2020 a federal court in the US had ruled that “ independent research aimed at uncovering whether online algorithms result in racial , gender , or other discrimination does not violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ” . These decisions will encourage inde pendent testing of AI algorithms and their interaction with cust omers in the financial sector45 . Companies that use AI should consider the benefits of engaging with a transparent and in dependent assessment of their use of AI . Research centres and universities can play a prominent role in these auditing activities requiring independence and specific skills46 . Researchers have the expertise for this type of assessment and a reputation at stake . Instead , the typical commercial auditing and co nsulting solutions may no t be adequate for AI applications for th e financial markets . 44 See PrivacyCon 2020 https : //www.ftc.gov/news-events/ev ents-calendar/privacycon-2020 . 45 See https : //www.aclu.org/press-releases/feder al-court-rules-big-data-discrimination -studies-do-not-vi olate-federal-anti 46 An interesting example of independent assessment of an AI al gorithm initiated by a private company for job market matching is in Wilson et al .
