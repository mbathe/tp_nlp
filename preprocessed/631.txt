Declaration of Cities Coalition for Digital Rights We , the undersigned cities , formally come together to form the ​ Cities Coalition for Digital Rights , ​ ​ to protect and uphold human rights on the internet at the local and global level . The ​ internet ​ ​ has become inseparable from our daily lives . Yet , every day , there are new cases of digital rights abuse , misuse and misinformation and concentration of power around the world : ​ freedom of expression being censored ; personal information , including our movements and communications , monitored , being shared and sold without consent ; ‘ black box ’ algorithms being used to make unaccountable decisions ; social media being used as a tool of harassment and hate speech ; and ​ democratic processes and public opinion being undermined . As cities , the closest democratic institutions to the people , we are committed to eliminating impediments to harnessing technological opportunities that improve the lives of our constituents , and to providing trustworthy and secure digital services and infrastructures that support our communities . We strongly believe that ​ human rights principles ​ ​ such as privacy ​ ​ , ​ freedom of expression ​ ​ , and democracy must be incorporated by design into digital platforms starting with locally-controlled digital infrastructures and services . As a coalition , and with the support of the United Nations Human Settlements Program ( ​ UN-Habitat ​ ) , we will share best practices , learn from each other ’ s challenges and successes , and coordinate common initiatives and actions . Inspired by the Internet Rights and Principles Coalition ( ​ IRPC ​ ) , the work of 300 international stakeholders over the past ten years , we are committed to the following five evolving principles : 1 . Universal and equal access to the internet , and digital literacy Everyone should have access to affordable and accessible internet and digital services on equal terms , as well as the digital skills to make use of this access and overcome the digital divide . 2 . Privacy , data protection and security Everyone should have privacy and control over their personal information through data protection in both physical and virtual places , to ensure digital confidentiality , security , dignity and anonymity , and sovereignty over their data , including the right to know what happens to their data , who uses it and for what purposes . 3 . Transparency , accountability , and non-discrimination of data , content and algorithms Everyone should have access to understandable and accurate information about the technological , algorithmic and artificial intelligence systems that impact their lives , and the ability to question and change unfair , biased or discriminatory systems . 4 . Participatory Democracy , diversity and inclusion Everyone should have full representation on the internet , and the ability collectively to engage with the city through open , participatory and transparent digital processes . Everyone should have the opportunities to participate in shaping local digital infrastructures and services and , more generally , city policy-making for the common good . 5 . Open and ethical digital service standards Everyone should be able to use the technologies of their choice , and expect the same level of interoperability , inclusion and opportunity in their digital services . Cities should ​ define their own technological infrastructures , services and agenda , through open and ethical digital service standards and data to ensure that they live up to this promise .
