responsible use moved forefront debate extent rely algorithms comes matters life death personal health safeguard algorithms used intended purposes ensure inadvertently discriminate specific cultures minorities groups thereby perpetuating inequalities access quality care questions far important answered hindsight compel think proactively industry individual actors best advance healthcare healthy living benefit consumers patients care professionals avoiding unintended consequences best advance healthcare healthy living benefit people avoiding unintended consequences healthcare personal health applications often involves use sensitive personal data key priority obviously use data responsibly data must kept safe secure times processed compliance relevant privacy regulations philips captured data principles yet set fundamentally change way people interact technology make decisions requires additional standards safeguards data policies alone enough led develop set five guiding principles design responsible use healthcare personal health applications based key notion solutions complement benefit customers patients society whole principles entail important solutions benefit health individuals contribute sustainable development society technological innovation first foremost ask human purpose meant serve goal advance sake improve people quality life rising global demand healthcare growing shortage healthcare professionals clear need help alleviate overstretched healthcare systems much already written act smart assistant healthcare providers diagnosis treatment potential improve health outcomes lower cost improving staff patient experience known quadruple aim truly benefit health people generations come need think beyond current model reactive sick care move toward true proactive health care every step people lives cradle old age applications health services could inform support healthy living personalized coaching advice preventing well treating disease move reactive sick care proactive health care privilege happy line sustainable development goals believe must take inclusive approach promotes access care healthy lives many developing countries today large inequalities exist urban rural health services combined enabling technologies internet things telecommunication technologies like could help reduce inequalities making specialist medical knowledge available rural areas oversight solutions augment empower people appropriate supervision established human guiding purpose development ensure delivers goal argued augments human skills expertise make less relevant especially complex world healthcare lives stake tools machine learning require human domain knowledge experience put outcomes context classic example medical literature help illustrate showing could wrong blindly rely algorithms research team created machine learning model predict probability death patients pneumonia goal ensure patients would admitted hospital patients could treated outpatients based training data model inferred patients pneumonia history asthma lower risk dying pneumonia general population finding flies face common medical knowledge without deeper understanding data could led erroneous conclusion pneumonia patients history asthma need hospital care urgently truth actually explained pattern data patients history asthma usually admitted directly intensive care unit presented hospital pneumonia lowered risk dying pneumonia compared general population received proactive care would fact much higher risk dying nothing wrong machine learning model per correlation identified based training data set dangerously misleading example shows crucial power goes hand hand domain knowledge human experts established clinical science one without power must hand hand domain knowledge human experts established clinical science medical research therefore essential bring together engineers data scientists clinical experts helps ensure proper validation interpretation insights application made way clinical practice powerful decision support tool still requires human oversight findings recommendations need judged checked clinician based holistic understanding patient context robustness solutions harm appropriate protection deliberate inadvertent misuse promote responsible application also need put safeguards place prevent unintended deliberate misuse robust set control mechanisms help instill trust mitigating potential risks particularly important misuse may subtle could occur inadvertently best intentions example let say algorithm developed help screen lung cancer using scans algorithm proven effective application high sensitivity spotting possible signs lung cancer may seem obvious extend use also diagnostic setting effective reliable use setting algorithm may need tuned differently increase specificity ruling people actually lung cancer totally different algorithm could even perform better different settings different demands one way preventing inadvertent misuse monitor performance solutions clinical practice compare actual outcomes obtained training validation significant discrepancies would call inspection training education also long way safeguarding proper use vital every user keen understanding strengths limitations specific solution fairness solutions developed validated using data representative target group intended use avoiding bias discrimination another priority make sure fair free bias mindful objective data feed bias could easily creep algorithm developed trained based specific subset population applied broader population take spontaneous coronary artery dissection scad rare often fatal condition causes tear blood vessel heart eighty percent scad cases involve women yet women typically underrepresented clinical trials investigating scad develop clinical decision support tool based data clinical trials would learn predominantly male data result tool may fully capture intricacies disease women perpetuating bias already present trials similar risks arise algorithm developed one region world applied another region without revalidating local data first example cardiovascular conditions typically affect people india years earlier people european ancestry therefore algorithm trained european people may fail pick early signs cardiovascular disease indian people prevent biases first development validation must based data accurately represent diversity people target group applied different target group revalidated possibly retrained first development validation must based data accurately represent diversity people target group experience philips diverse organization research teams china india europe also helps create awareness importance fairness diversity backgrounds fosters inclusive mindset transparency solutions require disclosure functions features validation process responsibility ultimate fifth final principle public trust wider adoption healthcare ultimately depend transparency whenever applied solution need open disclose validated data sets used relevant outcomes also clear role healthcare professional making final decision perhaps importantly optimal transparency achieved developing solutions partnership forging close collaboration different actors healthcare system providers payers patients researchers regulators jointly uncover address various needs demands concerns taken consideration developing solutions afterthought right start open informed dialogue shaping future healthcare together taken together
