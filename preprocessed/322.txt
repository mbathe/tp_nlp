microsoft one several companies playing leading role developing facial recognition technology working customers around world acting aggressively efforts improve capability technology recognize faces range ages skin tones last month new evaluation conducted national institute standards technology nist verified progress made developing facial recognition technology ranks top tier across sector algorithms microsoft submitted evaluation consistently ranked accurate nearly accurate algorithms tested believe future facial recognition technology positive role play problems need addressed time need risks potential abuse continued assess technology heading believe three problems governments need address first especially current state development certain uses facial recognition technology increase risk decisions generally outcomes biased cases violation laws prohibiting discrimination second widespread use technology lead new intrusions people privacy third use facial recognition technology government mass surveillance encroach democratic freedoms believe three problems addressed legislation described addressing bias discrimination first especially current state development certain uses facial recognition technology increase risk decisions outcomes experiences biased even violation discrimination laws recent research demonstrated example facial recognition technologies encountered higher error rates seeking determine gender women people color makes especially important microsoft tech companies continue work needed identify reduce errors improve accuracy quality facial recognition tools services work underway making important progress equally critical work customers closely ensure facial recognition services deployed properly ways reduce risks time believe market forces encourage technology innovation needed also believe new laws needed area two distinct reasons first market forces work well potential customers able test facial recognition technology accuracy risks unfair bias including biases arise context specific applications environments tech companies currently vary willingness make technology available purpose result academic tests services omitted market leaders important advocacy organizations tried perform tests almost immediately met rejections criticism providers claim testing deficient society need legislation put impartial testing groups like consumer reports counterparts position test facial recognition services accuracy unfair bias transparent manner believe new laws address need approach requiring transparency legislation require tech companies offer facial recognition services provide documentation explains capabilities limitations technology terms customers consumers understand enabling testing comparisons new laws also require providers commercial facial recognition services enable third parties engaged independent testing conduct publish reasonable tests facial recognition services accuracy unfair bias sensible approach require tech companies make facial recognition services accessible using internet also make available application programming interface technical capability suitable purpose second reason believe new legislation needed area points additional measures new laws address hopeful market forces may eventually solve issues relating bias discrimination witnessed increasing risk facial recognition services used ways may adversely affect consumers citizens today obviously little solace think eventual improvements technology misidentifies used way deprives ability access government services obtain admission event purchase commercial products problems exacerbated organizations deploy facial recognition beyond limits current technology manner different intended designed believe new law help address concerns without imposing onerous obligations businesses users involves legal approach ensuring meaningful human review human beings course immune errors biases believe certain scenarios critical qualified people review facial recognition results make key decisions rather simply turn computers new legislation therefore require entities deploy facial recognition undertake meaningful human review facial recognition results prior making final decisions law deems consequential use cases affect consumers includes decisions may create risk bodily emotional harm consumer may implications human fundamental rights consumer personal freedom privacy may impinged avoiding use unlawful discrimination finally important entities deploy facial recognition services recognize

technology government encroach democratic freedoms human rights democracy always depended ability people assemble meet talk even discuss views private public turn relies ability people move freely without constant government surveillance many governmental uses facial recognition technology protect public safety promote better services public without raising types concerns increasing number services place already encourage subject protections described one potential use facial recognition technology could put fundamental freedoms risk combined ubiquitous cameras massive computing power storage cloud government could use facial recognition technology enable continuous surveillance specific individuals could follow anyone anywhere matter everyone everywhere could time even time use facial recognition technology could unleash mass surveillance unprecedented scale unprecedented unimagined george orwell described novel one vision future would require citizens must evade government surveillance finding way secretly blackened room tap code hand signals arms otherwise cameras microphones capture record faces voices every word orwell sketched vision nearly years ago today technology makes type future possible inevitable must ensure year look like page novel indispensable democratic principle always tenet government law today requires ensure governmental use facial recognition technology remain subject rule law new legislation put path limiting ongoing government surveillance specified individuals protect use facial recognition encroach democratic freedoms legislation permit law enforcement agencies use facial recognition engage ongoing surveillance specified individuals public spaces court order obtained permit use facial recognition services monitoring emergency involving imminent danger risk death serious physical injury person important legislators consider standards obtaining court orders area part believe based traditional rules like probable cause search warrants may narrow circumstances also permissible appropriate uses help locate missing persons worth noting approach builds supreme court recent decisions june court decided

answer resounding yes company microsoft brought four lawsuits government since protect people privacy rights era new technology enable mass surveillance repeatedly sought preserve longstanding protections view timeless values embodied first fourth amendments constitution vantage point important act excessive use facial recognition technology put freedoms risk issues ultimately may find way supreme court one four cases past february begin people elected people protect rights legislators state capitals washington looking beyond law regulation believe new laws regulations indispensable
