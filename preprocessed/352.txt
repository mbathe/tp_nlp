Compared to human decision -making , the nature and the increasing use of AIDA may heighten the risks of systematic misuse . This may result in impacts which are more widespread , perpetuated at greater speed . When used responsibly and effectively , AIDA has significant potential to improve business processes , mitigate risks and facilitate stronger decision -making . 1.2 Thus , the objectives of this set of Principles are as follows : To provide firms providing financial products and services with a set of foundational principles to consider when using AIDA in decision -making To assist firms in contextualising and operationalising governance of use of AIDA in their own business models an d structures To promote public confidence and trust in the use of AIDA 1.3 This set of Principles has been co -created with the financial industry and other relevant stakeholders . In developing this set of Principles , MAS has worked closely with key industry st akeholders through the Fairness , Ethics , Accountability and Transparency ( FEAT ) Committee . MAS has also sought feedback from a range of financial institutions and companies , who have offered their diverse perspectives and inputs . Please refer to the Acknow ledgements in Section 9 . 1.4 In developing this set of Principles , MAS has worked closely with the Personal Data Protection Commission ( PDPC ) , Infocomm Media Development Authority ( IMDA ) to align the Principles with IMDA ’ s AI g overnance initiatives which include the Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of AI and Data and an overall AI Governance Framework . These initiatives aim to help businesses develop and deploy AI technologies in a responsible manner . PDPC ’ s Model AI Governance Framework1 is complementary to this document , and provides additional illustrations and guidance on areas such as selecting appropriate orga nisational governance measures and adopting good data management practices . 1 https : //www.pdpc.gov.sg/Resources/Model -AI-Gov Principles to Promote FEAT in the Use of AI and Data Analytics in Singapore ’ s Financial Sector Monetary Authority of Singapore 4 2 Using This Document 2.1 This document sets out Principles for firms to consider when assessing existing or developing new internal frameworks to govern the use of AIDA . This set of Principles is not intended to replace existing relevant internal governance frameworks . Firms should continue to comply with all applicable laws and requirements . 2.2 This set of Principles is not intended to be prescriptive . Examples provided in this document are purely illustrative . Nonetheless , through the process of ongoing industry engagement , there is scope for MAS to identify areas where more specific or technical guidance would benefit the industry , with this set of Principles serving as a foundational framework for consideration and discuss ion . 2.3 Across all of the Principles set out in this document , firms can calibrate actions and requirements under their internal governance framework based on the materiality of the AIDA -driven decisions . The following list provides non -exhaustive and indica tive examples of considerations that may be used when determining materiality : Extent to which AIDA is used in decision -making ; Complexity of AIDA model ; Extent of automation of process of AIDA -driven decision -making ; Severity and probability of impact o n different stakeholders , including individuals ; Monetary and financial impact ; Regulatory impact ; Options for recourse available . 2.4 As the Principles relate to and reinforce each other , readers are encouraged to view the Principles in totality .

While this definition is broad , the Principles in this document can apply to both complex and straightforward AIDA techniques . Firms using AIDA are encouraged to calibrate their internal governance frameworks based on considerations of materiality , as outli ned in Section 2.3 . 3.3 The following definitions are used in this document : “ AIDA ” refers to artificial intelligence or data analytics , which are defined as technologies that assist or replace human decision -making . “ AIDA Firms ” refers to firms that use AIDA to provide fi nancial products and services . “ AIDA -driven decisions ” refers to decisions and decision outcomes made or supported by AIDA . “ AIDA -driven decision -making ” refers to the process of making decisions using AIDA . “ Data subjects ” refers to individu als and/or firms who are or may be affected by AIDA -driven decisions . “ Models ” refers to the specific AIDA algorithms and algorithmic processes used to arrive at AIDA -driven decisions .

Today , offering different ial treatment to different groups of people is an existing practice and part of current busine ss models . While t he use of AIDA could enable analysis based on segmentation and clustering of data , this also means that differentiation between groups could take place at a greater scale and faster speed . The use of AIDA may also create the ability to id entify or analyse new types of differentiation that could not previously be done . This could perpetuate cases of unjustified differentiation at a systemic level if not properly managed . 5.2 AIDA Firms may have internal governance frameworks in place to assess and set standards of appropriate levels of justifications behind AIDA -driven decisions , including use of specific data attributes . Such internal governance frameworks may also have processes which assess data and models used for AIDA -driven decisions for accuracy , and may be calibrated based on the materiality of the decisions . 5.3 The principle s of Fairness focus on two key aspects – firstly , the justifiability and secondly , the accuracy and bias of AIDA -driven decision s. Justifiability 1 . Individuals or groups of individuals are not system atically disadvantaged through AIDA -driven decisions , unless these decisi ons can be justified . 2 . Use of personal attributes as input factors for AIDA -driven decisions is justified . 5.4 Illustration 1 : An AIDA Firm use s AIDA to decide whether to approve an increase in a customer ’ s credit card limit , b ased on a variety of factors . The Firm provide s justifications to internal approving authorities for the rationale for using each factor according to their internal governance framework . The Firm also justifies how each factor or combinations of different factors with varying weightages may affect the decision . Based on these justifications , some customers may receive approvals for an increase in their credit card lim its while others may not . 5.5 Illustration 2 : An AIDA Firm uses AIDA for customer segmentation to provide more relevant product offerings for different customer groups . This may include using a customer ’ s age , a personal attribute , as an input factor to decid e whether to offer retirement -related financial services and products . Based on the AIDA Firm ’ s internal governance framework , the use of age as an input factor for this AIDA -driven decision may be justified , given the relationship between age and retireme nt .

Data and models used for AIDA -driven decisions are regularly reviewed and validated for accuracy and relevance , and to minimize unintentional bias . 4 . AIDA -driven decisions are regularly reviewed so that models behave as designed and intended . 5.6 Illustration 3 : Based on an internal governance framework , an AIDA Firm puts in place requirements for model validation exercises and testing for errors or unintentional biases . The frequency of exercises or tests depend s on the materialit y of the decision and the complexity of the model . For particularly material and complex deep learning models , an AIDA Firm require s more frequent validation and testing . Conversely , for less material and more straightforwar d models , quarterly , annual or even less frequent validations and tests suffice . 5.7 Illustration 4 : In addition to periodic reviews , the AIDA Firm ’ s internal governance framework also identif ies specific triggers for review , including unexpected changes that invalidate basic model assumption s. For example , an unexpected court decision on whether an entity has defaulted on its debts might trigger a r eview of credit risk parameters to see if the parameters need to be revised .

These ethical standards are expressed through many ways , including company values , codes of conduct and mission statements , and may vary across firms and geographies . Adherence to the se ethical standards applies equally to the use of AIDA . 5 . Use of AIDA is aligned with the firm ’ s ethical standards , values and codes of conduct . 6 . AIDA -driven decisions are held to at least the same ethical standards as human driven decisions . 6.2 Illustration 5 : An AIDA Firm ’ s human resource department has existing recruitment rules that specify that gender should not be a consideration in making hiring decisions , in alignment with their overall company policy on diversity and fair employment . The AIDA Firm deci des to implement a model or algorithm to assist in their filtering and shortlisting of potential employment candidates . Under the AIDA Firm ’ s internal governance framework , t o maintain the same ethical standards as human driven decisions , the model or algo rithm does not use gender as an input or derived attribute . 6.3 Illustration 6 : An AIDA Firm does not have a clear authority that oversees and maintains its ethical standards , and thus decides to establish an organisation -wide ethical review board . In additio n , th e AIDA Firm also consider s setting up project -specific cross functional ethical review board s comprising stakeholders of relevant expertise and independent representatives , which report into the organisation -wide ethical review board .

Such accountability appl ies to all uses of AIDA , whether internally developed or externally sourced . 7.2 AIDA -driven decisions , especially those that could significantly affect data subjects , need to be based on as accurate an understanding of the data subject as possible . Data subjects could provide accurate infor mation about themselves through channels that aim to facilitate communication and seek recourse . 7.3 The principle of Accountability thus focuses on two key aspects – firstly , internal accountability , which is concerned with the AIDA Firm ’ s internal governan ce , and secondly , external accountability , which is concerned with the AIDA Firm ’ s responsibility to data subjects . Internal Accountability 7 . Use of AIDA in AIDA -driven decision -making is approved by the appropriate internal authority . 8 . Firms using AIDA are accountable for both i nternally developed and externally sourced AIDA models . 9 . Firms using AIDA proactively raise management and Board awareness of the ir use of AIDA . 7.4 Illustration 7 : A Firm currently has internal approval structures in place for decision -making , which it choose s to rely on when setting approval authorities for AIDA driven decision -making . For example , currently the Head of Financial Markets approve s all decisions related to the trading function . If the fun ction is lookin g to introduce an AIDA model for the execution of trades , the Head of Financial Markets would similarly approve the use of this model in line with the AIDA Firm ’ s internal governance framework . 7.5 Illustration 8 : When setting approving authorities for AIDA -driven decisions , the Firm ’ s internal governance framework take s into account materiality and complexity of the decision . The Firm sets approving levels at Chief Executive Officer or Board levels for high ly-material decisions , with proper due diligence so that approving authorities have sufficient understanding of the data and model logic used for decision -making .

As a good -to-have , t he Firm organise s regular Staff Town -halls to raise awareness of the use of AIDA within the Firm , which may include department case studies , or sharing of learning points . External Accountability 10 . Data subjects are provided with channels to enquire about , submit appeals for and request r eviews of AIDA -driven d ecisions that affect them . 11 . Verified and relevant supplementary data provided by data subjects are taken into account when performing a review of AIDA -driven decisions . 7.7 Illustration 10 : When informing a data subject of a AIDA -driven decision , the AIDA Firm include s a contact number and email address so that data subjects can enquire about the decision and provide a reasonable basis for review . The Firm adapt s existing frameworks for handling customer enquiries , to assess the materiality of the issue at hand , and the practicality of responding to such requests . 7.8 Illustration 11 : The AIDA Firm provide s the data subject with online data management tools such as privacy or personal data dashboards . Through these dashboards , data subjects may opt to review , update or edit their information for accuracy and relevance . Principles to Promote FEAT in the Use of AI and Data Analytics in Singapore ’ s Financial Sector Monetary Authority of Singapore 12 8 Transparency 8.1 While increased transparency in AIDA Firm s ’ use of AIDA could improve public understanding and confidence in AIDA , excessive transparency could create confusion or unintended opportunities for individuals to exploit or manipulate AIDA models . It is important to balance these considerations in determin ing the appropriate level of transparency in the use of AIDA . In determining levels of transparency , the materiality of the decision is also relevant . 8.2 Data subjects may seek clear explanations about data used for decision -making , how data affects the decision and the consequences on data subjects . Clear explanations do not necessitate exposure of intellectual property or publishing of proprietary source codes . Clear explanations could instead focus on facilita ting the data subject ’ s understanding of the Firms ’ use of AIDA . 12 . To increase public confidence , use of AIDA is proactively disclosed to data subjects as part of general communication . 13 . Data subjects are provided , upon request , clear explanations on what data is used to make AIDA -driven decisions about the data subject and how the data affects the decision . 14 . Data subjects are provided , upon request , clear explanations on the consequences that AIDA -driven decisions may have on them . 8.3 Illustration 12 : An AIDA Firm offering car insurance inform s customers that they will be using data on driving patterns to review customer premiums . The Firm explain s how certain driving patterns may affect premiums . The Firm provide s illustrative diagrams and charts to explain the patterns identified and the impact on different customer groups . The Firm also develop s a user interface to allow customers to vary potential inputs to get a sense of the impact on premium outcomes . A custom er who is charged a higher premium can approach the Firm for a meaningful explanation on the reasons for the increase . The AIDA Firm share s with the customer which customer group he falls into and the corresponding impact on premiums . The AIDA Firm also broadly share s with the customer what data is used to analyse his driving patterns and provide an avenue for the customer to provide more accurate or updated information . In the long term , the customer may choose to change his behaviour and cultivate good dr iving habits to ensure that his premiums do not increase .

For example , the AIDA Firm use s AIDA models for fraud detect ion and to identify possible “ red flags ” . Given materiality considerations and concerns of model manipulation or exploitation , an AIDA Firm decides not to share about the AIDA model used , or provide explanations relating to this area . On the other hand , th e AIDA Firm deploy s an AI phone operator to handle customer calls and engage directly with customers . In this case , the AIDA Firm opt s to begin the conversation by informing the data subject that they are interacting with an AI phone operator .
