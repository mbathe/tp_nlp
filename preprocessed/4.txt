The Code applies to relations that cover ethical aspects of the creation ( design , construction , piloting ) , integration and use of AI technologies at all stages , which are currently not regulated by the national legislation and international rules and/or by acts of technical regulation . The recommendations of this Code are designed for artificial intelligence systems ( hereinafter referred to as AI systems ) used exclusively for civil ( nonmilitary ) purposes . The provisions of the Code may be expanded and/or specified for individual groups of AI Actors in sectorial or local documents on ethics in the field of AI considering the development of technologies , the specifics of the tasks being solved , the class and purpose of AI systems and the level of possible risks , as well as the specific context and environment in which AI systems are being used.AI ETHICS CODE SECTION I ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF CONDUCT AI ETHICS CODE 6 YFDPDFYBT HFPLTJKF 7 SECTION I . ETHICAL PRINCIPLES AND RULES OF CONDUCT1.1 . Human-centered and humanistic approach . Human rights and freedoms and the human as such must be treated as the greatest value in the process of AI technologies development . AI technologies developed by Actors should promote or not hinder the full realization of all human capabilities to achieve harmony in social , economic and spiritual spheres , as well as the highest selffulfillment of human beings . AI Actors should regard core values such as the preservation and development of human cognitive abilities and creative potential ; the preservation of moral , spiritual and cultural values ; the promotion of cultural and linguistic diversity and identity ; and the preservation of traditions and the foundations of nations , peoples , ethnic and social groups . A human-centered and humanistic approach is the basic ethical principle and central criterion for assessing the ethical behavior of AI Actors listed in Section 2 of this Code . 1.2 . Recognition of autonomy and free will of human . AI Actors should take necessary measures to preserve the autonomy and free will of human in the process of decision-making , their right to choose , as well as preserve human intellectual abilities in general as an intrinsic value and a system-forming factor of modern civilization . AI Actors should forecast possible negative consequences for the development of human cognitive abilities at the earliest stages of AI systems creation and refrain from the development of AI systems that purposefully cause such consequences.1 . THE KEY PRIORITY OF AI TECHNOLOGIES DEVELOPMENT IS PROTECTION OF THE INTERESTS AND RIGHTS OF HUMAN BEINGS AT LARGE AND EVERY PERSON IN PARTICULAR 1.3 . Compliance with the law . AI Actors must know and comply with the provisions of the national legislation in all areas of their activities and at all stages of creation , integration and use of AI technologies , i.a . in the sphere of legal responsibility of AI Actors.1.4 . Non-discrimination . To ensure fairness and non-discrimination , AI Actors should take measures to verify that the algorithms , datasets and processing methods for machine learning that are used to group and/or classify data that concern individuals or groups do not entail intentional discrimination . AI Actors are encouraged to create and apply methods and software solutions that identify and prevent discrimination manifestations based on race , nationality , gender , political views , religious beliefs , age , social and economic status , or information about private life ( at the same time , the rules of functioning or application of AI systems for different groups of users wherein such factors are taken into account for user segmentation , which are explicitly declared by an AI Actor , can not be defined as discrimination ) . 1.5 . Assessment of risks and humanitarian impact . AI Actors are encouraged to : • assess the potential risks of the use of an AI system , including social consequences for individuals , society and the state , as well as the humanitarian impact of an AI system on human rights and freedoms at different stages of its life cycle , i.a . during the formation and use of datasets ; • monitor the manifestations of such risks in the long term ; • take into account the complexity of AI systems ’ actions , including interconnection and interdependence of processes in the AI systems ’ life cycle , during risk assessment . In special cases concerning critical applications of an AI system it is encouraged that risk assessment be conducted with the involvement of a neutral third party or authorized official body given that it does not harm the performance and information security of the AI system and ensures the protection of the intellectual property and trade secrets of the developer . 7 AI ETHICS CODE YFDPDFYBT HFPLTJKF 8 9 2 . RESPONSIBILITY MUST BE FULLY ACKNOWLEDGED WHEN CREATING AND USING AI 2.1 . Risk-based approach . The degree of attention paid to ethical AI issues and the nature of the relevant actions of AI Actors should be proportional to the assessment of the level of risk posed by specific AI technologies and systems for the interests of individuals and society . Risk-level assessment shall take into account both known and possible risks , whereby the probability level of threats , as well as their possible scale in the short and long term shall be considered . Making decisions in the field of AI use that significantly affect society and the state should be accompanied by a scientifically verified , interdisciplinary forecast of socio-economic consequences and risks and examination of possible changes in the paradigm of value and cultural development of the society . Development and use of an AI systems risk assessment methodology are encouraged in pursuance of this Code . 2.2 . Responsible attitude . AI Actors should responsibly treat : • issues related to the influence of AI systems on society and citizens at every stage of the AI systems ’ life cycle , i.a . on privacy , ethical , safe and responsible use of personal data ; • the nature , degree and extent of damage that may result from the use of AI technologies and systems ; • the selection and use of hardware and software utilized in different life cycles of AI systems . At the same time , the responsibility of AI Actors should correspond with the nature , degree and extent of damage that may occur as a result of the use of AI technologies and systems . The role in the life cycle of the AI system , as well as the degree of possible and real influence of a particular AI Actor on causing damage and its extent , should also be taken into account.2.3 . Precautions . When the activities of AI Actors can lead to morally unacceptable consequences for individuals and society , which can be reasonably predicted by the relevant AI Actor , the latter , should take measures to prohibit or limit the occurrence of such consequences . AI Actors shall use the provisions of this Code , including the mechanisms specified in Section 2 , to assess the moral unacceptability of such consequences and discuss possible preventive measures . 2.4 . No harm . AI Actors should not allow the use of AI technologies for the purpose of causing harm to human life and/or health , the property of citizens and legal entities and the environment . Any use , including the design , development , testing , integration or operation of an AI system capable of purposefully causing harm to the environment , human life and/or health , the property of citizens and legal entities , is prohibited . 2.5 . Identification of AI in communication with a human . AI Actors are encouraged to ensure that users are duly informed of their interactions with AI systems when it affects human rights and critical areas of people ’ s lives and to ensure that such interaction can be terminated at the request of the user . 2.6 . Data security . AI Actors must comply with the national legislation in the field of personal data and secrets protected by law when using AI systems ; ensure the security and protection of personal data processed by AI systems or by AI Actors in order to develop and improve the AI systems ; develop and integrate innovative methods to counter unauthorized access to personal data by third parties and use highquality and representative datasets obtained without breaking the law from reliable sources .
