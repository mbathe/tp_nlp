Overview of the Action Plan of the Implementation of Council Recommendations for Lithuania for 2017 -2018 ( Annex to NRP ) . CHAPTER II MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK 7 . The economic development scenario for 2018 -2021 prepared by the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the gross domestic product ( hereinafter – GDP ) of Lithuania will grow by an average of 2.7 percent per year in medium term . Taking into account the formed tendencies of the development of the economy and more favourable assumptio ns of external environment , GDP is expected to grow by 3.2 percent i n 2018 and by 2.8 percent in 2019 . 8 . In recent years , improving financial situation of households and good customer expectations encouraged the growth of household consumption expenditure . In 2016 , it reached 3.9 percent . With wages growing faster than in flation , household consumption will remain relatively high . Household expenditure will increase by about 3.7 percent per year in 2018 –2021 and will significantly contribute to GDP growth . 9 . 2017 was a year of investment breakthrough . Expenditures for the formation of gross fixed capital grew by 7.3 per cent . In the medium -term , the growth of economy will be supported by continuing growth level of investment s in the country driven by the need to modernize and streamline business processes of enterprises due to growing foreign demand , more active use of European Strategic Investment Fund and the EU funds investments . In 2018 -2021 , g ross fixed capital formation -related expenditure could grow by about 5.4 percent per year . 10 . Lithuanian exporters will have to continue adapting to changing economic circumstances , managing currency risks , reducing costs of production and increasing operational efficiency . Persisting wide variety of export ( diversification ) will create the preconditions for sustainable export deve lopment in the medium time -period . It is expected that in 2018 , real exports of goods and services will grow by 7 percent , in 2019 – by 5.7 percent , in 2020 – by 5 percent , and in 2021 – by 4.7 percent . 3 11 . In order to be competitive with the increasing pr ice of work force , business will have to increase labour productivity , efficiently use means of product ion and labour resources , and invest in development ( innovation and qualification of human resources ) . 12 . The average monthly salary in the country in 2 017 increased by 8.5 percent ( in the private sector – by 9.5 percent , in the public sector – by 6.8 percent ) and it is the fastest growth since 2009 . In the medium time -period , demand for labour force will continue to exceed supply , and therefore the enforcement to raise wages will remain . In 2018 , the growth rate of the average wage ( it is expected to grow by 6.6 percent ) in the country will also be greatly affected by a rapid growth of the minimum monthly wage , which increased up to EUR 400 from 1 Ja nuary 2018 . The average wage is expected to grow by 6.2 percent in 2019 , and in 2020 and 2021 , by 6 percent . 13 . With economic growth , the rate of unemployment will continue to decrease , and will account for 6.5 percent in 2018 , 6.1 percent – in 2019 , 5.9 percent – in 2020 and 2021 . 14 . Once the effects of one -off factors that triggered a jump of average annual rate of inflation in 2017 have passed , more moderate development of prices is expected in the medium term . Assessing the changed assumptions about o il prices , the average annual inflation rate is expected to reach 2.9 percent in 2018 , and 2.4 percent in 2019 . In the later medium term years , the price change should stand at 2.5 percent on average per year . CHAPTER III POLICY MEASURES THAT HELP TACKLE MAIN ECONOMIC CHALLENGES 15 . In 2018 , the Government prioritised six major reforms : the structural reform of education , covering the levels of secondary education , vocational education and higher education ; health reform , covering levels of all types of t reatment , nursing , measures to promote healthy lifestyle ; a tax reform aimed at making labour taxation more attractive for creation of job vacancies , promot ion of investments and entrepreneurship ; reduction of shadow economy allowing submission of measures to promote fair tax payments ; a reform of the cumulative pension part that would not encourage shrinkage of the level of overall income protection in old age ; innovation reform , which would stimulate investment in innovation , create a major innovation inc entive package , consolidate and strengthen the research system . FIRSTH SECTION LAB OUR MARKET AND EDUCATION POLICY 16 . According to preliminary data of the Statistics Lithuania , the average monthly gross ( before taxation ) wage , including individual enterprises , increased by 8.5 percent in 2017 , or by EUR 66 and amounted to EUR 840 . The average monthly net wage ( after taxation ) was EUR 660 in 2017 and increased by 9.6 percent over the year , or by EUR 58 . Real wage ( net wage , taking into account the av erage change in consumer prices – 3.7 percent ) increased by 5.7 per cent per year . In 2017 , gross wage grew more rapidly in the private sector ( 9.5 percent or EUR 72 ) and amounted to 4 EUR 833 , while in the public sector it increased by 6.8 percent , or EUR 54 , and amounted to EUR 854 . The average gross monthly wage of employees in budget institutions in 2017 amounted to about EUR 831 and increased by 7.4 per cent during the year . During the year , gross wages increased in enterprises of all economic activities , in particular wholesale and retail trade ( by 11.1 percent ) as well as information and communication ( by 10.3 percent ) . 17 . According to the Economic Activity S cenario for 2018 -2021 , published by the Ministry of Finance , it is expec ted that in the period from 2018 -2021 , wages will increase by 6.2 per cent on average per year . Wages will be the fastest growing in private sector , especially in the areas where labour demand is high and wages are the lowest . 18 . From 1 July 2017 , the Labor Code came into force , the aim of which is more flexible regulation of labo ur relations in order to encourage employers to create new high -quality job place s , while ensuring security for employees . The Labour Code i ntroduced more new types of employment co ntracts , provides for the formation of more flexible working time regulation , shortening of the notice periods when dismissing employees and reduction of severance pay -offs by transferring part of the severance pay to the Long -Term Benefits Fund , and the p ossibility of concluding fixed -term employment contracts for permanent jobs . New provisions that provide lifelong learning opportunities , ensure a balance between family and work life , non -discrimination at work , and the protection of personal data are ens hrined . One of the factors that led to a decrease in the number of minimum wage earners is the fact that the new Labour Code states that the minimum wage may be paid only for unskilled work . The wages of workers who did unskilled work and received a minimu m wage till 1 July 2017 , increased after 1 July 2017 . In July 2017 , the minimum monthly wage was received by almost 23 percent ( i.e. , 62 thousand ) less workers compared to the same period in 2016 , in July 2017 , compared to December 2017 , by 13 percent less , i.e . almost 27 thousand workers . Labour market 19 . Under the Interinstitutional Action Plan for the Programme of Raising the Employment 2014 -2020 following measures are aimed at integrating the people facing difficulties on the labour market into the labour market are planned : support for start -ups , partially funded business investment projects are implemented in the areas with the highest unemployment level , new job places are established for local unemployed people , part of the wage is compensated to recruit people facing difficulties on the labour market , and the recruitment of socially disadvantaged people in social enterprises is supported . 20 . The Lithuanian Labour Exchange , under the Ministry of Social Security and Labour ( hereinafter - the Labou r Exchange ) , will implement projects with the use of the European Social 5 Fund aimed at increasing opportunities for the integration of young people , the unskilled , the long term unemployed , the elderly ( 54+ ) and people with disabili ties into the labour market . During the implementation of the project “ TAPK – Tavo ateities perspektyvų kūrimas ” ( English : CYFP – Creating Your Future Perspectives ) in 2018 –2020 , as many as 23.5 thousand clients of the Labour Exchange – the long -term unemp loyed who have been looking for job for one year or more , unskilled persons and persons with disabilities – will be provided with the opportunity to obtain qualification and employment according to the acquired profession ; employers who recruit the clients of labour exchange will also be provided with possibilit y , if necessary , to use the measure of subsidy . It is estimated that 12.2 thousand non -working population will take part in vocational training where they will acquire or improve their existing quali fications/ competences in order to meet the requirements of job vacancies . 0.6 thousand persons will be able to obtain practice under apprenticeship contracts , and 1,4 thousand persons – under vocational skills trainees hip . 1.4 thousand job seekers will be granted possibility to participate in the activities related to the recognition of competencies acquired by means of non -formal and self -education . 2.7 thousand persons will be offered to obtain working skills according to available or ac quired profession . 7.7 thousand individuals will be involved in recruitment measure through subsidies in order to be able to return to the open labo ur market as soon as possible .

The Labour Exchange helps the elderly get back to the labour market by offer ing them a retraining by acquiring a profession in demand on the market or by offering a wage subsidy to a prospective employer when they are employed . It is planned that during the i mplementation of the “ Take advantage of the opportunity ” project , 4.0 tho usand clients of the Labour Exchange over 54 years of age will be able to acquire profession in demand on the market or job skills in specific workplaces in 2018 –2020 . 22 . By Q IV of 2018 , it is planned to prepare the cooperation and integrated assistance model , and an action plan for its implementation thereof municipal administrations that organize and provide monetary social assistance and social services , develop and implement raising the employment programs , and labo ur exchanges implementing active lab our market policy measures . This model will combine the promotion of employment and motivation services for unemployed and persons receiving social support . 23 . In 2018 , the optimization of the activities of Labo ur Exchange and territorial labo ur exchanges will be continued by eliminating excessive management chains , redistributing human resources and directing them to the direct work with clients as much as possible . From 1 October 2018 , structural changes will take place and employment promotion policy wi ll be implemented by 6 the Employment Service under the Ministry of Social Security and Labo ur . Following the structural changes , the burden on the load per employee would be reduced to 275 c lients ( now 405 ) . 24 . The Ministry of Social Security and Labour has drafted a Strategy for the Demography , Migration and Integration of 2018 –2030 ( hereinafter – the Strategy ) , which is submitted for consideration to the Parliament . The goal of the project is to solve systemati cally the demographic challenges in the country , to increase birth rate , reduce emigration , promote return migration and improve the quali ty of life of the elderly .

In order to ensure the implementation of general education financing methodology throughout the country , a working group has been formed which has to prepare the restructuring of preschool , early childhood and general education financing . 26 . According to international statistics , Lithuania is one of the countries paying the lowest wages to teachers . More than half of the teachers ’ wages range from EUR 400 to 800 , and only about one -third of teachers are paid at least EUR 1000 . In order to create more favourable conditions of the payment for teachers ’ work , it is e xpected that from 1 September 2018 a new staff remuneration system will be applied throughout Lithuania . The aim is optimize inefficiently used educational infrastructure and direct the saved funds to educational needs . 27 .

The amendments to the Law on Establishment of Reference Values and Basic Rate of Fines and Penalties of Social Security Benefits entered into force from 1 January 2018 , which established a new starting rate for social security benefits – the size of minimum consumption needs ( hereinafter – MVPD ) and valid starting rates of social security benefits – basic social benefits , bases of relief pensions , the target compensation bases , link of state -sponsored income with this size . The law stipulates that starting from 2019 , the basic social benefit may not be less than 16 percent , the relief pension base may not be less than 54 percent , the target compensation base may not be less than 47 percent , state -sponsored income may not amount to less than 50 percent than last year ’ s MVPD . This means that the MVPD will be calculated on annual basis and the amount of social support will increase depending on the increasing annual inflation , the prices of food and non-food products and services . 10 49 . A new wording of the Law on Benefits for Childre n entered into force from 1 January 2018 . The new version of the law validate the payment of child benefit ( child money ) of EUR 30 , as a universal benefit , to all children from birth to 18 years of age or older if they learn according to general education programme , but not longer before they reach the age of 21 years . Families who raise and ( or ) foster one or two children will be entitled to an additional child benefit if the family income per person per month is lower than the 1.5 state -supported income s ize ( from 2018 – less than EUR 183 ) : for a child from birth to 2 years – EUR 28.5 , from 2 to 18 years of age and older if they learn according to general education programme , but not longer before they reach the age of 21 years – EUR 15.2 . In addition , a c hild benefit for families raising and ( or ) fostering three or more children is paid without considering the income of the family . It is estimated that in 2018 , 410 thousand children ( a total of 530.8 thousand children ) will receive an additional child bene fit and the risk of poverty among children from birth to the age group of 18 will decrease by about 2.7 percentage points ( from 25.6 to 22.9 percent ) . 50 . Considering the results of the monitoring of the implementation of the legal regulation of social assistance , in order to increase the scope and adequacy of provision of monetary social assistance , ensure better financial support to f amilies raising children , and motivate the active integration of recipients of benefits into the labour market , Law on M onetary Social Support for Deprived Citizens has been amended . From 1 January 2018 , i t is established that when allocating monetary social support , the families raising children will receive a higher social benefit and compensations for heating , hot and dr inking water costs , as child benefit paid according to the Law on Benefits to Children , is not included in th e family income . T he following tolerable income level has been established : the part of income related to the employment relationship ( depending on the family composition and the number of children in the family from 15 to 35 percent ) is not included in the family ( personal ) income . In order to make monetary social assistance more effective , the list of types of additional social support in new forms has been expanded , providing for a legal basis for municipalities to allocate not only an one -off benefit , but also targeted , periodic and conditional benefits . Changes will particularly affect working families and families with children : the size of mone tary social support ( the social benefit per person per month is expected to increase by about 22 percent in 2018 ( from EUR 65.5 to EUR 80 ) will increase and the real income of needy families will increase as well ( due to the part of the income from work an d benefits to the child not included in the family income ) . In addition , about 20 thousand residents of Lithuania will receive monetary social support . 51 . By amend ing the Law on Social Insurance Pensions , the social insurance pension system is being refor med . Amendments to the law entered into force on 1 January 2018 : the procedure for calculating social insurance pensions is changed , it becomes clearer and more transparent ; pension 11 rates are more closely linked to the paid pension insurance contributions ; it is expected to create conditions ensuring the financial sustainability of the pension system and the adequacy of pension rates . A lso , the amendments to the law provide for a utomatic indexation of pensions based on clear criteria . Social insurance pensions will be automatically indexed each year according to the floating 7-year average fund growth rate of the wage . Under the new pension indexation procedure , from 1 January 2018 , social insurance pe nsions were indexed by 6.94 per cent . The procedure for calculating the amount of incapacity for work has changed as well – instead of the distribution of pension amounts by 3 groups , the amounts of these pensions are directly related to capacity for work determined to person by 5 percent interval . 52 . The automatic mechanism for indexation of social insurance pensions will maintain the social security pension system financially sustainable in the medium and long term s. However , in the medium term , a 0.64 percent of GDP deficit resulting from relief allowances and state pensions is projected . In this regard , the Plan of the Implementation of the P rogramme of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania provides for the systematic evaluation of the state pension system and submission of proposal s for its improvement . By using EC technical assistance for fulfilment of structural reforms , the assessment of the financial liabilities of the state pension system is performed in Q II of 2018 . 53 . From 1 January 2018 , the Ministry of Finance has taken over all the debts of the budget of State Social Insurance Fund . It is verified in the Law on Approving the Financial Indicators of the State Budget and Municipal Budgets for 2018 . This takeover will n ot change the amount of consolidated national debt . In recent years , the budget of State Social Insurance Fund has been balanced . Transferring debt to the state budget will allow seeing financial flows clearer , easier planning of changes in contributions a nd payments . Also , the costs of financial administration will decrease and the fund will save more than EUR 100 million per year , which was comprised of the interest . At the end of 2017 , the debt of the budget of State Social Insurance Fund amounted to EUR 3.7 billion : it comprised EUR 3.682 billion loan and EUR 3 million interest . 54 . The tax reform intro duced by the Government in 2018 aims at making labo ur taxation more attractive to creation of job places , the consideration of the issue of maximum income from which the social security contributions would not be calculated is considered : it is discussed whom and under what conditions the “ ceiling ” for social security contributions could be set . 55 . The social housing fund will be expanded : the housing available on the market will be rented , incentives to the tenants will be introduced , and all persons and families entitled to receive support for renting the housing will be entitled to receive compensation for part of the housing rental . 12 Health protection 56 . On purpose to prolong the years of healthy life , it is necessary to actively promote healthy lifestyle by develop ing such skills from birth , improve me ntal health of the society , and reduce the use of psychoactive substances : 56.1. from 1 January 2018 , the requirements for selling alcohol and advertising it have been tightened : persons under the age of 20 may not buy , possess and use alcoholic beverages , the time of sale of alcoholic beverages has been defined , and the advertising all typ es of alcohol has been prohibited . In 2018 –2019 , active prevention of the use of psychoactive substances will continue . It is planned that the consumption of alcohol per one resident of the country over 15 years of age , in litres of absolute alcohol will d ecrease from 17.8 ( in 2014 ) to 12.4 ( in 2020 ) ; 56.2. improving the accessibility and quality of public health care services , in 2018 special attention is paid to improving the health of pupils . It is planned that the share of school -age children who eat ve getables will increase from 36.5 percent ( in 2016 ) to 45 percent ( in 2020 ) , while the share of school -age children , who do sports 60 minutes or longer every day after the lessons will increase by 0.5 percent every year from 9.7 percent in 2016 and will rea ch at least 11.7 percent in 2020 ; 56.3. while improving public mental health , the aim in 2018 will be to reduce the number of suicides , by developing the system for early identif ication of possible suicides and provision of complex assistance through intro duction of innovative preventive measures for strengthening mental health . It is planned that suicide mortality ( mortality rate per 100 thousand inhabitants ) will decrease from 30.8 ( in 2015 ) to 19.5 ( in 2020 ) .

While implement ing the tasks of economic activity , the diplomatic services and the diaspora network of Lithuania are being involved more actively , visits and cooperation initiatives are being coordinated . Long -term targe t measures are aimed at strengthening the image of Lithuania and business sectors abroad , improving the national economic representation system , and refin ing the skills of export specialists . From the end of February 2018 , granting export credit guarantees ( EUR 8 million is allocated ) to SMEs were commence d. Preparatory work s are currently under way , and in Q II of 2018 , it is planned to launch the implementation of measure of portfolio guarantee for factoring ( EUR 4.3 million is allocated ) . Both an export credit guarantee and a portfolio guarantee for factoring measure will help SME s to expand the ir export activities , strengthen their competitiveness and promote exports of goods of Lithuanian origin . In 2017 , a one -stop shop system for exp orters was introduced . CHAPTER IV IMPLEMENTATION OF TH E OBJECTIVES OF THE “ EUROPE 2020 ” STRATEGY FIRST SECTION EMPLOYMENTM , POVERTY AND SOCIAL EXCLUSION Rate of employment of persons in the 20 –64 age group Table 1 . Rate of employment in the 20 -64 age group EU 2020 target National 2020 target Situation in Lithuania in 2016 An employment rate of 75 percent in the 20 -64 age group An employment rate of 72.8 percent in the 20 -64 age group An employment rate of 76.0 percent in the 20 -64 age group 102 . The rate of employment in the 20 -64 age group of individuals was 7 6.0 percent in 201 7 and , compared to 201 6 , it increased by 0.8 percentage point . 103 . In 2017 , the rate of unemployment in Lithuania was 7.1 percent , which is 0.8 percent age point less than in 2016 . The rate of unemployment of men was 8.5 percent , and the rate of unemployment of women was 5.7 percent in 2017 . Over the year , the unemployment of men has decreased by 0.6 percent , and women – by 1 percent . In 2017 , the youth unemployment rate ( 15-24 years old ) was 13.3 percent and was 1.2 percent lower than in 2016 . In 2017 , the long-term unemployment rate was 2.7 percent and was 0.3 percent lower than in 2016 . 26 104 . The Action Programme instrument for developing entrepreneurship skills of residents and initiatives for supporting the establishment and development of businesses in rural areas and areas with high unemployment levels is being implemented in 2018 . 105 . Active labour market policy measures for the support of integration of the unemployed into the labour market are applied in 2018 . The priority is given to unqualified long -term unemployed persons aiming to provide them with marketable skills and develop compe tencies meeting employer requirements . 106 . In order to ensure a rapid and sustainable transition of young people to the labour market , reduce the rate of unemployment of young people , the implementation of the Youth Guarantee Initiative and other programmes promoting youth employment are being continued in 2018 . Individuals facing the risk of poverty or social exclusion Table 2 . Individ uals facing the risk of poverty or social exclusion EU 2020 target National 2020 target Situation in Lithuania in 2016 To reduce the number of people living in poverty and facing social exclusion or people in danger of poverty or social exclusion by at least 20 million To reduce the number of people living in poverty and facing social exclusion by at least 170 thousand people , and the number of these people in 2020 must not exceed 814 thousand 871 thousand residents facing the risk of poverty or social exclusion 107 . According to data of 201 6 , improving economic and employment indicators did not help reduce poverty in the country . The number of people facing the risk of poverty or social exclusion was 30.1 percent in 201 6 ( compared to 29.3 percent in 201 5 ) . The data of statistical research of income and living conditions conducted by the Statistics Lithuania revealed that the poverty risk level was 21.9 percent in Lithuania in 201 6 . About 6 30 thousand residents of Lithuania lived below the risk of poverty threshold in 201 6 , which decreased by 0.3 percent compared to 2015 . 108 . The highest poverty risk rate was in the group aged 65 and over . In 2016 , it amounted to 27.7 percent and increased by 2.7 percent compared to 2015 . The increase was determined by an increase in the poverty risk level resulting from increased labour income and a relatively small increase of old -age pensions . 109 . The poverty risk level of people aged 18 -64 compared to previous years decreased by 0.4 percent and it was 19.1 percent i n 2016 ; of children under 18 – decreased by 3.3 percent and 27 amounted to 25.6 percent . Decline w as affected by rising wages , decreased unemployment , grow ing social security costs for families and children , and raising the minimum monthly wage . 110 . In order to increase availability of social services , the development of inpatient a nd outpatient social service infrastructure will be continued in 2018 , providing integral assistance at home ( nursing and social care ) . 111 . Providing support to the most deprived persons , the implementation of the project funded by the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived is planned in 2017 –2018 ( value of EUR 32.83 million ) . The plan is to provide food assistance to about 280 thousand most deprived persons . From 2018 , additional activities will be funded that will aim to reduce social exclusion and/or to fight social misfortune more resolutely and more sustainably , for example , various recommendations and consultations – on balanced nutrition ; on budget ma nagement ; legal , medical , psychological assistance ; organized vario us trainings ( courses ) on the topic of food production , psychological/emotional training , handicrafts , motivations/self -esteems ; occupation for children : day camp , after -school activities , trips , additional training , etc . 112 . In order to create the system of comprehensively provided services , which would allow every child , a disabled person or his family members ( carers , guardians ) to receive individual services depending on need and the necessary assistance in the community , the 2014 –2020 action plan for the transition from institutional care to family and community -based services to the disabled and children deprived of parental care is being implemented . SECOND SECTION INNOVA TIONS , RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Table 3 . Investments in research and development ( hereinafter – R & D ) EU 2020 target National 2020 target Situation in Lithuania in 2017 Increasing investment in R & D to 3 percent of GDP Increasing investment in R & D to 1.9 percent of GDP Investment in R & D accounted for 0.85 percent of GDP 113 . In 2016 , EUR 327.6 million were allocated to R & D work s , which made 0.85 percent of GDP . Com pared to 2015 , the ratio of R & D expenditure to GDP fell by 0.19 percentage points ( in 2015 R & D expenditure was 1.04 percent of GDP ) . This was mostly influenced by 53 percent reduction of R & D financing by foreign funds , the majority of which comprised the EU funds reallocated through the state budget . It should be noted that in 2016 , compared with 2015 , business investment in R & D significantly increased ( 14.8 percen t ) and almost reached the level of government investments . R & D financing from business funds amounted to EUR 127.7 million , 28 government funds – EUR 128.4 million . In order to encourage investments in R & D , Lithuania is implementing Smart Specialization S trategy , where national R & D development policies and priorities that reflect strengths and greatest potential of our national economy and science are identified . The funding in R & D provided for the EU funding period of 20 14–2020 amounts to EUR 678.9 million . 114 .
