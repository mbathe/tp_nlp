Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) systems are changing workplaces . AI systems have the potential to improve workplaces , but ensuring trustworthy use of AI in the workplace means addressing the ethical risks it can raise . This paper reviews possible risks in terms of human rights ( privacy , fairness , agency and dignity ) ; transparency and explainability ; robustness , safety and security ; and accountability . The paper also reviews ongoing policy action to promote trustworthy use of AI in the workplace . Existing legislation to ensure ethical workplaces must be enforced effectively , and serve as the foundation for new policy . Economy- and society-wide initiatives on AI , such as the EU AI Act and standard-setting , can also play a role . New workplace-specific measures and collective agreements can help fill remaining gaps .
