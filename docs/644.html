  <h2 id="toc1">About this document / what’s new</h2>
  <p>This is the first update to the Government  of Canada Information Technology Strategic Plan, published in June 2016. This  document provides insight into the digital direction being established by the  Government of Canada (<abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>). This  document  can be considered as  a directive.</p>
  <p>This Strategic Plan sets the information  management (<abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>) and information technology (<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>) direction for the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> and  identifies enterprise-wide priorities and key activities for departments,<sup id="fn1-rf"><a class="fn-lnk" href="#fn1"><span class="wb-inv">Footnote </span>1</a></sup> including those that provide services to other departments. It is a key input  to the departmental <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> planning process as an element of the prioritization  framework used to identify overall <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> investment and work priorities for the  <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>. As part of this process, departments should use this document to internally  prioritize <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> investments and initiatives, and demonstrate alignment with enterprise  direction. </p>
  <p>For service provider departments such as Shared  Services Canada (<abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>) and Public Services and Procurement Canada (<abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>), this  Strategic Plan identifies foundational priorities and activities that are required  in order to modernize service delivery and improve sustainability. Completion  of these initiatives will enable departments to partake in the enterprise  approach while moving toward digital program and service delivery for  Canadians.</p>
  <p>This update addresses feedback provided  through consultation with the public in summer and fall 2016 and with the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> Chief  Information Officer (<abbr title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</abbr>) and Information Management Senior Official communities  in February 2017. This plan:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>closes gaps identified through  public consultation in the areas of accessibility, open source and procurement</li>
    <li>clarifies alignment with <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>  priorities and strategies</li>
    <li>clarifies areas that need  improvement</li>
    <li>further develops the case for  change</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This plan addresses the key message  from the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> community that <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> supports <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>, which must support the  business. </p>
  <p>This plan also brings together the foundational  enablers of information, data, technology and security required to deliver open  and transparent government and improved services to Canadians.</p>

  <h2 id="toc2">Message  from the Government of Canada Chief Information Officer</h2>
  <img class="pull-right mrgn-lft-md col-md-3" src="/content/dam/tbs-sct/images/information-technology-project-management/20171031-8833-alex_benay.jpg" alt="Chief Information Officer of the Government of Canada">
  <p>Digital capabilities continue to transform  the way individuals and businesses work. In parallel, a data revolution is  taking place that requires transformative action to support different forms of  collaboration. The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> must adapt to meet demands and expectations from clients,  stakeholders, partners and employees. This update to the Government of Canada  Information Technology Strategic Plan (June 2016) is an interim step to a  larger digital policy and strategy that is currently under development for the 2018  to 2019 fiscal year.</p>
  <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> delivers a broad range of programs  and services to individuals and businesses in Canada and abroad. <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> and <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  support the government in providing these programs and services.</p>
  <p>Over the last few years, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> has taken  the first steps to shift toward an enterprise approach to managing information,  data, technology and security. This direction supports priorities identified in  recent budgets, ministers’ mandate letters, reports and audits while responding  to key drivers.</p>
  <p>This plan creates a framework and sets  direction for the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> to become an open and service-oriented organization that provides  programs and services to citizens and businesses in simple, modern and  effective ways that are optimized for digital and available anytime, anywhere  and from any device.</p>
  <p>Consistent with the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s first Strategic  Plan, the following 4 strategic goals frame the direction for the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>service</li>
    <li>value</li>
    <li>security </li>
    <li>agility</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Four strategic areas of action will achieve  these goals over the next 4 years and beyond. Each area of focus, “service”,  “manage”, “security” and “community”, details specific actions and activities  that are currently underway or that represent new enterprise directions.</p>
<p>“Service” focuses on building  and evolving <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> foundational elements, including processes, practices and  infrastructure, to enable implementation of current capabilities, technologies  and solutions. Focusing on these elements will ultimately result in improved  programs and services for Canadians and better internal services for government  employees through development of a modern, reliable, interoperable and  accessible <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> environment that:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>allows for secure sharing of  information and data </li>
    <li>improves the government’s  ability to leverage opportunities across multiple channels</li>
  </ul>
  <p>“Manage” addresses how the  management and governance of <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> across government ensure that <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  investments take advantage of economies of scale, demonstrate value and are  sustainable. This goal encompasses:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>a strengthened governance  approach</li>
    <li>the evolution of <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  management practices, process and tools </li>
    <li>a focus on innovation and  sustainability </li>
  </ul>
  <p>“Secure” focuses on  safeguarding sensitive government data and ensuring that Canadians who access  online services can trust the government with their personal information. Security  involves:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>layered defences to reduce  exposure to cyberthreats</li>
    <li>increased awareness and  understanding to proactively manage such threats</li>
    <li>protective measures to enable  the secure processing and sharing of data and information across government</li>
  </ul>
  <p>As the shift to digital services increases  and the sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks grow, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s defences  must also evolve. </p>
  <p>“Community” focuses on:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>building a high-performing  <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> workforce that has the skills and mindset needed to work effectively in  an open digital environment</li>
    <li>ensuring that public service  employees have a modern workplace, professional development and the <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> tools  they need to do their jobs</li>
  </ul>
  <p><abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> employees and the environment they work  in are vital because the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s employees are its greatest asset in delivering  the kind of government that Canadians want.</p>
  <p>Progress toward achieving the 4 strategic  goals outlined in this Strategic Plan will be tracked, evaluated and reported.  As it evolves, the plan will require the government to make investment choices.  The plan will be reviewed yearly to ensure it stays up to date and relevant,  supported by an implementation roadmap to track and report on progress (see <a href="#toc11">Appendix&nbsp;B</a>).  Departments, through their departmental <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> plans, will detail how this  enterprise approach will be implemented in their organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <p>With this Strategic Plan, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> has set  out a clear path to obtaining maximum benefit from the money it spends on  <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>. Implementing this agenda is crucial to ensuring that the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> is ready and  able to meet the needs and expectations of Canadians in the years ahead. </p>
  <p>This plan represents the last instalment  before we proceed to a broader agenda based on digital government adoption,  supported by the right technologies.</p>

<section>
  <h2 id="toc3">Introduction</h2>
  <p>Digital capabilities continue to transform  the way individuals and businesses work. In parallel, a data revolution is  taking place that requires transformative action to support different forms of  collaboration. The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> must adapt to meet demands and expectations from clients,  stakeholders, partners and employees. This update to the Government of Canada  Information Technology Strategic Plan (June 2016) is an interim step to a  larger digital policy and strategy that are currently under development for the  2018 to 2019 fiscal year.</p>
  <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> is made up of more than 100&nbsp;organizations  that deliver a broad range of programs and services to individuals and  businesses in Canada and abroad. <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> and <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> support the government in providing  these programs and services. </p>
  <p>In each <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> department, <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> is operated  separately and focuses on fulfilling the individual mandate of the department.  This siloed approach continues to lead to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>inefficiencies through  duplication of platforms</li>
    <li>incompatibility of systems and  data models</li>
    <li>inconsistent service delivery and  standards</li>
    <li>lack of information sharing</li>
    <li>inability to find information</li>
    <li>other factors</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This approach has led to complex,  time-consuming and costly client interactions with government.</p>
  <p>Similarly, the <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> and <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> workforces are  managed separately and in silos, leading to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>inconsistent and sometimes  limited professional development</li>
    <li>greater outsourcing </li>
    <li>weak integration of roles and  functions that fit closely together</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A whole-of-government or “enterprise”  approach is being taken to address some of these challenges through the  creation of a common <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> foundation as a first step. The responsibility for  delivering <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> services to core departments is now shared between central  providers such as <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>. <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> cybersecurity is the shared responsibility of  <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>, Communications Security Establishment Canada, and <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>, in  partnership with departments. The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat’s (<abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>’s)  Chief Information Officer Branch (<abbr title="Chief Information Officer Branch">CIOB</abbr>) supports the Treasury Board by:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>developing strategy</li>
    <li>setting government-wide policy </li>
    <li>providing implementation  guidance for <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>, service, access to information, privacy and security</li>
    <li>establishing technology  standards for the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr></li>
  </ul>
  <p>A number of priorities have been identified  at the federal level through recent budgets and ministers’ mandate letters,  Destination 2020, reports and audits. This <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> Strategic Plan for <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> supports  these priorities by setting a path for continued evolution to an enterprise  approach. It also proposes to address additional <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> challenges by responding  to the following key drivers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>citizens’ expectations</li>
    <li>workplace and workforce  evolution</li>
    <li>privacy and security</li>
    <li>the enterprise approach</li>
    <li><abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> sustainability and aging <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr></li>
  </ul>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc3-1">Citizens’ expectations</h3>
      <p>Citizens expect their government to be  open, transparent and accountable. They also expect their government to deliver  real and meaningful results fairly, efficiently and responsibly. Canadians want  and deserve programs and services that provide the best experience for them,  when and where they need it, and in a client-centred manner. This means that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>services are simple and easy to  access and use;  services are essentially user centric</li>
        <li>data is shared and reused where  appropriate</li>
        <li>interactions with government are  consistent </li>
        <li>there are connections across  jurisdictions (federal, provincial, territorial, municipal) where it makes  sense</li>
        <li>services are digitally enabled  and seamless</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Citizens value government that is open with  its data and other business information yet protects their privacy. Canadians accessing  and using open information and data generates economic opportunities and  increases trust and engagement in government activities.</p>
      <p>Citizens want to be assured that  departments are using the best available information and data from a variety of  authoritative sources to make evidence-based decisions with respect to  policies, programs and services that affect everyone. In addition, they want access  to digital tools to better participate in policy and program development. </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc3-2">Workplace and workforce evolution</h3>
      <p>Employees expect to have modern and effective tools that are interconnected, intuitive and accessible when and where they need them.&nbsp;The GC cannot properly serve  Canadians if its public service has outdated tools. Clients and employees are supported by updated business processes to make day-to-day work efficient and add value to their efforts. They want to be part of a networked workforce and want an experience that is open, inclusive, nimble and optimized for digital. Employees in a modern workplace need digital tools that promote collaboration, information sharing and increased productivity, and that are accessible to and usable by people with disabilities. </p>
  </section>
  <section>     
    <h3 id="toc3-3">Privacy and security</h3>
      <p>Cybersecurity is an ever-evolving aspect of  any <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> strategy and plan. Consolidating systems prompts important  opportunities but also leads to a greater “attack surface” that requires  enhanced security measures to minimize risks. Inconsistent management of  government networks and security profiles of government end-point devices (computer  devices that connect to the Internet) also have the potential to increase the  risk of cyberattack.</p>
      <p>As the government moves to an “open by  default” culture, it must continue to balance openness and transparency with  the requirements for information and data privacy and security that Canadians  have come to expect. Greater investment in cybersecurity is  required to maintain these expectations.</p>
</section>
  <section>     
    <h3 id="toc3-4">The enterprise approach</h3>
     <p>Sharing infrastructure and information,  when appropriate, and using common <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> solutions to meet common needs is one  part of leveraging information and technology in an enterprise approach.  Another aspect is addressing requirements for security, privacy, interoperability,  accessibility and open information.</p>
      <p>For Canadians, it is important to ensure a  consistent end-user experience government-wide, regardless of geographical  location. Issues of latency (delays in transmission), bandwidth, security,  infrastructure, service levels and other considerations need to be taken into  account in designing programs and services. </p>
      <p>An enterprise approach also means that the  size and complexity of <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>-enabled projects are increasing as we move toward a  more horizontal delivery model. Stronger prioritization and authoritative  governance is needed to make enterprise decisions on <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> investments. Such an  approach will change projects where scalable and rapid deployment of <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  business solutions to accommodate the size and complexity of various departments  is needed. These solutions must also be adaptable to meet evolving business  needs.</p>
      <p>In support of the enterprise approach, a  new <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> Enterprise Architecture Review Board (<abbr title="Enterprise Architecture Review Board">EARB</abbr>) has been established to  further the “whole of government as one enterprise” vision. It is integrated  into the larger <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> governance structure and looks at alignment of initiatives,  system and solution gaps and overlaps, development of new digital capabilities  and innovation opportunities, setting technology standards and providing <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  investment direction.</p>
</section>
  <section>     
    <h3 id="toc3-5"><abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> sustainability and aging <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr></h3>
    <p>Information and data are growing  exponentially, and it is increasingly challenging to find, use and share these  assets. Modern and efficient <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> solutions ensure long-term access to  information and data of business value. Such information and data must be  preserved to minimize the risk of it becoming obsolete.</p>
      <p>In order to maintain access to quality  information and data, and to continue programs and services for Canadians, there  is a continued need to renew the government’s aging and mission-critical <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  infrastructure and systems that are at risk of breaking down. <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> infrastructure  transformation is proceeding slower than anticipated; the complexity of these  initiatives has caused some delays and procurement is taking longer than  planned. Funding pressures are arising, in part, from stronger than forecasted  growth in demand in  digital government and from requirements to maintain existing <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> environments  longer than was anticipated. Chronic under-investment puts the government’s  ability to deliver some essential services to Canadians at risk. New mechanisms  are being established to improve stability of existing systems and services  such as use of cloud and other alternative service options to better balance  infrastructure supply and demand. While progress has been made to rationalize  applications, the  GC still operates over 8700 applications. In addition,  current system health indicators signal that more work is needed  to address the risks associated with aging <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>. These factors make cloud adoption  difficult.</p>
<p>Effectively addressing these expectations  and challenges will require new ideas and approaches. Departmental CIOs and  their departments will increasingly be working with peers in other jurisdictions  (provincial and municipal), academia, and the private sector through existing  and new forums such as the Public Sector Chief Information Officer Council, the  Open Government Partnership, the Digital  Advisory Board and their supporting sub-committees  and working groups to collaborate, learn and work more strategically. </p>

<h2 id="toc4">The vision</h2>
  	<p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> is an open and service-oriented  organization that delivers programs and services to citizens and businesses in  simple, modern and effective ways that are optimized for digital and available  anytime, anywhere and from any device. Digitally, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> must operate as one to  benefit all Canadians.</p>
<section>
    <h3 id="toc4-1">Digital services</h3>
      <p>Information and data management, <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> and cybersecurity  are enablers for <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> digital services and play critical roles in achieving this  vision.</p>
      <p><abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> solutions are connected and  interoperable, and facilitate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>information and data sharing</li>
        <li>“big data” analytics</li>
        <li>collaboration </li>
        <li>an open-by-default approach</li>
        <li>user centric development</li>
        <li>adoption of open standards</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These solutions enable the use of high-quality  government data to inform decisions and identify innovative approaches to  public policy. The use of enabling technologies such as cloud and social media  offer additional ways to engage with Canadians and the world.</p>
    </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc4-2">Open and accessible</h3>
      <p>Information and data are available,  accessible and proactively released to generate economic opportunities and  increase trust and engagement in government activities. </p>
        <p><abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> digital services and internal tools are  accessible and inclusive by design, reducing barriers for users with  disabilities. Federal departments continue to seek out partnerships and work  collaboratively with public and private sector organizations that are responsible  for enhancing accessibility to advance mutual efforts in <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> accessibility.</p>
        <p>The principles of open by default and  inclusive by design are integrated into all new processes, systems, solutions  and services.</p>
        <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> takes advantage of the increasing  number of opportunities to develop policies and solutions “in the open” and in  collaboration with stakeholders.</p>
</section>
    <section>
        <h3 id="toc4-3">Security</h3>
      <p>Risks related to cybersecurity and aging <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  have been reduced through the implementation of proactive measures to reduce  the threat surface of Internet-connected networks and improved controls over access  to government-held information. The completion of <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> infrastructure transformation  activities ensures that hardware, software and supporting processes are in  place with funded renewal plans, ensuring long-term sustainability. These  measures reassure Canadians and others who access <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> digital services that they  can trust the government with their personal and business information.</p>

      <p>Project investments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>address business problems and  opportunities</li>
        <li>align strategically with the  direction for the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>-wide enterprise architecture</li>
        <li>are effectively managed through  best practices that are:
        	<ul>
            <li>applied to project management  and governance </li>
            <li>gained from lessons learned  from previous projects’ concept-to-benefits realization</li>
        	</ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Achieving investment  goals will be through reviewing investment concept cases early, prior to defining  the solution or the project to implement the solution, allowing for early  engagement and direction setting and for periodic reviews by the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>&nbsp;<abbr title="GC Enterprise Architecture Review Board">EARB</abbr>. For high-risk  project investments, TBS monitors and reports on performance and governance  throughout the life of the project. Better  management of project investments, coupled with an agile approach to developing  and delivering projects and solutions, will maximize value and reduce service  delivery costs, enabling the government to respond more rapidly to emerging  issues. </p>

    <h3 id="toc4-6">Workplace</h3>
      <p>The federal public service is highly  connected, with information, technology and security integrating seamlessly into  daily work life. Efficient digital processes have rendered paper records  obsolete. Public servants can easily find, use and share their documents. A  common, customizable digital workspace follows public servants and allows them  to work smarter and solve problems more effectively by providing secure, agile,  accessible, and reliable systems and tools for information sharing,  collaboration and innovation. Information and data management practices are  automated and made invisible as much as possible to the average public servant.</p>
      <p>Much work is required to achieve a truly  digital public service mindset where programs and services are designed for  digital first, policy development approaches are open and innovative and  Canadians are actively engaged.</p>

                <p>This framework describes the mission,  guiding principles, goals and strategic actions that are laid out within the  Government of Canada Strategic Plan for Information Management and Information  Technology.</p>
                <p>The mission statement is “Federal <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  professionals are strategic partners and integrators within our departments,  providing excellence in <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> and <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> services and enabling delivery of secure,  reliable accessible and agile digital business solutions. Working openly and  collaboratively with external partners, stakeholders and across various levels  of government, our efforts:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>add value in the workplace</li>

                  <li>create opportunities for  innovation</li>
              </ul>
                <p>There are six guiding principles:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>client and service-centred  design</li>
                  <li>open</li>

<section>
  <h2 id="toc6">Guiding principles</h2>
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc6-1">Principle 1: client and  service-centred design</h3>
      <p><abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> solutions and services are designed from  a client-centred and end-to-end digital service delivery perspective to  increase the value they bring to clients through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>early user engagement</li>
        <li>convenient access and  availability through multiple channels</li>
        <li>pre-population of information  when possible and where appropriate</li>
        <li>simplified, streamlined and joined-up  workflows</li>
        <li>reuse of information where  appropriate</li>
        <li>rigorous user testing</li>
      </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc6-2">Principle 2: open</h3>
      <p><abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> information and data is open by default, ensuring that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>information and data are  made open to the public to the greatest extent possible</li>
        <li>new processes are  designed to enable and facilitate proactive release of government data and  information by default</li>
        <li>the public actively  participates in policy, program and service design</li>
        <li>citizens are consulted  and engaged in government decisions and operations</li>
        <li>GC employees work “in the open”</li>
      </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc6-3">Principle 3: enterprise first</h3>
      <p>Departments will follow common standards,  approaches and direction, and use existing enterprise assets, such as processes,  data, contracts and solutions, as accelerators where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>information is created once,  reused numerous times, and managed <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>-wide as a single-aligned asset that is  consistent, standardized and interoperable</li>
        <li>solutions support the use of  open standards, are scalable and can be rapidly deployed</li>
        <li>cost-effective and efficient  business solutions facilitate information and data integration, reuse,  management, sharing and analytics</li>
        <li>common business needs are  addressed through enterprise or shared solutions, and departments stop  investing in departmental legacy systems and refocus efforts, resources and  funds on becoming ready to adopt an enterprise or shared solution and on  accelerating its implementation</li>
        <li>efforts across the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> are more  coherent, integrated, secure and effective</li>
      </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc6-4">Principle 4: secure</h3>
      <p><abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> information is safeguarded for security,  privacy and confidentiality, is monitored to prevent leaks, and is protected  for future generations.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc6-5">Principle 5: cloud first approach</h3>
<p>Departments will explore “… as a service” (<abbr title="Anything as a Service">XaaS</abbr>)  cloud services before developing solutions in-house. This includes private and public cloud  offerings.</p>
</section>
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc6-6">Principle 6: enable a modern  workplace: anywhere, anytime with anyone</h3>
      <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> strives to be an innovative  organization that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>provides its employees  with modern technology that supports information retrieval, use, sharing and  collaboration by making information and data accessible when and where needed</li>
        <li>provides customizable  tools and resources with minimized learning requirements for users </li>
        <li>provides automated,  digital processes in support of better services</li>
        <li>attracts, retains and  encourages public servants to work smarter and be innovative, greener and  healthier so that they better serve Canadians</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Early thinking on new digital principles is in progress in  support of the shift to digital (see <a href="#toc15">Appendix F</a>). </p>

  <h2 id="toc8">Strategic actions</h2>
  <p>The plan’s strategic actions represent a range  of activities, from core operating requirements to forward-looking and  strategic initiatives. Those  established in the inaugural <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> Strategic Plan 2016 to 2020 maintained their  original numbers (1 through 47) to simplify reporting. Numbering for new  strategic actions begins at number 48. Some of these may require additional  approvals or funding to be fully implemented. Priorities for the 2018 to 2019 fiscal year are key  elements that enable the shift to digital service delivery (see <a href="#toc10">Appendix&nbsp;A</a>).</p>
  
  <section>
    <h3 id="toc8-1">Service</h3>
      <p>The strategic goal of “service”  focuses on building and evolving <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> foundational elements, including  processes, practices and infrastructure to enable implementation of current capabilities,  technologies and solutions such as blockchain and artificial intelligence. This  approach will ultimately result in improved programs and services for Canadians  and better internal services for government employees by focusing on developing a modern, reliable, interoperable and accessible <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  environment that:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>allows for secure sharing of  information and data via  policy and possible legislative changes</li>
        <li>improves the government’s  ability to leverage opportunities across multiple channels</li>
        <li>adopts open standards, where  applicable</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While these foundational  elements support all departments broadly, the science-based departments have additional  requirements for network connectivity, specialized tools and a data strategy so  that they can conduct research and collaborate with their partners and  communities.</p>
      <p>The sections below list the strategic  actions that are currently underway and those that represent new enterprise  directions that may require additional approvals or funding to be implemented.</p>

          <p>Key performance indicators that focus on  operational excellence and delivery are critical tools in managing the delivery  of <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> services. Departments will put in place metrics for monitoring client  satisfaction and key areas of <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> system performance (security, availability,  reliability and capacity). </p>
          <p>For the services they provide, <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>  will:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>set enterprise-wide service  levels in collaboration with departments </li>
              <li>report to departments on  performance based on these service levels</li>
              <li>engage their clients to resolve  issues if service levels fall below targets</li>
            
        </ul>
          <p><abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will also report on a quarterly basis to  the Deputy Minister and Assistant Deputy Minister Committees on Enterprise  Priorities and Planning (<abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr>) on key performance indicators.</p>

      <h5>Implement  enterprise <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> service management tools (planned actions)</h5>
        <p><abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> service management (<abbr title="IT service management">ITSM</abbr>) refers to an  organization’s planning, delivery, operations and control of <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> services  offered to clients. Departments traditionally have implemented their own <abbr title="IT service management">ITSM</abbr>  tools. Such tools are expensive to implement and maintain, and the diversity of  tools affects overall <abbr title="IT service management">ITSM</abbr> efficiencies. Moreover, service request and trouble  tickets do not flow easily within and between departments and tool sets. </p>
          <p><abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will put in place enterprise <abbr title="IT service management">ITSM</abbr> tools  and make them available to all departments. Doing so will bring consistency to  the practice of <abbr title="IT service management">ITSM</abbr> and, more importantly, reduce the cost and delays of  fulfilling service requests.</p>

      <h5>Develop  digital policy (actions  underway)</h5>
          <p>In order to remain relevant in the digital  era, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> must move away from its traditional siloed and complex web of  rules. Citizens today have high expectations of government. These expectations  are driven by their interactions with a more digitally sophisticated private  sector. Government <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> policies have not kept pace with this evolving landscape  and do not reflect current realities or future strategic direction. </p>
          <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will develop a new digital policy that  focuses on service to Canadians within an open and transparent environment that  is enabled by information, data, technology and cybersecurity to ensure that a  strong foundation can be leveraged to achieve business outcomes across  government and support innovation. </p>

        <h4 id="toc8-1-2">Cloud first</h4>
          <p>Cloud computing, or on-demand computing, introduces  a fundamental shift in providing <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> services. It provides access to shared <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  resources (networks, servers, storage, applications and services) through “pay  for use” models, similar to those used for traditional utilities such as water and  electricity. </p>
          <p>Cloud is best positioned to satisfy the  substantial need for agility and scalability of today’s unpredictable business  environments, and to improve the balance of supply and demand of  infrastructure. Cloud adoption will ensure that the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> can maintain <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> service  excellence during a period of increasing demand for online services, and provide  timely access to accurate information to Canadians. Cloud supports the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s digital  and innovation agendas.</p>
          <p>In the context of cloud and enterprise-wide  and shared solutions, departments have a duty to apply safeguards that will  enable them to retain uncompromised control over information they have  collected or created. </p>
          
          <section>
          <h5>Adopt  cloud services (actions  underway)</h5>
          <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> has published the <a href="/en/government/system/digital-government/digital-government-innovations/cloud-services/government-canada-cloud-adoption-strategy.html">Government  of Canada Cloud Adoption Strategy</a> to guide the cost-effective and secure adoption  of cloud services. Departments will choose cloud services from a number of  options that will include extensions to existing legacy solutions and private  and public cloud offerings. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> published right cloud selection guidance to  assist departments in making these choices. They will need to consider:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>privacy</li>
            <li>security</li>
            <li>compliance</li>
            <li>data residency and sovereignty</li>
            <li>vendor lock-in considerations</li>
            <li>commercial risk</li>
            <li>latency and performance</li>
            <li>data transfer</li>
            <li>integration</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Departments will consider solutions that  employ software as a service (<abbr title="Software as a Service">SaaS</abbr>) before platform as a service (<abbr title="Platform as a Service">PaaS</abbr>) and infrastructure  as a service (<abbr title="Infrastructure as a Service">IaaS</abbr>). </p>
          <p>To ensure Canada’s sovereign control over  its data, departments will adopt the policy that all sensitive data under  government control, that has been categorized at Protected B, Protected C, or  is Classified, will be stored in a <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>-approved computing facility located  within the geographic boundaries of Canada or within the premises of a <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> department located abroad, such as a diplomatic or consular missions.  Departments and agencies will evaluate risks based on an assessment of data  sensitivity and apply the appropriate security controls for cloud  services.&nbsp; Examples of sensitive data  include personally identifiable information or program/business information.</p>

      <h5>Establish  a cloud service broker (actions underway)</h5>
          <p>A cloud service broker (<abbr title="cloud service broker">CSB</abbr>) functions as a  bridge between organizations and cloud providers. Using a <abbr title="cloud service broker">CSB</abbr> makes cloud  services less expensive, easier, safer and more productive for organizations to  navigate, integrate, consume and extend cloud services, particularly when services  span multiple and diverse providers.</p>
          <p>A <abbr title="cloud service broker">CSB</abbr>’s key functions are as follows:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>procurement</li>
            <li>billing</li>
            <li>security accreditation</li>
            <li>networking</li>
            <li>credential and identity  federation</li>
            <li>application integration</li>
            <li>customer support</li>
            <li>vendor service-level agreements  (pertaining to management and skills)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> is responsible for providing a <abbr title="cloud service broker">CSB</abbr> quickly  by implementing contracts with cloud service providers, thereby enabling  departments to use a self-service model for providing cloud resources (computing  power, storage and platforms). <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will be responsible for connecting the cloud  environments as extensions of end-state data centres, with a catalogue of cloud  resources pre-configured to the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s standards.&nbsp;All cloud projects will be  reviewed and approved by <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> <abbr title="Enterprise Architecture Review Board">EARB</abbr>.</p>
          <p><abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr> is also responsible for implementing additional  contracts for services and must use the same demand intake process as <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>. <abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>  will work closely with <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> to leverage its suite of cloud broker functions and  infrastructure capabilities.</p>

      <h5>Offer  public cloud services (actions underway)</h5>
          <p>A public cloud refers to a cloud environment  shared by multiple tenants that are isolated from each other. <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will direct  its efforts toward acquiring and brokering multiple enterprise-grade public  cloud services. Several of these will have a presence in Canada and be capable  of storing and processing protected data. Public cloud services will be the  priority choice for departments when choosing a cloud deployment model.</p>
                </section>
      <section>
      <h5>Offer private cloud services (actions underway)</h5>
          <p>A private cloud has all of the self-service and dynamic attributes of a  public cloud except that the services are for use by a single enterprise, in  this case the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>. Under this deployment model, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> will be the only tenant  residing in the cloud. This model includes off-premise as well as on-premise  clouds that are managed by the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> or by a third party. </p>
          <p>Private clouds can be implemented as  pre-engineered commercial offerings or as tailored solutions that are engineered  and assembled by staff. <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will direct its efforts toward acquiring the  former, with the latter being implemented when unique requirements arise.  Departments will use private clouds where needs cannot be met by public clouds (e.g. secret information).</p>

      <h5>Complete   data centre consolidation and modernization (actions underway)</h5>
          <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> operates over 500 aging data centres  that support mission-critical and non-mission-critical business functions.  Consolidating these data centres into fewer modern and secure data centre  services is the most cost-effective way to address the government’s “rust out”  issue. These enterprise data centres will be designed to have backup and  retention capability as part of disaster recovery plans and in support of  business continuity.</p>
          <p><abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will enable the migration of  departmental legacy applications to segregated partner-specific locations  (called enclaves) within the new enterprise data centres. This migration will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>accelerate the closure of aging  data centres</li>
            <li>enhance data security</li>
            <li>minimize the financial and  business impact to departments </li>
          </ul>
          <p>To ease the demand for data centre  capacity, departments will reduce the number of back office applications to be  migrated. The extent to which the government leverages external cloud service  providers could also reduce the requirement for data centre capacity. </p>
          <p>Successfully consolidating data centres  depends on departments’ readiness to prepare their applications for migration  within prescribed time frames. Departments will work with <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> and other  government and external partners to ensure that:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>mission-critical and other  applications are in appropriate environments</li>
              <li>such applications are supported  with appropriate technologies and procedures to ensure their availability</li>

          <h5>Build  a platform for enterprise interoperability (actions underway)</h5>
          <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will continue to  work  with stakeholders to develop a unified service approach and to create a set of modern integration tools called the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> Interoperability  Platform (<abbr title="GC Interoperability Platform">GCIP</abbr>). This platform acts as an information broker, enabling the  exchange of data and information between enterprise systems, departments and  governments.</p>
          <p>The <abbr title="GC Interoperability Platform">GCIP</abbr> project will implement a central data exchange where information can be  shared securely and reliably between government applications. Three core  solutions for financial management, human resource management and information  management will be connected to seamlessly exchange information, regardless of  the technologies underpinning them. These systems operate on a “tell us once”  principle, where data is entered in one system and then reused by multiple  other systems, as legislation and policy permit, thus reducing the need for  duplicate data entry while improving data integrity and accuracy.</p>
          <p>This work  will lay the foundation to link internal departmental information with  solutions for delivering programs and services and enable greater GC-wide  collaboration when designing digital services.</p>
<p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will continue to  lead the adoption of a common <abbr title="GC Interoperability Platform">GCIP</abbr> to support information  sharing inside and outside the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> domain. This approach will enable business  process improvement within the government and across jurisdictions, leading to  improved program and service delivery for citizens and businesses. &nbsp;</p>
          <p>Through the creation and  use of a governance framework (policies, directives, guidelines and open  standards) for the <abbr title="GC Interoperability Platform">GCIP</abbr>, <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>foster openness and  collaboration</li>
            <li>promote digital services</li>

Departments have already made available a number of  <abbr title="Application programming interfaces">APIs</abbr>. The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> API store will offer a consistent means to discovering <abbr title="Application programming interfaces">APIs</abbr> and  subscribing to them. The store will provide API publishers and users with a  central, multi-tenant API management platform that includes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>a searchable catalogue</li>
            <li>version control </li>
            <li>automated access provisioning  workflows</li>

      <h5>Develop  a master data management program (planned actions)</h5>
          <p>In an open and distributed operational  environment such as the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>, there is a risk that business-critical data becomes  redundant, inconsistent and scattered throughout the enterprise. </p>
          <p>Master data management (<abbr title="master data management">MDM</abbr>) can be defined  as the processes, governance, tools, rules and technology required to create  and maintain consistent and accurate master data. It focuses on common critical  data elements and establishes strong governance around them. <abbr title="master data management">MDM</abbr> can eliminate  redundancy and inconsistency of data in an organization and ensure its quality  and control. It can provide a single, authoritative point of reference that can  be shared by many processes and applications across the organization. It can  also streamline data sharing and facilitate interoperability. </p>
          <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will work with key business owners (for  example, the Office of the Comptroller General and the Office of the Chief  Human Resources Officer) to establish a government-wide <abbr title="master data management">MDM</abbr> program to formally  identify standard data elements and single authoritative sources for key information  domains, where appropriate.</p>

          <p>Business intelligence involves creating,  aggregating, analyzing and visualizing data to inform and facilitate business  management and strategy. Analytics is about asking questions and refers to all  the ways in which data can be broken down, compared and examined for trends.  Big data is the technology that stores and processes data and information in  datasets that are so large or complex that traditional data processing  applications can’t analyze them. Big data can make available almost limitless  amounts of information, improving data-driven decision making and expanding  open data initiatives.</p>
          <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>, working with departments, will lead  the development of requirements for an enterprise analytics platform. </p>
          <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will work with departments to identify  a business lead to develop a data lake (a repository of raw data) service strategy  so that the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> can take advantage of big data and market innovation to foster  better analytics and promote horizontal data sharing.</p>

          <p>Time and productivity are frequently lost  due to the lack of consistent tools and systems to help employees store, search  and find the information and data they need to do their jobs. Enterprise <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>  solutions such as GCDOCS streamline and simplify these processes, but they need  to be configured properly to make back-end <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> processes as invisible as  possible to users.</p>
          <p>Automation can provide opportunities to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>simplify and streamline key <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>  processes and practices</li>
            <li>deliver a seamless user  experience that relieves burden on individual <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> workers</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Furthermore, implementing integrated and standardized  solutions across departments can help make it easier for <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> employees to find,  use and share the information and data they need to do their job, while  ensuring consistent, foundational management of <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> information assets. Information  and data can be leveraged to help departments achieve their business objectives  and meet their mandated requirements.</p>
          <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr> will enhance the  government-wide GCDOCS service for departments, including:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>full deployment by 2022</li>
            <li>broadening its integration with  back office systems </li>
            <li>piloting its use as a tool for  increasing the openness of government information</li>
          </ul>

      <h5>Migrate  websites to Canada.ca and assess options for a single GC digital  service platform (actions underway)</h5>
          <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s Web Renewal Initiative will  improve Canadians’ access to <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> online services through a single online window  (Canada.ca). This initiative will bring hundreds of existing sites into one,  designed to better meet the needs of Canadians. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will develop a new strategy  to set further direction on providing a single window to Canadians for all <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>  information and services and create the conditions required  to transition to a single GC service platform.</p>

        <h4 id="toc8-2-1">Governance</h4>
        <p>To fully embrace an enterprise approach,  departments need clear direction on agreed-upon priorities and approved  approaches that come from an authoritative source. Strong oversight is required  to ensure sustained progress in advancing shared objectives. Roles and  responsibilities must be documented for effective implementation of an <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  governance structure.</p>
        
    <section>
      <h5>Establish enterprise <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  governance (actions underway)</h5>
        <p>Adopting an enterprise approach requires  sound governance structures that support clear and informed decision making.  The Deputy  Minister and Assistant Deputy Minister Committees on Enterprise Priorities and  Planning (<abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr>) will be the governance, priority setting and oversight  bodies for all <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> investments. <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> will also provide oversight on <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>  service delivery. </p>
        <p><abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> will encourage departments to move  toward enterprise solutions for consolidated services. <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> will establish the  “rules of engagement” for adopting enterprise <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> solutions and services, including  the process for addressing exceptions. As such, <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> will prioritize all plans  for enterprise services. &nbsp;</p>
        <p><abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> will manage demand from departments  for <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> infrastructure services and guide how <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> provides those supply-side  services. <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will report to <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> on its progress with transformation efforts  and bring forward annually an investment plan for endorsement in advance of  seeking Treasury Board approval. </p>
        <p>Through principles, prioritization and a  risk-based approach to balancing demand and supply, <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> will align <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> and  <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>-enabled initiatives with enterprise business priorities. </p>
        <p>In addition, <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> will provide direction  for and oversee the implementation of the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> Strategic Plan for <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> that will  be published annually in October. The Strategic Plan outlines <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> priorities  and serves as the basis for <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>’s planning. <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr>’s Terms of Reference,  including mandates, authorities and accountabilities, are being reviewed  accordingly.</p>
        <p>All the business needs of government will  be managed according to <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> governance principles. Under <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> leadership, <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>  will:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>clearly define the key roles of  business owner, service provider and client</li>
          <li>clarify with the <abbr title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</abbr> Council  and the Enterprise Architecture Review Board how existing governance structures  will be integrated into the <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> governance structure </li>
          <li>determine an appropriate  decision-making process</li>
          <li>see that departments avoid  duplication and unnecessary overlap</li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Develop methods to prioritize  investments in legacy and transformation initiatives (actions underway)</h5>
        <p><abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr> will develop and define  methods to measure the progress of transformation initiatives, aligning them  with key benefits. Progress must be reported clearly and reliably. </p>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>, supported by <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> and other departments,  and under <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr>’s oversight and direction, will develop a methodology to  prioritize and allocate funding for investments in legacy and transformation  initiatives. <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will also develop a clear process to address funding and  capacity deficiencies. Methodologies and processes will be refined periodically  to ensure accurate determination and reporting of savings. These processes will  be integrated into enterprise planning initiatives.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr> endorses a principles-based approach and  prioritization methodology to guide departmental investment strategies,  ensuring that they reflect business and enterprise priorities. New or  significant changes to <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> and <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>-enabled projects will be subject to  consultation with <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> and approval by <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr>.</p>
        <p>As the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> shifts to a digital policy and  strategy, its enterprise <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> governance, planning, prioritization and project  management processes will evolve.</p>
        </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Document  roles and responsibilities for <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> and <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> security (planned actions)</h5>
        <p>Departments have a role in managing and  delivering <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>, as described in <a href="#toc13">Appendix&nbsp;D</a>. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will work to elaborate and  document the roles and responsibilities of departments, <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>, <abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr> and central  agencies for delivering <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> services and implementing the government’s <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> Strategic  Plan so that roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, communicated and  executed. They will be clarified through the revised policies on government  security, <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> and <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will also continue to provide clear direction to  departments on <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> security roles and responsibilities, including  security-control objectives and other security-related requirements.</p>
        
    </section>
    <section>
    <h5>Introduce  stronger project oversight at the concept phase (planned actions)</h5>
        <p>TBS will enhance and strengthen the  oversight function for <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>-enabled projects by introducing earlier reviews of  investment concept cases. Such reviews will take place prior to defining the  solution or the project to implement the solution, allowing for early  engagement and setting of direction. Concept cases will also be reviewed and  assessed by the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> <abbr title="Enterprise Architecture Review Board">EARB</abbr> for alignment with the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> business capability  model.</p>
        <p>For high-risk project investments, TBS will  monitor and report on performance and governance throughout the life of the  project. Better management of project investments, coupled with an agile  approach to development and delivery, maximizes value and reduces service  delivery costs, enabling the government to respond more rapidly to emerging  issues.     </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Establish  data governance (planned actions)</h5>
        <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> is committed to making better use of  data to inform decision making. To do so, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> must ensure that the maximum  value possible can be extracted from the large quantities of data that  departments collect in support of providing their individual programs and  services. Currently, data is fragmented and stored in departmental or program  silos, with minimal infrastructure in place to support sharing among  stakeholders and to effectively manage the data across its lifetime. </p>
        <p>Many departments collect and use similar or  related data, but no coherent government-wide approach to managing data is in  place for providing services that stretch across departments and jurisdictions.  Ownership for individual datasets is often not clear, and business development  processes do not sufficiently consider other potential uses of data collected.  In order to ensure informed decision making based on enterprise-wide data, the  government needs to take steps to ensure the sound governance of data and its  integrity and quality. </p>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will work with data creators and user communities  to define governance principles that assign formal accountabilities for  individual data assets.</p>

      <h4 id="toc8-2-2">Enterprise architecture alignment  and practices</h4>
      <p>Sound <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> management starts with  consistent planning based on documented descriptions of the enterprise. With an  understanding of what is in play, managers can adopt solutions that best  address their business needs while advancing government-wide architecture.</p>

    <section>
      <h5>Evolve  <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> management practices, processes and tools (actions underway)</h5>
      <p>CIOs should plan and execute departmental <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  plans so that they align with the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s Strategic Plan for <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> and overall  enterprise modernization priorities. Important tools to support CIOs include: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>investment plans</li>
        <li>architectural reviews</li>
        <li>application portfolio  management</li>
        <li>expenditure reporting</li>
        <li>performance reporting</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Optimizing <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> investments to meet  business outcomes will propel the evolution of <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> management processes and  tools. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> policy and guidance will allow departments to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>manage <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> consistently and  with greater maturity </li>
        <li>better understand <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> at the  enterprise level </li>
        <li>evolve digital service delivery</li>
        <li>benchmark themselves against  similar departments </li>
        <li>monitor and track progress  against government priorities </li>
        <li>set future priorities </li>
      </ul>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will also provide policy guidance and  more robust project oversight to help departments:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>develop sound project cost  estimates </li>
        <li>implement good project  management practices for complex <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> projects</li>
        <li>guide investments from concept  to benefits realization</li>
      </ul>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Develop enterprise architectures  for business, information, application and technology (actions underway)</h5>
      <p>Enterprise architecture will be used to  provide all <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> departments with a structured approach to identify and describe  <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> business needs and the information, applications and technology that are  required to enable them. </p>
      <p>Enterprise architectures show: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the capabilities and services  being provided to Canadians</li>
        <li>the information that supports  each <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> service</li>
        <li>the people impacted by business  decisions</li>
        <li>the secure enabling  applications and technologies for each <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> service</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Understanding enterprise architecture  enables effective decision making about <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> investments, costs and risks, allowing  the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> to act as one to optimize performance and deliver on government  priorities in the digital era. </p>
      <p>Working with functional communities, <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will  lead the development of an enterprise architecture framework, including an  <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> <abbr title="Enterprise Architecture Review Board">EARB</abbr>  that is integrated with <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> governance. The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>&nbsp;<abbr title="Enterprise Architecture Review Board">EARB</abbr>, with representation of  business and technology stakeholders from across the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>, will work  collaboratively to simplify the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> environment by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>assessing alignment of  initiatives</li>
        <li>identifying opportunities for  reusing solutions that support similar needs</li>
        <li>developing new digital  capabilities and innovation opportunities</li>
        <li>setting standards for <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>  technology </li>
        <li>providing direction on <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  investment</li>
      </ul>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Adopt agile approaches to  implementing business solutions (actions  underway)</h5>
      <p>It is a challenge to be able to acquire  goods and services in a timely manner to operationalize government mandates  that provide value to citizens. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> and <abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr> are leading a government-wide  initiative to identify and support key improvements in the federal procurement  regime. </p>
      <p>Departments will take advantage of existing  multi-departmental contracts when investing in solutions to meet common needs.  In cases where multi-departmental contracts or tools do not meet business  requirements, departments will contact <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> to discuss other options.  Departments are required to keep <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> up to date on their investments and plans.</p>
      <p>Where a customized or in-house solution is  the only option, application development teams should take modern and agile  approaches to achieve greater speed and agility. They must also take into  account the increasingly complex ecosystem of interdependent software  architecture, infrastructure and processes. </p>
      <p>Departments will promote a learning culture  that allows solutions architects and developers to: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>understand and adopt iterative  development approaches, automate release schedules and embrace a layered  testing strategy, including automated testing </li>
        <li>increase engagement with  business colleagues to advance iterative approaches</li>
        <li>engage functional (<abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>) experts  early in the development process </li>
        <li>adopt an approach that  considers a service-oriented architecture and application programming interface  (API) first rather than large and complex constructs </li>
      </ul>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Standardize  metadata (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Metadata is the backbone of digital  automated processes, information retrieval, and the use and sharing of  information and data. Metadata defines and describes the structure and meaning  of information and data and of the context and systems in which they exist. Metadata  supports efficient and effective management of information and data resources  over time, which facilitates decision making, accountability and the efficient  delivery of government programs and services. </p>
<p>Standardized metadata supports:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>interoperability within and  across systems</li>
        <li>reuse of information resources  within, across and outside the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Along with standardized metadata,  consistent use of authoritative vocabularies supports the exchange of  information and data resources within and across systems. </p>
      <p>Automated metadata collection, creation,  use and reuse can greatly relieve burden on individual <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> workers. </p>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>, in conjunction with business owners, will standardize metadata schemas and maximize their benefits to  simplify and automate metadata usage and make it invisible to users. </p>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Develop  an information and data valuation framework (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Organizations that are information-centred  and information-savvy recognize information and data as valuable assets. These  organizations move beyond considering the business value of information and  data to determining its value in monetary terms. Accounting for information and  data as strategic assets, similar to human and financial assets, allows organizations  and its partners to maximize the full potential of all information and data. When  information and data assets are valued and managed as such, they can pave the  way for innovation and cultural change within an organization. As the old adage  goes, “You can’t manage what you don’t measure.” This also means that if something  can’t be measured, it can’t be improved. It is therefore important to quantify  the value of information and data through a formal methodology. Currently,  there is no common agreement across government on how to measure the value of  information and data.</p>
<p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will test industry practices for  assigning value to unstructured information assets (infonomics) within targeted  domains and examine best practices for potential broader use. </p>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will leverage data inventories as a  baseline for a systematic and coherent approach to the quantitative and  qualitative evaluation of data, including the use of industry practices to  quantify the value of individual data assets.</p>
      </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Develop  an information management performance framework (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Considerable effort is expended throughout  government to produce coherent analysis and reporting that leverages common  metrics. Much of this effort is a result of inconsistent data definitions and  traditional measures of <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> (for example, through the Management Accountability  Framework) that reinforce an increasingly outdated view of <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> (recordkeeping). Differences  in the level of maturity of <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr> across departments place constraints on the  availability of quality metrics.</p>
      <p>By leveraging the right performance metrics,  the government can better understand the impact of information and data  management on its business. More importantly, it can serve to elicit desired  behaviours on the part of departments and their employees. Designing metrics  that are forward-looking and closely linked to business outcomes can help  establish and better communicate the value of information and data.  Furthermore, by shifting the focus of measurement away from compliance toward  outcomes, desired behaviour changes can be fostered, including increased  information sharing and reuse and improved data quality.</p>
<p>TBS will develop a performance framework, including  a renewed Management Accountability Framework, that is rooted in business  outcomes and results and is aligned with emerging needs. Over time, this  framework will evolve into the digital policy performance framework.</p>

      <h4 id="toc8-2-3">Agility and innovation</h4>
      <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> is transforming its <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> to better  serve Canadians, with innovation being key to delivering on this agenda. Successful  innovation combines creativity with process to transform novel ideas into  business enablers that deliver tangible results. It embraces experimentation  and intelligent risk taking, bringing new approaches that address existing  problems and leverage future opportunities. Innovation calls for collaboration,  both with new and traditional partners, to identify and break down any barriers  that prevent us from achieving maximum results. </p>

    <section>
      <h5>Lead  innovation (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>The role of CIOs is evolving from a service  provider to a full strategic business partner and digital enabler. CIOs are  innovation agents, business enablers and catalysts for enterprise  transformation. Departmental CIOs will be strategic business partners who bring  <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> to the table in innovative ways to address the department’s business  needs. To explore working in ways that are more agile, new opportunities with  various innovations hubs will be pursued.</p>

      <h5>Provide  tools and resources to make innovative use of information and data (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Departments have expressed a desire for  safe sandbox environments in which to develop and test innovative uses of  information and data. Departments expect that these environments are compliant  with pertinent policies (for example, the Policy on Official Languages and the Standard  on Web Accessibility). </p>
      <p>Encouraging exploration of new ideas in managing  information and data can bring the community together to experiment with  creative approaches and help the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> adapt more quickly to the pace of change.  By highlighting where innovation is happening, steps can be taken to encourage  and enable innovation for broader implementation across the government. Incubating  innovative solutions that create or exploit federal information and data can  also generate enhanced value for the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>. Furthermore, creating a clear path for  proposing new ideas could focus departments’ investment of their innovation  reserves on information and data pilot projects. With a strong commitment to  supporting innovation and increasing openness, the government can:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>inspire the creativity and  develop the skills of future innovators</li>
        <li>attract key talent to the  public service</li>
      </ul>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will provide tools and resources for  departments to test and make innovative use of information and data (for  example, support for developing <abbr title="Application programming interfaces">APIs</abbr> that enhance access to open data).</p>
     </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Shift  culture and processes toward open by design (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>To achieve the vision of a more  transparent, accountable and responsive government, an “open government” lens  needs to increasingly be applied to new or renewed program and service design and  at all stages of policy and program development and implementation. </p>
      <p>The long-term goal is to transform the work  processes and culture of the public service to one where programs, services and  information are open by design. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will lead work that includes designing new  processes, protocols and standards to enable and facilitate the proactive  release of government data and information by default.</p>

    <h3 id="toc8-3">Secure</h3>
    <p>The strategic goal of “secure” focuses on safeguarding  sensitive government data and ensuring that Canadians accessing online services  can trust the government with their personal information. As the shift to  digital services increases and the sophistication and frequency of cyberattacks  grow, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s defences must also evolve. Policy changes will be made to  strengthen the security of the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> environment.</p>
    <p>The strategic actions outlined below align  with Communications Security Establishment Canada’s (<abbr title="Communications Security Establishment">CSE</abbr>’s) top 10&nbsp;security  practices and with industry best practices. Departments will use <abbr title="Communications Security Establishment">CSE</abbr>’s top 10 practices  to prioritize their <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> security actions that will support the elimination of  active cyberthreats on government networks. </p>
    <p>The sections below list the strategic  actions that are currently underway and those that represent new enterprise  directions that may require additional approvals or funding in order to be  implemented.</p>

    </section>
    <section>
      <h4 id="toc8-3-1">Defence in depth</h4>
      <p>Canada’s competitive advantage, its economic  prosperity and its national security depend on government adopting new and  accessible technologies to better serve Canadians and public service employees.  If not managed well, however, making information and data more open could risk  exposing networks, systems, devices and data, including personal information,  vulnerable to malicious or accidental breaches. This is just one reason why  strengthening <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> security is paramount. </p>
    <section>
      <h5>Secure  the government’s network perimeter (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Although the Internet is a game changer in  how public service employees access and share information, it also brings  considerable risk. Malicious software (malware) can be unknowingly downloaded  from websites or through email and seriously compromise <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> systems and  disrupt government operations. </p>
      <p>To protect the government’s network,  world-class monitoring services and defensive measures have been implemented at  the government’s network perimeter through <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>-managed gateways. The completion  of network consolidation projects will ensure that all <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> partners use these  gateways. There remain, however, departments that continue to use non-<abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>  networks to access the Internet. </p>
      <p>To address risks to its network, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> is  standardizing protection and creating a secure, government-wide network  perimeter. Departments that do not currently use <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> Internet services will be  migrated to the <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>-managed enterprise network and will use <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> Internet  services exclusively. </p>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>, <abbr title="Communications Security Establishment">CSE</abbr> and <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will establish additional trusted  interconnection points between the government network and external partners to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>provide standardized and secure  connectivity with external partners and the Internet</li>
        <li>act as a gateway to cloud  services</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These actions will reduce the risk of  rogue, ad hoc or unauthorized Internet connections to and from the government’s  networks. They will also enhance the government’s ability to defensively  monitor data that crosses the government perimeter and ensure maximum protection  of government information assets.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Implement  end-point security profiles (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Malicious parties frequently seek out  exposed or misconfigured Internet-facing services or equipment to gain access  to <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> systems and information. End-point devices such as laptop computers,  tablets and servers provide a doorway for such threats. Malware, rootkits (software  tools to gain control of a system) and phishing can lead to the loss and  compromise of government data, including personal information. Operating  systems and applications that use default configuration settings typically  include unnecessary components, services and options. These default settings  are well known and easily discovered using automated tools.</p>
      <p>In the enterprise context, weaknesses and  misconfigurations in an organization’s systems could be exploited and used to  attack other organizations’ systems. Making the government’s end-point devices  more resistant to attacks is key to securing the government enterprise.</p>
      <p>Recognizing the risk posed by misconfigured  end-point devices, <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>, in consultation with <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> and <abbr title="Communications Security Establishment">CSE</abbr>, will develop end-point  device profiles. These standardized profiles will be based on security best  practices and will represent securely configured operating systems and  applications. The profiles will be validated and refreshed regularly to update  their security configuration. Additional security controls, such as host-based  intrusion prevention and application whitelisting (a computer administrative  practice used to prevent unauthorized programs from running) will be  implemented to further ensure the integrity of systems and information. </p>
           </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Implement  an enterprise approach to vulnerability and patch management (actions underway)</h5>
      <p>The government must ensure that  vulnerabilities are identified and remediated quickly to minimize the risk of  future intrusion and potential loss. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> and <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will implement an  enterprise-wide vulnerability and patch management capability to systematically  detect and remediate vulnerabilities. Departments will:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>implement these tools and  processes</li>
        <li>meet standard timelines for  remediation</li>
        <li>ensure quick response times for  emergency or critical patch deployment </li>
      </ul>
            </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Manage and control administrative  privileges (actions underway)</h5>
      <p>Departments also need to manage internal  risks to the security of their <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> environment. Privileged accounts (such as  local or domain administrators and other accounts that have elevated access)  are the most powerful accounts in any organization. They are also the most  targeted by malicious parties that wish to compromise government information. </p>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>, <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> and departments will work together  to minimize the misuse of any account that has elevated privileges, either  malicious or accidental. Tools and processes will be implemented to ensure the  proper management, control and monitoring of such accounts, including  establishing strong authentication mechanisms for all privileged accounts. </p>
      <p>Departments will also implement  measures to manage and control the life cycle of and access to privileged  accounts, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>audits and reviews to confirm  validity of privileges</li>
        <li>continuous monitoring to look  for uncharacteristic behaviour </li>
      </ul>
      </section>

    <section>
      <h4 id="toc8-3-2">Trusted solutions and services</h4>
      <p>Establishing identity is fundamental to  most government interactions that involve exchanging information or permitting  access to sensitive resources. </p>

    <section>
      <h5>Protect  web transactions to and from external-facing websites (actions underway)</h5>
      <p>As more Canadians interface electronically  with the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>, the amount of sensitive information transferred to and from  government websites will increase. To maintain maximum trust in these online  transactions, the government must protect them. </p>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will establish an “HTTPS everywhere”  standard that will require departments to use the HTTPS protocol for all  external-facing websites and cloud services. This protocol, along with approved  encryption algorithms, will ensure the secure transmission of data online and  the delivery of secure web services. </p>
          </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Implement  an improved cyber-authentication service (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Currently, Canadians and others external to  the government can securely access government services online using a trusted  credential. The credential (a username and password) is issued either by the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s  GCKey service or by a private sector organization that has partnered with  SecureKey Technologies to enable their customers to use their online  credentials (such as card numbers or user names and passwords) to access <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>  services. </p>
      <p>This mandatory solution for all online  government applications offered to the public is cost-effective, secure and  convenient for users. Still, improvements to the existing cyber-authentication  service are needed to support new initiatives such as Canada’s Digital  Interchange. Building on the existing solution and maintaining an enterprise  approach, <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> and <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will develop a renewed cyber-authentication service. This  service will meet current business needs and support enhanced functionality  required for future federated identity and digital service delivery  initiatives.</p>
           </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Implement  a trusted digital identity for people accessing internal government networks  and systems (actions  underway)</h5>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will take an enterprise-wide approach  to internal identity, credential and access management to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>reduce costs</li>
        <li>promote interoperability</li>
        <li>improve end-user experience by  reducing the need for multiple user IDs and passwords</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Under <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>’s leadership, <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will implement  common internal identity and credential processes and technologies tailored to  the level of assurance required for particular business processes. For example,  a unique digital identity will be needed to authenticate employees,  contractors, trusted guests or any other authorized users who access internal  government networks and systems.</p>
      <p>Departments will migrate applications to  this new enterprise service when their applications are upgraded as part of  regular life-cycle maintenance of assets. </p>
           </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Implement  a secure communication service for classified information (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Every day, departments create, store and  process classified information. Failure to protect this information could lead  to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>national security risks</li>
        <li>economic losses </li>
        <li>loss of government credibility </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although several special environments allow  some departments to safely share classified information, there is no common  solution available government-wide.</p>
      <p><abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>, under the strategic direction of <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>  and supported by <abbr title="Communications Security Establishment">CSE</abbr>, will implement a single, common and integrated  enterprise-wide secret-level network to enable classified data to be securely  transmitted, stored and processed across departments. Classified voice and  mobile capabilities will also be implemented for users who need to regularly  discuss classified information. </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Implement  enterprise data loss prevention (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>With its responsibility for maintaining  large amounts of sensitive data, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> needs to minimize the risk of  unauthorized disclosure. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will establish a framework to support an  enterprise approach to data loss prevention that will be supported by <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>  solutions. Preventing the unauthorized transfer or release of sensitive  information involves first identifying sensitive data. Unauthorized data flows  and operations will be monitored, detected and blocked. <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>, with departments,  will implement the framework.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h4 id="toc8-3-3">Awareness and understanding</h4>
      <p>Understanding the assets within an <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  environment is essential to knowing what to protect and enables the government  to be more proactive and efficient when responding to threats and attacks.</p>
        
    <section>
      <h5>Enable  comprehensive understanding of end-point devices (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>It is critical to be able to proactively  and accurately determine:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>the status of all end-point  devices</li>
        <li>what is running on them </li>
        <li>who is accessing them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>End-point devices that pose a risk to the  enterprise can be identified, allowing the government to be more effective when  responding to threats and attacks.</p>
      <p>Under <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>’s leadership, <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> and other departments  will acquire and implement tools and processes to enable a real-time,  enterprise view of the current status and configuration of government end-point  devices. Such information includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>hardware and software versions</li>
        <li>operating system versions </li>
        <li>patch installations</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Authorities will be strengthened and  procedures established to mitigate risks to the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> network should immediate  action be required.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h5>Enhance  awareness of enterprise cyberthreat and risk environment (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Departments are accountable for managing cyber-risks  to their particular program areas. However, as the government adopts an  enterprise approach and programs and services become more integrated, it will  be imperative that cyber-risks are also managed at the enterprise level. </p>
      <p>Key to effectively managing enterprise-wide  risk is understanding the changing cyberthreat landscape (for example, who is  trying to exploit government networks and systems, by what means, and for what  purpose). Departments indicate a strong desire for a more proactive approach  for <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> cybersecurity that emphasizes research and innovation in order to keep  pace with emerging threats, technologies and trends. Departments also have a  strong desire to work cooperatively to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>improve the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>’s security  environment </li>
        <li>reduce barriers to  collaboration and sharing of information</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A better understanding of departmental  threat environments would allow departments to take a risk-based approach and focus  cybersecurity efforts and resources rather than attempt to blindly protect  against all possible threats. </p>
      <p>Cybersecurity is a new reality for <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>  employees, and technological solutions alone will not protect the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> from cyberthreats.  All tools and technologies used in a strong <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> cyber-posture can be undermined  by uninformed user behaviour.</p>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will establish a centralized capability  to conduct governance, risk and compliance management activities in order to  gain a holistic picture of cyber-related business risks in the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>. This  capability will pull together data from multiple sources, for example, threat  assessments, risk registers, investment plans, audit results and critical asset  listings, to feed a consolidated enterprise view of cyber-risks. One of the key  data sources will be the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> Enterprise Threat Assessment, which <abbr title="Communications Security Establishment">CSE</abbr> will  refresh on an ongoing basis to keep pace with evolving internal and external cyberthreat  environments. </p>
      <p>The continuous monitoring of the cyberthreat  and risk landscape will inform decision making and influence how corrective  actions are prioritized across the enterprise to ensure maximum protection of  government assets.</p>

        <h4 id="toc8-4-1"><abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> workforce</h4>
        <p>Successfully delivering <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> services  requires a skilled, agile, connected and high-performing <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> workforce that  combines knowledge of business and technology. <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> professionals need to be  able to keep pace with the speed at which the business environment is evolving.  Today, the significant transformation of <abbr title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</abbr> organizations across the  enterprise continues, calling for a broader and more integrated range of  competencies in this increasingly digital and service-oriented work environment.  To enable a high-performing <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> workforce, 3&nbsp;overarching priorities have  been established: </p>
        <ol>
          <li>evolve toward an enhanced  community management model</li>
          <li>enhance the diversity of the  <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> workforce</li>
          <li>advance transformation</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Areas of action that support these  priorities include recruitment, consideration of diversity, career development,  leadership development, and targeted initiatives to source, attract, onboard,  develop and grow the <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> workforce. Partnerships, workforce analytics,  research and collaboration form the foundation that supports these activities.</p>
   
        <section>
      <h5>Enable  career development (actions underway)</h5>
        <p>Further enabling <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> professionals to  evolve into new roles, and addressing competency gaps in areas such as  strategic thinking, communications, innovation, change leadership and agility,  requires investment in employees. To support <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> professionals, retain talent  and re-skill the workforce, emphasis will be placed on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a career development portal</li>
          <li>learning provider solutions </li>
          <li>a development approach for the  <abbr title="Computer systems">CS</abbr> (Computer Systems) Group</li>
        </ul>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>, in conjunction with the Canada School  of Public Service, will lead work in this area.</p>
        </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Improve  diversity (actions  underway)</h5>
        <p>An innovative workplace is one where the  workforce reflects the full breadth of the talent pool. Diverse teams bring  broader perspectives and ideas for greater capacity to find creative solutions. </p>
        <p>Currently, <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> remains a predominantly male  domain. In Canada, recent data reveals that women occupy only 27% of the <abbr title="Computer systems">CS</abbr>  population in the federal public service. Moreover, the percentage of millennial  women in the <abbr title="Computer systems">CS</abbr> ranks has diminished steadily to a low of under 15%. Activities  to enhance diversity include focusing on recruitment and interdepartmental  action plans. Building on current efforts, specific initiatives include the  development of a multi-year action plan to improve diversity, inclusion and  representation via recruitment, retention and development for women of the <abbr title="Computer systems">CS</abbr>  Group. To further support the government’s commitments to achieving greater  representation and a balanced and diverse workforce, departments will develop  and leverage partnerships with departments that encourage <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> as a career choice  for young women. Departments and central agencies will also work to increase  labour mobility among women by encouraging leaders in the public service and  the private sector to consider roles in the government’s <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> community.</p>
        </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Strengthen  recruitment (planned actions)</h5>
        <p>To address challenges that include branding  issues, shortfalls in capacity and competency gaps, the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> will focus on <abbr title="Computer systems">CS</abbr> recruitment  campaigns, enterprise approaches and partnerships to support recruitment  efforts and onboarding. Specific initiatives will focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>outreach to college and  university campuses</li>
          <li>onboarding tools and initiatives  to improve the integration of new recruits</li>
          <li>partnership with the Public  Service Commission of Canada to create a partially assessed <abbr title="Computer systems">CS</abbr> inventory</li>
        </ul>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>, working with departments, will lead  work in these areas. Such initiatives will better position the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> to address  capacity and competency gaps more efficiently.</p>
       </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Modernize  information and data management profession (planned actions)</h5>
        <p>Revitalizing the information and data  management profession is necessary to ensure that it keeps pace with current  and emerging business needs in a digital, open and service-oriented environment.  Currently, HR classifications (for example, the <abbr title="Computer systems">CS</abbr> Group, the Administrative  Services (AS) Group and the LS (Library Science) Group) do not adequately  reflect the knowledge, skills and competencies needed. Furthermore, information  and data professionals should be more involved early on in the development  process when designing or renewing programs and systems to ensure that issues  associated with information and data management and sharing are proactively  considered. Realigning roles and responsibilities of information and data  management professionals and other key stakeholders could help improve  collaboration and overall coherence.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will work with Office of the Chief  Human Resources Officer to explore a classification standard for information and  data management professionals, including developing new standardized:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>generic work streams and job descriptions</li>
          <li>competency profiles</li>
          <li>organizational structures</li>
        </ul>
       </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Develop  information and data management training (planned actions)</h5>
        <p>By themselves, new policies, processes and  technology will not bring the change needed to support digital government. As  the need for quality information and data to support evidence-based decision  making and digital service delivery continues to evolve, so too must the  competencies of the information and data professionals that support the  delivery of government programs and services. </p>
        <p>By broadening the scope of competencies and  the capacity of information and data management professionals to include  business analysis, enterprise architecture, digital citizenship and horizontal  skills, the government can enable them to meet evolving business needs. Also,  educating information and data professionals to speak the language of the  business side of government would help shift the overall focus of information  and data management from process to business outcomes, making information and  data a central part of today’s digital workspace. </p>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will develop partnerships to design  learning and development opportunities for the next generation of information  and data professionals.</p>
       </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Strengthen  leadership development (planned actions)</h5>
        <p>There is a requirement to invest in current  and aspiring leaders across the enterprise to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>address talent retention issues</li>
          <li>increase capacity to develop  leadership competencies</li>
          <li>address gaps in skills</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Emphasis will be placed on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>talent management and succession  planning</li>
          <li>learning provider solutions</li>
          <li>cross-pollination with  organizations outside the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Specific leadership development efforts  include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>talent reviews</li>
          <li>promoting leadership  development programs at the Canada School of Public Service</li>
          <li>tracking and facilitating the  movement of <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> leadership across the enterprise</li>
        </ul>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will lead work in these areas.</p>
        </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Lead  targeted initiatives (planned actions)</h5>
        <p>The role of CIOs and their organizations  continues to evolve, with a shift toward being a transformational business  leader, technology strategist and innovator. Today’s environment further calls  for experimentation and smart risk taking. To enable CIOs to become  increasingly influential in shaping the business and supporting innovation, a  number of targeted initiatives have been identified, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>a talent cloud to increase  resourcing agility</li>
          <li>strengthened relationships  between departmental CIOs and the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> <abbr title="Chief Information Officer">CIO</abbr>&nbsp; </li>
        </ul>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>, working with departments, will lead  work in these areas.</p>

      <section>
        <h4 id="toc8-4-2">Modern workplace</h4>
        <p>Information and technology are key enablers  of a modern workplace that support collaboration, innovation and mobility. Ensuring  that smart technology provides a consistent, accessible workplace experience  throughout government will improve how all employees work together and provide better  services to Canadians. </p>
 
        <section>
      <h5>Modernize  workplace technology devices (actions underway)</h5>
        <p>Workplace technology devices are essential  for a modern workplace and a collaborative, mobile workforce, consistent with  the Blueprint 2020 vision. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will work closely with departments to ensure  that workplace technology devices meet the Blueprint 2020 vision.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will establish enterprise standards and  processes for life-cycle management and set direction to guide future workplace  technology devices standards and secure configurations. </p>
        <p><abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will continue to consolidate contracts  and procurement activities to improve security, reduce costs and improve  service to Canadians. <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will also procure workplace technology devices and  work with <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> and other departments to standardize devices. </p>
        <p>Departments are responsible for supporting  and maintaining workplace technology devices. They will explore support models  such as self-service and regional clusters to reduce costs while promoting  consistent user experience and service expectations.</p>
        </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Support a  mobile workforce (actions underway)</h5>
        <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> is committed to and encourages an  open and collaborative work environment where mobile devices are used. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will  develop a mobility strategy, focusing initially on smartphones. Departments  will balance the cost of these devices, and their support, against the business  value achieved. </p>
        </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Provide  Wi-Fi access (actions  underway)</h5>
        <p>Access to wireless data networks is  critical for employee productivity. The broader deployment of Wi-Fi may also  reduce costs by displacing the need to provide wireline infrastructure, which  is expensive to install and maintain.</p>
        <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> and <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will put in place the necessary  services and policies to support Wi-Fi usage. Departments will implement Wi-Fi  access to networks for all employees within common areas and their workspaces,  where the job requires mobility. Departments will migrate to Wi-Fi-capable  devices and support Wi-Fi access to local area networks for registered users,  as well as Wi-Fi guest-network access where security requirements are  appropriate. </p>
       </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Provide  desktop videoconferencing to employees (actions underway)</h5>
        <p>Increased access to videoconferencing  supports the collaborative operations of virtual teams across departments, time  zones and regions. Departments will complete the re-engineering of their  in-house videoconferencing facilities to enable full interconnectivity across  the government. Where appropriate and where a user profile supports such  functionality, <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> will also create the network and bandwidth capacity needed  to support videoconferencing at desktops. </p>
       </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Implement  managed print services (actions underway)</h5>
        <p>The <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> will continue to improve the  sustainability of workplace operations by completing the implementation of the Centre  for Greening Government’s strategy for printing. Departments will achieve an 8:1  average ratio of office employees to printing units. Departments will also use  <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>’s managed print services to facilitate improvements in their organization’s  environmental efficiencies in imaging, specifically:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>reduced energy costs and paper  consumption </li>
          <li>proper disposal of electronic  equipment</li>
        </ul>
        </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Improve  <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> accessibility (actions underway)</h5>
        <p>An innovative workplace requires all its  employees to contribute to their fullest potential and should attract the best  and brightest talent. Today, public service employees with disabilities  continue to face systemic barriers in the workplace, as information and  communications technologies are not as accessible as they should be, with key  tools posing accessibility and usability barriers to varying degrees. </p>
        <p> In line with Blueprint 2020 and efforts by  the federal government in the realm of accessibility, <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr><abbrev> </abbrev>has established  an interdepartmental task group of leaders, experts and practitioners to  identify issues and propose targeted initiatives to address <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> accessibility  for public service employees with disabilities. <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will also continue to seek  out partnerships and work collaboratively with departments that are responsible  for enhancing accessibility to advance efforts in improving <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  accessibility.</p>

    <section>
      <h4 id="toc8-4-3">Digital collaboration</h4>
      <p>Digital collaboration refers to the skills  and mindset needed to work effectively in an open digital environment. Tools  that respect government requirements such as accessibility, privacy, security, <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>  and official languages will be used to promote digital collaboration.</p>
  
        <section>
      <h5>Promote  digital literacy and collaboration (planned actions)</h5>
      <p>Digital literacy goes beyond basic computer  skills. It is essential to make the most of investments already made in the <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  environment, devices and tools, and to ensure that <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> helps workforce  productivity rather than detracts from it.</p>
      <p>Data literacy is a skill required for  working digitally. <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> employees need to be able to extract high-value insights  from the wealth of available information and data and to communicate them. </p>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will develop partnerships to leverage  and design an engagement and awareness program for all public servants to  enable them to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>become more data-literate</li>
        <li>leverage evidence-based  decision making</li>
        <li>engage internally and  externally as digital citizens</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Public service employees should also be  able to use GCTools such as GCpedia, GCconnex and GCintranet to share  information and build the professional networks needed to respond to shifting  priorities and problems. Collaborating digitally involves “working out loud,”  where others can see, benefit from and help improve how employees work.</p>
      <p>To promote a culture of openness and  collaboration, departments will nurture these skills throughout the public  service by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>adopting and using GCTools for  everyday work</li>
        <li>deploying targeted and general  learning and community outreach activities</li>
        <li>promoting the use of  self-directed learning tools and materials</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Senior leaders’ adoption of GCTools will be  critical to successfully integrating digital collaboration into their departments  and to demonstrating the full benefits of these collaborative tools. Leaders  will adopt an “open first” approach toward content creation and encourage their  employees to participate in shared knowledge and collaborative digital spaces,  other than where security requirements prohibit such an approach.</p>
      </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Advance  digital collaboration (actions underway)</h5>
      <p>GCTools such as GCpedia, GCconnex and the  GCintranet enable collaboration across the government. Employees are able to  access and share information and work across departments and geographic  boundaries, resulting in better service to Canadians.</p>
      <p>GCTools that support government  requirements for accessibility and official languages will be further developed  and integrated into other applications. These tools will allow employees to  easily connect with the colleagues and information they need to work  effectively. GCTools will connect to a digital workspace that provides  simplified access to other activities such as staffing, learning and  professional development.</p>
      <p><abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> will make adopting GCTools part of  standard practices for employee onboarding throughout government. Departments  will then be in a better position to adopt and use GCTools through the  Ambassadors Network and in formal training and ongoing communications. The  Ambassadors Network consists of volunteers from various departments and regions  that provide support to teams using GCpedia and GCconnex to enhance their work.</p>
      <p>Departments will decommission stand-alone  collaborative platforms unless they are linked to core local business  requirements. Email communication will be reduced in favour of open discussions  or instant messaging, where transitory communications can occur without bogging  down government systems.</p>
      </section>  
        <section>
      <h5>Expand  open government training and outreach (actions underway)</h5>
      <p>Training and awareness sessions are being  provided to public servants across the federal government to enhance knowledge  and skills for open government. The training resources developed will be made  available through government-wide platforms, including through the Canada  School of Public Service and on open.canada.ca. </p>

  <h3 id="toc9-1">Implementing the Strategic Plan</h3>
  <p>In support of the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr>, the Deputy Minister  Committee on Enterprise Priorities and Planning (<abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr>) provides oversight and  guidance on government <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> investments, supported by the Assistant Deputy  Minister (<abbr title="Assistant Deputy Minister">ADM</abbr>) <abbr title="Committees on Enterprise Priorities and Planning">CEPP</abbr>. Investments come forward through the annual departmental <abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>  planning process and are analyzed and prioritized by <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr> and <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> in order to  understand demand and capacity. An implementation roadmap for the plan’s  initiatives has been developed (see <a href="#toc11">Appendix&nbsp;B</a>),  and financial analysis is underway to help determine the extent and pace of  implementation, particularly in terms of infrastructure modernization. This  roadmap will be refined as planning advances.</p>
  <p>Information, data and technology can be  leveraged to support the culture change required within the <abbr title="Government of Canada">GC</abbr> to shift to an  open and service-oriented organization that delivers programs and services to  citizens and businesses in simple, modern and effective ways that are:</p>

  <p>The<strong> Government of Canada</strong> is made up of over 100&nbsp;organizations that deliver  a broad range of programs and services to individuals and businesses in Canada  and abroad. Its programs and services are categorized into 4&nbsp;spending  areas: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>economic affairs</li>
    <li>social affairs</li>
    <li>international affairs</li>
    <li>government affairs </li>
  </ol>
  <p><abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> supports the government in delivering  these external-facing programs and services.</p>
  <p>The<strong> Secretary of the Treasury Board</strong> sets government-wide strategic direction  for <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr>, with input from departments’ deputy heads, CIOs, information  management senior officials and other stakeholders. The responsibility for  delivering <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> services is shared between government departments and central  service providers such as Shared Services Canada and Public Services and  Procurement Canada.</p>
  <p><strong>Shared  Services Canada</strong> (<abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>) has the mandate to provide  data centres, networks and email services to the largest government  departments. Smaller government departments receive these services on an  optional basis. <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr>, Communications Security Establishment Canada, and Public  Safety Canada have a shared responsibility for cybersecurity, with oversight  provided by <abbr title="Treasury Board Secretariat">TBS</abbr>. In addition, <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> is responsible for procuring hardware and  software, including security software for workplace technology devices (the  authorized physical devices and related software used in government office work).  Departments are responsible for workplace technology device deployment, support  and asset life-cycle management. <abbr title="Shared Services Canada">SSC</abbr> spends $2 billion annually on the services  it provides, portions of which it cost-recovers from federal departments.</p>
  <p><strong>Public  Services and Procurement Canada</strong> (<abbr title="Public Services and Procurement Canada">PSPC</abbr>) provides  <abbr title="Information management">IM</abbr>-<abbr title="Information technology">IT</abbr> services supporting back office services such as:</p>
  <ul>
