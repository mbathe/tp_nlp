<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>

<p>Throughout history, there have been moments when the progress of technology has taken great steps forward, when a combination of the right tools, a capacity for innovation, and sparks of ingenuity lead to breakthroughs that transform how we live our lives.</p>

<p>How we produce and process information is critical to innovation – and our methods of recording and communicating information have themselves undergone great leaps. From the development of writing, to Gutenberg’s printing press – which advanced the spread of knowledge to the masses and ushered in the enlightenment and scientific revolution – to the first programmable digital computer Colossus, the cost of reproducing and communicating information, or data, has fallen again and again. At the same time, tools for processing and making sense of large quantities of data have developed exponentially – with artificial intelligence (<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>) representing the latest leap. In the same way that Gutenberg’s press ushered in a new era of growth, data-driven technologies such as <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> will underpin our future prosperity.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that machine learning and <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is already improving peoples’ lives, from intelligent personal assistants that can prepare us for changes in the weather, to systems that protect our money from criminals, or devices that offer medical advice from the comfort of our own home. And this is only the start; the potential of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is undeniable. Our next challenge will be to harness this technology to transform how we diagnose diseases, manufacture goods and build our homes.</p>

<p>Using advanced algorithmic techniques such as ‘deep learning’, <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> has the potential to solve complex problems fast, and in so doing, free up time and raise productivity. But we also need to make sure <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> benefits everyone in the UK, which is why – in addition to this Sector Deal – the government is establishing a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation to advise on the ethical use of data, including for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>.</p>

<p>The huge global opportunity <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> presents is why the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future" class="govuk-link">Industrial Strategy white paper</a> identified <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and data as 1 of 4 Grand Challenges – in which the UK can lead the world for years to come.</p>

<p>The UK is well placed to do this. We are already home to some of the biggest names in the business such as Deepmind, Swiftkey and Babylon.</p>

<p>And it’s not just the established players – Kwiziq, Cleo and Mindtrace are examples of UK <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> startups leading the way in areas as diverse as education, personal finance and autonomous vehicles. Major established companies in the tech sector, but also increasingly beyond, are using <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> to tune up their operations and services.</p>

<p>To realise all the social and economic benefits, we will need a strong partnership between business, academia and government. This sector deal establishes the beginning of that partnership. It responds to the recommendations of the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Review, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/growing-the-artificial-intelligence-industry-in-the-uk" class="govuk-link">‘Growing the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Industry in the UK’</a>, led by Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti, which articulated how the government and industry can work together on skills, infrastructure and implement a longterm strategy for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> in the UK.</p>

<p>We need to be strategic and focused: recognising the increasing convergence of technologies and focusing on the areas where we can compete globally.</p>

<p>While robotics, a complementary technology to <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, was outside the scope of the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Review, recommendations on the robotics industry have been made in the <a rel="external" href="https://connect.innovateuk.org/documents/2903012/16074728/RAS%20UK%20Strategy?version=1.0" class="govuk-link">Robotics Review RAS 2020</a>, and in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/made-smarter-review" class="govuk-link">‘Made Smarter’</a>, a review on digitising the manufacturing industry. Moving forwards, identifying and making the most of these synergies will be crucial for success.</p>

<p>A revolution in <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology is already emerging. If we act now, we can lead it from the front. But if we ‘wait and see’ other countries will seize the advantage. Together, we can make the UK a global leader in this technology that will change all our lives.</p>

<h2 id="executive-summary">Executive summary</h2>

<p>Creating an economy that harnesses artificial intelligence (<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>) and big data is one of the great opportunities of our age.</p>

<p>This Sector Deal is the first commitment from government and industry to realise this technology’s potential, outlining a package of up to £0.95 billion of support for the sector, which includes government, industry and academic contributions up to £603 million in newly allocated funding, and up to £342 million from within existing budgets, alongside £250 million for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. This support complements and leverages some of the £1.7 billion that has been announced under the cross-sectoral Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund so far, with 5 challenges having <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> components that <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> businesses will be able to bid into through future competitions.</p>

<p>This Sector Deal sets out actions to promote the adoption and use of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> in the UK, and delivers on the recommendations of the independent <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> review, ‘Growing the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> industry in the UK’, led by Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 1]</a></sup>. Their review, published in October 2017, engaged widely with businesses, academia, investors and other stakeholders on ways to boost the UK’s emerging <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> sector at home and across the world. It sets out proposals to improve the institutions that support <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> in the United Kingdom, to build a skilled workforce, and to stimulate access to data – collectively the lifeblood of any <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> business.</p>

<p>This Sector Deal reinforces the 5 foundations of the Industrial Strategy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>ideas</li>
  <li>people</li>
  <li>infrastructure</li>
  <li>business environment</li>
  <li>places</li>
</ul>

<p>It also draws on the government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/uk-digital-strategy" class="govuk-link">Digital Strategy</a>, which focuses on reinforcing our strengths in telecoms, data and enterprise. A key ambition of the industrial strategy is for the UK to be the world’s most innovative economy – this Sector Deal aims to attract and retain both domestic and global <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> talent; deliver major upgrades to our digital and data infrastructure; ensure that the UK is the best place to start and grow an <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> business; and contribute to communities’ prosperity by spreading the benefits of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> across the country.</p>

<h3 id="people-1">People</h3>

<p>The Industrial Strategy has people at its core: it is focused on creating good jobs and greater earning power for all people in the UK. To do this, we must equip citizens for jobs shaped by next generation technology. Growing the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> industry in the UK outlined the fast-growing demand for expertise to develop and apply <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies, and proposed ways to increase the supply of skills at different levels. Building on these recommendations and the commitments in the Industrial Strategy and Digital Strategy to grow science, technology, engineering and maths (<abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths">STEM</abbr>) and digital skills training, this Sector Deal sets out how the government, universities and industry will work together to greatly improve the supply of skills. It also sets out how we will attract the best, and most diverse, global <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> talent to the UK.</p>

<h3 id="infrastructure-1">Infrastructure</h3>

<p>Ensuring the UK has the right digital infrastructure – both physical and, crucially, data infrastructure – is critical to meeting our ambition of leading the world in <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. That is why, as part of our Industrial Strategy, we are investing over £1 billion to create a country with world class digital capabilities: from 5G mobile networks to full-fibre broadband. Equally important is the availability of data, which is required on a vast scale to train machine learning systems. The government and public bodies are already leading the way in making public datasets open and available. But there remain significant challenges to sharing private sector datasets. Through this Sector Deal, we will tackle both the practical and cultural barriers to sharing both publicly and privately held data. As part of this we will explore data sharing frameworks such as Data Trusts – mechanisms where parties have defined rights and responsibilities with respect to shared data – in order to protect sensitive data, facilitate access to data, and ensure accountability. This will allow and ensure fair and equitable data sharing between organisations in the private sector, and between the private and public sectors.</p>

<h3 id="ideas-1">Ideas</h3>

<p>The government set out a vision in the Industrial Strategy to make the UK the world’s most innovative economy. To achieve this, we are committing to work with the private sector to boost research and development (<abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>) spending to 2.4% by 2027, and 3% over the longer term. This begins with a £725 million investment through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund competition, designed to capture the value of innovation by commercialising a great idea in the lab to a successful business. For example, one early commitment is our £210 million Challenge on research into the early diagnosis of chronic illness – including a substantial investment in <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> diagnostics techniques<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 2]</a></sup>. The use of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is central to this work, which includes programmes applying <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> to raise output in sectors of the economy that have struggled with productivity, from reducing crop disease in the agriculture sector, to delivering services digitally in the public sector. We are seeing industry respond to our commitment to <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> innovation with investments in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> in the UK, such as those from major players like Beyond Limits and Element <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="business-environment-1">Business Environment</h3>

<p>Our intention is to be the best place to start and grow a business in the world. With a new business starting up every 75 seconds in the UK, and a massive increase in the finance available to knowledge-intensive and innovative firms – such as those developing <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> – through the British Business Bank, we are in a strong starting position.</p>

<p>As at September 2017, over £350 million<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 3]</a></sup> has been invested in 243 technology companies through the British Business Bank’s venture capital programmes.</p>

<p><abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is emerging in its own right as a nascent industry with the potential to raise the productivity of diverse sectors and create entirely new jobs. To maximise this potential, this deal will establish a new <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Council to bring together respected leaders in the field from across academia and industry; a new delivery body within the government – the Office for Artificial Intelligence – to support it; and a new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation. The deal will also increase promotion of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> businesses globally and take steps to attract <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> entrepreneurs to the UK. A recent report by Oxford Insights ranked the UK top for government readiness to implement <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, and these measures will allow us to capitalise on the UK’s worldclass <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> and tech entrepreneur base<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 4]</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The Industrial Strategy set out the goal of helping communities prosper throughout the UK. Growing the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> industry in the UK outlined the thriving <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> ecosystem that already exists. London is the European capital of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, while significant clusters exist in places such as Edinburgh, Belfast, Bristol and Cambridge. As important as the growth of these clusters of expertise is, our ambition is for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> to be adopted by businesses across the country. This deal will help businesses around the UK to grow using <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, and is supported by the government’s backing for the expansion of <a rel="external" href="https://www.techcityuk.com/" class="govuk-link">Tech City UK</a> and <a rel="external" href="https://technorthhq.com/" class="govuk-link">Tech North</a> into the national network Tech Nation, alongside its Scale Up campaign. At the same time, we are expanding the
academic commitment to <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> across the UK as universities partner with <a rel="external" href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/" class="govuk-link">The Alan Turing Institute</a>, the national institute for data science and <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>.</p>

<h3 id="growing-the-uks-ai--data-driven-economy">Growing the UK’s <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> &amp; data-driven economy</h3>

<p>We are at the cusp of one of the most exciting times in our lives, and if we get our strategy for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> right, then we will be able to reap the rewards for our economy for decades to come.</p>

<p>The Industrial Strategy set out <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-the-grand-challenges/industrial-strategy-the-grand-challenges" class="govuk-link">4 Grand Challenges</a> where the UK must act now to put itself at the forefront of the industries that will shape our futures and have a transformative impact on society. Through the Grand Challenges we are committed to taking advantage of major global trends, improving people’s lives and working in partnership with business and academia.</p>

<p>One of these is for the UK to maximise the economic and societal benefits of the current global technological revolution. We recognise that <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> will transform the way we live and work, from the way we diagnose and treat cancer to the security of online transactions. It can realise the potential for higher productivity and new jobs in nearly every sector in every country.</p>

<p>This Sector Deal will ensure we seize this global opportunity, and is focused on the recommendations put forward by Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti to promote <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> businesses in the UK.</p>

<p>But we will go further, setting out a vision of how the UK can respond to the broader opportunities and challenges for society posed by <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, including by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making the UK a global centre for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and data-driven innovation by investing in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>, skills and regulatory innovation</li>
  <li>supporting sectors to boost their productivity through artificial intelligence and data analytics technologies</li>
  <li>leading the world in the safe and ethical use of data through a new Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, and strengthening the UK’s cybersecurity capability</li>
  <li>helping people develop the skills needed for the jobs of the future through investment in <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths">STEM</abbr> skills and computer science teachers, as well as retraining and researching the impact of automation across sectors</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="support-ai-innovation-to-raise-productivity">Support <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> innovation to raise productivity</h3>

<p>Our vision in the Industrial Strategy - for the UK to be the world’s most innovative economy - is supported by a very significant increase in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> spending between the government and industry. This will boost <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> spending to 2.4% of <abbr title="gross domestic product">GDP</abbr> by 2027, and 3% over the longer term, beginning with a £725 million investment in new Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund programmes to capture the value of innovation. This is part of a broader commitment to raise total public investment in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> from around £9.5 billion in 2016 to 2017 to £12.5 billion in 2021 to 2022.</p>

<p>This Sector Deal positions the Artificial Intelligence sector to play a growing role in meeting this ambition – with a potential contribution of £200 billion or 10% of UK <abbr title="gross domestic product">GDP</abbr> by 2030<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 6]</a></sup>.

Industry recognises this commitment to innovation: already some of the most <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> intensive startups are basing themselves here such as Beyond Limits and Element <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>.</p>

<p>It’s not just the startups who are investing. Rolls-Royce has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Alan Turing Institute to codesign and deliver a programme of collaborative research in data science and <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. In particular, jointly-run research projects will explore: how data science can be applied at scale, the application of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> across supply chains, data-centric engineering and predictive maintenance, and the role of data analytics and <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> in science.</p>

<h3 id="stimulate-uptake-of-ai-within-the-public-sector">Stimulate uptake of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> within the public sector</h3>

<p>As announced in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future" class="govuk-link">Industrial Strategy white paper</a>, the government will invest £20 million in GovTech initiatives that will improve the delivery of public services, from transport and the environment, to education and health. We will also bring together existing work across central government and public bodies to share these technologies and understand how they are deployed most successfully.</p>

<h3 id="investments-in-the-uk-from-ai-powerhouses-1">Investments in the UK from <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> powerhouses</h3>

<p>Many of our most successful businesses started life as an idea in a university lab here in the UK. As the home of 4 of the top 10 universities in the world, we are a magnet for the highest calibre researchers in artificial intelligence and related disciplines.</p>

<p>DeepMind, a prominent UK-based <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> firm developed out of our leading universities, not only created AlphaGo, (the programme that defeated the world’s greatest player of Go, a fiendishly complex board game) but created a new version which taught itself to defeat the original programme. Alphabet, the parent company of Google and DeepMind – and a world leader in <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> – is building a new headquarters in London that will be home to 7,000 staff: a significant vote of confidence in the UK’s strength in <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr>.</p>

<p>Amazon is similarly building its UK base, increasing its staff by almost a fifth in 2017 to 24,000, including a major expansion of its <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> workforce to around 1,500. This includes a new development centre in Cambridge (the company’s second in the city), to add to existing development centres in Edinburgh and London.</p>

<p>The UK has also produced other globally recognised <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> firms such as Improbable, which specialises in using <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> for virtual reality (<abbr title="virtual reality">VR</abbr>), and has developed simulation technology with the potential to model the behaviour of millions of people. In 2017, Japanese telecommunications corporation SoftBank invested $500 million in Improbable, raising the value of the startup to over $1 billion. Onfido, which was founded 5 years ago to make identity verification checks quicker and easier for businesses, has developed machine learning technology used by businesses all over the world to help hire staff more quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Most recently, we have also seen notable investments in the UK from global <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> firms including Ironfly Technologies, a Hong Kong-based startup that uses machine learning in financial services and Element <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, an artificial intelligence solutions provider, which is opening a new <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> centre in London in 2018.</p>

<p>We are confident that the measures announced through this Sector Deal, alongside the government’s vision to be a leader in meeting the challenges posed by <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and data, will lead to further major investments in UK <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> from businesses around the world.</p>

<h3 id="work-with-schools-universities-and-industry-to-ensure-a-highly-skilled-workforce">Work with schools, universities and industry to ensure a highly-skilled workforce</h3>

<p>Skilled experts are needed to develop <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, and they are in short supply. As a global leader, the UK needs a large workforce with deep <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> expertise; a more diverse, <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> research base and workforce; and better digital skills in the wider workforce to use <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>.</p>

<p>Demand for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> talent in <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> techniques, such as machine learning, is increasing rapidly. Action is needed now to ensure the skills pipeline can meet the needs of industry now and in the future. By one estimate, the market value of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate of over 60% to 2022<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 7]</a></sup>. We must take concerted action or risk other countries seizing the opportunity and causing a brain drain from the UK.</p>

<p>In 2017 there were 26 UK universities offering undergraduate courses in <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and more than 30 graduate programmes running across 20 universities. Numbers of students have been rising modestly in recent years, driven predominantly by PhD level places (where the number of enrolments have almost doubled to just under 400 between 2013 and 2015<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 8]</a></sup>). A recent government consultation with <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> academics highlighted the gap between supply and demand for university places, with one institution turning down 13 viable candidates per available masters place.</p>

<p>The government recognises that to provide the advanced skills needed for creating <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> algorithms, the work begins in schools. That is why we have announced a major reform of technical education with the launch of T levels and investment in <abbr title="science, technology, engineering and maths">STEM</abbr> subjects. We announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget £84 million of new funding to deliver a comprehensive 4 year programme to improve computing education and drive up participation in computer science, including upskilling up to 8,000 computer science teachers, to ensure there is a suitably qualified GCSE teacher in every school. The government has also supported the creation of Ada, the National College of Digital Skills, which will train up to 5,000 students over the next 7 years for a wide range of digital careers. At a higher level, industry will be investing to fund a Masters degree programme with an integrated internship, targeting an initial cohort of 200 students per year. The government will be funding 450 new PhD places, and establishing a prestigious Turing Fellowship to support an initial cohort of 10 <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Fellows, to keep the best and brightest <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> researchers in the UK. These are just the first steps that we are taking to ensure the growth of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> skills in the UK.</p>

<h3 id="enhance-the-uks-existing-data-infrastructure">Enhance the UK’s existing data infrastructure</h3>

<p>Data is a critical part of our digital infrastructure – and fundamental to <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. It enables all kinds of services we use everyday from maps on our smartphones, to social media and payment processes. Without access to good quality data from a range of sources (whether privately or publicly held), <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies cannot deliver on their promise of better, more efficient and seamless services.</p>

<p>Open data published by organisations across a range of sectors have enabled other businesses to innovate and build new services, which in turn can make significant contributions to the economy. Transport apps such as CityMapper, for example, make journeys more efficient and have led to the creation of ‘pop-up’ bus routes for commonly made journeys that were previously unserved.</p>

<p>Similarly, open environmental data has been used to create flood risk and water quality apps. To test the autonomous vehicles of the future we will need good quality 3D topographic data on road conditions and roadside obstacles.</p>

<p>The government is committed to opening up more data in a way that makes it reusable and easily accessible. A good example is geospatial data. The Geospatial Commission announced in the 2017 Autumn Budget will provide strategic oversight to the various public bodies who hold geospatial data, seeking to maximise the growth of the digital economy and consolidate the UK’s position as the best place to start and grow a digital business. To further boost the digital economy, the government is working with the Ordnance Survey (<abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr>) and the new Commission to establish how to open up freely the <abbr title="Ordnance Survey">OS</abbr> MasterMap data to UK-based small businesses in particular. Geospatial data is a key enabler for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies.</p>

<p>In addition, the eInfrastructure Advisory Board (<abbr title="eInfrastructure Advisory Board">eAB</abbr>) has recently been set up by <abbr title="UK Research and Innovation">UKRI</abbr> with the purpose of advising the CEO of <abbr title="UK Research and Innovation">UKRI</abbr> on High Performance Computing (<abbr title="High Performance Computing">HPC</abbr>) Research infrastructure, and will be developing an eInfrastructure development roadmap, as well as other <abbr title="High Performance Computing">HPC</abbr> related projects, going forward.</p>

  <h4 id="case-study-ocado--machine-learning-to-build-a-smart-broadband-of-grocery">Case study: Ocado – Machine learning to build a smart broadband of grocery</h4>

  <p>Ocado are the world’s largest online-only grocery retailer, with over 600,000 active customers in the UK. As they are fully online, creating a robust data infrastructure and managing data effectively are both crucial to the success of the business. For example, in order to classify and prioritise the daily stream of emails into their call centre, Ocado has built a cloudbased machine learning model, which was trained on a database of 3 million emails previously classified by call centre agents.</p>

  <p>Machine learning is also used to monitor the health of their robot swarms, which carry out the bulk of the work in their new automated warehouses. Here, data from the robots are streamed to a data lake where analytical systems oversee performance and identify servicing requirements. By programming machine learning into the robots themselves using technologies such as embedded Tensor Flow, this also creates opportunities for swarm learning, where the learnings of one robot can be shared with the rest of the swarm, a concept which will keep driverless vehicles responsive and agile when on the road.</p>

  <p>These are just 2 examples of the many ways that <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and machine learning pervade Ocado’s end-to-end e-commerce, fulfilment and logistics platform.</p>

<h3 id="develop-fair-equitable-and-secure-data-sharing-frameworks">Develop fair, equitable and secure data sharing frameworks</h3>

<p>Some of the most valuable data – in terms of its potential for enabling innovation, improving services of realising public sector savings – cannot be made open because it contains nationally critical, personal or commercially sensitive information. This includes data which could be used to identify individuals. Organisations looking to access or share data can often face a range of barriers, from trust and cultural concerns to practical and legal obstacles. To address these issues, we are working with industry to pioneer mechanisms for data sharing such as Data Trusts. These frameworks will ensure that all parties involved have defined rights and responsibilities towards the data and individuals’ personal data, and other sensitive data, is protected. For example, the vision for Data Trusts is that they will allow 2 or more parties in any sector to partner in data sharing agreements, shape the agreements according to their needs and enable multiple organisations to work together to solve a common problem.</p>

<p>In addition to Data Trusts, we will explore how to improve data sharing generally, through sharing frameworks and consideration of data portability.</p>

<h3 id="deliver-a-strong-digital-infrastructure-across-the-uk">Deliver a strong digital infrastructure across the UK</h3>

<p>The government will work with the telecommunications industry to extend coverage of superfast broadband across the UK, achieving a baseline speed of 24 Megabits per second (<abbr title="Megabits per second">Mbps</abbr>). More than £1 billion is being invested to develop 5G mobile networks and extend the full-fibre rollout, capable of providing a highly reliable connection and speeds exceeding 1 Gigabit per second.</p>

<p>In addition, the University of Cambridge Research Computing Service is making the UK’s fastest academic supercomputer available to <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technology companies. This new <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> supercomputer is a £10 million partnership between the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (<abbr title="Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council">EPSRC</abbr>), the Science and Technology Facilities Council (<abbr title="Science and Technology Facilities Council">STFC</abbr>) and the university. Capable of solving the largest scientific and industrial challenges at very high speeds, it is supported by advice and consultancy from the team at Cambridge. The aim is to help companies to create real business value from advanced computing infrastructures.</p>

<p>In the 2017 Autumn Budget, the government announced a range of initiatives to ensure the infrastructure of the UK is wholly digitally connected. This included funding from the National Productivity Investment Fund to launch the £190 million Challenge Fund for Local Full Fibre Networks and provide a further £159 million for the 5G Testbeds and Trials programme. This will close down digital coldspots, ensuring <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> businesses can thrive anywhere in the UK.</p>

The government is committed to improving the financing of growth in highly innovative businesses. To do this the government is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>establishing a new £2.5 billion Investment Fund incubated in the British Business Bank</li>
  <li>investing in a series of private sector fund of funds of scale – the British Business Bank will seed the first wave of investment with up to £500 million, unlocking double its investment in private capital</li>
  <li>doubling the annual allowance for people investing in knowledgeintensive businesses through the Enterprise Investment Scheme (<abbr title="Enterprise Investment Scheme">EIS</abbr>) to £2 million a year</li>
  <li>providing greater flexibility for knowledge-intensive businesses over when they can access a first investment through <abbr title="Enterprise Investment Scheme">EIS</abbr> and Venture Capital Trusts (<abbr title="Venture Capital Trusts">VCT</abbr>)</li>
  <li>doubling the amount knowledgeintensive businesses can receive in a single year through <abbr title="Enterprise Investment Scheme">EIS</abbr> or <abbr title="Venture Capital Trusts">VCT</abbr> investment to £10 million</li>
  <li>backing first-time and emerging fund managers through the British Business Bank’s established Enterprise Capital Fund programme unlocking at least an additional £1.5 billion of investment</li>
  <li>backing overseas investment in UK venture capital, expected to release £1 billion of investment</li>
  <li>supporting long-term investment by giving pension funds confidence that they can invest in assets supporting innovative businesses as part of a diverse portfolio</li>
  <li>changing the qualifying rules in Entrepreneurs’ Relief to remove the disincentive to accept external investment and consulting on the detailed implementation of that change</li>

<h3 id="work-closely-with-key-clusters-to-provide-the-support-needed-for-ai-businesses-to-thrive">Work closely with key clusters to provide the support needed for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> businesses to thrive</h3>

<p>The government is committed to helping prosperous communities to thrive across the UK. As highlighted in ‘Growing the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> industry in the UK’, while the majority of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> businesses are based in London<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="govuk-link" rel="footnote">[footnote 9]</a></sup>, there are a number of other major technology clusters around the UK.</p>

<p>Yet many places are not realising their full potential. By introducing Local Industrial Strategies, and further strengthening local leadership through Local Enterprise Partnerships and Mayoral Combined Authorities, we will provide incentives to make regions across the UK attractive environments for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> businesses and research to flourish in. The huge potential for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> to transform sectors means action is needed now so that new and existing clusters are equipped to support the growing demand for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, and to be able to offer services locally.</p>

<p>For example, we are investing £21 million in Tech City UK over 4 years to expand into Tech Nation. Tech Nation will roll out dedicated sector programmes in tech specialisms, including <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>. The <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> programme will operate in 2 or 3 key clusters where there is <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> expertise and potential to provide the mentoring and growth support needed for ambitious <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> businesses to thrive. The aim is to link promising <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> clusters into a powerful network of high growth <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> businesses – part of Tech Nation’s strategy of linking regional tech clusters in London, Cambridge, Bristol and Bath, Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds and Sheffield, Reading, Birmingham, Edinburgh and Glasgow, Belfast, and Cardiff, to create a world leading national network of high growth tech entrepreneurs in the UK.</p>

<p>Key to the UK realising the full economic benefit of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is ensuring the adoption, deployment and use of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies by organisations of all size and sector. Following a recommendation made in the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Review techUK, the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Digital Catapult are working together to provide practical guidance and tools to support the effective and responsible use of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> by businesses across the UK. We are also working with Digital Catapult centres across London, North East and Tees Valley, Northern Ireland, Brighton and Yorkshire to help businesses adopt <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> effectively.</p>

<p>Alongside the 5 founding partner universities (Cambridge, Edinburgh, Oxford, Warwick and University College London) and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, The Alan Turing Institute has begun a programme of accepting new university partners. 8 new university partners have been announced in recent months.</p>

<p>These and other universities based in all 4 nations of the UK with strengths in <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, will host prestigious Turing Fellowships, whose holders will also be based at the Turing Institute. This will enable the Institute’s geographical span to grow and transform it into a truly national institute for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> and data science.</p>

<p>The actions we are taking to support the growth of <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> ecosystems apply throughout the United Kingdom and the challenges we face are shared with our partners in the devolved administrations. As we deliver this Sector Deal we will look for opportunities to collaborate.</p>

<p>As the UK’s longest established <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> research centre, the University of Edinburgh has been the home for many spin-out businesses, such as Skyscanner, while the Edinburgh Centre for Robotics recently won a £36 million grant for research into offshore robotics. Additionally, data driven innovation and <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> technologies underpin the £1.1 billion Scottish and UK government funded Edinburgh City Region Deal. Meanwhile, BT is opening a £29 million <abbr title="research and development">R&amp;D</abbr> facility in Belfast, and partnering with Ulster University to research future technologies such as the Internet of Things, <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>, data analytics, cybersecurity and 5G. Welsh company IQE has been at the forefront of the compound semiconductor industry for more than 25 years, and has joined with Cardiff University to invest in developing a compound semiconductor cluster in the area as part of the £1.2 billion City Deal agreed between local authorities, Welsh and UK governments. This builds on the existing cluster in the region, which is supported by the UK government’s investment in the Compound Semiconductor Applications Catapult. We want to support the growth of these clusters and the measures in the Industrial Strategy and Sector Deal will help achieve this.</p>

<p>An early role for the Office for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> will be to agree implementation plans for each section of the deal, including agreed success metrics.</p>

<p>Membership of the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Council will be announced ahead of the first meeting. The main aim of the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Council will be to provide strategic leadership and momentum in delivery.</p>

<p>The Office for <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> will report to the <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> Council regularly and will be subject to challenge sessions from government ministers on progress in implementing the Sector Deal. The Industrial Strategy team will provide the challenge on delivery timetable, metrics and ambition on outcomes as well as providing updates and escalation to ministers across the suite of Sector Deals.</p>

        "text": "\u003cp\u003eThroughout history, there have been moments when the progress of technology has taken great steps forward, when a combination of the right tools, a capacity for innovation, and sparks of ingenuity lead to breakthroughs that transform how we live our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eHow we produce and process information is critical to innovation – and our methods of recording and communicating information have themselves undergone great leaps. From the development of writing, to Gutenberg’s printing press – which advanced the spread of knowledge to the masses and ushered in the enlightenment and scientific revolution – to the first programmable digital computer Colossus, the cost of reproducing and communicating information, or data, has fallen again and again. At the same time, tools for processing and making sense of large quantities of data have developed exponentially – with artificial intelligence (\u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e) representing the latest leap. In the same way that Gutenberg’s press ushered in a new era of growth, data-driven technologies such as \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e will underpin our future prosperity.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThere is no doubt that machine learning and \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e is already improving peoples’ lives, from intelligent personal assistants that can prepare us for changes in the weather, to systems that protect our money from criminals, or devices that offer medical advice from the comfort of our own home. And this is only the start; the potential of \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e is undeniable. Our next challenge will be to harness this technology to transform how we diagnose diseases, manufacture goods and build our homes.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eUsing advanced algorithmic techniques such as ‘deep learning’, \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e has the potential to solve complex problems fast, and in so doing, free up time and raise productivity. But we also need to make sure \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e benefits everyone in the UK, which is why – in addition to this Sector Deal – the government is establishing a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation to advise on the ethical use of data, including for \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe huge global opportunity \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e presents is why the \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/industrial-strategy-building-a-britain-fit-for-the-future\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eIndustrial Strategy white paper\u003c/a\u003e identified \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e and data as 1 of 4 Grand Challenges – in which the UK can lead the world for years to come.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe UK is well placed to do this. We are already home to some of the biggest names in the business such as Deepmind, Swiftkey and Babylon.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eAnd it’s not just the established players – Kwiziq, Cleo and Mindtrace are examples of UK \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e startups leading the way in areas as diverse as education, personal finance and autonomous vehicles. Major established companies in the tech sector, but also increasingly beyond, are using \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e to tune up their operations and services.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eTo realise all the social and economic benefits, we will need a strong partnership between business, academia and government. This sector deal establishes the beginning of that partnership. It responds to the recommendations of the \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e Review, \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/growing-the-artificial-intelligence-industry-in-the-uk\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘Growing the \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e Industry in the UK’\u003c/a\u003e, led by Professor Dame Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti, which articulated how the government and industry can work together on skills, infrastructure and implement a longterm strategy for \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e in the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWe need to be strategic and focused: recognising the increasing convergence of technologies and focusing on the areas where we can compete globally.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eWhile robotics, a complementary technology to \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e, was outside the scope of the \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e Review, recommendations on the robotics industry have been made in the \u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://connect.innovateuk.org/documents/2903012/16074728/RAS%20UK%20Strategy?version=1.0\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRobotics Review RAS 2020\u003c/a\u003e, and in \u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/made-smarter-review\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003e‘Made Smarter’\u003c/a\u003e, a review on digitising the manufacturing industry. Moving forwards, identifying and making the most of these synergies will be crucial for success.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eA revolution in \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e technology is already emerging. If we act now, we can lead it from the front. But if we ‘wait and see’ other countries will seize the advantage. Together, we can make the UK a global leader in this technology that will change all our lives.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/greg-clark\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRt Hon Greg Clark MP\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSecretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/matthew-hancock\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eRt Hon Matt Hancock MP\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eSecretary of State for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"http://users.ecs.soton.ac.uk/wh/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eProfessor Dame Wendy Hall\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eRegius Professor of Computer Science, the University of Southampton\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003e\u003ca rel=\"external\" href=\"https://research.fb.com/people/pesenti-jerome/\" class=\"govuk-link\"\u003eJérôme Pesenti\u003c/a\u003e \u003cbr\u003eVice President of \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e, Facebook\u003c/p\u003e"

To do this, we must equip citizens for jobs shaped by next generation technology. Growing the \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e industry in the UK outlined the fast-growing demand for expertise to develop and apply \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e technologies, and proposed ways to increase the supply of skills at different levels. Building on these recommendations and the commitments in the Industrial Strategy and Digital Strategy to grow science, technology, engineering and maths (\u003cabbr title=\"science, technology, engineering and maths\"\u003eSTEM\u003c/abbr\u003e) and digital skills training, this Sector Deal sets out how the government, universities and industry will work together to greatly improve the supply of skills. It also sets out how we will attract the best, and most diverse, global \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e talent to the UK.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"infrastructure-1\"\u003eInfrastructure\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eEnsuring the UK has the right digital infrastructure – both physical and, crucially, data infrastructure – is critical to meeting our ambition of leading the world in \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e. That is why, as part of our Industrial Strategy, we are investing over £1 billion to create a country with world class digital capabilities: from 5G mobile networks to full-fibre broadband. Equally important is the availability of data, which is required on a vast scale to train machine learning systems. The government and public bodies are already leading the way in making public datasets open and available. But there remain significant challenges to sharing private sector datasets. Through this Sector Deal, we will tackle both the practical and cultural barriers to sharing both publicly and privately held data. As part of this we will explore data sharing frameworks such as Data Trusts – mechanisms where parties have defined rights and responsibilities with respect to shared data – in order to protect sensitive data, facilitate access to data, and ensure accountability. This will allow and ensure fair and equitable data sharing between organisations in the private sector, and between the private and public sectors.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ch3 id=\"ideas-1\"\u003eIdeas\u003c/h3\u003e\u003cp\u003eThe government set out a vision in the Industrial Strategy to make the UK the world’s most innovative economy. To achieve this, we are committing to work with the private sector to boost research and development (\u003cabbr title=\"research and development\"\u003eR\u0026amp;D\u003c/abbr\u003e) spending to 2.4% by 2027, and 3% over the longer term. This begins with a £725 million investment through the Industrial Strategy Challenge Fund competition, designed to capture the value of innovation by commercialising a great idea in the lab to a successful business. For example, one early commitment is our £210 million Challenge on research into the early diagnosis of chronic illness – including a substantial investment in \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e diagnostics techniques\u003csup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fn:2\" class=\"govuk-link\" rel=\"footnote\"\u003e[footnote 2]\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e. The use of \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e is central to this work, which includes programmes applying \u003cabbr title=\"artificial intelligence\"\u003eAI\u003c/abbr\u003e to raise output in sectors of the economy that have struggled with productivity, from reducing crop disease in the agriculture sector, to delivering services digitally in the public sector.
