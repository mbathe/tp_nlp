This document, issued by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), is one of several fleshing out aspects of a more general and longer-term document issued in July 2017 by China&#8217;s State Council. DigiChina <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/blog/chinas-plan-lead-ai-purpose-prospects-and-problems/">translated and analyzed</a> that larger plan, which outlines ambitious targets through 2030, last year. This MIIT plan outlines more immediate guidance to industry, government, and experts through 2020 and includes some concrete metrics that can be applied to measure progress.</p><p>The Chinese-language text of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology&#8217;s release notice is available <a href="http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146290/n4388791/c5960863/content.html">here</a>, and the full text of the plan is available <a href="http://www.miit.gov.cn/n1146295/n1652858/n1652930/n3757016/c5960820/content.html">here</a>.</p><p>Both are translated below.

It focuses on the in-depth integration of information technology and manufacturing technology, with the industrialization and integration of the new generation of AI technology application as the focal point, to promote the in-depth integration of AI and the manufacturing industry and speed up the building of China into a manufacturing superpower and a cyber superpower.</p><p>At present, China's AI industry development has enjoyed good momentum, and there is huge space to grow. In accordance with the principle of "system layout, key breakthroughs, collaborative innovation, and openness and orderliness,&#8221; the Action Plan puts forward four major tasks. First, focus on nurturing and developing intelligent and networked vehicles, intelligent service robots, intelligent unmanned aerial vehicles, medical image-assisted diagnostic systems, video image identification systems, intelligent voice interactive systems, intelligent translation systems, and smart home products and other intelligent products; and promote the integrated application of smart products in the economy and society. Second, focus on the development of intelligent sensors, neural network chips, open source platforms, and other key areas, in order to lay a hardware and software foundation for the development of the AI industry. Third, there is a focus on deepening the development of intelligent manufacturing, to encourage the exploration and application of the new generation of AI technology in all aspects of the industrial sector, to enhance the innovation capability of intelligent manufacturing of key technology and equipment, and to foster the promotion of a new modes of intelligent manufacturing. Fourth, build a public support system for industry training resources, standard testing, and an intellectual property service platform, inintelligent network infrastructure, cybersecurity, and other industries, to improve the environment for the development of AI.</p><p>The Action Plan makes full use of the available resources and measures to strengthen the linkages between ministries and provinces and rely on the construction of national demonstration bases for new industrialized industries to support qualified areas to exert their own resource advantages and foster a group of leading enterprises in AI to and explore the construction of AI industrial clusters. The plan promotes the establishment of manufacturing innovation centers in the relevant fields, setting up key laboratories, encouraging industries to open up data rationally, and supporting more key industries and key areas to increase their application so as to promote breakthroughs in the development of the AI industry. We will strive by 2020, to achieve the goal of: "scaled development of key AI products, significant enhancement in AI overall core fundamental capabilities, deepened development of intelligent manufacturing, and basic establishment of an AI industry support system.&#8221;</p><p>In order to ensure that responsibility for each focus is clear, the Action Plan also sets forth measures to ensure five aspects, including: strengthen organized implementation, improve the degree of support, encourage innovation and pioneering work, accelerate personnel training, optimize the development environment, etc., to promote the formation of a positive development environment, ensure the successful implementation of the Action Plan, realistically advance AI industry development, and assist in the transformation and upgrading of the real economy.</p><h2 id="three-year-action-plan-for-promoting-development-of-a-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-industry-20182020-full-translation">Three-Year Action Plan for Promoting Development of a New Generation Artificial Intelligence Industry (2018&#8211;2020) [Full translation]</h2><p>Currently, a new round of technological revolution and industrial revolution is under way.
