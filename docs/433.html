<h2>2. Mind the gap: AI leaders pulling ahead</h2>
<p>Over the past five years we have tracked the leaders in AI—we refer to them as AI high performers—and examined what they do differently. We see more indications that these leaders are expanding their competitive advantage than we find evidence that others are catching up.</p>
<p>First, we haven’t seen an expansion in the size of the leader group. For the past three years, we have defined AI high performers as those organizations that respondents say are seeing the biggest bottom-line impact from AI adoption—that is, 20 percent or more of EBIT from AI use. The proportion of respondents falling into that group has remained steady at about 8 percent. The findings indicate that this group is achieving its superior results mainly from AI boosting top-line gains, as they’re more likely to report that AI is driving revenues rather than reducing costs, though they do report AI decreasing costs as well.</p>
<p>Next, high performers are more likely than others to follow core practices that unlock value, such as linking their <a href="/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/artificial-intelligence-in-strategy">AI strategy to business outcomes</a> (Exhibit 1).<span class="FootNote_footnote-holder__tjRqy"><a aria-label="footnote" href="javascript:void(0);" class="FootNote_footnote-wrapper__AIRwL undefined FootNote_inactive__VZfCp" aria-describedby="18dc511f-7c7f-4c38-b6c2-80c53ec3d4b3"><sup class="FootNote_footnotesup__e73z_">2</sup><span class="FootNote_notch-wrapper__b_5NS"><span class="FootNote_notch__omKtY"></span></span><span class="FootNote_tooltip__QtrbA mdc-u-mt-2"><span class="FootNote_footnote-content__r2OVl"><span id="18dc511f-7c7f-4c38-b6c2-80c53ec3d4b3" aria-hidden="true" data-module-theme="light" class="FootNote_footnote-text__VjKgO mck-u-links-inline">All questions about AI-related strengths and practices were asked only of the 744 respondents who said their organizations had adopted AI in at least one function, n = 744.</span></span></span></a></span> Also important, they are engaging more often in “frontier” practices that enable <a href="/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/executives-guide-to-developing-ai-at-scale">AI development and deployment at scale</a>, or what some call the “<a href="/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/power-up-how-southeast-asias-largest-bank-is-becoming-ai-fueled">industrialization of AI</a>.” For example, leaders are more likely to have a <a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/breaking-through-data-architecture-gridlock-to-scale-ai">data architecture that is modular enough</a> to accommodate new AI applications rapidly. They also often automate most data-related processes, which can both improve efficiency in AI development and expand the number of applications they can develop by <a href="/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/how-to-unlock-the-full-value-of-data-manage-it-like-a-product">providing more high-quality data</a> to feed into AI algorithms. And AI high performers are 1.6 times more likely than other organizations to engage nontechnical employees in creating AI applications by <a href="/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/rethinking-ai-talent-strategy-as-automated-machine-learning-comes-of-age">using emerging low-code or no-code programs</a>, which allow companies to speed up the creation of AI applications. In the past year, high performers have become even more likely than other organizations to follow certain advanced scaling practices, such as using standardized tool sets to create production-ready data pipelines and using an end-to-end platform for AI-related data science, data engineering, and application development that they’ve developed in-house.</p>
<!-- -->
<p>High performers might also have a head start on managing potential AI-related risks, such as personal privacy and equity and fairness, that other organizations have not addressed yet. While overall, we have seen little change in organizations reporting recognition and mitigation of AI-related risks since we began asking about them four years ago, respondents from AI high performers are more likely than others to report that they engage in <a href="/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/getting-to-know-and-manage-your-biggest-ai-risks">practices that are known to help mitigate risk</a>. These include ensuring AI and <a href="/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/designing-data-governance-that-delivers-value">data governance</a>, <a href="/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/winning-with-ai-is-a-state-of-mind">standardizing processes and protocols</a>, <a href="/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-data-driven-enterprise-of-2025">automating processes such as data quality control</a> to remove errors introduced through manual work, and testing the validity of models and monitoring them over time for potential issues.</p>

Of respondents from organizations that have adopted AI, 43 percent say their organizations are using AI to assist in sustainability efforts, and 40 percent say their organizations are working to reduce the environmental impact of their AI use by minimizing the energy used to train and run AI models. As companies that have invested more in AI and have more mature AI efforts than others, high performers are 1.4 times more likely than others to report AI-enabled sustainability efforts as well as to say their organizations are working to decrease AI-related emissions.

<p>When asked about the types of sustainability efforts using AI, respondents most often mention initiatives to improve environmental impact, such as optimization of energy efficiency or waste reduction. AI use is least common in efforts to improve organizations’ social impact (for example, sourcing of ethically made products), though respondents working for North American organizations are more likely than their peers to report that use.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>
<p>Investment is yet another area that could contribute to the widening of the gap: AI high performers are poised to continue outspending other organizations on AI efforts. Even though respondents at those leading organizations are just as likely as others to say they’ll increase investments in the future, they’re spending more than others now, meaning they’ll be increasing from a base that is a higher percentage of revenues. Respondents at AI high performers are nearly eight times more likely than their peers to say their organizations spend at least 20 percent of their digital-technology budgets on AI-related technologies. And these digital budgets make up a much larger proportion of their enterprise spend: respondents at AI high performers are over five times more likely than other respondents to report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent of their enterprise-wide revenue on digital technologies.</p>
<p>Finally, all of this may be giving AI high performers a leg up in attracting AI talent. There are indications that these organizations have less difficulty hiring for roles such as AI data scientist and data engineer. Respondents from organizations that are not AI high performers say filling those roles has been “very difficult” much more often than respondents from AI high performers do.</p>
<p>The bottom line: high performers are already well positioned for sustained AI success, improved efficiency in new AI development, and a resultingly more attractive environment for talent. The good news for organizations outside the leader group is that there’s a clear blueprint of best practices for success.</p>

<h2>3. AI talent tales: New hot roles, continued diversity woes</h2>
<p>Our first detailed look at the AI talent picture signals the maturation of AI, surfaces the most common strategies organizations employ for talent sourcing and upskilling, and shines a light on AI’s diversity problem—while showing yet again a link between diversity and success.</p>
<h3>Hiring is a challenge, but less so for high performers</h3>
<p>All organizations report that hiring AI talent, particularly data scientists, remains difficult. AI high performers report slightly less difficulty and hired some roles, like machine learning engineers, more often than other organizations.</p>

<h3>Reskilling and upskilling are common alternatives to hiring</h3>
<p>When it comes to sourcing AI talent, the most popular strategy among all respondents is reskilling existing employees. Nearly half are doing so. Recruiting from top-tier universities as well as from technology companies that aren’t in the top tier, such as regional leaders, are also common strategies. But a look at the strategies of high performers suggests organizations might be best served by tapping as many recruiting channels as possible (Exhibit 2). These companies are doing more than others to recruit AI-related talent from various sources. The findings show that while they’re more likely to recruit from top-tier technical universities and tech companies, they’re also more likely to source talent from other universities, training academies, and diversity-focused programs or professional organizations.</p>

<p>Responses suggest that both AI high performers and other organizations are upskilling technical and nontechnical employees on AI, with nearly half of respondents at both AI high performers and other organizations saying they are reskilling as a way of gaining more AI talent. However, high performers are taking more steps than other organizations to build employees’ AI-related skills.</p>
<p>Respondents at high performers are nearly three times more likely than other respondents to say their organizations have capability-building programs to develop technology personnel’s AI skills. The most common approaches they use are <a href="/capabilities/operations/our-insights/everyone-is-within-learning-distance-building-skills-remotely">experiential learning</a>, self-directed online courses, and certification programs, whereas other organizations most often lean on self-directed online courses.</p>
<p>High performers are also much more likely than other organizations to go beyond providing access to self-directed online course work to upskill nontechnical employees on AI. Respondents at high performers are nearly twice as likely as others to report offering peer-to-peer learning and certification programs to nontechnical personnel.</p>
<h3>Increasing diversity on AI teams is a work in progress</h3>
<p>We also explored the level of diversity within organizations’ AI-focused teams, and we see that there is significant room for improvement at most organizations. The average share of employees on these teams at respondents’ organizations who identify as women is just 27 percent (Exhibit 3). The share is similar when looking at the average proportion of racial or ethnic minorities developing AI solutions: just 25 percent. What’s more, 29 percent of respondents say their organizations have no minority employees working on their AI solutions.</p>

<p>Some companies are working to improve the diversity of their AI talent, though there’s more being done to improve gender diversity than ethnic diversity. Forty-six percent of respondents say their organizations have active programs to increase gender diversity within the teams that are developing AI solutions, through steps such as partnering with diversity-focused professional associations to recruit candidates. One-third say their organizations have programs to increase racial and ethnic diversity. We also see that organizations with women or minorities working on AI solutions often have programs in place to address these employees’ experiences.</p>
<p>In line with <a href="/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters">previous McKinsey studies</a>, the research shows a correlation between diversity and outperformance. Organizations at which respondents say at least 25 percent of AI development employees identify as women are 3.2 times more likely than others to be AI high performers. Those at which at least one-quarter of AI development employees are racial or ethnic minorities are more than twice as likely to be AI high performers.</p>

Mind the gap: AI leaders pulling ahead\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOver the past five years we have tracked the leaders in AI\u0026mdash;we refer to them as AI high performers\u0026mdash;and examined what they do differently. We see more indications that these leaders are expanding their competitive advantage than we find evidence that others are catching up.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFirst, we haven\u0026rsquo;t seen an expansion in the size of the leader group. For the past three years, we have defined AI high performers as those organizations that respondents say are seeing the biggest bottom-line impact from AI adoption\u0026mdash;that is, 20 percent or more of EBIT from AI use. The proportion of respondents falling into that group has remained steady at about 8 percent. The findings indicate that this group is achieving its superior results mainly from AI boosting top-line gains, as they\u0026rsquo;re more likely to report that AI is driving revenues rather than reducing costs, though they do report AI decreasing costs as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNext, high performers are more likely than others to follow core practices that unlock value, such as linking their \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/artificial-intelligence-in-strategy\"\u003eAI strategy to business outcomes\u003c/a\u003e\u0026nbsp;(Exhibit 1).[[footnote 2]] Also important, they are engaging more often in \u0026ldquo;frontier\u0026rdquo; practices that enable \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/executives-guide-to-developing-ai-at-scale\"\u003eAI development and deployment at scale\u003c/a\u003e, or what some call the \u0026ldquo;\u003ca href=\"/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/power-up-how-southeast-asias-largest-bank-is-becoming-ai-fueled\"\u003eindustrialization of AI\u003c/a\u003e.\u0026rdquo; For example, leaders are more likely to have a \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/breaking-through-data-architecture-gridlock-to-scale-ai\"\u003edata architecture that is modular enough\u003c/a\u003e to accommodate new AI applications rapidly. They also often automate most data-related processes, which can both improve efficiency in AI development and expand the number of applications they can develop by \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/how-to-unlock-the-full-value-of-data-manage-it-like-a-product\"\u003eproviding more high-quality data\u003c/a\u003e to feed into AI algorithms. And AI high performers are 1.6 times more likely than other organizations to engage nontechnical employees in creating AI applications by \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/rethinking-ai-talent-strategy-as-automated-machine-learning-comes-of-age\"\u003eusing emerging low-code or no-code programs\u003c/a\u003e, which allow companies to speed up the creation of AI applications. In the past year, high performers have become even more likely than other organizations to follow certain advanced scaling practices, such as using standardized tool sets to create production-ready data pipelines and using an end-to-end platform for AI-related data science, data engineering, and application development that they\u0026rsquo;ve developed in-house.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[ceros 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eHigh performers might also have a head start on managing potential AI-related risks, such as personal privacy and equity and fairness, that other organizations have not addressed yet. While overall, we have seen little change in organizations reporting recognition and mitigation of AI-related risks since we began asking about them four years ago, respondents from AI high performers are more likely than others to report that they engage in \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/getting-to-know-and-manage-your-biggest-ai-risks\"\u003epractices that are known to help mitigate risk\u003c/a\u003e. These include ensuring AI and \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/designing-data-governance-that-delivers-value\"\u003edata governance\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/winning-with-ai-is-a-state-of-mind\"\u003estandardizing processes and protocols\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-data-driven-enterprise-of-2025\"\u003eautomating processes such as data quality control\u003c/a\u003e to remove errors introduced through manual work, and testing the validity of models and monitoring them over time for potential issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[sidebar 1]]\n\u003cp\u003eInvestment is yet another area that could contribute to the widening of the gap: AI high performers are poised to continue outspending other organizations on AI efforts. Even though respondents at those leading organizations are just as likely as others to say they\u0026rsquo;ll increase investments in the future, they\u0026rsquo;re spending more than others now, meaning they\u0026rsquo;ll be increasing from a base that is a higher percentage of revenues. Respondents at AI high performers are nearly eight times more likely than their peers to say their organizations spend at least 20 percent of their digital-technology budgets on AI-related technologies. And these digital budgets make up a much larger proportion of their enterprise spend: respondents at AI high performers are over five times more likely than other respondents to report that their organizations spend more than 20 percent of their enterprise-wide revenue on digital technologies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinally, all of this may be giving AI high performers a leg up in attracting AI talent. There are indications that these organizations have less difficulty hiring for roles such as AI data scientist and data engineer. Respondents from organizations that are not AI high performers say filling those roles has been \u0026ldquo;very difficult\u0026rdquo; much more often than respondents from AI high performers do.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe bottom line: high performers are already well positioned for sustained AI success, improved efficiency in new AI development, and a resultingly more attractive environment for talent. The good news for organizations outside the leader group is that there\u0026rsquo;s a clear blueprint of best practices for success.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[ceros bryce]]\n\u003ca id=\"talent\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003e3. AI talent tales: New hot roles, continued diversity woes\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur first detailed look at the AI talent picture signals the maturation of AI, surfaces the most common strategies organizations employ for talent sourcing and upskilling, and shines a light on AI\u0026rsquo;s diversity problem\u0026mdash;while showing yet again a link between diversity and success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eHiring is a challenge, but less so for high performers\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAll organizations report that hiring AI talent, particularly data scientists, remains difficult. AI high performers report slightly less difficulty and hired some roles, like machine learning engineers, more often than other organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[story 2]]\n\u003ch3\u003eReskilling and upskilling are common alternatives to hiring\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen it comes to sourcing AI talent, the most popular strategy among all respondents is reskilling existing employees. Nearly half are doing so. Recruiting from top-tier universities as well as from technology companies that aren\u0026rsquo;t in the top tier, such as regional leaders, are also common strategies. But a look at the strategies of high performers suggests organizations might be best served by tapping as many recruiting channels as possible (Exhibit 2). These companies are doing more than others to recruit AI-related talent from various sources. The findings show that while they\u0026rsquo;re more likely to recruit from top-tier technical universities and tech companies, they\u0026rsquo;re also more likely to source talent from other universities, training academies, and diversity-focused programs or professional organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[exhibit 2]]\n\u003cp\u003eResponses suggest that both AI high performers and other organizations are upskilling technical and nontechnical employees on AI, with nearly half of respondents at both AI high performers and other organizations saying they are reskilling as a way of gaining more AI talent. However, high performers are taking more steps than other organizations to build employees\u0026rsquo; AI-related skills.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRespondents at high performers are nearly three times more likely than other respondents to say their organizations have capability-building programs to develop technology personnel\u0026rsquo;s AI skills. The most common approaches they use are \u003ca href=\"/capabilities/operations/our-insights/everyone-is-within-learning-distance-building-skills-remotely\"\u003eexperiential learning\u003c/a\u003e, self-directed online courses, and certification programs, whereas other organizations most often lean on self-directed online courses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHigh performers are also much more likely than other organizations to go beyond providing access to self-directed online course work to upskill nontechnical employees on AI. Respondents at high performers are nearly twice as likely as others to report offering peer-to-peer learning and certification programs to nontechnical personnel.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eIncreasing diversity on AI teams is a work in progress\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe also explored the level of diversity within organizations\u0026rsquo; AI-focused teams, and we see that there is significant room for improvement at most organizations. The average share of employees on these teams at respondents\u0026rsquo; organizations who identify as women is just 27 percent (Exhibit 3). The share is similar when looking at the average proportion of racial or ethnic minorities developing AI solutions: just 25 percent. What\u0026rsquo;s more, 29 percent of respondents say their organizations have no minority employees working on their AI solutions.\u003c/p\u003e\n[[exhibit 3]]\n\u003cp\u003eSome companies are working to improve the diversity of their AI talent, though there\u0026rsquo;s more being done to improve gender diversity than ethnic diversity. Forty-six percent of respondents say their organizations have active programs to increase gender diversity within the teams that are developing AI solutions, through steps such as partnering with diversity-focused professional associations to recruit candidates. One-third say their organizations have programs to increase racial and ethnic diversity. We also see that organizations with women or minorities working on AI solutions often have programs in place to address these employees\u0026rsquo; experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn line with \u003ca href=\"/featured-insights/diversity-and-inclusion/diversity-wins-how-inclusion-matters\"\u003eprevious McKinsey studies\u003c/a\u003e, the research shows a correlation between diversity and outperformance. Organizations at which respondents say at least 25 percent of AI development employees identify as women are 3.2 times more likely than others to be AI high performers.
