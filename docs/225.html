            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The future of finance is digital: consumers and businesses are more and more accessing financial services digitally, innovative market participants are deploying new technologies, and existing business models are changing. Digital finance has helped citizens and businesses tackle the unprecedented situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic. For example, online identity verification has enabled consumers to open accounts and use multiple financial services at a distance. A growing proportion of in-store payments are now digital and contactless, and on-line purchases (e-commerce) have significantly increased. Fintech solutions have helped to broaden and speed up access to loans, including loans supported by government in response to the Covid-19 crisis. Ensuring safe and reliable operation of digital infrastructures has also become more important, as more people access financial services online and financial sector employees themselves work remotely. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>If there was still any doubt it is now clear: digital finance has a lot to offer, and the people and businesses of Europe are ready for it. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Europe must take full advantage of this in its recovery strategy to help repair the social and economic damage brought by the pandemic.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref2" href="#footnote2">1</a>
               </span><span> Digital technologies will be key for relaunching and modernising the European economy across sectors. It will move Europe forward as a global digital player. At the same time, users of financial services must be protected against risks stemming from increased reliance on digital finance. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Supporting the digital transition in the EU is a key priority for the Commission, as set out earlier this year</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               <span>Payment services play a key role among digital financial services, being at the cutting edge of innovation and instrumental to support the digital economy. Digital payment solutions enable individuals and companies to transact safely and efficiently. They are indispensable for paying in shops and in e-commerce, settling bills, repaying loans or mortgages, transferring money, paying salaries or pensions.  As such, they require specific policy measures which are developed in the communication entitled “A Retail Payments Strategy for the EU”, published together with this communication.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

               <span><span class="num">2.</span></span><span>The background: digital innovation trends</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The digital transformation of the economy has changed innovation and business models including in financial services. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Innovation increasingly takes a digital form, making it easier for firms to grow.</span><span> To an ever-increasing extent, innovation implies new products, processes or business models enabled by digital technologies. From having a mere support function, information technology (IT) systems in combination with appropriate software have become a core pillar of business activities for many firms. This is because digitalisation offers substantial new opportunities, as digital networks and data services generally facilitate economies of scale, enabling the provision of more qualitative services at a lower cost .</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Innovation cycles are accelerating, becoming more open and collaborative. </span><span>Digital technologies and applications are increasingly built in a modular way, communicating with each other via application programming interfaces (APIs). They make it possible to tailor services more closely to customer demand. They also provide more opportunities for experimentation and collaboration between various actors. This may have a number of consequences for the way financial services are provided. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Data is becoming a key asset for innovation along with IT infrastructure.</span><span> Data has become more important than ever for financial services. The availability of digital data enables more accurate prediction of future events, thereby allowing for the provision of bespoke services. Analysing a merged dataset provides more insights than analysing each dataset separately. The economic benefits derived from a specific dataset are higher when multiple parties have simultaneous access to it. In addition, use of associated technologies is necessary to maximise data value. IT infrastructure today increasingly sits in the cloud, offering a high degree of operational flexibility and facilitating access to advanced data processing technology. These developments also raise important new issues for protecting consumers and a responsible use of their data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>At the same time, innovation is changing market structures</span><span>. Europe is home to many successful Fintech start-ups. Incumbent firms are fundamentally overhauling their business models, often in cooperation with Fintech companies. Technology companies both large (“BigTech”) and small are increasingly active in financial services. These developments are changing the nature of risks to consumers, users and financial stability and they may also have a significant impact on competition in financial services.</span>

               <span><span class="num">4.</span></span><span>Four priorities for the digital transformation of the EU financial sector</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In light of the trends and objectives outlined above, and as supported by the vast majority of respondents participating in the public consultation underpinning this strategy,</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref13" href="#footnote13">12</a>
               </span><span> four priorities will guide EU actions to promote digital transformation up to 2024. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The first priority is to tackle fragmentation in the Digital Single Market for financial services, thereby  enabling European consumers to access cross-border services and help European financial firms’ scale up their digital operations (4.1)</span><span>. Many firms have confirmed that scaling up across borders is essential for them, because on-line services are costly to develop but cheap to reproduce and often require deployment at considerable scale. A larger potential market across borders makes it easier to raise the funds needed to develop such services. It gives consumers genuine access to cross border services. Firms achieving scale may also be able to provide such services at a lower price and higher quality.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The second priority is to ensure that the EU regulatory framework facilitates digital innovation in the interest of consumers and market efficiency (4.2).</span><span> Innovations based on or making use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) or artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to improve financial services for consumers and businesses. The regulatory framework for financial services should ensure that they are used in a responsible way, in line with EU values. More broadly, faster, more open and collaborative innovation cycles call for regular examination of and adjustments to EU financial services legislation and supervisory practices, to ensure that they support digital innovation and remain appropriate and relevant in evolving market environments. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The third priority is to create a European financial data space to promote data-driven innovation, building on the European data strategy, including enhanced access to data and data sharing within the financial sector (4.3).</span><span class="FootnoteReference">
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref14" href="#footnote14">13</a>
               </span><span> </span><span>The EU has ensured that companies including financial firms publish comprehensive financial and non-financial information on their operations and products. It has also led the way in opening up the sharing of data on payments accounts as part of the revised Payment Services Directive. Further steps towards enhanced data sharing and openness across and within sectors, in compliance with  data protection and competition rules, will enable the financial sector to fully embrace data-driven innovation. This will encourage the creation of innovative products for consumers and businesses, and will support broader policy objectives, such as the as the creation of a single market for data. It will also contribute to facilitating access to data needed to channel funding in support of sustainable investments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The fourth priority is to address new challenges and risks associated with the digital transformation (4.4).</span><span> Financial services migrate to digital environments with fragmented ecosystems, comprising interconnected digital service providers falling partially outside financial regulation and supervision. Digital finance may therefore make it more challenging for the existing regulatory and supervisory frameworks to safeguard financial stability, consumer protection, market integrity, fair competition and security. To ensure that digital finance’s enable better financial products for consumers and businesses these risks must be addressed.  The Commission will therefore pay particular attention to the principle </span><span>“same activity, same risk, same rules”</span><span>, not least to safeguard the level playing field between existing financial institutions and new market participants. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Across these four priorities, the Commission will pay particular attention to </span><span>promoting the new opportunities that digital finance offer to consumers and to protecting consumers wherever appropriate</span><span>. This will notably be </span><span>in due compliance with data protection rules, in particular the General Data Protection Regulation</span><span>
                  <a class="footnoteRef" id="footnoteref15" href="#footnote15">14</a>
               </span><span> (GDPR)</span><span>. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission also remains committed to continue working closely with our international partners</span><span>, since the benefits of digital finance are best harnessed if their deployment is based on international principles and standards. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal"/>
            <p class="li ListParagraph">

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The digital finance strategy is designed to build on the opportunities offered by the Single Market, to offer consumers and firms the benefits of digital financial services. A well-functioning Single Market for digital financial services will help improve access to financial services for consumers and retail investors in the EU through more innovative, diverse and inclusive banking, investment and insurance services. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>By 2024, the EU should implement a sound legal framework enabling the use of interoperable digital identity solutions which will enable new customers to access financial services quickly and easily (“on boarding”). This framework should be based on more harmonised anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorism financing (CTF) rules and a revised framework for electronic identification and trust services for electronic transactions (e-IDAS Regulation)</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The recent lockdown has highlighted just how essential digital financial services that function smoothly are for consumers and businesses interacting remotely. However, much more needs to be done before remote ‘on-boarding’ of financial services will work effectively and seamlessly. This needs to work both in domestic and cross-border settings, in full compliance with AML/CTF requirements and with a view to facilitating compliance with other regulatory on-boarding requirements, for example to assess a customer’s suitability for certain investment products. The Commission will facilitate financial service providers’ safe remote on-boarding of customers across the EU in three steps.</span>
            </p>

               <span>First, the Commission is today inviting the European Banking Authority (EBA) to develop guidelines in close coordination with the other European Supervisory Authorities by Q3 2021. These aim to ensure greater convergence on the elements related to identification and verification needed for on-boarding purposes, and on the manner and extent to which financial service providers are allowed to rely on customer due diligence (CDD) processes carried out by third parties, including other financial service providers. In parallel, the Commission will engage with the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) to clarify all data protection aspects in the context of reusing ‘on-boarding’ information for other purposes (e.g. ‘on-boarding’ with another provider, access to other non-banking services). </span>

               <span>Second, as part of the upcoming legislative proposals for a new AML/CTF framework, the Commission will further define and harmonise CDD requirements to facilitate the use of innovative technologies and allow for seamless cross-border operation, without the need to apply different processes or comply with additional requirements in each Member State. This will make it easier to identify customers and check their credentials ), while ensuring full compliance with the AML/CTF risk-based approach. For instance, this could be done by stating what ID documents are needed to establish a person’s identity, and by clarifying which technologies can be used to check ID remotely. The Commission review of AML/CTF rules will also aim to propose: </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>A long-standing principle in the single market is that consumers and businesses should have genuine access to cross-border services provided by firms established and supervised in another Member State in line with commonly agreed rules (“passporting”). Any remaining obstacles to cross-border provision of such services should be particularly low for digital services. However, as highlighted by many respondents to the public consultation, EU fintech firms often can only provide services only within their own country or restrict access to their digital platforms to customers located in a limited list of EU jurisdictions. The main reasons for that are that regulatory framework differs from country to country , entailing disproportionate compliance costs for operators active in several countries.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission is amending the regulatory framework to introduce the possibility of passporting in key areas relevant to digital finance. The Crowdfunding Regulation, agreed by the co-legislators in December 2019 will introduce common rules and passporting for various types of crowdfunding services, including credit intermediation, and today’s Commission proposals on crypto-assets will propose common rules and passporting for crypto-asset issuers and service providers. The Commission will also consider the relevance of passporting in other areas, for example in the context of examining the prudential regulation of non-bank lending, with due attention to consumer protection rules (see section 4.4 below). It will also examine possible ways to enable the certification of technical solutions designed to help firms meeting their regulatory compliance obligations (“RegTech”</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

At the same time, the practical application of passporting requires close cooperation between home and host supervisors to ensure that commonly agreed rules are enforced and applied consistently. The Commission encourages the European Supervisory Authorities (ESAs) to continue and step up their work to promote cooperation and supervisory convergence.</span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>To encourage cooperation between private and public stakeholders, the Commission, in cooperation with EFIF, will establish a new EU digital finance platform. The new platform will serve as a channel to interact online and on an ongoing basis with this new digital finance ecosystem building on the positive feedback received after the digital finance outreach. It will also offer an interface to the EFIF and to national innovation facilitators and national e-licensing procedures. Going forward, it could be developed into a broader platform for cooperation and a data space that could be used by industry or supervisory authorities to test innovation. The platform will be designed to be eligible for potential funding from the digital Europe programme which will support the roll–out of collaboration platforms for mainstreamining digital technologies.. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Crypto-assets and their associated blockchains can bring significant opportunities in finance: potentially cheap and fast payments, especially for cross-border and international transactions, new funding possibilities for SMEs and more efficient capital markets.

               </span><span> to accompany this strategy. The proposal clarifies the application of existing EU rules to crypto-assets, introduces a pilot regime for crypto-assets covered by these rules and establishes a new EU legal framework for crypto-assets that are not covered by these rules, based on a taxonomy of definitions of different types of crypto-assets. The latter includes utility tokens and dedicated rules to regulate the particular risks for financial stability and monetary sovereignty linked to asset-referenced tokens (also known as ‘stablecoins’) used for payment purposes. Additional interpretative guidance on the application of existing rules will improve regulatory clarity, enabling the financial sector to reap efficiency gains through wider use of distributed ledger technology (DLT) in capital markets, while continuing to respect the safety and security rules and maintaining a high level of user protection. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>At the same time, in light of ongoing work carried out by the Basel Committee, the Commission will consider updating the prudential rules for crypto-assets held by financial firms.

Other cloud policy measures that aim at increasing competition and market fluidity, building on the already available self-regulatory codes of conduct developed by the industry as regards switching cloud service providers and porting data are expected to foster cloud adoption in the financial sector. The Commission has requested the EU cybersecurity agency (ENISA) to develop a cybersecurity certification scheme for cloud services in conformity with the Cybersecurity Act, which will support trust in cloud use, notably by financial services and regulators. Further action may include measures on how to facilitate the migration towards a modular IT architecture and to allow for collaboration with other players.

               <span>By 2024, the EU should have an open finance framework in place, in line with the EU Data Strategy, the upcoming Data Act, and Digital Services Act. This will be coordinated with the review of the Payment Services Directive.</span>

               <span>The revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) marked an important step towards the sharing and use of customer-permissioned data by banks and third party providers to create new services (“open finance”). The Commission will launch the review of the Payment Services Directive in 2021, including an assessment of its scope. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Open finance can lead to better financial products, better targeted advice and improved access for consumers and greater efficiency in business-to-business transactions. Access to more customer data would also enable service providers to offer more personalised services that are better tailored to customers’ specific needs. A balanced regulatory framework for the sharing of data on financial products will support the financial sector in fully embracing data-driven finance, and effectively protect data subjects, who must have full control over their data.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission will therefore propose legislation on a broader open finance framework by mid-2022. It will build on the upcoming initiative focusing on data access, including the upcoming Data Act, and the Digital Services Act</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

As announced in the retail payments strategy, the Commission will explore initiatives at EU level to address the current issues faced by payment services providers when trying to access near field communication (NFC) antennas available on certain mobile platforms (such as phones or tablets) and used for effective contactless payments. The open finance framework will also build on the initiatives on digital identities mentioned above. </span>

            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The digital transformation of the financial sector is not without challenges and risks, some of which are transversal in nature due to the digital environment itself, whilst others are more specific to the individual policy initiatives set out above. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="li ListParagraph">
               <span class="list-symbol"><span class="num">·</span></span><span>Safeguarding financial stability, protecting investors and consumers, based on the “same </span><span>activity</span><span>, same </span><span>risk</span><span>, same rules” principle</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>By 2024, the EU prudential and conduct regulation and supervision should be adapted to be future proof for the new financial ecosystem, including traditional regulated financial institutions and technology providers offering financial services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Technology companies – large and small – are increasingly entering financial services, either directly or indirectly. While many technology providers are now offering payments and related services, respondents to the Commission’s public consultation expect that online provision of other financial services, such as loans, insurance, and asset management for consumers and businesses develops further. Large technology companies also often act as intermediaries by bundling various services and products with associated financial services, such as payments, financing or insurance and thus become marketplaces for financial services. They can scale up financial services quickly across their large user bases and radically change market structures, sometimes adversely affecting competition. Finally, large technology companies also provide many of the digital technology solutions that are used in the provision of financial services, including hardware, software and cloud-based solutions for the financial industry. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Technology companies are therefore likely to become an integral part of the financial ecosystem, and most respondents to the public consultation expect risks to increase as a consequence. It is important to address all these risks, not only those affecting customers (policy-holders, investors and depositors) but also broader financial stability issues and competition in financial services markets. Such issues are significant both as regards technology companies’ provision of, and consumers and businesses’ access to, financial services, as well as the potential spill-over effects between the financial and non-financial parts of mixed groups. In this context, regulation and supervision should be proportionate, based on the principle of “same activity, same risk, same rules” and pay particular attention to the risks of significant operators. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Furthermore, technology is contributing to breaking up previously integrated value chains for a given financial service. While most financial services have traditionally been offered by one provider, digital technologies have made it possible for firms to specialise in a particular leg in the value chain. This increases competition and may improve efficiency. However, it also makes value chains more complex, making it harder for supervisors to have an overview of the risks in the value chain, especially if the entities involved are subject to different regulatory and supervisory frameworks.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission will, where necessary, adapt the existing conduct and prudential EU legal frameworks so as to continue safeguarding financial stability and protecting customers in line with the “same activity, same risk, same rules” principle. The Commission will cooperate with the ECB, national central banks and competent authorities in this process as appropriate.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>First, as set out in the Retail Payments Strategy, the Commission will review the Payment Services Directive and the E-Money Directive.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Second, it will assess how to ensure comprehensive supervision of the more fragmented value chains and the new providers of financial services. One possibility, included in the proposal on crypto assets presented alongside this strategy, is to establish a supervisory college for the ecosystem of a given financial services value chain. This would improve cooperation and ensure that no risk is ignored.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Third, the Commission will explore ways to ensure that the prudential supervisory perimeter is broad enough to capture risks arising from platforms’ and technology firms’ financial services provision and from techno-financial conglomerates and groups. To that end, it will review whether provisions on group supervision in EU financial services legislation, such as the Financial Conglomerates Directive (FICOD), have a sufficiently broad and flexible institutional scope to adapt to a constantly changing financial market structure regardless of the corporate structure and the group’s main activities. The supplementary supervision of group risks entailed by FICOD could also be one way to beef up cooperation between sectoral supervisors so as to have a general overview of bundled financial services offered by various providers. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>Fourth, the Commission is considering the need for legislative proposals to address potential risks stemming from potential large-scale lending operations by firms outside the banking perimeter, which may entail both micro and macro-prudential risks. </span>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div class="content">
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>To prepare these actions, the Commission is requesting advice from the European supervisory authorities on how to address “same activity, same risk, same rules” issues, more fragmented value chains, the scope of the supervisory perimeter and prudential risks related to non-bank lending, and will decide on the necessary legislative amendments by mid-2022. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="Default">
               <span>The EU must integrate into all measures taken to implement this strategy the objective of continuously empowering and protecting consumers to ensure that they benefit from a broader access, under safe conditions, to innovative products and services. The protection of the public interest against the risk of money laundering, terrorist financing and any other financial misbehaviours including tax evasion should progress in parallel.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>In a digital world, consumers and investors can access a greater range of financial services, including cheaper and more innovative services. Interoperable digital identities will make it easier to access these products remotely and across borders. At the same time, there was a broad consensus among those who took part to the public consultation that with technology companies gaining market share in financial services, consumers will face additional risks, which could include the unwanted consequences of a potential reduction in competition. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission will integrate the objective of facilitating consumers’ access to financial services, while addressing the risks for them, into the implementation of all elements of this strategy. A new framework for safe remote identification referred to in section 4.1, easier access to public disclosures and a new open finance framework referred to in section 4.3 are particularly important in this respect. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Normal">
               <span>The Commission will assess whether and how the customer protection and conduct aspects of a number of items of EU legislations can be improved to take account of new, digital ways of providing financial services. The sectoral financial services framework includes a number of consumer and personal data protection rules, including rules on conduct of business, information disclosure, credit worthiness or advice. The Distance Marketing of Financial Services Directive sets out additional requirements as regards sales of financial services at a distance. In the context of  upcoming legislative reviews, the Commission will systematically assess whether consumer protection rules and the regulatory framework to fight money laundering, terrorist financing and any other financial misbehaviours including tax evasion are suited to the digital world, and propose legislative amendments where needed. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="Default">
               <span>Finally, to ensure that European consumers are made aware of these opportunities and that digital financial products and services fulfil their potential to fight financial exclusion, the Commission is ready to help fund financial literacy programmes focusing on digitalisation to be implemented by Member States, for example through the structural reform support service. The Commission will also duly consider the digital aspect of the actions proposed on financial literacy in the CMU action plan</span><span>.</span><span class="FootnoteReference">

The Commission will work together with the legislators and the supervisory community at both European and national level. Member States and national supervisors should continue and expand their numerous innovative initiatives, amplifying their effects beyond national markets to encompass the EU single market as a whole. </span>
