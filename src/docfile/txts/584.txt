Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 6Executive Summary Artificial intelligence (AI) promises to transform how government agencies do their work.  Rapid developments in AI have the potential to reduce the cost of core governance functions, improve the quality of decisions, and unleash the power of administrative data, thereby making  government performance more efficient and effective. Agencies that use AI to realize these gains  will also confront important questions about the proper design of algorithms and user interfaces, the respective scope of human and machine decision-making, the boundaries between public actions and private contracting, their own capacity to learn over time using AI, and whether the  use of AI is even permitted. These are important issues for public debate and academic inquiry. Yet little is known about how agencies are currently using AI systems beyond a few headlinegrabbing examples or surface-level descriptions. Moreover, even amidst growing public and scholarly discussion about how society might regulate government use of AI, little attention has  been devoted to how agencies acquire such tools in the first place or oversee their use. In an effort to fill these gaps, the Administrative Conference  of the United States (ACUS) commissioned this report from researchers at Stanford University and New York University. The research team included a diverse set of lawyers, law students, computer scientists, and social scientists with the capacity to analyze these cutting-edge issues from technical, legal, and policy angles. The resulting report offers three cuts at federal agency use of AI: • a rigorous canvass of AI use at the 142 most significant federal departments, agencies, and sub-agencies (Part I) • a series of in-depth but accessible case studies of specific AI applications at seven leading agencies covering a range of governance tasks (Part II); and • a set of cross-cutting analyses of the institutional, legal,and policy challenges raised by agency use of AI (Part III). Taken together, these analyses yield five main findings. First, the government’s AI toolkit is diverse and spans the  federal administrative state. Nearly half of the federal agencies studied (45%) have experimented with AI and related machine learning (ML) tools. Moreover, AI tools are already improving agency operations across the full range of governance tasks, including: • Enforcing regulatory mandates centered on market efficiency, workplace safety, health care, and environmental protection;• Adjudicating government benefits and privileges, from disability benefits to intellectual property rights; • Monitoring and analyzing risks to public health and safety; • Extracting useable information from the government’s massive data streams, from consumer complaints toweather patterns; and • Communicating with the public about its rights and obligations as welfare beneficiaries, taxpayers, asylum seekers, and business owners. The government’s AI toolkit spans the full technical scope of AI techniques, from conventional machine learning to more advanced “deep learning” with natural language and image data. The government’s AI toolkit is diverse  and spans the federal administrative  state. Nearly half of the federal agencies  studied (45%) have experimented with  AI and related machine learning   (ML) tools. 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 7Second, and despite wide agency embrace of AI, the  government still has a long way to go. In canvassing agency  use of AI, Stanford computer scientists evaluated the  techniques deployed in each use case and, while limited  public details precluded clear conclusions as to many, rated  only 12% as high in sophistication. This is concerning  because agencies will find it harder to realize gains in  accuracy and efficiency with less sophisticated tools. This  result also underscores AI’s potential to widen, not narrow,  the public-private technology gap. Third, AI poses deep accountability challenges. When public  officials deny benefits or make decisions affecting the public’s rights, the law generally requires them to explain why. Yet many of the more advanced AI tools are not, by their structure, fully explainable. A crucial question will be how to subject such tools to meaningful accountability and thus ensure their fidelity to legal norms of transparency, reason-giving, and non-discrimination. The case studies presented in the report highlight several vital aspects of that challenge: • Transparency’s costs, benefits, and feasibility will vary across policy areas, governance tasks, and AI techniques. Open-sourcing of technical details might be appropriate when agencies are allocating social welfare benefits but can undermine agency use of valuable enforcement tools because of gaming by regulatory targets. • One key area for future inquiry is how to adapt existing principles of administrative law, which is more likely to modulate agency use of AI than the constitutional constraints that occupy much current debate. • Policymakers should also consider other interventions. A promising candidate is to require agencies to engage in prospective “benchmarking” of AI tools by reserving a random hold-out sample of cases for human decision, thus providing critical information to smoke out when an algorithm has gone astray or “automation bias” has leddecision-makers to excessively defer to an algorithm. To achieve meaningful accountability, concrete and technically-informed thinking within and across contexts— not facile calls for prohibition, nor blind faith in innovation —is urgently needed.Fourth, if we expect agencies to make responsible and smart use of AI, technical capacity must come from within. While many agencies rely on private contractors to build out AI capacity, a majority of profiled use cases (53%) are the product of in-house efforts by agency technologists. This underscores the critical importance of internal agency capacity building as AI continues to proliferate. In particular: • In-house expertise promotes AI tools that are better tailored to complex governance tasks and more likely to be designed and implemented in lawful, policy-compliant, and accountable ways. Sustained collaboration between agency officials and in-house technologists facilitates identification of appropriate questions, seizing new innovations, and evaluating existing tools, including contractor-provided ones. • Fully leveraging agency use of AI will require significant public investment to draw needed human capital and update outmoded data and computing systems. Given fiscal and labor market constraints, agencies should also explore non-commercial sources of valuable technical capacity, including collaborations with universities, NGOs, and industry and agency-sponsored competitions. In-house expertise yields AI tools  that are better tailored to complex  governance tasks and more likely to  be implemented in a lawful, policycompliant, and accountable fashion.  Fifth, AI has the potential to raise distributive concerns and  fuel political anxieties. Growing agency use of AI creates a risk that AI systems will be gamed by better-heeled groups with resources and know-how. An enforcement agency’s algorithmic predictions, for example, may fall more heavily on smaller businesses that, unlike larger firms, lack a stable of computer scientists who can reverse-engineer the agency’s model and keep out of its cross-hairs. If citizens come to believe that AI systems are rigged, political support for a more effective and tech-savvy government will evaporate quickly.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 8In sum, the stakes are high. Managed well, algorithmic  governance tools can modernize public administration,  promoting more efficient, accurate, and equitable forms of  state action. Managed poorly, government deployment of AI  tools can hollow out the human expertise inside agencies with  few compensating gains, widen the public-private technology  gap, increase undesirable opacity in public decision-making,  and heighten concerns about arbitrary government action  and power. Given these stakes, agency administrators, judges,  technologists, legislators, and academics should think  carefully about how to spur government innovation involving  the appropriate use of AI tools while ensuring accountability  in their acquisition and use. This report seeks to stimulate  that thinking.To achieve meaningful accountability,  concrete and technically-informed  thinking within and across contexts— not facile calls for prohibition, nor blind  faith in innovation—is urgently needed. 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 9Introduction Americans depend on the federal government not only to provide for the common defense  and promote general welfare, but to protect the environment, advance public health, promote  innovation, and implement labor and employment standards. As federal agencies develop new  rules and guidance and adjudicate, enforce, and otherwise implement statutory policies, they  encounter a constantly changing economic, social, and technological context. The growing  sophistication of and interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) is among the  most important contextual changes for federal agencies during the past few decades. While many scholars and commentators have speculated  about how government should regulate AI, we know precious  little about how government agencies themselves use AI.  Getting an accurate picture of such use today is critical for  developing a national AI strategy that can help guide the  country’s approach to AI in the future, for modernizing the  public sector, and for instituting appropriate safeguards to  govern the adoption and use of AI. The recently proposed  AI in Government Act,1 for instance, aims to “improve the  use of AI across the federal government by providing access  to technical expertise and streamlining hiring within the  agencies.”2 At the same time, there is mounting resistance  against some of the most controversial uses of AI. As the  most visible example, a number of jurisdictions have recently  moved to ban use of facial recognition systems, and similar  efforts have begun to percolate in Congress.3 Without  understanding how government agencies develop and deploy  emerging AI technologies, it is difficult to craft sensible and  workable prescriptions. We realize that crafting those prescriptions—and, indeed,  addressing any of the most important issues involving  government adoption of AI—can prove contentious, and  rightly so. Some observers are concerned that AI will further  enhance government power, enabling surveillance that could  threaten privacy and civil liberties. Others express concern  that AI will further disempower marginalized groups. And still others take the view that the power of AI in the private  sector, without appropriate knowledge in the public sector,  can undermine agencies’ capacity to achieve regulatory goals.  Ultimately, our goal here is not to take any single categorical  position on the normative desirability of any specific  government use of AI or ML tools. Instead, our aim is to  understand how agencies are currently using this technology  and identify the most important legal and policy implications  it presents. The New Algorithmic Governance The use of AI-based tools to support government decisionmaking, implementation, and interaction—what could be  called “algorithmic governance”—already spans the work of  the modern administrative state. Table 1 previews some of the  use cases explored in this report and advances a typology of  governance tasks to which agencies are applying AI. Among  these are two core tasks of modern government: enforcing  regulatory mandates (“enforcement”) and adjudicating  benefits and privileges (“adjudication”). However, federal-level  use cases span well beyond enforcement and adjudication to  other critically important governance tasks, such as regulatory  analysis, rulemaking, internal personnel management, citizen  engagement, and service delivery.

In one  sense, the new algorithmic governance tools build on  several decades of federal government experimentation  with data mining—to identify criminal suspects, monitor  suspicious banking practices, and administer transportation  security—that created flash-points around government  privacy and cybersecurity practices in the 2000s.4 Other tools  harken back even further, to efforts in the 1990s to “reinvent government” through data-based performance management  and oversight.5 Finally, the new algorithmic governance tools  have plain antecedents in “expert systems” championed  throughout the 1960s and 1970s by Herbert Simon to  rationalize and evaluate administrative behavior.6 Such  systems relied on input by domain experts to craft logical rules  to automate decision-making. Yet these new algorithmic governance tools differ from prior  technological innovation in three important ways. First,  these tools are more inscrutable  in that even a system’s 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 11engineers may not fully understand how it arrived at a  result.7 In an expert-based system, the logical rules are  written as conditional (if-then) statements. In traditional  statistical analysis, outcomes are modeled with relatively  few explanatory variables and the resulting models remain  relatively simple. By contrast, state-of-the-art machine  learning deploys far more complex models to learn about   the relationship across hundreds or even thousands of  variables. Model complexity can make it difficult to isolate   the contribution of any particular variable to the result. Second, and relatedly, machine learning outputs are often  nonintuitive —that is, they operate according to rules that are  so complex, multi-faceted, and interrelated that they defy  practical inspection, do not comport with any practical human  belief about how the world works, or simply lie beyond  human-scale reasoning .8 Even if data scientists can spell  out the embedded rule, such rules may not tell a coherent  story about the world as humans understand it, defeating  conventional modes of explanation.9 Because machine learning can yield counter-intuitive results  with flaws that can be difficult to detect, observers may not  consider the results fully “accountable,” 10 even when they  have a detailed indication of how an algorithmic system  works.11 To be sure, some of these concerns may diminish  over time with continued advances in “explainable AI”—a  term that describes an emerging set of techniques that has  shown promise in rendering machine learning models more  interpretable by ranking, sorting, and scoring data features  according to their pivotalness in the model or by using  visualization techniques or textual justifications to lay bare  a model’s decision “pathway.”12 But technical challenges  remain, especially with more complex algorithmic models. For  the moment, surprisingly little is known, for example, about  how and why the most advanced neural networks work.13 Third, the new algorithmic governance tools differ from past  rounds of public sector innovation in the sense that they are  often more deeply embedded  in the work of government.  As Table 1 illustrates, more powerful analytic methods have  made possible the automation of a wider range of government  tasks than before.14 Importantly, the expanding menu of  applications, particularly those that perform enforcement  and adjudication tasks, is rapidly moving the new algorithmic  governance tools to the center of the coercive and (re-) distributive power of the state.15 In addition, the growing  sophistication and power of AI is nudging agencies toward fully automated decision-making, leaving progressively less  to human discretion and judgment.16 Government officials  who use those tools may, to borrow from the AI lexicon, be  increasingly left “out of the loop.” Finally, leaps in analytic  power mean more displacement of discretion at all levels of  bureaucracy. Growing sophistication may permit algorithmic  tools to continue “steadily climb[ing] up the bureaucratic  ladder,” shaping, and in some cases displacing, the decisions  of more senior agency decision-makers.17 At the same time,  the impact of AI systems on administrative government also  goes in the opposite direction: What could be called an “ITlevel bureaucracy” is in some cases increasingly displacing the  smaller-scale and more numerous decisions of the “streetlevel bureaucrats” that perform much of the visible, citizenfacing work of government.18 Goals Understanding these features of the new algorithmic  governance toolkit is critical. To aid that understanding, this  report has three principal goals. First, this report aims to inform the trajectory of AI use in  government by understanding whether, how, and why  agencies are beginning to use these tools. Agencies often  face daunting constraints. Innovation and continuous  improvement––including through the use of AI/ML––can  help agencies achieve their challenging missions with  integrity, efficiency, and fairness. A variety of risks and  opportunities exist in domains ranging from cybersecurity to  public engagement in the regulatory process. We can better  understand those risks and opportunities, as well as the  challenges agencies will face as they adapt to an increasingly  AI-driven world, if we know how agencies are experimenting  with these technologies. Over time, more specific metrics  of agency use of AI tools can help policymakers identify  opportunities for improvement and remedy deficiencies. Second, our report aims to spell out how these new tools  raise new and challenging questions in law and policy about  fairness, transparency and accountability, due process, and  capacity building. While the new algorithmic governance  tools hold the promise of more accurate and consistent  government decisions, their opacity also creates myriad legal  puzzles because of administrative law’s core commitment  to transparency and reason-giving when government takes  actions that affect rights. In the years ahead, judges, lawyers, 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 12agency administrators, and legislators will have to face these  legal quandaries. Not only does the law require an answer to  those questions, but the continuing development of AI/ML  systems can benefit from engagement with the various legal  and governance issues raised by the use of such technology in  administrative agencies. This report begins to map and assess  these issues. Third, our analysis sketches out promising directions for future  research. If that research is to inform a robust understanding  of how federal agencies can better achieve the many (often  contradictory) demands placed on them, it must engage  with agencies’ actual practices and legal responsibilities.  By canvassing agency practices and then offering more  detailed case studies at an important moment in the history  of government use of AI, we hope to catalyze further work in  this area and perhaps even parallel efforts on state and local  agencies as well as international entities. Scope AI technologies and the federal government are both vast.  To be clear about the scope of our work, it is worth defining  terms and delineating what this report covers and what it  does not. By “artificial intelligence,” we limit our scope to the most  recent forms of machine learning, which train models to learn  from data. These include a range of methods ( e.g., neural  networks, random forests) capable of recognizing patterns in  a range of types of data ( e.g., numbers, text, image)—feats of  recognition that, if undertaken by humans, would be generally  understood to require intelligence. The definition includes  both “supervised learning,” where “training data” is used to  develop a model with features to predict known “labels” or  outcomes, and “unsupervised learning,” where a model is  trained to identify patterns in data without labels of interest.  Conceptually, AI includes a range of analytical techniques,  such as rule-based or “expert” symbolic systems,19 but we  limit our focus to forms of machine learning. Our scope also  excludes conventional forms of statistical inference ( e.g.,  focused on causal, as opposed to predictive, inference) and  forms of process automation that do not involve machine  learning ( e.g., an online case management system).20 We often  use the shorthand “AI/ML” to describe the family of tools and  techniques falling within the above definition. By “federal agencies” we mean executive departments  and their sub-components as well as independent agencies. While the project aspired to the widest possible  scope in investigating the growing role of AI in the federal  administrative state, we limit the set of agencies investigated  in two ways. First, we do not examine military and intelligence  agencies ( e.g., the National Security Agency; the Department  of Defense; agencies working on cyber-defense) because it  is difficult to obtain reliable publicly available information  from such agencies. Second, to make our inquiry tractable  given a rapidly changing landscape, we limit ourselves to  the 142 largest and most prominent federal agencies, as set  forth below. By “use case,” we focus on the use of AI for core agency  functions. We do not examine agency use of traditional  regulatory methods to monitor or regulate industries and  other private sector actors who are themselves deploying AI  systems ( e.g., the SEC’s regulation of high-frequency trading  algorithms or NHTSA’s regulation of autonomous vehicles  using conventional rulemaking). That said, substantial  industry reliance on AI technology will serve as a useful flag or  marker in identifying actual and prospective agency use of AI  in administrative decision-making, so the report offers some  preliminary insights on the topic. Roadmap The rest of this report proceeds as follows.  Part I provides the results of a systematic survey of federal  agency use of AI. We examine a wide range of public  evidence—including agency websites, news articles, press  releases, congressional testimony, and mandated data  mining reports—to develop a portrait of AI adoption at  the largest 142 federal administrative agencies (measured  by full-time equivalent employees). We examine whether  there is evidence that the agency has experimented or  adopted AI/ML, the policy area and task to which such use  cases are devoted, how such use cases were developed  (e.g., in-house vs. contractor vs. competitions or other  non-commercial sources), underlying technology ( e.g.,  supervised vs. unsupervised machine learning models),  data source, and level of sophistication. We cannot claim  perfect comprehensiveness from this analysis, particularly  given our reliance on publicly available sources. Moreover,  the technology is rapidly changing, so much so that the  landscape has surely changed at numerous agencies since we  embarked on this study. However, in adhering to a common  protocol, our aim is to provide a rigorous portrait of AI use 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 13that can help policymakers, agency officials, academics, and  other interested persons to understand where the federal  administrative state is and where it might be heading. Part II offers a set of rich case studies of AI innovation at  specific federal agencies. One limitation of Part I’s survey is  that it is based on publicly available sources. Such sources  rarely provide sufficient technical detail on AI systems and  offer little insight on the process of generating such use cases.  Part II’s case studies overcome this limitation by relying on  extensive interviews with federal officials. The particular  case studies were chosen to illustrate the range of agencies,  use cases, and types of technology being deployed. In the  enforcement context, we study the tools developed by the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Customs and  Border Protection (CBP). With respect to agency adjudication,  we focus on the Social Security Administration (SSA) and  the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO). For regulatory  analysis, we examine a pair of pilots at the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA). For citizen engagement, we examine the  role of emerging tools for computationally assisted processing  of complaints and comments in rulemakings, exemplified in  the context of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)  and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). And to  assess the potential for improving citizen services, we examine  a pilot in automated mail delivery by the U.S. Postal Service  (USPS). Part III turns to implications and recommendations that  cut across particular tools and governance tasks. We cover  six major areas: (1) the challenges of building AI capacity  in the public sector, including data infrastructure, human  capital, and regulatory barriers; (2) the difficulties inherent in  promoting transparency and accountability; (3) the potential  for unwanted bias and disparate impact; (4) potential  risks to statutory hearing rights and due process; (5) risks  and responses associated with gaming and adversarial  learning, and (6) the use of contracting and procurement to  supplement agency technical expertise and capacity. Because so little is known about federal agency usage of  AI/ML, the case studies contained in this report are lengthy  and richly detailed and can each be read independently.  For readers interested in the highlights, we provide a short  summary of takeaways at the beginning of each case study.  Readers short on time are advised to read the canvass in Part  I, the case study highlights in Part II, and then Part III’s crosscutting implications.Acknowledgments We are grateful for the willingness of ACUS and its leadership  to support this project. Given ACUS’s mission of fostering  improvement in federal agencies’ procedures while   engaging lawyers, scholars, and government officials, we  consider this project to fit well with the agency’s broad,  nonpartisan mission. Many others contributed time and resources to this effort.   We appreciate generous support from Stanford Law School,  Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence,  NYU Law School, and the Stanford Institute for Economic  Policy Research.  We are likewise grateful to the many dedicated agency  officials and staff who shared their knowledge and views  with us, during countless meetings, site visits, phone calls,  and a roundtable meeting at NYU Law School in February  2019.  They are too many to name here, and some agencies  specifically requested that we not reference by name any  personnel.  We nonetheless wish to direct special thanks to  the following present and former public servants for their  time, advice, and help connecting us with resources at various  stages of the project:  Scott Bauguess, Jeff Butler, Kurt Glaze,  Lynne Parker, Gerald Ray, James Ridgway, Paul Verkuil, and  Matthew Wiener. We received valuable feedback from participants at the  American Bar Association’s Administrative Law Conference,  an ACUS Plenary Session, the Ethics, Policy and Governance  Conference by Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered  Artificial Intelligence, the Technology, Innovation, and  Regulation Conference at the C. Boyden Gray Center for the  Study of the Administrative State, a meeting of the Regulation,  Evaluation, and Governance Lab at Stanford, and the faculty  workshop at the School of Law at the University of Texas at  Austin. Numerous colleagues provided exceptionally helpful  comments, including Scott Hemphill, David Marcus, Lisa  Ouellette, Arti Rai, and Chris Walker. Particular thanks go to the remarkable students from  throughout Stanford University and NYU Law School who  enrolled in the policy practicum that catalyzed work on  this project in the winter of 2019.

We hope the pages to come— replete with rich information about what’s currently occurring  and what agencies will seek to do in the years to come—make  a lasting contribution on that score.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 15Part I. Taking Inventory:   A Survey of Federal Agency Use of AI Where, and for what purposes, are federal agencies developing and deploying algorithmic  governance tools? What are the principal types of AI techniques federal agencies are  developing and deploying? And what are the primary sources of AI-based governance  tools—in-house agency technologists, the procurement process, or some other channel? To answer these questions, our research team of lawyers, social scientists, and computer  scientists identified and characterized possible AI use cases at the 142 most significant  federal departments, agencies, and subagencies—collectively referred to hereafter as  “agencies.” This Part presents our empirical results and provides a broad overview of how  federal agencies are using AI-based tools to perform the work of governance. By situating  federal government use of AI in a wider context, we provide a first-of-its-kind snapshot of  the current state of federal government development and deployment of AI. Methodology To generate a rigorous portrait of government use of AI, we  began by identifying the most significant federal agencies.  We started with the ACUS Sourcebook of U.S. Executive  Agencies, which lists roughly 300 agencies, bureaus, and  offices, including independent agencies.1 To focus on the  most substantial agencies, we trimmed this list to agencies  with at least 400 employees, removing 125 agencies.2 We  also excluded 21 active military and intelligence-related  organizations ( e.g., the Defense Information Systems   Agency and the Missile Defense Agency), leaving us with   142 agencies overall. We then relied on a wide range of sources to search for  evidence that the agency had considered deploying an AI/ ML use case. We defined a use case as an instance in which  an agency had considered using  or had already deployed   AI/ML technology to carry out a core function. We did not  count instances where agencies demonstrated no intent to  operationalize a given tool—for example, a pure research  paper using AI/ML conducted by an economist at the Federal Reserve with little direct connection to the agency’s  regulatory or other duties. Sources included industry and  nonprofit reports, congressional testimony, press releases,  agency websites, mandated data mining reports, and  academic studies.3 After substantial piloting (including a survey sent to agency  officials via ACUS), the most reliable protocol for identifying  AI use cases was an agency-by-agency, web-based search  protocol, augmented by a range of third-party sources.4  We compiled these results with agency use cases as  distinct observations. We note at the outset that this methodology is limited in  several respects. First, our results reflect searches conducted  during January through August of 2019. The technology is  developing rapidly, so the aggregated results should only be  considered a snapshot-in-time. Second, it was not always easy  to determine the boundary between AI use cases to perform  core agency functions and pure research. Third, use cases are  defined by what information is publicly available. It is possible  that access to non-public, pan-government information 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 16would yield a different picture. A final challenge we faced  was determining what constituted a use case based on often  limited technical and operational documentation. Numerous  agencies touted their use of tools to “automate” functions or  their application of “predictive analytics,” but many of these  tools would not necessarily be considered a form of modern  machine learning and were excluded.5 We attempted to  resolve boundary issues as well as we could through multiple  rounds of quality control.6 Contrary to popular perceptions  presuming government agencies  uniformly rely on antiquated systems  and procedures, many agencies have in  fact experimented with AI/ML.  Results The results of this survey shed significant light on the state of  AI/ML in federal administrative agencies. First, contrary to popular perceptions presuming government  agencies uniformly rely on antiquated systems and  procedures, many agencies have in fact experimented with AI/ ML. Nearly half (64 agencies, or 45%) of canvassed agencies  have expressly manifested interest in AI/ML by planning,  piloting, or implementing such techniques. To offer a flavor,  the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is using  AI to refine high-impact weather tracking systems to improve  decision-making in real-time. The Transportation Security  Administration is exploring the use of image recognition to  screen passenger luggage for explosive devices. The Centers  for Medicare and Medicaid Services is developing AI-based  tools to predict health care fraud. And the Department of  Housing and Urban Development deployed a prototype  chatbot to enable citizens to acquire information about  rental assistance, agency programs, and civil rights  complaint procedures.Second, many agencies have pioneered multiple AI/ML use  cases. We documented 157 use cases across 64 agencies. AI  usage is heavily concentrated in a small number of agencies,  with about 7% of canvassed agencies responsible for 70% of  all identified use cases. Table 2 lists the number of use cases  at the top 10 adopters. A large number of use cases fell under  health- and law-enforcement-focused subagencies such  as the Food and Drug Administration, the Office of Justice  Programs, and the Transportation Safety Administration and  Customs and Border Protection. As a result, the Department  of Health and Human Services, the Department of Justice,  and the Department of Homeland Security account for a  collective 51 use cases. Perhaps unsurprisingly, NASA has also  rapidly adopted AI. For instance, NASA developed a prototype  cockpit advisor system based on IBM’s Watson, which would  enable pilots to query a knowledge base for situationally  relevant information. TABLE 2.

For example, the Department of Health and Human  Services (19 use cases), the Department of Justice (16 use cases),  and the Department of Homeland Security (16 use cases) have  been refactored into respective sub-agencies (e.g., the Food and  Drug Administration, the Office of Justice Programs, and Customs  and Border Protection).  In addition, note that three other agencies  or subagencies other than CBP have four use cases: the Board of  Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Oceanic and  Atmospheric Administration, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 17Third, agency AI/ML use is spread across a wide range of  policy areas. As reflected in Figure 1, the top three policy areas  were in law enforcement,7 health, and financial regulation.  But Figure 1 also shows that use cases span virtually all other  substantive policy areas, such as environment, energy, social  welfare, and communications. This highlights the breadth of  AI use and impact.Fourth, agency AI/ML use serves diverse regulatory functions.  As shown in Figure 2, agencies use AI to prioritize enforcement  (e.g., prediction of potential violators of the federal securities  laws at the SEC), engage with the public ( e.g., a United  States Citizenship and Immigration Services chatbot to  provide assistance answering immigration questions),  conduct regulatory research, analysis, and monitoring ( e.g.,  Department of Health and Human Services tools to predict  adverse drug events and unplanned hospital admissions),  and adjudicate rights and benefits ( e.g., United States Patent  and Trademark Office tools to support patent and trademark  determinations).8FIGURE 1.

For simplicity, each agency was coded as falling  into one primary policy area. Science and Energy were combined  into one category. Some agencies that were coded as occupying  two primary fields were collapsed ( e.g., EPA was classified as  ‘Environment’; the National Institute of Food and Agriculture as  ‘Agriculture’; the International Trade Commission as ‘Commerce’;  the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as ‘Financial Regulation’;  and the Railroad Retirement Board as ‘Social Welfare’).FIGURE 2.

The ‘Regulatory research, analysis, and monitoring’  category includes tools (or research) that involve collecting  and analyzing information to inform agency policymaking. The  ‘Enforcement’ category includes use cases that support or lead  to enforcement actions, including monitoring tasks for finding  and tracking violations. The ‘Public services and engagement’  category includes tools that facilitate the provision of services to or  communication with the public for regulatory or other purposes.  The ‘Internal management’ category includes tools to support all  other internal agency management functions, including employee  management and procurement. The ‘Adjudication’ category  includes tools that aid in formal or informal adjudication of benefits  or rights. Coding was keyed to the primary purpose of each use  case. Twenty-four use cases received multiple codings ( e.g., both  ‘Regulatory research, analysis, and monitoring’ and ‘Public services  and engagement’ for a tool that analyzes consumer complaints). Agency AI/ML use is spread across a wide  range of policy areas and serves diverse  regulatory functions.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 18Fifth, agency AI/ML uses vary in their stage of development.  Figure 3 allocates use cases to three implementation stages— planning, piloting/partially deployed, and fully deployed. On  the one hand, only one-third (53 use cases, or 33%) of the  applications are fully deployed. On the other hand, the sheer  amount of planning and piloting is a testament to how much  attention is currently being devoted to scoping out usage  of AI/ML.Sixth, agency AI/ML use cases vary in their development  source. Figure 4 presents the primary developer of the  application. We denote whether the use case was built inhouse by agency staff, by third-party (commercial) contractors,  by non-commercial collaboration ( e.g., collaboration  with an academic lab, public-facing competitions), or a  mix. Contrary to much of the literature’s fixation on the  procurement of algorithms through private contracting,  over half of applications (84 use cases, or 53%) were built  in-house, suggesting there is substantial creative appetite  within agencies.FIGURE 3.

Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 19Seventh, administrative agencies are experimenting with  a range of AI/ML methods. To understand the distribution  of methods, we classified each use case as (a) supervised  versus unsupervised learning (or other), (b) type of supervised  learning (regression for continuous outcomes, classification  for categorical labels, structured prediction ( e.g., chatbots)),  and (c) type of unsupervised learning (clustering or  dimensionality reduction). Figure 5 displays the breakdown  of methods. The dominant method by far is supervised  learning (red), comprising nearly 71% of all agency use cases.9  Unsupervised learning and robotics are much less prevalent in  the administrative state, at least for the time being. Eighth, agency AI/ML use leverages a range of data. Figure 6  provides a breakdown of the types of datasets being used. The  vast majority (78%) of applications rely on structured or text  data. Despite rapid advances in computer vision, for instance,  fewer agencies have begun to rely on image, sound, or other  forms of unstructured data.Last, our team of computer scientists assessed the technical  sophistication of each use case. To illustrate the scale used,  we considered: (a) logistic regression using structured data to  be of lower sophistication; (b) a random forest with attention  to hyperparameter tuning to be of medium sophistication;  and (c) use of deep learning to develop “concept  questioning” of the patent examination manual to be of  higher sophistication. Here lies the most sobering finding:  For most government applications (61%), there is insufficient  publicly available technical documentation to determine with  precision what methods are deployed. In some cases, the  agency’s description appears more like marketing language  or concerns a tool still under development. In other cases,  agencies describe use of neural networks, natural language  processing, or facial recognition technologies but do not  provide enough technical details to discern whether a use  case is a simpler or more sophisticated version thereof. We  did not make judgments solely based on task or incantation FIGURE 5.

In those instances, we counted each  application-data type.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 20of method. The result, as presented in Figure 7, is that only a  minority of agency use cases (12%) could clearly be rated as higher in sophistication by our team of computer scientists. Even among the sample of use cases for which sophistication could be discerned, only 31% would rate as ‘Higher’ in sophistication. While the deep learning revolution has rapidly transformed the private sector, it appears to have only scratched the surface in public sector application. While the deep learning revolution  has rapidly transformed  the  private sector, it appears to have  only scratched the surface in public  sector application. These results on sophistication should be taken with  a grain of salt. Reasonable people can disagree about comparative assessments of sophistication, particularly given different domains and availability of documentation. Moreover, available documentation likely skews toward older technology. Finally, as just noted, in the most common case it was difficult to discern the level of sophistication (“insufficient detail”). There may be additional highly sophisticated use cases that our team of computer scientists could not clearly categorize as such, though these are likely relatively few in number. Overall, the results suggest there is considerable room for improvement and development.To sum up, this survey provides much needed grounding of the landscape of federal government use of AI. To that end, we provide summary information about all use cases in the online Appendix* to this report. However, while these descriptive statistics paint a rich portrait of government innovation, they do not fully capture the process, technical detail, and institutional setting of AI in government. For that, we turn to in-depth case studies. *The Appendix is available at www.law.stanford.edu/ACUS-AI-ReportFIGURE 7.

Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 21Part II. Case Studies of Federal Agency   Deployment of AI This Part performs a deeper dive into the algorithmic governance tools deployed or under  development at federal agencies. We aim to describe in detail a handful of especially  impactful or promising use cases without losing generality and without discounting the  rich diversity of applications across agencies, governance tasks, and policy areas. To  that end, we showcase seven algorithmic governance tools spanning seven governance  tasks: civil enforcement, hybrid civil / criminal enforcement, formal adjudication, informal  adjudication, regulatory analysis, public engagement, and public service provision. This  approach, administrative lawyers will recognize, partially tracks categories of agency  action within contemporary American administrative law.1 Further, each chapter hews to a  common format, first spotlighting one or more use cases at a single agency and thoroughly  exploring their technical and operational details and their future trajectory. Each chapter  then closes by framing the agency-specific implications of the tool and the wider family of  applications in use at other agencies. We reserve discussion of legal and policy issues that  cut across use cases and governance tasks for Part III.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 22KEY TAKEAWAYS  The Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) is using a suite  of algorithmic tools to identify  violators of the securities laws.  A challenge is training data that  accurately reflects ground truth,  avoids narrow feedback loops based  on prior decisions, and accounts for  dynamic changes in wrongdoing.  Accountability of AI-based  enforcement runs into a tradition  of enforcement discretion  protected under law and the risk of  gaming by regulatory targets.  Agency investigators demand  explainable AI-based tools, not  just risk predictions, facilitating  “internal” due process.Regulatory Enforcement at the Securities and  Exchange Commission As Part I’s inventory revealed, AI has made some of its most substantial inroads in the  context of agency enforcement activities. These efforts are especially important, for  enforcement is the tip of the spear of the modern regulatory state. It is the primary way  government gives real-world effect to legal mandates, thus converting “law on the books”  into “law in action.”2 It is also one of the main ways government delivers to the polity a wide  range of policy benefits, from clean air and water and safe food, drugs, and workplaces  to capital and labor markets that are efficient and fair. And it is the principal means by  which the government protects its own interests against those who would abuse it by  underpaying taxes or defrauding the government when it buys needed goods or services  from the private sector. Not only is enforcement central to governance, it also embodies one of the  core dilemmas of modern administration: the trade-off between discretion and  accountability. On the one hand, agencies vested with enforcement authority  need discretion because agency resources are finite, and the costs agencies would  incur in identifying all violators of a law and pursuing them to a conclusion are  virtually infinite.3 Moreover, the cost of prosecuting an enforcement action may  exceed its social benefit by stifling socially productive activity, or it may simply  not be a sound use of scarce agency resources given other policy priorities and  imperatives.4 On the other hand, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion—and  an agency’s decision not to wield the state’s coercive power at all—brings risks.  Agency forbearance can yield arbitrary selection of regulatory targets that  undermines the legitimacy of the regulatory state by treating similarly situated  violators differently. In addition, an agency’s decision to forego an enforcement  action may mask infidelity to Congress’s command or, worse, patterns of political  influence and agency “capture” that threaten rule of law.5 In short, prosecutorial  discretion is both a necessary component of good regulatory governance and an  ever-present threat to the regulatory state’s legitimacy. In what follows, we focus much of our attention on a suite of enforcement tools  in use at the Securities and Exchange Commission that navigate these pressures  by helping agency staff “shrink the haystack” of potential violators and better  allocate scarce agency resources. While we focus on the SEC, a number of other  federal agencies with significant enforcement mandates, among them the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS), the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), and  the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), are also developing or deploying  similar tools.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 23I. THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION The mission of the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) is to “protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and  efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation.”6 To  achieve these regulatory objectives, the SEC issues rules  governing securities exchanges, securities brokers and  dealers, investment advisors, and mutual funds.7 The SEC  not only has the authority to issue rules under various of the  federal securities laws but can also bring enforcement actions  against those who violate them. The SEC brings hundreds  such enforcement actions each year. The SEC’s wide-ranging  regulatory and enforcement duties are reflected in its  structure and organization. The Commission is headed by five  Presidentially-appointed Commissioners, one of whom serves  as chairperson.8 The Commission is further organized into five  divisions9 and several standalone offices.10 II. AI USE CASES The SEC is currently developing or deploying multiple  algorithmic enforcement tools across all five of its divisions  and several of its standalone offices. We here profile four such  tools. One targets fraud in accounting and financial reporting,  two target trading-based market misconduct, particularly  insider trading, and a fourth targets unlawful investment  advisors and asset managers. A. Accounting and Financial Reporting Fraud: CIRA To detect fraud in accounting and financial reporting, the SEC  has developed the Corporate Issuer Risk Assessment (CIRA).  CIRA is a dashboard of some 200 metrics that are used to  detect anomalous patterns in financial reporting of corporate  issuers of securities.11 Today, there are over 7,000 corporate  issuers who must submit financial statements, such as annual  10-K and quarterly 10-Q forms, to the SEC for oversight.12  These reports can be hundreds of pages long, containing  general business information, risk factors, financial data, and  so-called MD&As (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of  Financial Condition and Results of Operations). Analyzing this immense body of reports is a resource-intensive  process, and, as with any agency, the SEC has limited  resources with which to do it. CIRA’s goal is to help the agency  more efficiently utilize its finite resources by identifying  corporate filers that warrant further investigation. One way  SEC staff have sought to manage large data flows is through  use of a machine learning tool that helps identify which filers  might be engaged in suspect earnings management.13 The  tool is trained on a historical dataset of past issuer filings and  uses a random forest model to predict possible misconduct using indicators such as earnings restatements and past  enforcement actions.14 Enforcement staff scrutinize the results,  thus maintaining a human eye, and consider them alongside a  range of other metrics and materials.15 Though the algorithmic  outputs are only part of a broader analysis, SEC staff report  that CIRA’s algorithmic component improves the allocation of  scarce enforcement resources.16 B. Trading-Based Market Misconduct:   ARTEMIS and ATLAS A further pair of tools target trading-based market  misconduct: the Advanced Relational Trading Enforcement  Metrics Investigation System (ARTEMIS) and the Abnormal  Trading and Link Analysis System (ATLAS).17 ARTEMIS identifies and assesses suspicious trading by  “analyz[ing] patterns and relationships among multiple  traders using the Division’s electronic database of over six  billion electronic equities and options trading records.”18 The  tool aims to catch all instances of insider trading in the market  and enhances the SEC’s monitoring and surveillance powers.  ARTEMIS’s focus is serial cheaters. This is said to be an easier  demographic of offenders to identify compared to first-time  insider traders, the target of the ATLAS tool. The ARTEMIS process is not automated. It first requires the  agency to identify a suspected offender before targeted  data collection and a full-fledged investigation can proceed.  The first step is a preliminary analysis of publicly available  information and corporate filings. Companies often announce  important events in scheduled 10-K and 10-R filings, but  for material events that fall outside these scheduled filings,  companies are required to make an announcement using  an 8-K form, which is submitted to the SEC’s Electronic Data  Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) system, a public  database of corporate filings and voluntary shareholder  reports. SEC staff have developed in-house natural language  processing (NLP) tools to analyze submitted 8-K forms.19  A standard NLP process is used to process these forms,  stemming the words and then applying a “bag of words”  model20 to classify documents according to the significance  of an event, language changes in the disclosures, scheduled  and unscheduled earnings announcements, and events not  necessarily related to earnings, such as CEO terminations, FDA  (dis)approval announcements, court judgments, and clinical  trials, among others. The labeled data is then pushed through  a supervised learning algorithm to identify trigger events and  market changes that may warrant investigation. Once the  data has been sifted and analyzed, a human examiner reviews 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 24the results. This is a disciplined process to ensure that the  agency is not overburdening brokerage companies or others  within the broker/dealer community without a firm basis for  doing so.21 Once an SEC examiner hypothesizes that there was insider  trading on a stock, agency staff prepare a “bluesheet”  request to the relevant parts of the broker/dealer community  to obtain a comprehensive trading record for the stock or  related options within a set time period.22 Staff decide which  securities merit review and the time period for which to obtain  trading data.23 Staff must also identify which broker/dealers  traded the security at issue by obtaining the clearing reports  submitted to FINRA.24 To ensure that the data in bluesheets  is high-quality, the SEC and FINRA bring charges against  brokerage firms for inaccurate or incomplete submissions.25 Data obtained via bluesheet requests are sorted and  categorized according to the event that triggered elevated  review.26 Next, the SEC uses bluesheet data alongside a  database of every previously requested bluesheet to judge  whether the trading behavior is anomalous in the context  of the trader’s identity and historical behavior.27 ARTEMIS  currently uses an unsupervised learning model for anomaly  detection. The working assumption is that suspicious activity  is an outlier and will not match the patterns of most other  data. Because of the difficulty of getting labeled data for this  task—it is hard to identify all true positives in past data and  impossible to identify the false negatives— the SEC uses an  unsupervised learning approach. While accurate ground  truth28 data is difficult to obtain, the models make predictive  inferences about fraud by viewing data points in relation to  one another.29 ATLAS complements the ARTEMIS tool by focusing on  first-time, rather than serial, insider trading. It is the newest  of the SEC’s algorithmic enforcement tools, and there is  much less publicly available information about its technical  and operational details. Like ARTEMIS, the ATLAS tool uses  bluesheet data, from which a half dozen hand-crafted data  features are extracted. Such features were defined using  domain knowledge about insider training and are described  as having an “intuitive explanation.”30 These data features  are then fed into a supervised machined learning model (a  one-class support vector machine or SVM) to determine if the  trade is suspicious.31 The potential regulatory targets fed into  the model are then split into two categories: those who lost  money on a trade, and those who made money. The SVM is  trained on the former, then fit to the latter. The assumption is that the behavior of those who made money should not differ  significantly from those who lost money over time. Outliers  are treated as suspicious. It is important to note that ARTEMIS and ATLAS are only two of  many tools and systems SEC staff use to build insider trading  cases. As SEC staff emphasized, the process of identifying  and investigating insider trading is an iterative process that  requires sifting through many sources of data, knowing the  context of the situation, and synthesizing evidence and  concepts into higher-order judgments. C. “Registrant” Misconduct: The Form ADV   Fraud Predictor A fourth and final tool, the Form ADV Fraud Predictor, helps  SEC staff predict which financial services professionals may  be violating federal securities laws.32 The tool parses socalled Form ADVs—also known as the Uniform Application  for Investment Adviser Registration and Report by Exempt  Reporting Adviser—a filing that investment advisors who  manage more than $25 million in assets must submit to the  SEC annually. Form ADVs contain two parts. The first part  requires disclosure of the investment advisor’s “business,  ownership, clients, employees, business practices, affiliations,  and any disciplinary events of the adviser or its employees.”33  The second elicits information regarding services offered,  fee schedule, as well as an array of information relating  to disciplinary information, conflicts of interest, and the  educational and business background of the advisor and key  supporting management and staff.34 Because Form ADVs are composed of free text, NLP algorithms  are used to normalize the inputs in order to detect instances  of fraud. Because it is difficult to observe fraud directly,35  the SEC has developed a multi-step process to automate  the fraud detection pipeline. After a pre-processing step  that algorithmically converts PDF forms into useable blocks  of text,36 an unsupervised NLP technique (Latent Dirichlet  allocation or LDA37) generates topics that best describe the  words in each document.38 This approach identifies topics  in the documents without prior knowledge about what the  topics will be. The final step deploys a supervised learning algorithm to flag  current registrants as “high,” “medium,” and “low” priority for  further investigation by SEC staff.39 The algorithm is trained on  a dataset of past registrants that were referred to the agency’s  enforcement arm. Data features include the topics in the Form  ADVs as well as information collected by SEC staff during 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 25interviews and site visits, among other sources. This step relies  upon a random forest model to predict document priority,  with “high” priority documents referred to relevant SEC staff.  This recommendation is accompanied by an explanation  of the document’s flag, including a rough measure of  feature importance.40 III. FUTURE TRAJECTORY OF AI AT SEC The SEC’s suite of algorithmic tools provides a glimpse of  a potential revolution in regulatory enforcement. Here we  highlight some technical challenges and opportunities that  are likely to shape the trajectory of algorithmic enforcement  tools at the SEC in the near- to mid-term. Among these are  input challenges , including the need for data that accurately  reflects ground truth and takes account of the dynamic nature  of wrongdoing, and analytic challenges , which largely relate  to the need for technical capacity to develop, deploy, and  maintain useable tools and exploit continued advances in  machine learning. Together, these challenges reveal both  the limits of the new algorithmic enforcement and the rich  possibilities going forward. A. Input Challenges: Data, Ground Truth, and the  Dynamic Nature of Wrongdoing Enforcement tools can only be as good as their data inputs.  Unlocking the full potential of machine learning in any  regulatory context, but especially in the enforcement context,  requires abundant, well-labeled data that accurately reflect  “ground truth” about misconduct. Data quantity and quality  are thus a key determinant of, and a significant limit on, the  potential of the SEC’s new algorithmic governance toolkit. Some of the SEC’s data challenges afflict any agency  developing algorithmic governance tools. Many of the  documents the SEC uses to power its algorithmic tools are  not in machine readable formats and thus require substantial  pre-processing. For this reason, there has been an internal  push at the SEC to require filings in both human and machine  readable formats.41 The SEC must also navigate a welter of  data laws limiting collection, storage, and use of data. We  discuss the effect of data laws on the future of algorithmic  governance in Part III’s discussion of internal capacity building. Beyond these more generic hurdles, data challenges in  the enforcement context tend to take one of two forms,  reflecting either a lack of randomization or the difficulty of  finding accurate ground truth in training data. The first of  these is exemplified by the bluesheet process that feeds  the SEC’s ARTEMIS and ATLAS tools. That process, as noted previously, is neither comprehensive nor random. Instead, it  is hypothesis-driven and reflects SEC staff judgments about  the likelihood of market misconduct in each case. As a result,  the types of misconduct and entities targeted will reflect the  assumptions, heuristics, and biases of enforcement staff.  Furthermore, the ARTEMIS and ATLAS tools are trained on a  pool of trading data that includes only past bluesheet requests  and thus captures only a small fraction of total trading activity.  When either of the SEC’s tools looks for patterns suggestive  of insider trading, the system compares previously flagged  trading behavior to other flagged traders, not traders in the  market as a whole, potentially reducing the tool’s accuracy. The second type of input challenge is finding accurate ground  truth for training data. This concern pervades algorithmic  enforcement tools because it is difficult to identify all  true positives in past data, and one can never “know,” or  comprehensively identify, false negatives. A related challenge  comes at the intersection of automation and human-level  discretion. When a line-level investigator retains the ultimate  authority to initiate an enforcement action, uncritical reliance  on automation may displace investigatorial attention away  from false negatives and/or crowd out the application of  discretion to false positives. If prior enforcement actions  are used as training data, the system may unduly confine  enforcement actions to a distinct subset of all violations. This  phenomenon has been well-documented in the predictive  policing context: When a predictive model is used to deploy  police, and the resulting arrest data is employed to re-train  the model, a “runaway feedback loop” occurs.42 Police may  be sent to the same neighborhoods over and over again  regardless of the underlying crime rate. In short, algorithmic  detection may be dominated by superficial features from prior  enforcement decision-making, replicating the idiosyncrasies  of line-level enforcers rather than building richer and more  precise models of noncompliance. A final and fundamental challenge arises from the dynamic  nature of wrongdoing. As already noted, effective algorithmic  enforcement tools require training data that accurately  reflect ground truth about misconduct. But the regulatory  landscape, and the ground under it, can shift over time. For  many agencies, enforcement is akin to a game of “whack-amole” in which regulatory subjects seek to evade regulation  by developing new artifices designed to evade, or narrowly  navigate between, announced rules. Tax shelters, to cite a  concrete example, follow this script. As a result, algorithmic  enforcement tools are rarely turnkey systems, and agencies  must continually and iteratively update them to capture new 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 26modes of wrongdoing.43 Returning to tax, an algorithmic tool  might be able to flag the complicated and choreographed set  of transactions needed to implement an illegal tax shelter.  But once enforcement has begun, taxpayers and the tax  compliance industry shift away and develop new artifices that  are identifiable to algorithmic enforcement tools only if they  are sufficiently similar to the prior ones.44 For agencies using  algorithmic enforcement tools, the challenge is designing  systematic methods of model optimization and updating built  upon randomized case samples ( i.e., a sample that includes  both cases identified as problematic and unproblematic), as  well as careful procedures for incorporating newly discovered  types of wrongdoing.45 If data rooted in historical enforcement  patterns are unreflectively used to train models and efforts  to update those models are ad hoc, enforcement efforts risk  focusing on an arbitrary subset of violations or fighting the last  war instead of addressing new forms of misconduct. The SEC is cognizant of these challenges and is attempting  to mitigate them. Improved data systems may overcome  the shortcomings of the bluesheet process. In 2016, the  SEC approved a joint plan with FINRA and SROs to develop  a consolidated audit trail (“CAT”).46 Adopted under SEC  rules, CAT requires SROs and broker-dealers to significantly  enhance their information technology capacities to maintain  a comprehensive database of granular trading activity  in the U.S. equity and options markets, thus broadening  reporting to every trade quote and order, origination,  modification, execution, routing, and cancellation. 47 Once  fully implemented, CAT will generate an estimated 58 billion  trading records each day.48 Granting the ARTEMIS and ATLAS  systems access to this data stands to substantially improve  accuracy and reliability. In addition, the SEC has begun to pilot a range of evaluation  and validation efforts. While ground truth challenges are  endemic and make objective performance metrics hard to  create, back-testing of the ATLAS tool revealed that its models  could predict all or nearly all proven instances of past insider  trading.49 Similarly, agency technologists systematically  worked with enforcement staff in one of the Commission‘s  regional enforcement offices to test the frequency with  which the Form ADV tool surfaced a problem that was then  corroborated upon examination.50 Neither of these efforts,  however, rose to the level of a rigorous “benchmarking,” in  which agency administrators would set aside a random test  sample of enforcement targets and then work up the cases  in the old school, analog fashion, comparing the results to those achieved via algorithmic methods.51 We discuss  such an approach in Part III’s discussion of transparency  and accountability. If data rooted in historical enforcement  patterns are unreflectively used to  train models and efforts to update  those models are ad hoc, enforcement  efforts risk focusing on an arbitrary  subset of violations or fighting the last  war instead of addressing new forms  of misconduct. B. Analytic Challenges: Technical Demands   and Capacity Building A second type of challenge centers on the substantial  technical demands of the new algorithmic enforcement  tools. As described throughout this report, developing and  maintaining effective algorithmic tools across the full range of  governance tasks will require significant computing and data  infrastructure as well as technical expertise. Technical capacity  will likely grow in importance as algorithmic governance tools  become more sophisticated. The need for technical capacity may be especially strong  in the enforcement context. Many of the new algorithmic  enforcement tools will, as with the SEC’s Form ADV Predictor  Tool, rely on NLP techniques to derive semantic meaning  from unstructured texts. Enormous strides have been made  in NLP in recent years due to advances in deep learning and  computing power. But NLP advances have tended to focus on  areas with commonly-accepted benchmark tasks ( e.g., GLUE,  IMDb movie review datasets).52 Advances have come more  slowly in niche contexts involving more specialized, technical,  and jargon-filled text with no large gold standard, labelled  datasets. As a result, developing workable algorithmic  governance tools may require more than off-the-shelf and  third-party implementations or open-source libraries. Words  used in the finance context may have different meanings than  in standard parlance, requiring finance-specific corpora in  order to maximize the tool’s utility.53 If a financial regulator like  the SEC were to use standard datasets rather than finance-
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 27specific ones, or if existing algorithms are not retrofitted to  promote transfer between domains, the resulting system  could be less effective. Another key issue is whether agencies will meet heightened  technical demands by developing internal capacity, thus  choosing to “make” their own algorithmic tools, or instead  “buy” needed technical capacity by acquiring new tools via  the procurement process.54 This make-or-buy choice, which  we discuss in more detail in Part III, may be particularly  salient in the enforcement context. The dynamic nature  of wrongdoing and the subtlety and complexity of many  enforcement tasks mean that the design, deployment,  and maintenance of algorithmic enforcement tools may  be best achieved with substantial embedded agency  expertise—that is, technologists sited within the agency who  understand subtle and complex governance tasks—rather  than contractors working at a remove.55 Finally, the makeor-buy choice presents an especially acute challenge in the  enforcement context because of the threat of gaming and  adversarial learning by regulated parties, an issue we also take  up in more detail in Part III. C. New Technical Vistas No matter how the SEC goes about improving data inputs and  acquiring needed technical capacity, doing so will allow it to  pursue a number of new and promising technical vistas. First, it is plausible—and perhaps even likely—that continued,  non-trivial technical advances in the coming years will  move algorithmic enforcement tools steadily closer to fully  automated decision-making. This does not describe the  SEC’s current menu of algorithmic enforcement tools. Most  of these tools use a classifier, the results of which are handed  off to line-level enforcement staff who continue to work up  cases themselves. Discretion to initiate enforcement action  remains in human hands.56 But this may change. Continued  technological advances may eventually cause much of  enforcement decision-making, from monitoring to initiation of  enforcement actions to agency adjudication, to be an entirely  machine-driven process. As we explain in more detail in Part  III, full automation of consequential governance decisions  will raise significant legal issues that courts reviewing agency  action will have to resolve. A second clear vista is agency development of ever more  sophisticated analytic techniques. One likely growth area is  computer vision, the branch of AI that trains computers to  understand the visual world. Already, academic researchers have developed machine learning tools that analyze satellite  imagery to predict which facilities are concentrated animal  feeding operations and thus at greater risk of violating the  Clean Water Act or other environmental laws.57 Another clear  technical frontier is use of unsupervised learning techniques  to improve compliance monitoring and enforcement  capabilities in the absence of data with high-quality labels.58 A final vista is the use of machine learning techniques that do  not enhance an agency’s own technical capacity, but rather  allow it to harness outside talents and enterprise. Algorithms  might be developed, for instance, to generate synthetic  datasets that preserve the higher-order dimensions of real  data without disclosing personally identifiable information or  other sensitive information.59 This data generation would be  an improvement from the public use files that are currently  available. By publicly releasing data of this sort and inviting  collaboration, enforcement agencies like the SEC could  harness private expertise and enterprise and thus obtain  analytical support that they cannot currently access—a  potentially happy story of technical innovation begetting  technical innovation. IV. IMPLICATIONS: THE FUTURE OF ALGORITHMIC  ENFORCEMENT The SEC is hardly alone in leveraging AI to perform  enforcement-related tasks. The Internal Revenue Service  (IRS) and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  (CMS) have deployed algorithmic tools designed to predict  illegal conduct and more precisely allocate scarce agency  resources toward audit or investigation. The IRS, for instance,  has responded to budget and workforce cuts by investing  over $400 million to develop and operate a fraud detection  algorithm, the Return Review Program (RRP), that generates  fraud risk scores for all national individual tax returns claiming  a refund.60 For its part, CMS has engaged contractors to  help build and implement a machine-learning-based risk  assessment tool that analyzes historical and incoming  claims to furnish provider-level leads to the agency’s fraud  investigators. And a wide range of other agencies, from  the Environmental Protection Agency and Department of  Labor to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, are  developing or deploying tools that predict non-compliance  with rules regarding the environment, workplace safety,  banking, consumer product safety, food processing, disability  insurance, and workers’ compensation, among others.  This steadily growing catalog of algorithmic enforcement  tools holds significant implications for the future of  regulatory governance.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 28A. Enforcement and Algorithmic Accountability The proliferation of algorithmic enforcement tools at the  SEC and beyond highlights especially difficult trade-offs  between the efficacy of the new tools and the accountability  concerns that animate administrative law. As Part III describes  in more detail, algorithmic governance tools trigger a  profound collision between administrative law’s requirement  of transparency and reason-giving and the fact that many  algorithmic decision tools are not, by their structure,  fully explainable. An important debate asks how much  transparency, from thin system-level explanations of a tool to  full disclosure of a tool’s source code and data, is necessary  to gauge a tool’s fidelity to governing law. Some advocate  deliberate impairment of an AI tool’s predictive accuracy to  achieve explainability. Algorithmic governance tools  trigger a profound collision between  administrative law’s requirement  of transparency and reason-giving  and the fact that many algorithmic  decision tools are not, by their structure,  fully explainable. A critical question is whether continued uptake of  algorithmic tools by enforcement agencies will, on net,  render enforcement decisions more or less accountable.  On the one hand, the black box nature of machine learning  tools may exacerbate accountability concerns. On the other  hand, algorithmic enforcement tools can, by formalizing  and making explicit agency priorities, render an agency’s  enforcement decision-making more tractable compared  to the dispersed human judgments of agency enforcement  staff. Algorithmic enforcement tools might thus provide a  “focal point” for judicial review, undermining the normative  foundation of longstanding legal doctrines, embodied by  the Supreme Court’s Heckler v. Chaney  decision, hiving off  agency enforcement decision-making from judicial review.61  Algorithmic enforcement tools, by encoding legal principles  and agency policies and priorities, might also qualify as  “legislative rules” under the Administrative Procedure Act  and thus require full ventilation via notice and comment. The result, though it runs contrary to much contemporary  commentary, is that displacement of agency enforcement  discretion by algorithmic tools may, on net, produce an  enforcement apparatus that is more  transparent, whether to  reviewing courts or to the agency officials who must supervise  enforcement staff. But legal demands of transparency also produce further  trade-offs in the enforcement context because of the risk  that public disclosure of a tool’s details will expose it to  gaming and “adversarial learning” by regulated parties.62 As  discussed in more detail in Part III, an SEC registrant with  knowledge of the workings of the SEC’s Form ADV Fraud  Predictor could adversarially craft its disclosures, including or  omitting key language in order to foil the system’s classifier.  A key line of inquiry in the enforcement area will be what  degree of transparency, and what set of oversight and  regulatory mechanisms, can reach a sensible accommodation  of interlocking concerns about efficacy, accountability,  and gaming. B. Algorithmic Enforcement and the Structure and  Legitimacy of the Regulatory State Algorithmic enforcement tools may also, in time, work a  fundamental change in the structure and legitimacy of  the administrative state. Algorithmic enforcement tools  are force-multipliers that allow an agency to do more with  less by permitting agencies to identify regulatory targets  more efficiently. In this sense, the advent of algorithmic  enforcement tools could halt or even reverse the decadeslong shift away from public enforcement and toward private  litigation as a regulatory mode.63 The advent of algorithmic enforcement may also supplant  expertise within the federal bureaucracy, exacerbating a  perceived trend toward politicized federal administration  and the hollowing out of the administrative state.64 This  is especially worrying because, at least for the moment,  line-level enforcers appear to play a key role in bolstering  the accountability of new algorithmic tools. Because SEC  enforcement staff can choose whether to use algorithmic  enforcement tools, agency technologists must sell skeptical  line-level staff on their value. SEC technologists report that  line-level enforcement staff are often unmoved by a model’s  sparse classification of an investment advisor, based on  dozens of pages of disclosures, as “high risk.” They want to  know which part of the disclosures triggered the classification  and why. This is pressing agency technologists to focus on  explainability in building their models by taking account of 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 29frontier research on how to isolate which data features in an AI  system may be driving an algorithmic output. Staff skepticism  and demand for explainable outputs raise the possibility that  governance of public sector algorithmic tools will at times  come from “internal” due process, not the judge-enforced,  external variety.65 Finally, as algorithmic tools move closer to the core of the  state’s coercive power, they may systematically shift patterns  of state action in ways that raise distributive and, ultimately,  political anxieties about a newly digitized public sector. As  already noted, gaming reduces the efficacy of algorithmic  systems and risks rendering their outputs fully arbitrary. But  gaming is also likely to have a distributive cast, particularly  in the enforcement context.66 The predictions of the SEC’s  Form ADV Fraud Predictor as to which investment brokers  are likely to be the bad apples may fall more heavily on  smaller investment firms that, unlike Goldman Sachs, lack a  stable of computer scientists who can reverse-engineer the  SEC’s system and work to keep their personnel out of the  agency’s cross-hairs.67 As we explore in more detail in Part III,  a narrow focus on technical and capacity-building challenges  misses the profound political implications of the current  algorithmic moment. * * * * As the SEC’s experience illustrates, AI/ML tools have the  potential to help enforcement agencies flag potential  violations of the law and focus agency attention in a world  of scarce resources. This improved accuracy and efficiency  may come at a cost, however. As AI/ML tools get ever more  sophisticated, they also pose real threats to the transparency  and democratic accountability of enforcement agencies and  of the regulatory state as we know it. 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 30Law Enforcement at Customs and Border Protection While civil enforcement agencies like the SEC, IRS, and EPA have begun to experiment with  machine learning, pure law enforcement agencies have been quicker to adopt such tools.  Nearly 100 state and local jurisdictions have replaced traditional surveillance cameras with  more sophisticated AI-powered gunshot detection technology.1 Others have employed  AI-driven automatic license plate readers.2 Police departments in Los Angeles,3 Chicago,4  New Orleans,5 and Missouri6 have deployed AI-powered predictive policing strategies  to identify gang-related crimes. Federal law enforcement agencies such as the Federal  Bureau of Investigations (FBI) use similar strategies, though we do not consider them here  due to the information barriers inherent in examining a pure criminal law enforcement  agency like the FBI. Instead, we turn in this chapter to an agency that straddles the civil and  criminal divide: Customs and Border Protection (CBP).  Although CBP conducts some civilian enforcement functions such as cargo  inspection, the agency also monitors criminal activity and enforces immigration  and customs laws. In doing so, CBP deploys two of the most controversial AI/ML  tools: facial recognition and risk prediction. Law enforcement agencies have used facial recognition technology to match still  images from crime scenes against criminal databases since at least 2009.7 As of  2016, one in four state or local police departments had access to facial recognition  databases, and sixteen states had contributed driver’s license photos to the FBI’s  federal equivalent.8 Today, local governments have access to an even wider suite  of live facial recognition surveillance tools.9 Despite its growing popularity with law  enforcement, facial recognition raises unique privacy and due process concerns.  Four cities in California and Massachusetts have banned its use,10 and a recent  Senate bill proposes to ban facial recognition technology in all public housing  receiving federal funding.11 Risk prediction, too, is a widely contested use of AI/ML. Law enforcement risk  prediction tools incorporate data about individuals—such as their age, criminal  history, and gender—to identify individuals that may be at risk of committing or  becoming the victims of crime. Police departments can use such tools to rank  individuals prone to violence based on their likelihood of becoming involved  in a future homicide.12 Courts routinely consult AI-based risk-assessment tools,  referring to automatically-generated risk scorecards in making sentencing  decisions.13 Like facial recognition, law enforcement uses of risk prediction may  raise due process14 or equal protection concerns. In this chapter, we consider CBP’s plans to “transform the way it identifies travelers  by shifting the key to unlocking a traveler’s record from biographic identifiers”— such as passports and visas—“to biometric ones—primarily a traveler’s face.”15 KEY TAKEAWAYS  Customs and Border Protection  (CBP) has relied extensively on  contractors to develop facial  recognition technology and risk  scoring of passengers.   Reliance on contractors carries a  cost: CBP was unable to explain  failure rates of one biometric  scanning application.   While such tools can expedite  processing at airports and borders,  they also raise questions about  interagency data sharing, privacy,  equal protection, and rulemaking  requirements. 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 31This significant shift may allow the agency to leverage a  broader dataset and improve accuracy, but it also creates new  vulnerabilities and raises important legal questions. We begin  with a brief overview of the agency and its mandate, then  examine CBP’s use of facial recognition and risk prediction. We  conclude by discussing the trajectory for AI use at CBP and   highlight implications for the future of such technologies. I. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION Customs and Border Protection sits within the Department of  Homeland Security, the federal government’s largest law  enforcement agency.16 The agency was established in 2003, in  the aftermath of the September 11 attacks, to combine the  former U.S. Customs Service with various immigration,  agricultural inspection, and border patrol roles.17 Today, CBP  boasts 60,000 employees, making it “one of the world’s largest  law enforcement organizations.”18 These employees are spread throughout several sub-agencies,  including the Office of Field Operations—which controls ports  of entry—and the U.S. Border Patrol, which patrols the areas  between them.19 The Air and Marine Operations division  supports these functions,20 and the Office of Trade coordinates  with international partners and other agencies to enforce  trade restrictions and customs laws at ports of entry.21 CBP is a  pure law enforcement agency, imposing both civil and  criminal penalties in its enforcement of twenty-nine distinct  sections of the U.S. Code, in areas ranging from intellectual  property protection to environmental conservation.22 Although  CBP fulfills a wide variety of functions, the agency’s  overarching mission is “[t]o safeguard America’s borders.”23 To  achieve this mission, the agency continues to rely on  specialized officer teams, such as the CBP Aircraft Search  Team, to search for contraband and apprehend those  engaged in trafficking or smuggling on the ground.24 It also  supplements these human teams with more advanced  technological tools. For example, CBP began deploying  unmanned drones as early as 2004 to monitor smuggling,  human trafficking, and illegal crossings at the border.25 The  agency’s use of facial recognition and risk prediction tools are  consistent with this trend and are meant to support the work  of its human officers. II. AI USE CASES Customs and Border Protection has invested significant  resources in artificial intelligence. In 2018, the agency received  $196 million to acquire and deploy border security  technology.26 In 2017, Executive Order 13,780 enabled the agency to “expedite the completion and implementation  of a Biometric Entry-Exit Tracking System.”27 CBP’s Facial  Recognition and Risk Prediction Programs have grown out  of the agency’s emphasis on counterterrorism: The Facial  Recognition Program is a “direct result” of “recommendations  from the 9/11 Commission,”28 and the Risk Prediction Program  bills itself as a way to “identify potential threats.”29 The latter  assesses not only human travelers, but also non-human entities such as cargo. A. F acial Recognition In 2004, Congress authorized CBP to collect biometric data  from non-citizens entering the United States.30 At entry  points such as airports, officers would match passenger data  provided by airlines with a passenger’s passport. Officers would also collect the biometric fingerprints of non-citizens to ensure a match with the passports, and would run that data  against criminal and terrorist watchlists. 31 In 2012, the agency  began placing self-service Global Entry kiosks at airports  to process biographic data for inbound U.S. citizens.32 This  enabled the agency to focus human resources on processing non-citizens. Three years later, the agency began piloting  facial recognition and mobile fingerprint scanners at airports  to enhance this process. 33 Facial recognition systems match a given image or video of a face with an identity. 34 These systems work by first detecting  a face—often in cluttered, crowded or obstructed settings— then matching its features against a database of known  faces. A CBP port of entry kiosk, for example, may snap a photo of incoming persons, detect and crop a particular face,  and create a vector representation that can more robustly  match an identity in the underlying database. Biometric identification, which identifies people using physical traits such as the face, fingerprints, or voice, has several advantages. 35 In theory, each person’s physical traits are  unique and more difficult to falsify than written documents  like passports.36 Although CBP initially experimented with  other biometric technologies such as iris and mobile  fingerprint scanning,37 it has settled upon facial recognition  both because of low iris capture rates,38 and because photos  of faces are more widely available and easily accessible than iris data—which the agency would have to gather on its own. 39 The agency recognizes that “[w]hile DHS’ gallery  of fingerprints is large, it pales in comparison to the number of facial recognition quality photos held in existing data  sources, such as the U.S. Passport and Visa databases.” 40 Facial  recognition also served as the least disruptive option: The 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 32agency “found that facial recognition was intuitive for people.  Everybody knows how to stand in front of a camera and have  his or her picture taken.”41 CBP launched its facial recognition program in 2017.42 It  typically obtains facial recognition software from private  vendors that closely guard their intellectual property, making  it difficult to determine the architecture of its program.43  Unisys, an information technology company that is the  agency’s main contractor for facial recognition, seems to use  deep learning in both the pre- and post-image processing  stages to extract features—such as estimated age—from  an image. The agency appears to have combined products  from companies that likely employ different models, such  as NEC’s NeoFace44—which identifies individuals using  proprietary feature-extraction methods and deep learning  face-matching—and Cognitec’s FaceVACs.45 The deployment  examples below illustrate the range of this technology and its  applications to CBP’s broader mission. 1. Airports As part of its Biometric Entry/Exit Program, CBP entered into  agreements requiring airports to buy cameras to capture  facial images.46 Several airports and airlines have rolled out  the agency’s Traveler Verification Service, a central biometric  identification system that includes facial recognition.47  Private partners use the Traveler Verification Service for  paperless boarding and processing.48 In June 2018, Orlando  International Airport became the first to use facial recognition  on all travelers.49 At least seventeen airports, from Seattle  to Atlanta and Fort Lauderdale, have followed suit.50 As  passengers board an aircraft, the system captures their  photos, which an algorithm then processes to ensure that the  boarding passengers’ faces match their registered photos.  CBP claims that its facial recognition system finds passengers  attempting to enter the country illegally on a daily basis.51 CBP  initially failed to clarify whether passengers could opt out of  the system, generating confusion and criticism.52 And despite  CBP’s later clarification that passengers could opt out, the  rate at which passengers do so remains low: In one audit, only  sixteen passengers across a sample of twelve flights declined  to be photographed.53 CBP is partnering with the Transportation Security  Administration to test its ability to capture and match facial  images at checkpoints. But in addition to sharing its system with sister agencies, CBP also encourages third-party use of  these technologies. CBP describes its database as a “device  agnostic backend backbone” that will spur “private sector  investment in front end infrastructure, such as self-service  baggage drop off kiosks, facial recognition self-boarding gates,  and other equipment.”54 As the agency states: Customs and Border Protection will build a backend  communication portal to support TSA, airport, and  airline partners in their efforts to use facial images  as a single biometric key for identifying and  matching travelers to their identities. This portal  will provide our partners with the ability to utilize  the Customs and Border Protection Biometric  Pathway for identity verification at any point in the  travel continuum.55 Commercial carriers and airport authorities send the facial  images they capture to CBP’s Traveler Verification Service.56  The agency retains photos of U.S. citizens only until their  identities are confirmed, but can retain photos of non-U.S.  citizens for up to fifteen years.57 2. Land Borders CBP has also begun testing facial and iris recognition  technology at land borders. At the Otay Mesa Port of Entry,  for example, the agency has tested a variety of physical  deployments including kiosks and stop-and-look or on-themove detection systems.58 Kiosks pose the fewest technical  challenges, because they scan passengers who are directed  to stand in a particular pose. Stop-and-look stations are  similar, but must account for different poses. On-the-move  placements must process video, which may require detecting  faces in a series of frames without overcounting or accounting  for blur and other video artifacts. In August 2018, CBP began  testing facial recognition on drivers in Anzalduas, Texas.59 The  agency has tested this technology using dedicated lanes,  allowing people to opt in to the facial recognition system.60 B. Risk Prediction Risk prediction modeling uses statistical methods to assess  particularized future risks, such as the probability that  an individual will develop a specific illness. To assess the  potential security risks posed by each of the hundreds  of millions of people, vehicles, and containers crossing  U.S. borders, CBP employs a bundle of programs termed 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 33the Automated Targeting System. Information about the  Automated Targeting System first became publicly available  in November 2006 through the Federal Register,61 but has  since been exempted from future disclosures.62 According to  agency documents, the system generates and assigns a rating  to every entity that crosses U.S. borders, determining the  potential threat a given entity poses and the level and priority  of screening it should receive.63 One subsystem screens  passengers—including by marking airline passengers for  additional screening—while another screens cargo. By 2014, CBP had begun developing a Risk Prediction  Program, which aims to improve the Automated Targeting  System in collaboration with the Science & Technology  Directorate of the Department of Homeland Security.64 The  Risk Prediction Program will augment existing systems with  machine learning techniques to help track and assess more  complex patterns.65 Various contractors with machine learning  expertise have been involved in the project. For example,  the project integrates Metron’s machine learning “real-time  Automated Modeling & Targeting Subsystem” into the CBP  passenger screening subsystem. Metron has also developed  and integrated a “Link Discovery Tool” into passenger  screening, aiding the “discovery of links from current  passengers to past known or suspected threats.”66 In June  2018, CBP contracted with Unisys,67 which has developed its  own risk-prediction program for use by governments around  the world.68 The program also uses information from a wide variety of  government and non-government data sources. Many of  these data sources are internal to DHS, such as the Advance  Passenger Information System, Nonimmigrant Information  System, and Enforcement Integrated Database. Others, such  as the Federal Bureau of Investigation Terrorist Screening  Database and the Department of Justice National Crime  Information Center, come from peer agencies. But the  program also reaches beyond federal government sources  to collect passenger data—such as billing and email  addresses, payment information, in-flight seat locations, meal  preferences, and baggage data—directly from airline carriers.69 As in the facial recognition context, CBP has not publicly  released the specific technologies its Risk Prediction Program  uses to process this data. CBP has both a security and liability  incentive to keep its technologies opaque: Doing so wards off adversarial learning while insulating the agency from legal  challenges. But the program likely integrates a wide range  of tools from contractors and parallel agency initiatives.  Contractor Metron, for instance, boasts capabilities that  include supervised and unsupervised machine learning and  graph-mining.70 And DHS has reported that CBP’s advanced  machine learning algorithms in the cargo screening context  may support “research on entities and individuals of interest”  for intelligence and law enforcement purposes.71 DHS reports  that CBP’s passenger screening program employs only “riskbased rules that are derived from discrete data elements” and  does not mention machine learning.72 Yet DHS also contracted  with Metron in 2012 to develop an “automated behaviorbased screening and anomaly detection technology.”73 And  in 2018, it awarded funds to DataRobot, Inc. to “begin testing  a prototype of a machine learning platform” for CBP’s Global  Travel Assessment System.74 In one internal report CBP admitted  that it was unable to explain the failure  rates of its iris scanning technology:  “Due to the proprietary technology  being used, the specific cause of the  failure could not be differentiated.” The Risk Prediction Program’s methodology and scope  remains somewhat unclear. CBP has denied using MLpowered risk assessment scores for passengers75 and  claims to instead compare each passenger’s personally  identifiable information “against lookouts and patterns of  suspicious activity identified through past investigations  and intelligence.”76 In 2009, a lawsuit by the Electronic  Frontier Foundation revealed several references to “riskscored” passenger information within the agency’s internal  documents.77 Whether these risk scores come from an ML  algorithm similar to those the agency is using in the cargo  context or from an expert-based system remains unclear.  As recently as 2018, Unisys stated in a press release that it  helps CBP assess “risk associated with travelers or cargo 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 34shipments.”78 These risk scores may be used not just by  Customs and Border Protection, but also by other DHS or law  enforcement agencies. III. FUTURE TRAJECTORY FOR CBP Although facial recognition may not be as accurate as  fingerprints79 and may be susceptible to evasion,80 it offers  a more seamless interface than even mobile fingerprint  scanners. By deploying facial recognition cameras, CBP can  collect biometric facial recognition data on a wider scale, and  at faster speeds, than individual fingerprints. The technology  also enables CBP to match travelers against a wider database  of photos, while reducing the agency’s “dependency on less  reliable paper travel documents like passports and visas.”81  Risk prediction programs promise similar improvements  in efficiency and accuracy. However, these tools remain in  their early stages. As CBP expands its use, it will likely have  to build greater internal agency AI/ML expertise to address  the knowledge gap created by reliance on contractors. In one  internal report, for example, CBP admitted that it was unable  to explain the failure rates of its iris scanning technology:  “[D]ue to the proprietary technology being used, the specific  cause of the failure could not be differentiated.”82 If CBP  fails to understand the flaws in its own technology, it can  expose itself to unknown vulnerabilities and fail to detect  adversarial attacks. More broadly, agencies that lack access  to a contractor’s proprietary technology may be unable to  troubleshoot and adapt their own systems. In addition to building internal technical capacity, CBP  may have to stay abreast of advances in AI, as its programs  raise security and adversarial learning concerns that law  enforcement agencies continue to grapple with. Facial  recognition systems can be vulnerable to adversarial attacks.83  An attacker could, for example, craft data inputs to trick a CBP  facial recognition system into incorrectly matching a face with  the no-fly list or vice-versa.84 The simplest attacks can often  be the most successful: Security researchers have confused  a Tesla autopilot system by strategically placing stickers  in its field of view, causing the car to unexpectedly change  lanes.85 Moreover, attackers can often break adversarial  defenses in short time frames.86 Although researchers have  sought to address adversarial attacks by training models with  theoretical guarantees on robustness,87 these guarantees  often come at the price of accuracy. Furthermore, private  contractors may exacerbate vulnerabilities. For example, many of CBP’s private contractors list their research on their  resumes, enabling adversaries to make educated guesses  about the agency’s internal models. As CBP expands its use  of facial recognition and risk prediction, it must consider and  address these evolving security threats. CBP’s controversial gathering and  sharing of personal data highlights  the importance of establishing robust  consent and security procedures. IV. IMPLICATIONS: THE CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR LAW  ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES USING AI AI/ML tools can enhance a law enforcement agency’s breadth  and precision. CBP’s AI/ML use cases have implications  for other agencies in law enforcement and beyond. The  Department of Veterans Affairs and other service agencies,  for example, may consider using facial recognition or other  biometric identifiers to process identities, securely process  private information, and reduce wait times.88 Regulatory  enforcement agencies that monitor risk on an individual  level—such as the SEC and FTC—may learn from CBP’s Risk  Prediction Program. These insights could, for example, assist  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) with its  own Fraud Prevention Program.89 At the same time, agencies  will have to consider the challenges that CBP continues to  face in deploying its ambitious programs. First, CBP’s controversial gathering and sharing of personal  data highlights the importance of establishing robust consent  and security procedures, even for interagency data sharing.  Federal regulation of interagency data sharing is limited  primarily to reporting requirements, and may not fully  address public concerns with more modern data sharing.  Prior technologies used straightforward opt-in and opt-out  mechanisms: Law enforcement agencies historically collected  images directly from citizens, such as during the passport, visa  application, or border crossing process.90 And while airports  have long used automated passport kiosks which verify  identity using facial biometrics, those technologies have been  relatively easier to notice and opt out of.91 By contrast, a U.S. 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 35citizen who wishes to opt out of facial recognition today may  find it increasingly difficult to do so: The agency has likely  obtained her image from one of its many data sources and  may already be using it to verify her identity. In implementing  the Facial Recognition Program, for example, CBP obtained  decades of passport photos from the Department of State’s  Consular Consolidated Database,92 without obtaining consent  from U.S. citizens.93 Second, data sharing raises privacy concerns. CBP shares  information with various federal, state, and local authorities.  It partners with the National Institute of Standards and  Technology to test and evaluate vendor technologies,94 and  feeds biographic and biometric data to the shared interagency  Arrival and Departure Information System.95 This  data sharing  extends beyond the government. Under existing guidelines,  private parties, such as airlines or airports, might be allowed  to use facial images for commercial purposes. One CBP  memorandum of understanding does not “preclude any Party  from entering into future business agreements or commercial  opportunities.”96 According to one media report, this  agreement sets “no commercial limits for ‘airline partners;’ if  they wanted to sell or somehow monetize the biometric data  they collect, there was nothing stopping them.”97 Moreover,  while CBP writes data usage policies into its government  contracts,98 in compliance with DHS guidelines implementing  federal requirements from the Security Modernization Act of  2014 and the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015,99  these precautions fail to sufficiently delineate the limits on  private use of agency data. To prevent the kind of criticism  CBP has faced for its lack of transparency,100 agencies may  want to share clear guidelines on data gathering and data  sharing at the outset. Third, agency uses of facial recognition or risk prediction can  raise equal protection concerns.  As privacy advocates and  academics have highlighted,101 facial recognition systems  can entrench bias into agency decision-making. Biases in  the data may translate to inaccuracies for underrepresented  populations, implicating disparate impact and disparate  treatment concerns.102 Many systems originally misclassified  faces with darker skin tones at higher rates than faces with  lighter skin tones.103 In China, an automated policing system  detected a businesswoman’s face on a bus advertisement  and mistakenly cited her for jaywalking.104 Although scholars are working to develop algorithms that naturally account  for these biases,105 and vendors have significantly reduced  the disparity in error rates,106 systems continue to be far from  perfect. Similarly, with respect to risk prediction, risk scores  may rely on protected characteristics such race, religion, and  gender.107 The legal issues surrounding such scoring remain  controversial but unresolved in the algorithmic context.108  Agencies should consider these legal concerns when  determining whether to adopt facial recognition systems. Fourth, agency deployment of facial recognition raises Fourth  Amendment issues. While current law is permissive with  respect to search and seizure at the border,109 there are some  uncertainties around the use of these technologies, as well as  congressional calls for greater oversight.110 There is no judicial  ruling on whether using facial recognition constitutes a search  under the Fourth Amendment.111 The use of risk scoring could  implicate the Fourth Amendment if it becomes the basis  for—or even merely prolongs—a search or seizure. The border  exception is less likely to apply in other agency contexts  deploying risk scores and facial recognition. Fifth, agencies that implement AI/ML technologies outside of  the national security context may be subject to procedural  requirements under the APA. Congress has on several  occasions ordered collection of biometrics from foreign  nationals at the border, but it has never clearly authorized  facial recognition for U.S. citizens.112 CBP did not conduct  notice-and-comment rulemaking prior to implementing its  facial recognition program,113 presumably invoking one of the  APA exceptions. In 2011, however, the D.C. Circuit held that the  Transportation Security Agency was required to go through  the rulemaking process prior to employing body scanners  at airports.114 The D.C. Circuit found the agency’s adoption of  body scanners to be a legislative rule, requiring notice and  comment. If the biometric program is analogous to the use  of body scanners, it may similarly require rulemaking. The  APA further exempts agencies from notice and comment  when impractical or unnecessary115 or for matters of military  or foreign affairs.116 The agency might claim this exemption,  invoking Executive Order 13,780, which articulates the  national security purpose and urgency driving the biometric  Entry-Exit system.117 But even then, it would likely need to  incorporate a brief statement citing its rationale for excluding  public comment into the rule itself.118
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 36Finally, CBP must contend with serious political and public  relations risks. Facial recognition and risk prediction  remain some of the most contentious applications of  AI/ML technology, in part because they implicate the  aforementioned concerns regarding citizen consent, data  privacy, equal protection, and searches and seizures. But  growing agitation about facial recognition technology and risk  prediction runs deeper than that, reflecting more existential  concerns about the rise of the surveillance state. While the  foregoing cannot possibly do justice to ongoing debate about  the proper role of technology-enabled surveillance, it is a  crucial debate to have. * * * * In sum, AI/ML tools may, as in CBP’s case, significantly expand  an agency’s scope and reach and enable it to make agency  operations more efficient and accurate. At the same time,  such programs raise privacy and security risks and reveal basic  tensions between the goals of law enforcement and agency  transparency.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 37Formal Adjudication at the Social Security  Administration Federal agencies adjudicate more cases than all federal courts combined. Guaranteeing  due process in the face of such high volumes remains one of the core challenges of  administrative adjudication, with volumes of legal and scholarly analysis devoted to the  topic.1 When an immigrant appeals her asylum decision, when a veteran appeals the denial  of disability benefits, or when an individual challenges the denial of Medicare coverage,  how can we assure that decisions reached by adjudicators are accurate and consistent?  And what potential does AI have to solve what some have called a “looming crisis in  decisional quality”2 in agency adjudication?  In this chapter we cover the emerging uses of  AI for formal adjudication.  AI-based adjudication tools address two types of adjudication settings. First,  the textbook APA category of formal adjudication centers on instances where  an agency’s enabling act requires adjudications to be made on the record.3  Sometimes dubbed “Type A” adjudications,4 such adjudications trigger procedural  protections under the APA,5 including the right for interested parties to submit  evidence, a right to an exclusive record for the decision, the right to a presiding  employee who is at arm’s length from agency investigators or prosecutors  (separation of functions), and the prohibition of ex parte communications.6  Typically, the presiding employee is an administrative law judge (ALJ).7 As of  2017, 27 agencies employed 1,931 ALJs. A small number of agencies employ the  vast bulk of ALJs: 86% sit in the Social Security Administration, 5% in the Office  of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, 2% in the Department of Labor, and 2% in the  National Labor Relations Board. Second, the tools discussed in this chapter also pertain to adjudications that  require evidentiary hearings, but do not trigger the APA’s default adjudicatory  procedures. In such “Type B” adjudications, agencies employ administrative judges  (AJs), whose adjudicatory work resembles that of ALJs, but without the same  set of procedural protections as the APA.8 Strictly speaking, such adjudications  are “informal” under the APA, but the enabling act (and, potentially, procedural  due process) can still trigger an administrative approximation of a civil trial.  Asimow reports nearly 100 schemes where an office’s primary function is “Type  B” adjudication,9 but, as with Type A adjudications, a small number of agencies,  such as the Board of Veterans Appeals10 and the Executive Office of Immigration  Review,11 employ the bulk of AJs. These types of adjudications typically also have  an exclusive record requirement, the right to a neutral decision maker, separation  of functions, and a prohibition on ex parte communications. While “wildly KEY TAKEAWAYS  AI tools are being developed to  improve the accuracy and efficiency  of formal adjudication.   The most advanced tool relies on  text parsing of draft decisions to  flag potential errors.  Entrepreneurs within the agency  with both subject matter and  technical expertise were critical  in spurring early innovation to  circumvent legacy systems and  restrictions.   As adjudicatory decision tools  grow, they may raise questions  about decisional authority and  independence and the transparency  of adjudicative decisions. 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 38diverse,”12 these adjudicatory processes often also face case  processing challenges due to significant caseloads. Tools  developed at SSA to reduce error and improve processing  times of disability adjudication may well translate, for  instance, to the closely analogous BVA setting. The tools we discuss in this chapter have somewhat less  direct applicability to the vast residual category of informal  adjudications that do not require an evidentiary hearing  (“Type C” adjudications). We turn to that setting in the  following chapter. In what follows, we devote the bulk of the discussion to AI  innovations in place at the Social Security Administration  (SSA), both because the agency plays a central role when it  comes to formal adjudication and because SSA has taken the  largest strides in developing such tools. We close the chapter  by spelling out implications for adjudication more broadly. I. THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION A. Disability Claims System The SSA was created in 1935 as part of the Social Security Act.  Congress subsequently modified the Social Security Act of  1935 to cover people unable to work because of disabilities  and created the Social Security and Disability Insurance  (“SSDI”) Program. The program currently covers all workers  between 18 and 65 who have contributed to the program  commensurate with their contributions.13 In 1972, Congress  created the Supplemental Security Income (“SSI”) Program,  which provides disability benefits on the basis of need  regardless of past contributions.14 The Social Security Act defines “disability” as “inability  to perform any substantial gainful activity by reason of a  medically determinable impairment that is expected to  last at least twelve months or result in death.”15 The statute  and implementing regulations create a five-step process for  determining whether an applicant meets the criteria and is  entitled to benefits.16 At step one, the agency denies the claim  if the claimant is engaged in substantial gainful activity.17  At step two, the agency considers whether the claimant  has “a severe medically determinable physical or mental  impairment” (or combination of impairments) of sufficient  duration.18 At step three, the agency determines whether  the impairment(s) meets or equals a listed impairment,19  in which case the claimant is entitled to benefits. If not, the  agency determines at step four if the claimant is capable of performing her past relevant work, based on the claimant’s  “residual functional capacity” and past relevant work.20 If  not, the agency determines at step five whether the claimant  is able to perform any other work, based on the claimant’s  residual functional capacity, age, education, and work  experience. If not, the claimant is found disabled and entitled  to benefits.21 The adjudication process is divided into four administrative  levels. First, at the initial state level, the SSA receives an  application and sends that application to the State Disability  Determination Service (“DDS”). DDS staff work with medical  or psychological consultants to initially determine whether  the applicant is disabled under the rules. Second, a claimant  dissatisfied with DDS’s initial determination can request  reconsideration. A different DDS examiner reviews all  evidence submitted as part of the initial determination, and  the claimant can submit further evidence. Third, a claimant  dissatisfied with reconsideration results can request a  hearing with an Administrative Law Judge (“ALJ”) for de novo  review of her claim, including review of additional evidence  not available at the time of prior proceedings. The Appeals  Council handles the final level of appeals within the agency.  The Appeals Council is also in charge of performing quality  review and policy interpretation. B. Current Challenges 1. Caseload, Processing Time, and Differential  Grant Rates The SSA is likely “the largest adjudication agency in the  western world.”22 Its Office of Disability Adjudication and  Review (“ODAR”) is in charge of scheduling disability hearings,  handling the Appeals Council, and reviewing decisions made  by ALJs. ODAR consists of over 160 offices and 10 regional  offices. In 2016, SSA received more than 2.5 million disability  claims, with almost 700,000 appealed to the hearings level.23  Because of the caseload, ODAR offices experience a significant  backlog of claims. Wait time for a hearing can range from a  few months to more than two years.24 Past efforts to reduce  the hearings backlog and the average processing time for  claims have had limited success.25 In addition, there are longstanding concerns about widely  differential grant rates between ALJs, with some judges  granting benefits over 90% of the time and others under 10%  of the time.26 Such disparities raise concerns about accuracy  and fairness, but prior efforts to reduce disparities through 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 39internal oversight have been held to violate principles of  decisional independence under the APA.27 These challenges  of ensuring the accuracy and consistency of decisionmaking at SSA have persisted through decades of quality  improvement efforts.28 2. Capacity Building As part of its efforts to address these challenges, the SSA  has undertaken a series of efforts to improve its data  infrastructure and develop staff with technical competence to  improve efficiency and accuracy in processing claims in data  driven ways. SSA has long sought to improve the quality of data available  for data analysis to improve the efficiency and quality of  adjudications. In contrast to other adjudicatory agencies, SSA  adopted an electronic case management tool early on.29 One  of its current efforts involves obtaining medical records in  electronic format and converting medical records, presently  received as image files in most cases, into text files. SSA is  currently in the process of digitizing its request-generation  process and planning to obtain medical evidence in more  accessible formats. In 2015, SSA also started to develop  software to convert images of medical records to readable  text. The SSA CARES initiative is planning to develop and  pilot a software that uses artificial intelligence and NLP to  automatically scan case files, identify duplicative medical  evidence, and suggest those pieces of evidence for removal by  SSA staff. Notwithstanding these efforts, significant challenges  to the data infrastructure remain. Agency leadership and entrepreneurship appears to have  played a particularly important role for positioning SSA to  be able to take advantage of data analytics. Gerald Ray, who  spent most of his career at SSA, becoming an Administrative  Appeals Judge and then deputy executive director of the  Office of Appellate Operations (OAO), played an important  role in creating the seedbed for prototyping AI tools.  Described by one co-worker as the “Steve Jobs of the SSA,”  Ray realized early on that the formalization of adjudicatory  policy, capturing data streams, and analytics could help  address longstanding challenges of SSA adjudication. Because  OAO was only authorized to employ attorneys, however, he  strategically identified attorneys who also happened to have  a knack for data analysis and software engineering, which  became the core team building out SSA’s early prototypes.30II. AI USE CASES We now describe three novel experiments in the use of AI/ ML at the SSA in increasing order of sophistication, aimed to  address the caseload, accuracy, and consistency challenges. A. Clustering for Micro-Specialization The Appeals Council has explored the use of clustering  algorithms to improve case processing. The existing approach  randomly assigned cases to adjudicators. SSA hypothesized  that case clustering could help adjudicators accumulate  expertise about and reduce research time into policies and  regulations by examining similar claims together, potentially  reducing case processing time and errors. One potential for  case clustering would have been to develop specialty units,  wherein adjudicators exclusively focused on distinct areas of  law. Yet in response to concerns about differential workloads,  the clustering algorithm was applied so that each adjudicator  would (a) receive the same (randomly selected) set of cases  as before, but (b) receive the suggested order in which to  process them. Such “micro-specialization” might still enable  adjudicators to develop expertise in one area and apply the  relevant statutes and regulations to comparable cases. The clustering tool uses meta-data available in SSA’s case  management system—including claimant’s age, impairments,  state of origin and other facts developed at the hearing  level—to provide clusters of similar claims.31 SSA reported  12% reduction in case processing time and 7.5% reduction  in returns from administrative appeal judges to attorneys.32  That said, the program is being used only on a voluntary  basis and it is unclear how these effects were calculated. If  more motivated adjudicators adopted micro-specialization  or if the program was implemented along with other quality  improvement efforts, the reported benefits may be overstated. B. Accelerating Appeals with Predicted   Likelihood of Success In another effort to reduce case processing times, the SSA has  developed two mechanisms for expediting claims likely to  receive benefits. To improve case processing at the initial application level,  SSA promulgated new rules that included provision for  automatically identifying claimants most likely to qualify  for benefits for Quick Disability Determination (QDD).33 The  program identifies claims where benefits are likely to be  awarded and where the information needed to make the 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 40disability determination can be obtained quickly and easily.  Each DDS unit establishes a QDD unit devoted to processing  claims referred by the predictive model.34 After referral, each  QDD determination “involv[es] sign-off by both an examiner  and a medical expert.”35 The expectation was that a small  number of claims would qualify, but that more cases would  be processed in this manner over time.36 The proposed model  was meant to identify claims using scores based on “such  factors as medical history, treatment protocols, and medical  signs and findings.”37 Features were selected based on prior  DDS determinations.38 In 2010, SSA revised its regulations  to permit QDD examiners to grant claims without medical  consultation,39 while still requiring such consultation for  denials.40 Some scholars expressed enthusiasm about QDD:  “The addition of QDDs at the initial decision level for selected  types of claims—those where the information needed to  decide disability can be obtained quickly and easily—is also  a positive and practical approach to case management.  Setting apart claims for which the evidentiary record may be  compiled with little difficulty will allow SSA to direct muchneeded resources to more difficult claims.”41 SSA has also developed tools to expedite claims at the  hearing level by predicting which claims were denied  reconsideration but have a high likelihood of receiving  benefits.42 The predicted probability of a grant is “not used  to adjudicate the cases, and the probabilities of allowance  [are] not shared with adjudicators, but cases with higher  probabilities of allowance [are] moved ahead of cases in the  queue with lower probabilities of allowance under the notion  that disabled claimants should receive their decisions as soon  as possible.”43 Specialized teams then analyze the cases based  on the estimates.44 The model also seeks to identify claims  dismissed for procedural reasons but that would otherwise  be paid to ensure such claims receive proper review.45 The  supervised learning model (Naïve Bayes) uses outcomes at  the hearing level (fully favorable, favorable, unfavorable, or  dismissal),46 age, and impairment as features. Officials at SSA  reported that the model identified 10% of cases as likely to  receive fully favorable as compared with the average fully  favorable rate of 2.5-3% for all claims at the hearings level.47  C. Natural Language Processing for Quality Assurance SSA has a long history of initiatives for quality assurance.48 The  most ambitious technological version consists of a suite of  tools based on natural language processing (NLP). Known as the Insight program,49 these tools were principally developed  by Kurt Glaze, an SSA attorney-turned-programmer, primarily  to improve the quality of decision writing. At the hearing  level, Insight is used to identify weaknesses in draft opinions,  ensuring that adjudicators have properly gone through the  analysis required by regulations. At the Appeals Council level,  it is used to identify inconsistencies in opinions appealed  from ALJ decisions, either by claimants or on the Council’s  own motion. At the Appeals Council level, use is voluntary. At  the hearing level, use is required for fully favorable decisions  but voluntary for unfavorable decisions.50 Since August  2017, the tool has been used 200,000 times at the Appeals  Council level.51 Since October 2018, the tool has been used  approximately 70,000 times at the hearing level.52 The SSA  may be further expanding the program—Congressional  testimony in the summer of 2018 indicated an intention to  expand the use of NLP for quality review.53 Insight analyzes a draft decision  and calculates a set of over 30  “quality flags” that are suggestive  of policy noncompliance or internal  inconsistencies in the decision. Insight consists of several distinct parts. First, using  information extraction from the case management system,  Insight provides a case summary, including claim type,  disposition, claimant information (date of birth, claimed  onset dates, body mass index), and acquiescence rulings  for the region. Second, Insight analyzes a draft decision and  calculates a set of over 30 “quality flags” that are suggestive  of policy noncompliance or internal inconsistencies in the  decision. These flags can range from the simple ( e.g., the  decision cited a provision in the C.F.R. that does not exist, the  claimant’s age and vocational grid rule are inconsistent) to  the more complex ( e.g., the claimant’s capacity is inconsistent  with job requirements in the Dictionary of Occupational  Titles). Critical in this analysis was the existence of SSA’s  policy decision tree that spells out the appropriate paths that  an adjudicator could take, leading to approximately 2,000 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 41possible case types within the five-step process described  above.54 At the Appeals Council level, reviewers answer a  series of questions on the page “to verify that the hearing  decision meets the requirements for a legally sufficient  application of policy in deciding the disability claim.”55 Because over 30 quality flags exist, there is no single algorithm  underpinning the Insight system. The existence of the  Findings Integrated Template, standard templates of decision  writing for case types, facilitates information extraction  from opinions and many quality flags are a hybrid of logical  rules and supervised learning. For instance, a rule-based  heuristic (regular expression) might identify specific language  indicating the claimant’s maximum capacity to perform  certain functions, but a probabilistic NLP classification  algorithm may also be developed based on (relatively) small  training datasets as a fallback. The most advanced component  uses part-of-speech tags and supervised classification to  predict internal inconsistencies. Flags are included in the  Insight system only if they have over 80% accuracy. Some of  the most challenging scenarios where flags are inaccurate  come from cascades of failures—for instance, if the optical  character recognition engine improperly reads an impairment,  multiple inaccurate flags may be thrown. According to internal reports, the Insight system reduces  processing time and the number of returns to staff making  initial determinations at the Appeals Council level.56 In an  audit of the Insight system, SSA’s Inspector General reported  that 80% of survey respondents found the flags to be accurate  while 20% found that the flags were not accurate. Only 30%  of respondents found that Insight improved case processing  time. Overall, the Inspector General recommended that the  agency “develop metrics to determine whether Insight is  achieving its goals.”57 III. FUTURE TRAJECTORY OF AI AT SSA SSA’s prototype applications provide a blueprint for  technology to address longstanding challenges of agency  adjudication. The use of AI to enable adjudicators to process  cases in a more coherent order (through micro-specialization),  to triage cases in a data-driven way to fast-track those  amenable to quick resolution, and to develop quality flags  for written decisions each have potential applicability for  other adjudicatory agencies, such as the Board of Veterans  Appeals, the Office of Medicare Hearings and Appeals, and the Executive Office for Immigration Review.58 The BVA, for  instance, has recently experimented with a case specialty  team, allowing for specialization across adjudicators, not only  in the order of processing within adjudicators. SSA is by far  the most advanced in its adoption of these tools and there is  significant interest in tools that might enable other agencies  to improve case processing. We now spell out some of the  challenges that may limit the trajectory of AI applications in  mass adjudication. A. Improving Data Quality The success of AI depends first and foremost on data. While  SSA has rich raw data, there are significant impediments to  being able to build out a more ambitious AI pipeline. First, much data remains unstructured. The prior employment  field, for instance, is a freeform field that applicants enter  (sometimes in handwritten form), making it challenging  to incorporate in a machine learning pipeline. Legal and  regulatory issues are not used for clustering, as they are  embedded in the text of decisions, leading some branch chiefs  to be more hesitant about adoption. Medical records are  available only in PDF format. Significant efforts are required to  extract, standardize, and validate such information from raw  records. As a result, SSA’s current applications are limited in  the amount of information they are able to incorporate. For  its clustering algorithm, for instance, SSA relies on a limited  number of basic demographic features ( e.g., age, impairment,  and state of origin). The shift toward electronic health  records ( e.g., Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)  and intermediate tools to extract medical conditions ( e.g.,  Amazon’s Comprehend Medical) may help to solve this  bottleneck in the near future. If medical records were available  in structured form, for instance, AI tools could be built out  to aid in the time-consuming process of reviewing the  claims folder. Second, the structured data itself exhibits quality issues. One  of the more important quality flags of the Insight system,  for instance, compares maximum capacity to complete  work-related physical functions with structured data on  employment qualifications in the Dictionary of Occupational  Titles, last updated in the late 1990s. Yet this structured  data is increasingly becoming outdated and may not match  the range of occupations in the current economy.59 As put  by one commentator, “There’s widespread agreement 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 42among the legal community and the SSA that the Dictionary  of Occupational Titles is outdated, with inaccurate job  descriptions, obsolete jobs, as well as missing jobs.”60  In addition, if this data is in fact updated, it may require  significant resources to adapt to the rule-based system that  SSA has developed. Third, labeling data is expensive. This stands in contrast to  many benchmark machine learning tasks ( e.g., sentiment  analysis of movie reviews, object detection in images),  where labels can be crowd-sourced by lay coders. Providing  ground truth labels for legal decisions can be an expensive  endeavor, requiring attorneys well-versed in the legal area  to label decisions. For instance, whether an opinion applied  the appropriate weight to a medical decision in the record  requires an understanding of social security law. Generating  large datasets of several hundred thousand labeled decisions  that are the grist for deep learning can be challenging. These data pipeline issues are not unique to SSA. OMHA is  just now transitioning to an electronic case management  system. In recent years, the U.S. Digital Service built out a new  Caseflow for the BVA. Such systems promise to provide much  richer structured information to facilitate prototyping of AI  tools, but each of these agencies will likely face challenges  comparable to SSA’s. Here again, we see the utility of  embedded expertise in helping an agency to identify the most  appropriate data sources to build out important achievable  solutions. Glaze: “I developed the flags that  I wanted to have available as an  adjudicator.” B. Improving Methods and Evaluation One of the strengths of SSA’s AI strategy has been to rely on  adjudicators (subject matter experts or SMEs) to determine  what tools merit development. Providing acquiescence  rulings, for instance, is straightforward based on ZIP-code  matching, but requires substantive expertise as to what in  fact slows down the decision writing process. As put by Glaze, “I developed the flags that I wanted to have available as an  adjudicator.” Consider a contrast with a search engine built  out for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, as detailed in the  next chapter. While technically sophisticated for its time, the  only users reporting positive interactions with the tool were  those with computer science backgrounds, leading the PTO to  abandon the tool. That said, the SME-driven approach constrains the  sophistication of AI/ML deployed. The model for predicting  grants (naïve Bayes), for instance, imposes a strong  independence assumption. While SSA’s model predicts that  10% of cases will receive fully favorable decisions, significantly  fewer are granted upon review, suggesting that the model may  require some more calibration. The model (logistic regression)  used for a number of the Insight quality flags does not take  advantage of the most important developments in natural  language processing— e.g., the deep learning revolution.  We hence spell out several areas where advances in AI may  improve existing tools. First, advances in synthetic data  generation and differential privacy may enable SSA to provide  public data or query-based access to enlist the broader  machine learning community in building out solutions.61  Employing these methods may enable SSA to begin to release  certain synthetic datasets to enlist the machine learning  community to work on these important social problems. Second, the lack of large datasets with ground truth (training  corpora) may be overcome by deploying “fine-tuning” from  (language) models pretrained on large corpora. Until recently,  deep learning as applied to NLP required large volumes of  ground truth data, making it infeasible to train such models  on SSA data. As happened in computer vision years earlier, we  have observed breakthroughs in NLP with pretrained models  that facilitate fine-tuning. Google’s BERT model, for instance,  is a model trained on Wikipedia and the Books Corpus with  110 million parameters, learning the context of language  better than prior models.62 Most importantly, it is possible to  retrain BERT to achieve substantial gains in benchmark NLP  tasks with much smaller training datasets. By fine-tuning  such language models, mass adjudicatory agencies may be  able to deploy insights gained from much larger corpora to  solve discrete adjudicatory tasks, with much less diversion of  adjudicatory resources to hand-label case decisions.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 43Machine learning tools may be built  to pinpoint the relevant records and  passages in lengthy claims folders,  potentially achieving for record review  what electronic searchers have achieved  for the discovery process. Third, one of the most promising deployments of AI may  lie in lowering the costs for claims folder processing and  legal research. Conventionally, adjudication has been laborintensive, requiring manual review of lengthy claims folders  and research into applicable laws and regulations. The  provision of acquiescence rulings illustrates how machine  learning can create a more streamlined decision-making  architecture, reducing the cost of locating circuit-specific  policy. More generally, machine learning tools may be built to  pinpoint the relevant records and passages in lengthy claims  folders, potentially achieving for record review what electronic  searchers have achieved for the discovery process. To be sure,  before such tools can be built out, agencies need to digitize  the claims folder and capture information on the relevant  records from manual processing to be able to develop such  models. And the task is challenging because any missed  record ( e.g., doctor’s note) could be the grounds for reversal.  Nonetheless, these tools could potentially reduce the cost of  decision writing by a wide margin. We explore more of these  search and classification methods in the context of the PTO in  the next chapter. Fourth, generative language models may begin to automate  parts of decision writing. SSA’s Findings Integrated Template  already provides most of the stock language for decisions, but  adjudicators are still required to write portions of the decision.  Generative language models have been used to predict words  and sentences ( e.g., auto-complete). And such generative  models could be developed to use structured data about  the type of case and the relevant records to draft decision  passages. Given the high volume and often formulaic nature  of mass adjudications, such tools may ease the burden of  drafting decisions.Last, active learning methods could overcome static  deficiencies of these tools. Conventional supervised learning  trains a model based on a snapshot of data. As a result, such  methods may not be able to account for dynamic changes  over time. As mentioned in the enforcement context, past  indicators of insider trading may not be future indicators  of insider trading given strategic adaptation by regulated  parties. In the benefits adjudication context, one acute  concern is that machine learning methods may fail to  adapt to dynamic changes in the economy with the same  degree of flexibility as humans. Methods for active learning  counteract this, by using the model to adaptively select units  for labeling and updating the model-based outcomes. Such  methods could take case triage, such as QDD, to its logical  conclusion by deploying adjudicatory resources to where  errors are the likeliest and updating the underlying model  with each interaction. Adapting active learning principles  to adjudication could hence respond to a longstanding  critique of agency adjudication as failing to correct systematic  sources of error due to arbitrary selection of cases for appeal.  Instead, model-based methods could be used to deploy  adjudicatory resources to discover systemic sources of error in  a dynamic fashion. We make one last comment on improving the methods  for mass adjudication. As in the enforcement context,  evaluation is lacking on two levels. First, little information  exists to be able to assess the performance of AI tools based  on conventional machine learning criteria ( e.g., accuracy,  precision, and recall in a random test set). Second, little  evidence is put forth to sustain claims about the causal effect  of adopting these tools. While SSA touts how these tools  have improved case outcomes, it provides no details on the  method of evaluation. Without such evaluation, it is difficult to  verify whether investment into an AI tool is worth the benefit,  particularly because the data may not available for an external  evaluation.63 As the Inspector General concluded, we lack  measurement “to determine whether Insight is achieving its  goals.”64 The failure to implement such new systems without  an evaluation plan makes it difficult to learn and generalize  from these important interventions, stymieing crossfertilization across agencies. Here, an important lesson comes  from the SEC’s openness toward experimentation: Identifying  the right set of AI tools necessarily means evaluating them and  allowing some to fail.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 44C. Improving Capacity The SSA case study is particularly powerful in what it reveals  about innovation within government. First, as we detail more  fully in a later chapter, SSA illustrates how conventional  boundaries (hiring for attorneys vs. hiring of information  technology staff) can impede innovation. Gerald Ray was only  authorized to hire attorneys, limiting the ability to prototype AI  tools within the Appeals Council. Second, the SSA experience illustrates the importance of  blending subject-matter and technical expertise. Kurt Glaze  was particularly successful in building out the Insight tool  because he spent years deciding cases as an adjudicator,  but also happened to have the requisite background and  willingness to shift toward software engineering. Such  a combination is particularly powerful, but rare. BVA’s  experience with building out the Caseflow provides a different  model: James Ridgway, who helped oversee the project,  felt strongly that members of the U.S. Digital Service needed  to remain on site to observe in real time how the case  management system would be used: If people come in for two weeks, do a bunch of  surveys, go off site, spend two years building  something, and then present it as a finished  product, it’s going to be a disaster. That happens  all the time in the federal government. If you can’t  get the IT folks living with the people who are going  to use the equipment, you should start looking for  a new job now, because you want to get out of  there before the dumpster fire is so bad that the  new IT is leading mission failure.65 Third, SSA will need to give serious consideration to how  to build out from the initial proofs-of-concept. While its  techniques are the most advanced compared to any other  adjudicatory agency we are aware of, as we spell out above,  they do not yet take advantage of all the data available at  SSA nor of state-of-the-art methods developed on machine  learning. Finding, hiring, and training individuals with both  technical capacity and institutional knowledge can be  difficult and expensive. Without requisite technical capacity  to calibrate models, AI tools may introduce inaccuracies into  the adjudicatory process. Conversely, without the requisite  substantive knowledge, an AI tool may improperly encode laws and regulations into computer code.66 The establishment  of the Analytics Center of Excellence (ACE), which aims to  house technical and data science talent, is a positive step to  institutionalizing AI innovation, though it remains to be seen  how successful ACE proves to be in driving forward SSA’s  initiatives. Many individuals trained through ACE proceeded  to help other agencies, limiting SSA’s ability to capitalize on  this investment. IV. IMPLICATIONS: THE FUTURE OF MASS ADJUDICATION At its most ambitious, AI could transform what it means to  adjudicate a case. To be sure, current use cases are a far cry  from full automation of adjudication, but the trajectory raises  profound implications for the APA vision of adjudication.  While we reserve a discussion of broader implications for later  chapters, we briefly spell out several that are distinct to the  adjudicative setting here. First, the trajectory of AI tools in adjudication raises the  normative question about the desired extent of discretion  in adjudication. SSA moved early to formalize its policy as  a decision tree, but few other adjudicatory agencies have  formalized policy to that extent. Such formalization makes  it easier to build out AI tools, yet it may be less clear as a  normative matter whether such a shift is desirable. More rulesbased adjudication may promote consistency, but may also  undercut one of the rationales for adjudication: tailoring the  application to individualized circumstances.67 Second, the development of AI tools raises questions about  notice and transparency. Formal adjudication requires that a  decision be based on the exclusive record, but AI tools involve  a transfer of decision-making authority away from line-level  adjudicators toward AI developers. Where the program  fundamentally changes the way claims are adjudicated—akin  to, say, the establishment of a vocational grid68—rulemaking  may be required. At the state level, where benefits programs  have effectively modified eligibility criteria through the use  of algorithmic decision-making, some courts have found  that the change violates notice and comment requirements  and deprives claimants of due process.69 The QDD program,  for instance, appears to involve a criterion not explicitly  envisioned in statute or regulation, screening applications  based on the onset date of the disability and ruling out  disabilities with earlier onset dates for fast-tracking. While 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 45the use of the onset date might be protected under the APA’s  exemption for internal rules of agency organization,70 the  decision to privilege certain applications may be closer to  occupational guidelines that structure adjudication.71 Ridgway: “If people come in for two  weeks, do a bunch of surveys, go off site,  spend two years building something,  and then present it as a finished  product, it’s going to be a disaster.” Third, the adoption of AI tools could potentially erode the  decisional independence of and de novo review by ALJs. An  SSA ALJ has a “duty to fully and fairly develop the record and  to assure that the claimant’s interests are considered.”72 The  duty is heightened where the claimant is not represented  by counsel but exists also with represented claimants.73  Clustering, for instance, might empirically narrow the scope  of review or analysis to just one particular disability, resulting  in insufficient consideration to other disabling conditions.74  Allowing for voluntary adoption of these decision tools  counteracts the potential political pushback by ALJs to  perceived infringement on their decisional authority, but  such pushback may weaken if adoption is seen to ease the  work burden. Automation bias could mean that ALJ review  of AI-generated content becomes increasingly perfunctory.  Decision writers might increasingly rely on Insight to catch  errors, for instance, ultimately ignoring errors that don’t  have existing flags in the Insight system. This dynamic  of overreliance may be particularly acute given the high  caseloads that adjudicators face.75 Last, as we have seen in many areas of machine learning,  the adoption of such tools can heighten concerns of bias.  For instance, if SSA is able to incorporate electronic health  records for improving its model for expedited processing,  the differential take-up rate of electronic health records  across demographic groups could generate disparate impact.  Understanding this potential for bias underscores the need for  internal capacity to monitor and adjust methods.76* * * * Forecasting the trajectory of AI tools brings into relief  longstanding debates about the core values of agency  adjudication. At its best, AI may address longstanding  problems of the accuracy and consistency of decisions. By  increasingly automating core portions of the adjudicatory  process, these tools may cut down on staggering agency  caseloads without a sacrifice in the accuracy of decisionmaking. At the same time, this future of algorithmic  adjudication may cause us to go back to the basic premises of  procedural due process. Why do we hold hearings? Machine  learning may enable agencies like the SSA, BVA, and OMHA to  expedite decisions by skipping resource-intensive hearings.  And while this may meet the goals of accuracy under due  process, it may also cause us to revisit the lost constitutional  rationale of dignity. The rationale for hearings may not solely  be to promote accuracy, but also to explain the law, to engage  claimants, and to make them feel heard. This, then, is the  challenge of the push for AI solutions in mass adjudication:  Agencies seek out these solutions to accelerate case  processing, but that same pressure may cause agencies to  crowd out the dignitary values of an adjudicative hearing.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 46Informal Adjudication at the United States Patent and  Trademark Office Informal adjudication is a large residual category under the APA1 that spans a wide range of  decision-making contexts, from government grants by the National Science Foundation to  campsite permits by the National Park Service, from gaming licenses by the National Indian  Gaming Commission to wastewater treatment plan permits under the Clean Water Act, and  from an audit of government contracts by the Department of Defense’s Defense Contract  Audit Agency to farm inspections by the Food and Drug Administration. Even enforcement  decisions covered earlier are, for APA purposes, classified as forms of informal adjudication. We specifically focus here on the kinds of adjudicatory proceedings that do not  require an evidentiary hearing either under the APA or the enabling act (“Type  C” adjudications)—which may comprise as many as 90% of all federal agency  adjudication.2 Per Michael Asimow, “The term evidentiary hearing means one  in which both parties have the opportunity to offer testimony and rebut the  testimony and arguments made by the opposition and to which the exclusive  record principle applies .”3 To illustrate the distinction between Type B and C  adjudications, consider different patent proceedings. The Patent and Trademark  Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board, amongst its duties, hears appeals of denials  of patent applications, with a formal hearing and an exclusive record, and is hence  classified as a Type B adjudication. On the other hand, patent examination in the  first instance has no such closed record requirement. Because patent examiners  are tasked with searching all available databases for relevant prior art, patent  examinations are classified as Type C adjudications. We further focus on the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) as an  illustration of how AI tools have begun to transform informal adjudication. The  common challenge running through Type C adjudications is that the open record  (e.g., scientific scholarship for the USPTO) can make information management  challenging. The USPTO case study illustrates how AI/ML can potentially reduce  the cost of such information management. I. THE PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE A.  Patent and Trademark System The USPTO is a federal agency within the Department of Commerce responsible  for granting and issuing patents and registering trademarks.4 Customers use the  agency to protect their intellectual property by filing applications for these patents  or trademarks. When a person seeks a patent from the USPTO, she submits an  application to the agency, and an examiner determines whether to grant a patent  for her application.5 Similarly, when a person seeks to register a trademark, she  submits an application to the agency, and an examining attorney assesses the  application to determine whether the trademark should be registered.6 At the end KEY TAKEAWAYS  The PTO has prototyped AI/ ML tools for improved patent  and trademark classification  and search.  In patent examination, the  reduction of search costs with  deep learning models appears  particularly promising.  In trademark examination, the  computer vision model to detect  visually similar trademarks is one  of the more advanced forms of  AI/ML.  Challenges in the adoption of such  tools include employee / union  resistance, maintaining internal  due process, adversarial learning,  and potential contractor conflicts.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 47of 2018, the USPTO employed 8,185 patent examiners and 579  trademark examining attorneys, and applicants filed 643,349  patent filings (down 1.1% from 2017), and 638,847 trademark  filings (up 7.5% from 2017).7 The examination process comprises three steps. First, the  USPTO classifies a mark into available codes selected from  more than 4,000 possible design codes,8 or classifies the  subject matter of a patent application into one or more codes  selected from over 250,000 possible classification codes.9  For trademark examination, the USPTO identifies design  search codes so that attorneys and other applicants are able  to “thoroughly and efficiently search the USPTO database”  for similar marks.10 Trademarks consist of text and/or design  elements, and each mark is assigned one or more design  search codes.11 For example, one registered trademark for the  “PUMA” sportswear brand contains the depiction of a puma  and the textual name of the brand. The mark is assigned the  design code that falls into the “Animals” category, “Cats, dogs,  wolves, foxes, bears, lions, tigers” division, and the “Tigers and  other large cats (such as leopards or jaguars)” section.12 For patent classification, the USPTO assigns each patent  application one or more Cooperative Patent Classification  (CPC) codes indicating the relevant subject areas for the  claimed invention.13 The CPC classification scheme is “the  result of a partnership between the European Patent Office  and the USPTO in their joint effort to develop a common,  internationally compatible classification system for technical  documents.” 14 Its code structure is hierarchical. It contains  nine sections—such as “Operations and Transport” , “Textiles” ,  “Physics,” etc.—at the highest level, and each of these is  further subdivided into classes, then into subclasses, then  groups, and then main groups.15 Each additional level in the  hierarchy refines the level of specialization for inventions. For  example, the section “Physics” contains the class “Measuring  Instruments” , which further contains subclasses such as  “measuring length” , “measuring distance” , and “measuring  volume.” CPC code(s) are used to route an application to the  appropriate technology centers16 and determine the art unit,  and hence scope of the prior art search. Second, in part based on that classification, examiners or  examining attorneys conduct extensive searches of trademark  registrations or prior art (patents, non-patent literature)  that would legally disqualify the applicant from obtaining  a trademark or a patent. The USPTO currently provides at  least two search tools to support prior art search for patents: Examiner’s Automated Search Tools (EAST) and Web Examiner  Search Tool (WEST).17 These search tools access published  U.S. patent applications, U.S. patents, and some foreign  patent documents, and allow search through Boolean  Retrieval.18 Boolean search provides control and transparency  in searches due to exact match constraints. For trademarks,  examining attorneys similarly perform searches for conflicting  marks and review the written application to determine  eligibility.19 The two search systems (X-Search and Trademark  Electronic Search System (TESS)20) allow examining attorneys  and the broader public to conduct searches for text and  images in pending applications, abandoned applications, and  registered marks.21 TESS is very similar to the Boolean search  system used for patents. It requires examiners to use keywords  for textual marks and to manually look up design search codes  for designs.22 Third, patent examiners determine whether to issue a  patent or to reject the patent based on patentability  requirements such as novelty or non-obviousness. In the  statement of rejection, examiners must include citations  to material prior art and “properly communicate the basis  for a rejection so that the issues can be identified early  and the applicant can be given fair opportunity to reply.”23  Similarly, trademark examining attorneys determine, based  on searches for conflicting marks (based on a likelihood of  confusion assessment), whether the application is eligible for  registration.24 If not, the attorney issues an action including the  grounds for refusal.25 In both cases, examination concludes  either when the application is approved or the applicant  abandons the application. The full examination process can  hence entail rounds of interactions between the examiner and  the applicant. B. Current Challenges As in formal adjudication, the USPTO faces quantity and  quality challenges. First, the agency has a considerable  backlog. In 2018, the average amount of time between a  patent application filing and a first action by the USPTO  (e.g., a rejection or a notice of allowance) was 15.8 months,  0.4 months greater than the target.26 The USPTO “receives  hundreds of thousands of patent applications every year,  and the examiners who process the applications operate  under severe time pressure.”27 The backlog is less severe  for trademarks, with the average first action pendency of  3.4 months.28 Second, the USPTO has engaged in a range  of quality improvement initiatives to reduce, for instance, 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 48patents that are granted but invalidated or patents that  are wrongly denied.29 Patent examiners spend 19 hours on  average per application.30 They “operate under time and other  resource constraints that make it difficult to guarantee the  adequacy of the cited prior art for analyzing patentability.”31 The USPTO’s strategic plan at the end of 2018 included  goals to improve both patent and trademark examination  timeliness and quality.32 The specific objectives to achieve  these goals include increasing international cooperation and  work sharing,33 increasing efficiencies during examination,34  and leveraging machine learning and AI techniques “to benefit  every operational level of the USPTO.”35 II. AI USE CASES We now provide an overview of the use cases the USPTO has  for patent classification, patent prior art search, trademark  classification, and prior trademark search. A. Patent Classification The USPTO classifies new patent applications into CPC codes  using a third-party contractor.36 The contractor appears to  use a human-in-the-loop approach that combines a machine  learning model with human expertise. The supervised  machine learning classifier uses the specification, claims, and  drawings from the application as inputs, and trains on labels  generated by the human experts to learn a mapping from a  patent application to the set of output CPC codes, allowing  them to “streamline the classification decision process and  enhance classification quality.”37 CPC schemes and definitions,  however, can change,38 resulting in a need for the model’s  training data to be re-annotated. In this case, the human  experts continue to process and classify the applications, both  old and new, to provide new labeled data to train the model. B. Patent Prior Art Search Prior art considered by the examiner can include art the  applicant submitted, art received in counterpart applications  in foreign jurisdictions, patent and patent-related literature  found by the examiner, prior public use, and non-patent  literature found through an online search.39 As the examiner  performs the search, she generally records her search history  and tracks her search strategies.40 Existing search methods rely heavily on matching keywords  in the query.41 In one pilot, the USPTO designed an alternate  in-house search tool called “Sigma,” which used a more  complex document annotation pipeline and a more sophisticated search engine using term frequency inverse  document frequency (TF-IDF) scores for retrieving and ranking  documents.42 Yet USPTO never deployed Sigma because it  was found to improve efficiency only for examiners with a  computer science background.43 USPTO never deployed Sigma because  it was found to improve efficiency only  for examiners with a computer science  background. The USPTO has considered other ways of incorporating  machine learning tools into the patent search process. The  agency has discussed plans to build “an AI-based search  platform” that would use content-based recommendation  engines to suggest prior art for a given application.44 In  addition, the agency announced plans to use neural word  embeddings (akin to synonyms) to expand the search  queries “to promote consistency in searching and to more  quickly surface prior art that may be located in any of several  disparate databases.”45 Such models use neural networks  to learn dense vectors for words in a large collection of  documents, such that words appearing in similar contexts  have similar vectors. Synonyms are then generated by  searching for similar words to those in the patent application,  by matching word vectors. Overall, the ultimate goal of  incorporating these machine learning models would be to  provide cost-effective and time-efficient means for providing  the examiner with relevant prior art.46 C. Mark Classification The USPTO has experimented with AI/ML tools to automate  mark classification. Historical practice has been exclusively  manual. After receiving a trademark registration application,  “specially trained Federal employees in the Pre-Examination  section of the USPTO review the mark drawing and assign”  relevant design codes.47 The application includes a written  characterization of design elements in the mark “to assist  the USPTO in making accurate and comprehensive designcoding determinations.”48 After the Pre-Examination section  codes the design elements of the application, an examining  attorney “reviews the mark, the design codes, and the mark  description and may determine whether codes should be 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 49added or deleted.”49 The applicant and the general public then  have the opportunity to suggest changes to design codes for  the application.50 At each of the steps, guidelines specify how  design codes should be selected.51 The experimental AI system aims to suggest trademark  design codes. This supervised classification task uses  images of trademarks as inputs, with an output of the set of  applicable design codes for each image. The deep learning  image classifier was implemented in Google’s TensorFlow  framework,52 consisting of a convolutional neural network  that applies several transformations to an input image,  generating a dense image vector or embedding. These image  embeddings are meant to represent features most useful for  identifying appropriate design codes for the input trademark.  The USPTO has also experimented with a model pre-trained  on a large image database (ImageNet) to use transfer learning  to improve model performance.53 D. Prior Mark Search Because search is a critically important part of the trademark  examination process, the USPTO has also prototyped deep  learning models that could make retrieval more accurate  and efficient. Robust trademark search systems that can  achieve high recall or coverage over existing marks can allow  the examiner to divert efforts from the time-consuming  task of manually searching through tens of thousands of  potentially related marks to substantively determining  whether an application should be allowed. The deep learning  prototype takes as input an image ( e.g., the applied-for  mark) and outputs a list of the most visually similar images  from an existing database.54 The prototype appears to use  an unsupervised approach in which the top matches are  presented as a ranked list of similar trademarks.55 Such a  model is likely pre-trained on data consisting of millions  of images.56 The adoption of deep learning models  into classification and prior art search  holds great promise for improving  the accuracy and efficiency of patent  examination.III. FUTURE TRAJECTORY FOR USPTO A. Improving Patent Examination The adoption of deep learning models into classification  and prior art search holds great promise for improving the  accuracy and efficiency of patent examination. Examiners  grapple with information overflow and evolving or nonstandard terminology,57 and legacy systems have limited  capacity to cover nonpatent literature and foreign language  literature.58 First, deep learning tools could potentially improve patent  classification. In a survey conducted by the U.S. Government  Accountability Office in 2016, 75% of patent examiners  claimed to have encountered misclassified applications.59  Deep learning models can be used to classify each claim  separately and then tag the application using the most  confidently identified codes. Second, neural networks could improve efficiency and quality  of search. Neural networks are used to learn dense vectors for  words appearing in a large collection of documents, such that  vectors of words that appear in similar contexts are located  close together. Using a system that computes similarity in this  vector or embeddings space could allow examiners to search  for claims that are relevant to claims in the application being  examined, regardless of whether they share terms.60 This could  improve recall of the search process, thus ensuring that highly  relevant documents are retrieved. Neural networks could  also allow the use of a single tool to search over all text from  patents, nonpatent literature, and foreign patent literature.  This tool could enable examiners to conduct prior art searches  by simply using entire claims from the application as search  queries, something that patent examiners expressly desire.61 Third, deep learning tools could also be trained to precisely  highlight the passages that make a retrieved document  relevant, and map them to elements of the current  application’s claims.62 Such features—which are far more  sophisticated than the current USPTO search system’s feature  of simply highlighting searched keywords—could drastically  reduce the time spent in trying to determine why a document  is relevant to a particular claim element in the application.  Deep learning tools could also allow examiners to quickly  expand queries with retrieved claims written in a different  style or using different terminology and language. These tools  could also be helpful in decoding relevance of prior art cited  by applicants who often supply excessive references that tend 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 50to slow down examiners.63 Viewing highlighted claims might  also allow examiners to piece together evidence showing the  obviousness of the proposed invention more quickly. Fourth, AI/ML tools may aid in searching foreign-language  literature. Neural machine translation has improved  significantly in the last decade and could be directly  incorporated within the prior art search tool.64 This could serve  as an important step in streamlining the patent examiners’  search process and alleviating time pressures which make it  harder to conduct thorough prior art searches. Fifth, AI/ML may improve work-sharing and office action  drafting. For a particular patent or trademark application,  algorithmic systems could leverage rejections rendered  in other jurisdictions and provide these rejections to the  examiner to determine whether the rejections would be  applicable under U.S. law. Such systems could use style  transfer tools and sequence transduction models to map  specific reasoning in office actions issued in counterpart  foreign applications to specific rejections under U.S. patent  law. In addition, ML methods could determine which  rejections from previous office actions the applicant has  properly addressed and which rejections the applicant has  not properly addressed, and then populate a draft office  action template for the examiner. Last, improvements may be seen in dynamically updating  models for improved generalizability. While the classification  and search systems may have efficiency advantages in  most cases, they may fall short in other cases. For example,  for patent applications on newer subject matters where  inventors are just developing new patentable technologies,  an examiner using the prior art search system may be unable  to find relevant prior art. Indeed, “[t]o the extent that the AIassisted search used by the Patent Office does not account for  potentially rapid change in the average skill of practitioners  itself spurred by AI, it will fall short.”65 As is the case with  the SSA, active (or online) learning methods may improve  generalizability. B. Trademark Examination Deep learning models for image classification and prior  trademark search may also significantly improve the  trademarking process. Yet performance of the tools piloted so  far has been suboptimal due to several problems, including  class imbalance, duplicate images, and text identification.66First, AI/ML may aid in determining the specific goods and  services classification for prior uses. The scope of a trademark  depends on the specific goods and services that it is used to  sell, and prior use of similar marks used to sell similar goods  and services would also lead to a rejection.67 For searches of  prior use, the USPTO could use ML to additionally search for  similarity in the goods and services space. Second, because trademarks can often consist of more  than one element, a mark may not be easily sorted into a  single category. Design code classification accounts for this  by assigning multiple codes to a single mark, with a code  assigned to each design element of the mark. The image  classification model could be augmented to first identify each  design element and then classify each element into a design  code class. Using object detection as a first step may also aid  in identifying text in an image. Text elements are not assigned  design codes but can still prove to be useful during both  classification and search processes. Once all the objects have  been identified, a classifier can determine which of the objects  contain text before recognizing and generating the specific  characters and words contained in the image.68 This text can  serve as useful metadata for the trademark, particularly during  the search for similar marks. IV. IMPLICATIONS: THE CHALLENGES FOR AI IN   INFORMAL ADJUDICATION We now highlight some legal and policy implications  presented by the USPTO case study. First, as the USPTO increasingly incorporates AI into its  examination process, its results and decisions may be harder  to decipher, potentially putting the agency in conflict with  administrative law’s demand for explainability.69 To be sure,  the effect on applicants’ procedural rights is likely minimal.  Because a human examiner ultimately reviews the factual  record and prepares the reasoning for a decision on an  application, AI systems at the USPTO likely would not violate  legal due process rights of applicants or their rights under the  Administrative Procedure Act (APA). When the USPTO chooses  to reject a patent application or a trademark application,  under section 555(e) of the APA, the USPTO generally must  give a brief statement of the grounds for denial.70 But with  respect to classification and search, the APA does not  necessarily impose a specific requirement on the reasoning  that the USPTO must provide for the specific classification of  an application or for the specific search results.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 51Even so, explainability remains a normative goal.71 Internal  due process that supports the explainability of examination  ensures both quality and efficient examination. The  USPTO has set forth guidelines affirming the importance  of explainability in patent and trademark examination. For  prior art searches, the USPTO has specific guidelines for  recording search data “to provide a complete, accurate, and  uniform record of what has been searched and considered  by the examiner for each application,”72 explaining that the  record “is of importance to anyone evaluating the strength  and validity of a patent, particularly if the patent is involved  in litigation.”73 Specifically, USPTO guidelines require that an  examiner provide search results as well as notes indicative of  the nature of the search conducted.74 Similarly, for trademark  examination, the file wrapper includes search histories that  specify the key word terms used by the examining attorney in  her searches for prior trademark registration applications. The  USPTO explicitly refers to this information as being “helpful for  internal review,”75 facilitating supervision and work-sharing. As more of the classification and  search functions migrate to AI-assisted  systems, the USPTO will need to  consider how to maintain existing forms  of internal due process. AI-based systems may undercut such internal process,  as search notes would become increasingly less useful. A  supervisory patent examiner would be able to extract little  information on the efficacy of a junior patent examiner from  simply looking at search notes. In addition, search notes  for an application would have less generalizable value for  both U.S. and non-U.S. examiners conducting searches on  related applications. Examiners for continuation or divisional  applications, applications with similar inventorship, or  counterpart foreign applications would not be able to easily  revise their search strategies based on the search notes. These  examiners, at best, could use the search results. Furthermore,  the applicant would not be able to easily discern the specific  types of prior art that the search system scanned to find the  output prior art results. As more of the classification and search functions migrate to AI-assisted systems, the USPTO  will need to consider how to maintain existing forms of  internal due process. Second, piloting AI use cases may trigger resistance by  examiners and their union representatives. The Patent Office  Professional Association represents both examiners and  classifiers,76 and the National Treasury Employees Union,  Chapter 245, represents trademark examining attorneys.77  And, at least on the patent side, the union is “relatively  powerful.”78 While unions “should not, in principle, necessarily  oppose a tool that would allow more effective search within  the same number of hours,”79 unions may bristle at the  prospect of any reduction in hours for examination,80 potential  employment effects, and tools that lack an intuitive and  accessible user interface.81 Thus, the USPTO must ensure that  AI tools consider the needs of end-users and articulate a clear  vision for AI-assisted examination. Third, applicants may seek to game AI-based methods to  improve their chances of obtaining an allowable patent  or trademark registration application. For example, with  respect to search, applicants could draft patent or trademark  applications such that the search systems do not capture  relevant prior art or relevant registered marks, respectively. In  the context of classification for patents, artificial intelligenceassisted CPC classification could encourage applicants  to draft their applications in a way to achieve a certain  classification such that the USPTO directs the application to  an art unit having more permissive allowance rates.82 Such  gaming behavior could be interpreted to implicate duties and  obligations that practicing patent practitioners and trademark  attorneys have to the USPTO. The agency imposes a duty of  disclosure, candor, and good faith on individuals associated  with filing and prosecuting a patent application, requiring  that such individuals “disclose to the Office all information  known to that individual to be material to patentability.”83  A violation of this duty can raise inequitable conduct issues  during litigation of the patent that could end up invalidating  the entire patent.84 On the trademark side, before the USPTO  begins trademark registration examination, the applicant  must submit a statement under oath that to the best of her  knowledge and belief, no other person has the right to use an  identical or similar mark in commerce that would, when used  in connection with goods of this other person, likely cause  confusion, cause mistake, or deceive.85 Such guidelines may  not yet contemplate knowledge of strategic conduct to avoid 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 52a rejection at the USPTO. To curb such conduct, the USPTO  could promulgate rules clarifying these duties and obligations.  For example, the duties and obligations of applicants to  the USPTO could be clarified to cover strategic conduct like  adversarial learning or 35 U.S.C. § 112 could be used to reject  applications that strategically use terms to fool machine  learning-assisted search algorithms.86 Last, because the USPTO relies on contractors to build out  some tools, the USPTO must carefully manage potential  conflicts of interest. The USPTO “follows the [Federal  Acquisition Regulations] as guidance in [their] acquisition  decisions whenever it is appropriate to do so.”87 These  regulations require contracting officers to “[i]dentify and  evaluate potential organizational conflicts of interest as  early in the acquisition process as possible; and. . . [a]void,  neutralize, or mitigate significant potential conflicts before  contract award.”88 The regulations further specify that  “contracting officers should obtain the advice of counsel  and the assistance of appropriate technical specialists in  evaluating potential conflicts and in developing any necessary  solicitation provisions and contract clauses.”89 As we spell out  in more detail in the Part III of this report, it is unclear how well  such conflicts are managed. * * * * As illustrated by the USPTO example, the potential benefits  of AI/ML in supporting informal adjudication are substantial.  AI-supported tools may empower agency officials to divert  their scarce time and expertise to other important parts of  the informal adjudication process. With respect to trademark  registration and patent examination at the USPTO, trademark  examining attorneys and patent examiners, not their tools,  ensure quality adjudication of trademark and patent rights.  Improved search results can provide the factual basis for  a rejection, but only trademark examining attorneys and  patent examiners have the technical and legal expertise to  determine whether applicants are entitled to intellectual  property rights. AI-assisted systems ensure that examiners  and attorneys can focus their time and efforts on the analysis  necessary to provide reasoned decisions for applicants.  Artificial intelligence systems thus can be valuable tools for  informal adjudication.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 53Regulatory Analysis at the Food and Drug  Administration Virtually all federal agencies issue statements of general applicability explaining how  they expect the public to behave within the agency’s regulatory domain. Agencies often  make such statements by engaging in rulemaking to establish legally binding regulations  pursuant to their Congressionally-delegated authority. Rulemaking, alongside closely  related administrative outputs such as standard-setting and “guidance” documents, are at  the heart of the regulatory work many federal agencies perform. Indeed, the Congressional  Research Service estimates that federal agencies publish between 2,500-4,000 final rules  each year.1 While it is commonly accepted that rulemaking involves a mix of policy  considerations and prudential assessments, rulemaking also routinely involves  complicated technical judgments of a predictive or contingent nature. Federal  agencies have for many years used statistical decision-making techniques to  help make those judgments, but the deployment of AI and machine learning  technologies represents a new level of sophistication. Many agencies have begun  to incorporate AI/ML into their analytic processes, and their use of such techniques  will likely grow more important going forward. This chapter examines the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) piloting of  AI/ML techniques to identify emerging safety concerns in reports made to its  Federal Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). Because preapproval studies  cannot identify all possible side effects or problems with a drug or therapeutic  biological product, the FDA maintains a system of postmarket surveillance and  risk assessment centered on analysis of a growing pool of data about adverse  events and medication error reports.2 The agency uses the results of these analyses  to update rulemaking and guidance, and, on rare occasions, to reevaluate an  approval decision.3 The FDA has publicly discussed the FAERS pilot projects since  at least 2017.4 This case study is informed by our review of publicly available  documents, as supplemented by interviews with key FDA officials. We present the FAERS pilot projects as illustrative of federal agencies’ growing  interest in the use of AI/ML to analyze data relevant to rulemaking, standardsetting, and guidance. The FAERS projects likewise highlight the critical need— shared across nearly all federal agencies—to develop internal technical capacity,  a topic explored in more detail in Part III. This technical capacity is not only  important so that agencies can leverage data in crafting and promulgating rules  and regulations, but is also necessary as agencies increasingly regulate the use  of AI-powered products and services using agencies’ conventional, non-AI-based  regulatory instruments.KEY TAKEAWAYS  FDA has piloted NLP-based engines  for postmarket surveillance of  drugs and medical devices based on  adverse event reports that contain  substantial freeform text.  Such tools have played a role  in facilitating a shift from  premarket approval to postmarket  surveillance.  AI/ML-based tools for adverse  events can help to prioritize which  reports should receive attention,  but have been less successful  when they verge on attempting to  make causal inferences based on  unrepresentative data.  Agencies should consider collecting  “structured data” in the first  instance, rather than building  out NLP-based tools to extract  structured data from unstructured  text.  FDA has invested significant  resources to develop AI capacity,  with benefits extending beyond  regulatory analysis.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 54That said, the FAERS pilots also underscore the challenges  agencies face in leveraging growing streams of data in  performing regulatory analysis. AI can address some—but not  all—of these challenges. To be sure, the FDA is in the vanguard  among agencies in its experimentation with advanced AI/ ML techniques, including “deep learning” approaches, to  meet those challenges.5 And the agency’s FAERS work, while  plainly less sophisticated than other FDA efforts, is part of that  work and, in addition, sits at the center of a significant policy  challenge as the FDA contemplates shifting its regulatory focus  from premarket approval to postmarket surveillance efforts.  But focusing on FAERS also makes sense because it highlights  a key lesson about the possibilities and limits of algorithmic  governance tools used in regulatory analysis: While useful,  predictive analytics cannot substitute for conventional  principles of causal inference.6 I. THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION The FDA oversees products that represent over $2.5 trillion in  annual consumption, or about 20% of household spending  in the United States.7 This vast regulatory scope means that  even limited use of AI/ML tools by the FDA have a substantial  impact on public welfare. The primary statutory authority governing the FDA is the 1938  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its amendments.8  Under the FDCA, the FDA is tasked with ensuring the safety  of food, drugs, medical devices, and cosmetics. While the  FDA has expansive rulemaking authority,9 it has employed  guidance documents as its primary means of policymaking for  the last several decades.10 In addition to guidance documents,  the FDA uses “warning letters” to communicate directly with  firms and to make criminal referrals.11 The FDA has several  additional enforcement mechanisms at its disposal, including  recalls, license suspensions, and product seizures.12 Together,  these varied regulatory options assist the FDA in fulfilling  its statutory mandate despite being a relatively resourceconstrained agency.13 Beyond rulemaking and guidance, the FDA also uses a mix of  premarket approval and postmarket surveillance methods to  ensure the safety of drugs and medical devices. The core of  the premarket approval process for brand-name prescription  drugs is the New Drug Application (“NDA”) process.14 The NDA  process requires that drug manufacturers submit evidence  from clinical trials that is sufficient to demonstrate that a  drug is safe and effective for its intended use.15 For generic  prescription drugs, the drug manufacturer may submit a  streamlined Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”), which, in lieu of clinical trial evidence, presents evidence that  is sufficient to show that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to  an already approved brand-name drug.16 For medical devices,  the FDCA mandates that the FDA classify all medical devices  by risk and administer the Premarket Approval (“PMA”) and  premarket notification (“510(k)”) processes.17 It also authorizes  the FDA to ban devices if necessary.18 To a certain degree, this  device approval process mirrors the drug approval one—with  the stringent PMA pathway mirroring the NDA pathway and  the streamlined 510(k) pathway mirroring the ANDA pathway. The FDA also conducts extensive postmarket surveillance,  collecting and monitoring millions of adverse event reports.19  The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007  (“FDAAA”) expanded the FDA’s postmarket (post-approval)  authority. Passed in the wake of several reports excoriating the  FDA’s lackluster postmarket surveillance efforts,20 the FDAAA  empowers the FDA to “require a drug sponsor to conduct  post-approval studies or new clinical trials at any time after  approval of a new drug application if FDA becomes aware  of new safety information, . . . to require labeling changes  to disclose new safety information, . . . and to require ‘risk  evaluation and management strategies’[.]”21 The expansion  of the FDA’s regulatory authority and resources into the  post-approval regulation and surveillance realm reflects a  significant agency shift in emphasis fueled by technological  innovation and big data.22 For several years, the FDA has been investing in human  capital in the AI space. Starting in 2017, Dr. Bakul Patel,  the Associate Director for Digital Health at FDA’s Center for  Devices and Radiological Health, hired “13 engineers— software developers, AI experts, cloud computing whizzes—to  prepare his agency to regulate a future in which healthcare  is increasingly mediated by machines.”23 The FDA also  announced the creation of an Entrepreneur-in-Residence  program in 2017 as part of its Digital Health Innovation  Action Plan.24 In the FDA’s 2019 budget proposal, former  Commissioner Scott Gottlieb requested roughly $70 million  from Congress to fund a center with significant implications  for AI.25 Gottlieb explained that “the agency would create  a Center of Excellence on Digital Health to establish more  efficient regulatory paradigms, build new capacity to  evaluate and recognize third-party certifiers, and support a  cybersecurity unit to complement the advances in softwarebased devices.”26 According to Gottlieb, AI “holds enormous  promise for the future of medicine.”27 Under his leadership,  the FDA began work in “the field of radiogenomics, where AI  algorithms can be taught to correlate features on a PET or 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 55MRI scan with the genomic features of tumors.”28 Moreover,  the FDA “is exploring the use of a neutral third party [to]  collect large annotated imaging data sets for purposes of  understanding the performance of a novel AI algorithm for a  proposed indication.”29 II. AI USE CASE Beginning in 2016, the FDA has experimented with AI/ML  techniques to analyze data to assist the agency in detecting  and addressing adverse drug events brought to its attention  through its postmarket surveillance regime. In particular, the  agency has sought to develop innovative, AI-based methods  to parse the millions of text-based reports of adverse events  that flow into the agency’s FAERS database. A. The FAERS Database The FAERS database is one of several databases the FDA  maintains to assist in its postmarket surveillance activities.30  FAERS contains “adverse event reports, medication error  reports and product quality complaints resulting in adverse  events that were submitted to FDA.”31 Information in the  FAERS database comes from two sources: Patients, caregivers,  and healthcare professionals voluntarily submit information  to “FDA MedWatch” (5% of all reports), and manufacturers  are required to submit information to the FDA (95% of all  reports).32 FAERS is useful for the FDA’s postmarket surveillance regime  given the breadth of the information it captures. Submission  does not require demonstrating causation ( i.e., there is no  need for the submitter to show that the adverse event was,  in fact, caused by the drug), so the database casts a wide  net.33 Likewise, FAERS reports include information that is  unlikely to be captured via clinical trials ( e.g., off-label uses,  co-morbidities, or long-durational use).34 The database  contains a considerable quantity of information: According  to the FDA, over 1.81 million reports were submitted in 2017  alone.35 FAERS is not, however, without its disadvantages.  The database’s utility is somewhat limited by duplicative  reports, reports of variable quality and completeness, and  unverified data.36 Given the sheer volume of data contained  in FAERS, and the varied types of data—both structured and  unstructured—the FDA has sought more efficient ways to  extract and use this information. B. NLP for Adverse Event Detection Details of two pilot FDA efforts demonstrate the potential of  using a combination of text mining and NLP to parse adverse  event reports and identify emerging safety concerns.One of the FDA’s pilot efforts experimented with NLP  techniques to convert the large amounts of unstructured data  flowing into FAERS into structured data and then to model  relationships between drugs and a single medical condition,  hepatic ( i.e., liver) failure.37 FDA analysts first retrieved data of  FAERS hepatic failure reports from November 1997 to March  2018.38 Each report included structured information regarding  the patient’s age group, the report type (direct/expedited/ non-expedited), the seriousness of the condition (serious/ non-serious), and one or more reported outcomes (such  as death, disabled, and required intervention).39 Analysts   then used a range of techniques to identify important  textual cues associated with adverse drug events.40 First, the  project applied text mining41 and topic modeling42 to identify  important information contained within the materials and  to map associations between terms or topics.43 For instance,  the models found a strong association between the terms  “hepatic failure” and “death.”44 Second, analysts experimented  with text-based rules, decision trees using text clustering  inputs, and a simple neural network to predict serious drugrelated adverse outcomes. The decision tree performed best  in predicting a serious outcome in FAERS cases, with a true  positive rate of 91% ( i.e., correctly predicted adverse events)  and a false positive rate of 4.9% ( i.e., non-adverse events  incorrectly predicted as adverse).45 A second pilot effort mounted by FDA scientists and  researchers from Stanford University used similar techniques  but adopted a subtly different analytic tack.46 The team  employed three FDA safety evaluators to label a sample of  reports on modified World Health Organization–Uppsala  Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) criteria for drug causality  assessment. They then used structured features and expertderived terms from unstructured text ( e.g. “drug interaction”)  to predict these ground truth labels. They trained (regularized)  logistic regression, random forest, and support vector  machine models and then constructed a rank-ordering  of reports based on their probability of containing policyrelevant information about safety concerns. They showed that  such a ranking could help prioritize review by FDA evaluators,  although there was still considerable predictive uncertainty.47  Much like the SEC’s enforcement tools or the SSA’s caseclustering tool profiled above, the tool can be thought of as  performing a kind of triage to better target scarce agency  resource rather than displacing human assessments.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 56III. FUTURE TRAJECTORY OF AI AT THE FDA The FDA’s FAERS efforts have been successful, to an extent.  The liver-focused project uncovered some previously  undetected relationships between hepatic failure and drugs,  particularly drug combinations.48 It also showed some  promise in distinguishing between predictors of the degree  of hepatic failure from serious and less serious events.49 The  second of the two efforts profiled above also demonstrated  potential. The approach identified six data features that can  actionably guide the FDA’s analysis of reports going forward.50  The tool, as the FDA and Stanford data scientists noted, can  serve as “the foundation” of a system that better economizes  on scarce agency resources in identifying emerging  postmarket safety concerns. But the pilots also reveal numerous challenges. The main one  was the difficulty of uncovering causal relationships between  drugs and hepatic failure using predictive analytics given the  available data. By definition, most or all of the FAERS data  consists of adverse events, meaning the models are selecting  on a negative outcome. Without knowing baseline drug usage  within the population, it remains challenging to infer which  drugs cause hepatic failure. These causal inference challenges are exacerbated by the use  of NLP methods on unstructured data. NLP algorithms are  continually improving. However, as NLP technology currently  stands, without some expert input, it may not be well-suited  to critical tasks in which inaccurate predictions could have  severe life-or-death consequences. NLP’s shortcomings are  almost certain to be magnified in an environment where the  text is both unstructured and highly technical and where  precision and expertise are at an absolute premium.51 While  the pilot project served as a useful “proof of concept,”52 FDA  officials conceded that it was not fully successful as it did not  generate outputs accurate enough for deployment.53 The  second pilot might hence be a more promising deployment of  ML with FAERS data to prioritize how reports are processed.54 The future trajectory of these projects remains uncertain, and  FDA officials continue to discuss the current and future role  for NLP and alternatives at the agency.55 The FDA may be at a  crossroads with respect to whether it continues to use NLP to  handle unstructured data, or whether it instead restructures its  data collection. FDA officials at the Center for Drug Evaluation  and Research (CDER) maintain that there is substantial value in using NLP to understand the FDA’s large volume of existing  structured and unstructured data. Some advocate exporting  NLP applications to other domains, including the vaccine  adverse event reporting system (VAERS), which contains  “information on unverified reports of adverse events (illnesses,  health problems and/or symptoms) following immunization  with U.S.-licensed vaccines.”56 A different path would instead have the FDA focus on requiring  regulated entities to submit fit-for-purpose, structured data  to the FDA in the first instance, thus obviating the need for  NLP techniques to mine unstructured data.57 NLP and other  machine learning tools could then be used down the road to  analyze patterns and generate usable predictions. Given that  the FDA collects enormous amounts of data annually, it may  make sense to require industry to alter its data submissions  since highly functional NLP capable of analyzing largely  unstructured data may not be developed for some time. The  FDA will need to consider how best to harness the data the  agency receives, as that could substantially further its ability  to employ AI/ML both now and in the future. In the FDA’s case, uptake of AI/ML  tools may herald a broader shift away  from premarket approval and toward  postmarket surveillance efforts.  IV. IMPLICATIONS: THE FUTURE OF AI-DRIVEN  REGULATORY ANALYSIS The FDA’s FAERS pilot projects provide valuable lessons for  other administrative agencies, especially regarding (i) the  potential power of new algorithmic tools to shift regulatory  paradigms (in the FDA’s case, potentially facilitating a shift  from premarket approval to postmarket surveillance); and  (ii) the multiple ways in which internal technical capacity can  advance the missions of safety-focused agencies like the FDA,  particularly by augmenting their ability to regulate AI-based  products and services using conventional regulatory tools. We  discuss each of these in turn.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 57A. AI and Shifting Regulatory Paradigms: From   Premarket Approval to Postmarket Surveillance The FAERS NLP pilot projects illustrate how increased use of  AI/ML tools may precipitate or accelerate shifts in agencies’  regulatory paradigms. In the FDA’s case, uptake of AI/ML tools  may herald a broader shift away from premarket approval and  toward postmarket surveillance efforts. Although the FDA historically de-prioritized its postmarket  surveillance activities, the FDA’s leadership—following  congressional mandate—has made it a higher priority over  the past decade.58 This shift toward postmarket surveillance  is critical given that clinical trials (which are the basis for exante premarket approval of drugs) can mask, or fail to reveal,  serious issues attendant to a drug. Clinical trials are limited  by a relatively small n, relatively brief durations, and selection  bias among the patients selected for study.59 Thus, the FDA  must monitor drugs (and devices) after they have been  approved to ensure safety and efficacy for all patients.60 According to the FDA, its increased attention focused on  postmarket surveillance is beginning to bear fruit.61 The AI  revolution could facilitate and dramatically improve such  postmarket surveillance. AI/ML tools will make it easier for the  agency to capture and mine large quantities of postmarket  data. Proliferating use of AI may also render postmarket  surveillance practically necessary—for instance, where  certain new devices incorporate AI/ML tools that change over  time.62 The use of AI/ML tools can potentially be beneficial  beyond ensuring the safety and efficacy of a particular drug or  device. As former Commissioner Gottlieb noted: “Traditional  postmarket studies typically require years to design and  complete and cost millions of dollars.” By encouraging  collection and analysis of “real world data” and “real world  evidence” and developing the analytic tools and techniques  necessary to use it, the FDA “may be able to provide patients  and providers with important answers much sooner by  potentially identifying a broader range of safety signals more  quickly.”63 B. Building Multi-Purpose Technical Capacity The FDA’s FAERS pilot projects also demonstrate how  developing internal AI-based technical capacity will serve  multiple agency missions, particularly at safety-related  agencies. At the FDA, internal technical capacity appears  to be paying dividends beyond the use of AI/ML for  regulatory analysis.Developing internal AI-based   technical capacity will serve multiple  agency missions. First, internal technical capacity will be increasingly important  as the agency applies its conventional regulatory tools—for  instance, approval decisions, as well as issuance of rules  and guidance—to the growing set of AI-based products and  services offered by regulated parties. Concrete examples  abound. The FDA recently gave marketing clearance to  several medical devices that incorporate AI: Viz.AI64 detects  strokes, OsteoDetect65 recognizes bone fractures, and IDx-DR66  identifies diabetic retinopathy. These devices went through  the FDA’s de novo review process, an alternative pathway  for “novel devices of low to moderate risk” to gain approval  to “be marketed and used as predicates for future 510(k)  submissions.”67 In its market authorization of Viz.AI, the FDA  specified that it is “creating a regulatory framework for [clinical  decision support] products that encourages developers  to create, adapt and expand the functionalities of their  software to aid providers in diagnosing and treating diseases  and conditions.”68 The FDA cleared each of these devices  for marketing on the basis of similar criteria: performing  better than the existing baseline, often a human medical  professional.69 The FDA’s market authorization of these AI-devices and its  recent release of a discussion paper on its plans to regulate AI/ ML-based software as a medical device70 suggest that the FDA  aims to move quickly on the AI/ML front. The FDA also recently  provided additional guidance as part of its Digital Health  Innovation Action Plan to give “more clarity on [its] risk-based  approach to digital health products.”71 However, the AI-devices  that the FDA has cleared for marketing with de novo review  represent a small swath of the future of potential AI-devices.  To date, the reviewed devices have been “locked,” in that they  “don’t continually adapt and are dependent on updates from  the manufacturer, which can include training the algorithms  with new data to improve their performance.”72 But, as former  FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb noted, “[T]here’s a great  deal of promise beyond locked algorithms that’s ripe for  application in the health care space.”73 Regulating AI-devices  will grow increasingly complicated as medical devices  incorporate AI that dynamically updates in the future.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 58Second, internal technical capacity empowers agencies like  the FDA to make smart investments in data infrastructure  as building blocks to make effective use of AI/ML tools  going forward. The FDA’s Information Exchange and Data  Transformation (INFORMED) illustrates how internal technical  capacity can shape data infrastructure.74 INFORMED is an  oncology data science initiative, motivated in large part by  the perception that the FDA was not capitalizing on the data it  collects.75 Although ostensibly oncology-focused, INFORMED’s  goals appear to be broader. INFORMED acts as “a sandbox,”  wherein the FDA pairs “new talent such as entrepreneursin-residence, engineers, and data scientists with subject  matter experts such as oncologists at the FDA,”76 in order to  expand the organization’s capacity for big data analytics.77  INFORMED emphasizes “data sharing and the creation of new  data assets,”78 as well as “opportunities for machine learning  and artificial intelligence to improve existing practices.”79 The  group is currently working on several projects, including some  with other public and private entities.80 In addition, internal technical capacity appears to be helping  the FDA collect real-world data. For example, the National  Evaluation System for health Technology (“NEST”) was  designed to “help improve the quality of real-world evidence  that FDA can use to detect emerging safety signals quickly and  take appropriate actions.”81 The MyStudies App82 was built  to “foster the collection of real world evidence via patients’  mobile devices” in a way that is both useful to manufacturers  and “compliant with the FDA’s regulations and guidance for  data authenticity, integrity and confidentiality.”83 In sum, while the specific FAERS NLP applications may for  the moment have limited utility, FDA’s AI investments have  generated a range of innovative efforts within the agency. * * * * While many challenges lie ahead, NLP-based regulatory  analysis promises to transform the work of the FDA and other  agencies in the years ahead. For NLP tools to be successful,  it is imperative that the FDA and other agencies cultivate  internal technical capacity—both to leverage a dizzying array  of data and to better regulate new AI products and services.  Moreover, as agencies like the FDA become more reliant on  AI, they will likely have more time and tools to devote to tasks  that were once cumbersome and costly, shifting agencies’  regulatory paradigms in the long run.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 59Public Engagement at the Federal   Communications Commission and Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau Administrative agencies increasingly use AI/ML tools to engage with and provide services  directly to citizens. These engagements include “customer service” interactions, such as  applying for a passport, a license, or benefits.1 They also include interactions facilitated by  “civic tech” applications,2 such as open data portals and chatbots.3 Where successful, such  tools can streamline and improve the quality of diverse interactions between the public  and government.  This chapter explores the use of AI/ML to streamline two related forms of  citizen engagement: notice and comment rulemaking and complaint review.  We begin with a brief overview of the growth of notice and comment in the digital  age. We then examine how AI/ML was used to analyze comments during the  Federal Communications Commission’s (FCC) Net Neutrality rulemaking, as well  as how the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has used NLP to process  consumer complaints. We conclude by discussing the broader legal implications of  deploying AI/ML in these contexts. I. THE GROWTH OF COMMENTS IN RULEMAKING Federal agencies publish between 2,500-4,000 final rules each year.4 Most use  the interagency website Regulations.gov to coordinate the notice and comment  process. The back-end system undergirding Regulations.gov allows agencies to  track, review, and publicly re-post comments to Regulations.gov so that other  interested parties are able to view what has been submitted.5 Although the system  can sort and group comments based on some basic criteria, it does not deploy ML. Online platforms have lowered the cost of participation and agencies across the  federal government are experiencing an overall increase in public comments  to proposed rules.6 Under the APA, agencies must give “interested persons”  an opportunity to comment “through submission of written data, views, or  arguments.”7 Most comment periods typically range from thirty to sixty days.8  Executive Order 12,866 requires that interested persons have at least sixty days  to comment on “significant rules,”9 after which agencies must disclose any  information they have relied on in drafting a final rule.10 These requirements—a  “safeguard against arbitrary decision-making”— are critical to insulating rules from  legal challenge.11 Failure to comply with APA requirements can spark litigation,  especially in the case of major or controversial rules.12 The internet has also led to mega-participation , in which regulators have begun  to receive an unprecedented quantity of comments from a wider array of  stakeholders.13 Where a proposed rule garners widespread attention because of  media coverage or organized efforts to mobilize the public, agencies often receive KEY TAKEAWAYS  With the availability of online  portals, many agencies have  grappled with the sharp rise in  volume of complaints or comments  submitted in notice-and-comment  rulemaking.  Sentiment analysis, topic modeling,  and information retrieval can  be useful tools for agencies to  process comments and complaints  submitted by citizens.  As with Regulations.gov, such tools  may be useful across a wide range  of agencies, raising the question  of how to coordinate interagency  efforts.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 60comments that––however relevant in principle––may be  poorly suited for analysis by the coterie of agency staff who  normally tend to the notice and comment process. Even  when the majority of comments come from lawyers and  sophisticated technical experts, the detailed information they  contain can challenge and sometimes overwhelm agency  capacity. AI/ML tools might help federal agencies respond to  this high volume of information.14 For instance, AI/ML tools  can help to identify duplicates and form letters, summarize  overall comment sentiment, and identify relevant comments  that could save significant resources and enhance the quality  of the rulemaking process. Recent years have seen tremendous  advances in NLP tools that could  streamline agency processing and  analysis of public comments. II. AI USE CASES At a high level, the core technical task agencies face in the  notice-and-comment process is large-scale textual analysis.  Recent years have seen tremendous advances in NLP tools  that could streamline agency processing and analysis of  public comments. Agencies and private-sector actors have  become more interested in using technical tools to assist  in the notice and comment process, but many potential  solutions remain at the prototype stage.15 While some  agencies are working with third-party organizations to  develop scalable tools, these tools have yet to be integrated  into internal agency processes.16 This chapter considers AI/ ML comment analysis by reference to one of the first—and  most public—use cases: the Net Neutrality rulemaking at the  FCC. We then consider analogous use cases by the Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau for complaint processing. A. FCC’s Net Neutrality Proceeding In June 2014, late-night comedian John Oliver released a  viral monologue critiquing the FCC’s proposed net neutrality  regulation and encouraging viewers comment on the  proposed rule.17 In response, nearly 3.7 million comments  flooded the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) website.18 In May 2017, in response to another round  of net neutrality rulemaking, Oliver yet again urged his  viewers to comment on the FCC’s proposed rollback of  the prior regulation. He directed his viewers to a link titled  “GoFCCYourself” that in turn redirected to the official FCC  rulemaking webpage.19 The agency’s site was again deluged  with comments that overwhelmed the agency’s servers.20 Over  twenty million comments were ultimately submitted on the  proposed rollback.21 A significant number of these comments  (1) included false or misleading personal information, (2) were  part of an organized grassroots or “astroturfing” campaign, or  (3) were submitted at exactly the same time.22 An independent  study found that as many as two million of the comments  were “fake.”23 Broadband for America engaged the consulting firm Emprata  to analyze these comments using a range of basic NLP tools.24  As we do not have access to a government-commissioned  report, the Emprata report provides one illustration of how  NLP might be used to analyze a large volume of comments. A  key component of Emprata’s work was a sentiment analysis  of submitted comments in order to extract their most salient  features. Sentiment analysis is an especially challenging  problem for NLP . Human language constructs often rely on  contrasting sentences ( e.g., “I hate this agency but this rule  is not bad!”) or sarcasm ( e.g., “Rescinding net neutrality is  a great idea. Let’s return to the Stone Age, too”).25 Heuristic  approaches ( e.g., assigning a sentiment score to each word  in a sentence) and simple NLP models ( e.g., so-called “bagof-words” approaches that disregard word ordering and  grammar26) tend to be less effective at such extraction,27  although neural networks are more promising.28 When it analyzed the comments the FCC received, Emprata  found that only 8% of the more than 21 million comments  were unique, and “[t]he top 10 and 100 most prevalent  comments accounted for 66% and 89% of the total comments,  respectively.”29 To measure overall comment sentiment,  Emprata “employed a hybrid text mining approach consisting  of (1) manual sentiment assignment, (2) keyword/phrase  matching, and (3) natural language processing (NLP).”30 This  tiered approach enabled Emprata to first manually assign the  500 most prevalent comments into groups based on whether  they supported or opposed the proposed rule.31 The firm then  used simple keyword and phrase matching rules to assign the  majority of the remaining comments to a group, validating  the results by manually verifying a random sample.32 Emprata 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 61applied machine learning only to the final 1% of comments,  using NLP classification.33 “After multiple iterations, the NLP  model reached an overall accuracy of 95.2%,”34 although it  was more successful at classifying comments against repeal  rather than for repeal.35 Pure sentiment analysis may prove insufficient, however,  when dealing with the kinds of mass-generated comments  that begin with a common template and replace sentences  with semantically identical but reworded content. This might  occur when an advocacy organization sends a form letter to  its members and requests that they edit it before submission.  Bots can use this strategy at scale to generate large amounts  of technically unique yet semantically similar comments.36  Previously-uncovered bot comments, such as comments on  the FCC’s net neutrality rule, appear to stem from a simple  generative process that starts from a template comment and  randomly replaces words with synonyms or entire sentences  with semantically identical phrasings.37 This process, when  applied at scale, is detectable using comment de-duplication  and clustering techniques.38 But as bot-generated comments  become increasingly similar to human-written comments,39  agencies must exercise caution. Even humans often use  similar generative processes as part of common masscommenting efforts coordinated by advocacy organizations.40  The Electronic Frontier Foundation, for example, published  a “DearFCC” automated comment-generator for use by  concerned citizens.41 Such tools may generate outputs that  resemble bot-generated comments. The FCC uses an online comment submission system similar  to Regulations.gov, which allows users to enter demographic  data that the agency does not verify at any stage in the  process.42 In its overall sentiment analysis, Emprata “did not  eliminate or discount comments that seemed artificially  generated, duplicated, or submitted by actors who may have  intended to influence the final sentiment tally.”43 Nor did  it remove multiple comments from the same submitter.44  Because it could not verify any comments, Emprata found  it “very difficult to draw any definitive conclusions” without  assuming some subset of the data was “real.”45 It did, however,  find that controlling for the data discrepancies it discovered  would have supported the opposite conclusion: The majority  of unique, American comments favored  repealing net  neutrality protections.46 To analyze comment authenticity, Emprata first conducted a rudimentary data scrubbing, marking indecipherable  comments (such as those that contained random characters)  and comments submitted with incomplete or indecipherable  demographic information. Emprata also validated the  addresses of 65% of the comments using a geocoding  service.47Although the FCC had received “significantly more  unique/non-form letter comments” against  repealing net  neutrality,48 a large percentage of those comments came from  “email domains associated with FakeMailGenerator.com” or  other unverifiable email sources.49 Comments against repeal  also included “[e]ssentially all international comments,” 50 and  “[t]he majority of duplicative comments” submitted using the  same address or email.51 Controlling for these discrepancies  would have thus led Emprata to the opposite conclusion in  its sentiment analysis. For these reasons, Emprata found that  its pure sentiment analysis was perhaps telling the wrong  story by overcounting duplicate, inauthentic, or bot-generated  comments. B. CFPB’s Reliance on NLP We can develop a further sense of the potential use of NLP  in citizen engagement by considering how the CFPB has  deployed such tools in processing consumer complaints. To balance the unprecedented scale  of consumer complaints relative to  the CFPB’s resources and personnel  capacity, the agency deploys NLP to  automatically analyze text to categorize  narratives, identify trends, and predict  consumer harm. As a consumer financial protection agency, the CFPB has  received more than 1.5 million consumer complaints since  it was established in July 2011.52 Processing, prioritizing,  and responding to the thousands of consumer complaints  submitted weekly is the CFPB’s main regulatory and  administrative challenge. To balance the unprecedented scale  of consumer complaints relative to the CFPB’s resources and  personnel capacity, the agency deploys NLP to automatically  analyze text to categorize narratives, identify trends, and 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 62predict consumer harm.53 The CFPB’s NLP tool augments its  platform for processing complaints (the “Consumer Response  System”), and the agency’s strategic plan and budget report in  March 2014 reveals that the CFPB is investing annually ($10.7M  in 2014, $8.1M in 2015) to develop this system.54 The Bureau makes publicly available all complaints in its  Consumer Complaint Database, which removes personally  identifiable information (PII) then shares the allegations to  encourage consumer awareness of potential and repeat  violators.55 This public database discloses the company  name, financial product and sub-product, details of the issue,  and whether there was a timely response by the company.56  Consumer narratives are coded by the nature of the issue  and corresponding financial product, such as “incorrect  information on [a] credit report,” which is regulated in part  by the CFPB through the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The CFPB  maintains the Consumer Complaint Database with the caveat  that the agency does not verify all the facts alleged in the  complaints. However, the tool provides an opportunity for  the companies to publicly respond to complaints and publish  their resolution, which minimizes the enforcement tasks  of CFPB. Although the CFPB does not publish full technical details,  it appears to use NLP for two primary purposes. First, the  Bureau uses software to scrub PII from the Consumer  Complaint Database. The first step of the scrubbing process  is done by automated software. Two further steps include  separate reviews by a trained human reviewer and a quality  assurance specialist to further ensure that the data has been  effectively de-identified.57 Given that this is a three-stage  process—with two of the steps being controlled by human  readers—the scrubbing process appears to be very thorough.  The computer-generated scrubbing makes use of open-source  part-of-speech tagging software to determine which parts of  the speech are pronouns, verbs, etc.58 Such de-identification  may be a way to ensure authentication of submissions while  protecting the privacy of submitters in notice-and-comment. Second, the CFPB is deploying contextual NLP tools to  categorize complaints via topic modeling. The agency uses  an off-the-shelf Structured Topic Model59 (STM) that builds  on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).60 Such topic modeling  may enable agencies to quickly build typologies of the types  of comments submitted. Coupled with anomaly detection,  such NLP techniques could facilitate the retrieval of relevant  comments more efficiently.III. FUTURE TRAJECTORY OF AI TOOLS FOR COMMENT  AND COMPLAINT ANALYSIS Given the resource-intensive nature of the comment and  complaint analysis process, agencies have a strong incentive  to build AI/ML comment analysis tools. Some agencies, such  as the Department of Health and Human Services, have  database management systems that can run rudimentary  comment de-duplication or grouping, while others outsource  this work to contractors.61 The Wage and Hour division of the  Department of Labor, for example, has relied on a private  contractor to help sort through comments and identify  those that may warrant further attention from the agency.62  Still other agencies, however, rely on manual labor to sort,  process, and respond to comments.63 Given these expensive  investments in comment analysis, the long-term savings of  an AI/ML notice-and-comment tool are likely to outweigh  development and adoption costs, particularly for agencies  such as the EPA and FCC, which have continued to see a  rise in comments.64 Despite the fact that agencies face common challenges with  complaint submissions and notice and comment, developing  an efficient, widely applicable interagency AI/ML tools  requires overcoming a collective action problem. The history  of Regulations.gov illustrates this concern. Regulations.gov  was launched in 2003 by the EPA and later shared with other  agencies.65 While these latter agencies benefitted from the  site’s user interface and comment storage functions, agencies  had little incentive to contribute when the EPA, which still  maintains Regulations.gov, hired consultants to upgrade the  site’s capabilities.66 Meanwhile, some agencies, such as the  FCC and FEC, maintain their own independent notice-andcomment sites.67 Hence, while it may be most efficient for  agencies to pool their technical and financial resources to  develop an effective set of tools built upon a broad dataset, it  is more likely that an agency facing an especially burdensome  notice and comment process will have to take on the burden  and then share the tool over time, as the EPA did with  Regulations.gov. IV. IMPLICATIONS AI/ML comment analysis sits at the center of growing debate  about the legitimacy of the rulemaking process. For the  moment, Regulations.gov—the platform used for most  federal notice and comment processes—merely requires that  users complete an optional web form with basic identifying  information. Even users who indicate they are submitting a 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 63comment on behalf of a third party can, but are not required  to, disclose the name of the third-party. Given these minimal  requirements, some proposed rules are flooded with botgenerated comments as well as comments that use fake  names or that impersonate prominent public figures (possibly  written by humans or bots).68 The problem of bot-generated  and inauthentic comments may well worsen with time. Automated comment analysis can help mitigate these  problems, but its use also raises a host of further concerns.  First, bots can generate mass comments intended to persuade  an agency of a particular approach to a proposed rule, but  they can also be deployed to intentionally overwhelm an  agency’s capacity to respond to genuine, human-submitted  comments. Where bots aim only to overwhelm an agency,  use of automated comment analysis to identify and filter  out perceived bot comments should be uncontroversial.  Identifying and filtering out bot comments ensures that  human voices are not drowned out. However, where bots  are used in an effort to shape an agency’s decision-making,  the rationale for using automated comment analysis is more  complicated. One reason is that bots can blur the distinction  between grassroots campaigns ( i.e., political mobilizations  reflecting authentic mass concern and consensus on an issue)  and astroturfing ( i.e., elite-funded campaigns designed to  create an appearance of mass concern where there is none).  Bot-generated comments of the latter sort can over-represent  the level of genuine concern because they can be deployed  by a single actor. That said, the line between grassroots  mobilizations is a blurry one.69 Moreover, it is at least possible  that bots can provide useful information to regulators ( e.g.,  using a knowledge base to automate the submission of  relevant information). If the purpose of rulemaking is to  sharpen an agency’s analysis, one might argue that even  bot-generated comments should be welcomed.70 Finally,  even where there is consensus on the need to filter out botgenerated comments, calibration can be challenging. An  overinclusive filtering tool might reduce the risk of removing  human-generated comments but increase the risk of allowing  undetected bot-generated comments to color the debate. An  underinclusive tool, on the other hand, might reduce the risk  of allowing too many bots to drown out human-generated  comments at the risk of erroneously marking some human  commenters as bots.Second, in addition to ensuring that relevant and valuable  comments do not slip through the cracks, agencies must  be especially attuned to any systematic reasons why a tool  might be overlooking particular comments or information.  To be effective, any such tool must first be trained using  representative data. This might be especially hard in the  context of comments because materiality may vary across  language patterns. An NLP tool might fare much worse on  comments that use colloquial language or sarcasm, or that  contain certain grammatical or spelling mistakes. This may  disparately impact certain members of the general public,  whose substantive comments could be ignored because they  use language the tool mischaracterizes or fails to recognize.  An agency which fails to consider a material comment  because an AI/ML tool mistakenly categorizes it as immaterial  would likely run afoul of the APA’s requirement to “consider  . . . relevant matter”71 and address such comments in the  statement of basis and purpose. An agency that systematically   fails to consider comments from specific groups might further  raise equal protection concerns. Such a concern is especially  important in the case of discrimination on the basis of race  or gender where government actions must meet a higher  standard of scrutiny.72 Systematically ignoring comments  based on race, gender, or even education level also risks  undermining public confidence in AI/ML tools.73 Third, contractor relationships may pose unique conflicts of  interest in the notice and comment space. Agencies often hire  third-party entities, which also advise private-sector clients  on commenting campaigns, to build better comment analysis  tools. Potential cross-pollination between the private lobbying  and government consulting arms of these organizations raises  concerns about the integrity of the process. For example,  in 2017, consulting firm CQ Roll Call worked directly with  the FCC to upload its clients’ bulk comments into the FCC  comment processing system.74 More generally, FiscalNote  works with government agencies while simultaneously  providing “Issues Management” tools to make it easier for  private organizations to track regulatory changes and submit  comments on proposed rules.75 Consultants might be able to  monetize their access to the inner workings of agency notice  and comment systems by advising clients on how to carefully  draft comments in order to achieve the desired agency  classification and avoid being filtered out by an algorithm. 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 64They may also charge a premium for this “insider” expertise,  disadvantaging stakeholders who do not hire their services. * * * * While still in their early stages, AI/ML tools may assist  agencies with notice and comment analysis and complaint  processing—a key function of democratic decisionmaking—even in the age of mega-participation. Doing so  while maintaining fidelity to legal requirements may require  thinking through difficult normative questions. Agencies  willing to do so may be able to transparently design an  effective yet inclusive tool that enhances public participation  in the rulemaking process.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 65Autonomous Vehicles for Mail Delivery at the   United States Postal Service The prior chapter examined how AI can change individuals’ interactions with government  agencies. The two examples in that chapter — comment and complaint submissions —  both concerned the relatively straightforward application of AI to massive text databases  to improve efficiency of processing, responsiveness, and analysis. In this chapter, we  examine a less intuitive AI application that will also alter interactions with the government:  autonomous vehicles currently being developed by the U.S. Postal Service for mail and  parcel delivery. In many ways, autonomous vehicle navigation is unique among AI applications  examined in this report. Like many agencies, the Postal Service proposes to use AI  to improve and streamline its services. And like individuals who submit complaints  to the CFPB or comments to the FCC, individual Postal Service customers will  engage with AI technology to varying degrees in the course of their interactions  with the agency. But anyone who shares the road with autonomous delivery  vehicles or walks alongside will also interact with the technology and be affected  by its data collection and analysis. As a physical, mobile manifestation of AI,  autonomous vehicle technology thus holds distinct legal implications for the  Postal Service and other agencies that adopt it in their vehicle fleets. I. UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE The Postal Service handles close to half of the world’s total mail volume: In 2018 it  delivered 146 billion pieces of mail to 159 million delivery addresses.1 For much of  the rural United States, the Postal Service is the only postal delivery option. And,  unlike many federal agencies, the Postal Service enjoys favorable public opinion,  with three out of four Gallup poll respondents indicating the agency does an  excellent or good job.2 By statute, the Postal Service has a broad role and mandate, often called the  “universal service obligation” (USO): The Postal Service shall have as its basic function the obligation  to provide postal services to bind the Nation together through the  personal, educational, literary, and business correspondence of the  people. It shall provide prompt, reliable, and efficient services to  patrons in all areas and shall render postal services to all communities.3 The agency must also provide “a maximum degree of effective and regular postal  services” to urban and rural communities alike.4 Since the Postal Service is selffinanced, Congress granted it monopolies over both letter delivery and mailbox  delivery as a means of fulfilling its broad mandate.5KEY TAKEAWAYS  The Postal Service has prototyped  autonomous vehicles for rural  delivery routes, enabling drivers  to sort mail while the vehicle is  driving along the route, and longhaul trucking.  The Postal Service anticipates  autonomous vehicles will improve  productivity and save money on  overtime, fuel, and costs associated  with collisions.  Government agencies considering  adopting autonomous vehicles will  face an uncertain regulatory future  on such issues as tort liability and  data privacy.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 66Despite its popularity, the Postal Service has struggled with  declining revenues and climbing operating costs. It has been  in a budget shortfall for more than a decade, recording net  losses of $3.9 billion in FY20186 and more than $69 billion in  cumulative losses since FY2007.7 Relevant contributing factors  include the shift to digital correspondence; related shifts in  consumer demand from less labor-intensive services like  mail delivery to more labor-intensive services like package  shipping; statutory restrictions on pricing for many services  and products; and competition from private entities like UPS  and FedEx.8 As revenues have declined, the Postal Service’s labor and  operating costs have continued to rise. Personnel costs,  which account for about 76% of Postal Service expenses,9 are  projected to increase along with demand for labor-intensive  package deliveries.10 A growing shortage of long-haul truck  drivers, in particular, has driven up labor costs.11 Much of the  agency’s aging delivery vehicle fleet was acquired as far back  as 1987, such that the Postal Service incurs high maintenance  costs—about $4,500 per vehicle each year12 across a fleet of  more than 232,000 vehicles.13 The Postal Service also has to  budget around rising (and often unstable) fuel costs14 and the  cost of traffic accidents. Postal vehicles were involved in nearly  30,000 accidents in FY2018,15 and 11 postal workers were killed  in roadway accidents in 2017.16 The Postal Service paid about  $67 million in FY2016 in repair and tort costs related to motor  vehicle accidents.17 In light of its uncertain financial status, the Postal Service has  been designated a “high-risk” agency by the GAO since 2009.18  A presidential Task Force recently recommended several  dramatic changes, including ending collective bargaining for  Postal Service workers and lifting certain price caps.19 II. AI USE CASE To combat some of these challenges, the Postal Service has  begun developing autonomous delivery and hauling of mail  and parcels. The Postal Service has been testing AI  applications for transporting mail and  parcels since 2014. In general, autonomous vehicles navigate via an onboard  computer, which uses AI to interpret data from mounted  sensors—typically a combination of cameras, radar, and  lidar.20 The computer’s AI is trained on driving techniques  using data captured from human drivers responding to  audiovisual cues on the road. The vehicle’s computer  combines sensor data with detailed digital maps that indicate  road layouts, speed limits, the location of traffic signs, and  other information relevant to navigation. Some complex  autonomous vehicle systems exchange data with nearby  cars to coordinate driving patterns. Depending on their level  of sophistication, autonomous vehicles may request or  require a human driver to remain on standby to intervene in  circumstances.21 The Postal Service has been testing AI applications for  transporting mail and parcels since 2014.22 It currently has  two pilot-phase projects: autonomous delivery vehicles and  autonomous long-haul trucks. The Postal Service also recently  issued a Request for Proposal for a third potential application,  unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),23 but this chapter focuses  on road vehicles since these pilot projects are closer to  operational deployment.24 The first Postal Service application of autonomous vehicles  is for “last mile” delivery— i.e., delivery of mail and parcel  to endpoint addresses. In 2017, the agency issued a grant  to a robotics laboratory at the University of Michigan to  develop a prototype autonomous vehicle for rural delivery  routes, the Autonomous Rural Delivery Vehicle (ARDV).25 The  Postal Service determined rural routes were appropriate  for testing autonomous technology because they are less  congested and have fewer sensor inputs than urban or  suburban roads. Under its agreement with the University  of Michigan, researchers engineered the ARDV to carry  a human postal carrier, rather than conduct the entire  delivery process autonomously: The ARDV drives along the  route, and the carrier sorts mail between stops and delivers  through the window. As designed, the carrier also drives  the ARDV manually from the post office to the beginning of  the route and manually crosses intersections. The study,  which completed in 2018, simulated real world delivery  environments on a facility test track but did not test the ARDV  in the field.26 In February 2019, the Postal Service issued a Request  for Information along similar lines to the ARDV for an 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 67“autonomous delivery vehicle that will allow delivery of mail  and parcels to curbside mailboxes from the right side of the  vehicle” and that “enable[s] the operator to sort and organize  mail while the vehicle autonomously drives between delivery  points/mailboxes.”27 As of this writing, the Postal Service is  reviewing both the University of Michigan project test results  and the RFI responses and indicates it will identify next steps  based on the results and responses received.28 The Postal Service’s second AI application is autonomous  long-haul trucking. In May 2019, the agency partnered with  TuSimple, a self-driving truck company, for a pilot program  that hauled USPS trailers between facilities in Phoenix,  Arizona and Dallas, Texas,29 a trip of more than 1,000 miles  each way.30 The pilot study involved five roundtrips, each of  which took approximately 22 hours, less than half the typical  time of 48 hours required for human drivers, including stops  for rest.31 As with the ARDV, human drivers remained on  board for the duration of the pilot. According to TuSimple,  all deliveries during the two-week pilot were made ahead  of schedule and without any traffic incidents.32 As with the  delivery vehicle projects, the Postal Service indicated it is  reviewing the long-haul pilot results and will identify next  steps in the near future.33 As the Postal Service pursued the above applications, it  also conducted opinion research to understand the public’s  perception of self-driving postal vehicles.34 In an April 2017  nationwide online survey, the agency’s OIG sought to “gauge  public perception of driverless technology” for both of the  above applications, including “the overall appeal of the  technology, the believability of claims about its potential  benefits, the public’s expected timeframe for implementation,  and many of their potential concerns.” At a high level, the  survey results indicated that the public, while highly aware of  self-driving cars generally, has only a “shallow awareness” of  their potential application for postal delivery.35 Once informed  of the concept, a large majority indicated they believed  autonomous delivery vehicles would be deployed in the  near future, but many expressed skepticism about both the  potential benefits and safety of autonomous delivery vehicles.  Young and urban respondents were more amenable than  older and rural respondents, as were those who were already  aware of the concept of self-driving postal vehicles.36 Less favorably, the survey indicated the public may not trust  the Postal Service to lead on autonomous delivery. Asked to rank which of four organizations — the Postal Service,  Amazon, FedEx, and UPS — they trusted most to successfully  deploy autonomous vehicle technology, respondents ranked  the Postal Service last.37 The OIG cautioned that the Postal  Service must monitor public opinion as part of its deployment  strategy, and not just “the usual feasibility assessments.”38 The Postal Service will need to coordinate with the  relevant postal worker labor unions as it develops and  deploys autonomous delivery vehicles. The status of such  coordination is unclear. In late 2018, the president of  the National Association of Letter Carriers (NALC), which  represents city delivery letter carriers, said the union needed  to keep careful watch on autonomous delivery vehicles and  other technologies.39 As of 2018, the Postal Service planned to  bring in union representatives to review the ARDV prototype  “to discuss some of the human/machine interaction issues  and craft employee training guidelines,” 40 but the agency did  not say whether this consultation took place.41 The National  Rural Letter Carriers’ Association (NRLCA), which represents  rural letter carriers, indicated the Postal Service did not  reach out to the NRLCA about the ARDV project.42 The Postal  Service did, however, notify the NALC of its February 2019  RFI.43 Following the TuSimple long-haul pilot, the American  Postal Workers Union called on members to submit concerns  to the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and called  for testing ”at least as stringent as the requirements for a  professional driver operating commercial vehicles on the  streets with our families and the public at risk.”44 III. FUTURE TRAJECTORY OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES   IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE Manufacturers are racing to bring automated vehicle  navigation to public roadways for a variety of purposes,  from personal transportation to shipping and delivery. And,  based on its investment to date in the technology, the Postal  Service seems highly committed to integrating autonomous  technology into its delivery model.45 It remains to be seen,  however, what form such technologies will take and on what  timeline they will be rolled out. Various levels of automated navigation are already on the  road. Certain personal vehicles have an “autopilot” or similar  feature.46 Current systems require human drivers to remain  ready to intervene, but manufacturers are actively pursuing  full self-driving functionality.47 Shipping vehicle manufacturers  and delivery companies themselves are also aggressively 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 68pursuing automated navigation. Amazon and FedEx have both  invested in autonomous vehicle navigation startups.48 UPS has  partnered with TuSimple, the Postal Service’s partner in the  autonomous hauling study, on daily tests of automated longhaul trucks on Arizona highways.49 TuSimple aims to eliminate  the need for “fail-safe” human drivers by 2021.50 The precise trajectory of autonomous vehicle navigation will  depend on how the fragmented regulatory regime evolves.  At the federal level, the National Highway Traffic Safety  Administration has endorsed the technology’s potential to  decrease traffic-related injuries and deaths.51 But many states  have not yet enacted laws about automated vehicles, and  those that have vary widely.52 IV. IMPLICATIONS: LEGAL AND POLICY LESSONS FOR  AUTONOMOUS DRIVING TECHNOLOGY Even in this early stage, the Postal Service’s exploration  of autonomous driving technology contains lessons for  successful development of government AI applications.  Many of these implications flow from the distinctive  nature of autonomous vehicles as a physical, public-facing  manifestation of AI. There is not yet a comprehensive federal regulatory  framework for autonomous vehicles, so the full legal  implications of the technology remain unclear. Two bills  stalled in the Senate last session,53 but legislators are  currently working on a new bill — the Senate Commerce and  House Energy and Commerce committees circulated a joint  discussion draft in October 2019.54 The Senate Commerce  Committee held a hearing on autonomous vehicle regulation  in November 2019.55 State legislatures have also been active  on the topic.56 So far, the primary focus of Congress and state  legislatures has been how to regulate the manufacture of  autonomous vehicles, rather than their use. The Postal Service, which operates  one of the largest vehicle fleets in the  country and delivers nationwide, must  engage with this debate over reshaping  tort liability regimes.The most immediate legal implication relates to the Postal  Service’s tort liability for vehicle accidents. Although  automated vehicles are predicted to reduce accident  frequency, they will not eliminate collisions. There is debate  about how liability should be determined for collisions  involving automated vehicles, particularly in the early stages  of deployment.57 Although the discussion draft of the current  federal bill does not address liability,58 its predecessor bills  both contained explicit provisions that left common law  liability undisturbed.59 Some commentators advocate shifting  liability from the individual operator to manufacturers or  suppliers as an extension of products liability law. Relatedly,  some have advocated tying tort liability to compliance with  federal regulatory standards instead of state law.60 The Postal  Service, which operates one of the largest vehicle fleets in  the country and delivers nationwide, must engage with this  debate over reshaping tort liability regimes, including perhaps  to advocate for adoption of federal standards. The second potential legal implication concerns data  ownership and privacy.61 Autonomous vehicles collect and  analyze enormous amounts of data about the surrounding  environment, including about nearby vehicles and even  pedestrians. As with liability, the Postal Service’s legal  obligations with respect to data collected by its autonomous  vehicles will vary depending on how regulations take shape.  The current discussion draft of the federal bill does not  address data privacy,62 but its predecessor bills would have  ordered studies into how data collected by autonomous  vehicles should be processed and safeguarded63 and would  have required manufacturers to disclose both the types of  information their systems collect and how that information  is used.64 Some have called on Congress to include a  provision granting exclusive ownership over any data  collected by an autonomous vehicle to the vehicle’s owner.65  At least one state legislature has considered a similar data  ownership provision.66 In addition to any obligations deriving from autonomous  vehicle regulations, the Postal Service may have obligations  under the Privacy Act of 197467 for data collected by its  autonomous vehicles.68 Since the Privacy Act applies broadly  to “information about any individual ” that is maintained  collected, used, or disseminated by a government agency,69  its application depends on the extent to which Postal  Service autonomous vehicles collect data that is individually  
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 69identifiable, particularly individualized location information.  This, in turn, depends on the deployed technology: Systems  that use lidar, for example, or other sensors that capture  the relative proximity of a vehicle, pedestrian, etc., but do  not capture any identifying information (such as faces or  license plates) are less likely to trigger the Privacy Act.70 By  contrast, systems that use cameras or other sensors to collect  information about individual vehicles or people are more  likely to qualify as collecting “individual” information subject  to Privacy Act obligations.71 Autonomous vehicle systems that  communicate directly with adjacent vehicles may also trigger  Privacy Act obligations.72 In addition to legal implications, there are a number of policy  and practical implications to deploying autonomous vehicles.  The agency has explicitly addressed the potential benefits  and costs of deploying autonomous vehicle technology  in a comprehensive OIG report.73 On the benefits side, the  report highlights improved safety and lower accident rates  projected to accompany autonomous technology generally,74  which, in turn, would save the Postal Service money on both  tort liability and vehicle repairs. The agency anticipates cost  savings on fuel as well, given projections that autonomous  vehicles will generally decrease traffic congestion (and thus  improve fuel economy).75 The Postal Service also anticipates  autonomous driving applications will increase delivery  carriers’ labor productivity by freeing up carriers to sort  mail and do other tasks while the vehicle drives between  addresses, and thus decrease expensive overtime.76 Similarly,  using autonomous vehicles for long-haul trucking would  likely ease contract expenses that come with the truck driver  shortage, since autonomous shipping would decrease (or  potentially eliminate) the need for such drivers.77 Finally, the  OIG report suggests autonomous vehicles would be good  for the agency’s brand and likelihood of being “viewed as an  innovative company.”78 The potential benefits of autonomous vehicles are closely  tied to their potential downsides. First, as the Postal Service  recognized in the OIG report, are the long-term labor  implications. Although the agency’s current plan is to use AI  to assist human mail carriers, it is not difficult to imagine the  next step of eliminating mail carriers entirely, particularly if  technology becomes sophisticated enough to eliminate the  need for human drivers. This possibility poses both political  and practical difficulties for deployment. Employees and  their labor unions may be hesitant to accept the technology even at an early stage, and customers may not like the  possibility of fully autonomous postal services. As the OIG  report summarized, “a machine does not easily replace the  institutional knowledge, judgement, and human contact that  carriers can provide.” The negative labor impact on contracted  truck drivers is likely to be more immediate. * * * * In sum, autonomous vehicles will remake not only American  roads, but also the day-to-day work of the administrative  state. Done well, the advent of autonomous vehicles will  make the work of agencies like the U.S. Postal Service both  safer and more efficient. But, if rolled out poorly, this new  technology threatens to displace the labor force, exacerbate  ongoing data privacy concerns, and collide with existing legal  regimes. Careful attention to these risks is necessary as federal  agencies and the private sector plow ahead on developing  and deploying autonomous vehicle technology.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 70Part III. Implications and Recommendations Part I offered an overview of how 142 of the most significant federal agencies are currently  using AI/ML. Part II dove deeper into a select set of use cases, highlighting the many  complexities that attend AI adoption by the administrative state. This Part steps back  and, cutting across the full set of use cases, focuses on the policy and legal issues raised  by agency use of AI tools. More specifically, we describe the challenges that lie ahead for  agencies seeking to develop and deploy AI/ML tools, and where possible, recommend  how to mitigate them. We focus on six major implications: (1) the challenges of building AI  capacity in the public sector, including data infrastructure, human capital, and regulatory  barriers; (2) the difficulties inherent in promoting transparency and accountability; (3) the  potential for unwanted bias and disparate impact; (4) potential risks to hearing rights and  due process; (5) risks and responses associated with gaming and adversarial learning; and  (6) the role of contracting for supplementing agency technical expertise and capacity.1
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 71Building Internal Capacity No agency can effectively deliver on its mission without access to the people, infrastructure,  and organizational resources necessary to understand and respond to its environment. As  policymakers and civil servants increasingly seek to rely on AI and algorithmic governance,  a core challenge for agencies is how to generate the necessary technical capacity—the  ability to identify, develop, responsibly use, and maintain complex technical solutions.  Our report suggests that building internal capacity, rather than simply embracing a default  practice of contracting out for technical capacity, will be crucial to realizing algorithmic  governance’s promise and avoiding its perils. The literature on government capacity building generally boils  down to the “make-or-buy” decision.2 An agency can make   the goods and services needed to perform governance tasks  by hiring personnel and building its own infrastructure, or it  can buy them through the procurement process.3 In theory,  the private sector has greater expertise and can produce at  lower cost.4 In practice, however, procurement has downsides.  For “hard” or “commodity” goods and services, where  quality is easily measured and tasks involve little discretion,  government can fully capture private sector expertise and  efficiencies. By contrast, “soft” or “custom” ones—where  monitoring quality is more difficult and tasks involve more  discretion—invite corner-cutting by contractors that degrade  quality.5 Contracting out makes more sense for police cars  than for police officers. Realizing the full potential of  algorithmic governance tools will thus  often require internal capacity.  These generalizations are coarse but useful. Certain  components of algorithmic governance tools appear  suitable  for procurement. U pgrading computer systems  and consolidating databases, for instance, are more likely  to be standard services.6 In other ways, however, AI poses  heightened capacity-building challenges for agencies. For  example, a private sector contractor’s software engineers  often will not have a nuanced understanding of the problems a given algorithm tool is aimed to address or the legal,  regulatory, and organizational environment within which the  tool will operate. Realizing the full potential of algorithmic  governance tools will thus often require internal capacity.  We describe the potential pitfalls of relying on external  contractors, and explicitly compare the pros and cons of  internal and external sourcing of AI tools, in a separate section  below on “External Sourcing.” Focusing on internal capacity building, we here address four  main considerations. First, agencies will need to invest in  their technical and data infrastructure. In most cases this will  require not only hardware and software upgrades but also  collecting, standardizing, and securing the data required  to deploy AI tools. Second, agencies will need to cultivate  in-house human capital to produce AI tools that are not  only usable at the technical level but also compliant at the  legal and policy levels. Third, agencies will need to invest in  comprehensive and flexible AI strategies that allow agencies  to learn strategically from failures  and evolve. For agencies  developing their own AI tools, this means creating iterative  development and evaluation processes with clear success  metrics. For agencies that regulate private sector AI, these  strategies may include regulatory “sandboxes” to develop and  enforce standards  not just for present applications but also  for future ones.  Finally, in-house design and deployment can  enhance public accountability and transparency. I. BUILDING TECHNICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND DATA  CAPACITY Because AI tools require complex software packages and  computing power to process large datasets, agencies may  have to upgrade legacy systems or integrate new systems 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 72with old ones.7 This is a challenge for agencies that excel, as  one agency official facetiously put it, at “having the latest  technology of the last decade.”8 By one estimate, SSA has over  14 petabytes of data, but data is stored in roughly 200 separate  databases. Linking, cleaning, and merging such data remains  an ongoing process. Most of SSA’s supporting applications  remain written in outdated (COBOL) programming language,  stemming from initial development some 30 years ago. SSA  is in a process of updating these applications into more  modern languages, but such modernization is resource  intensive, requiring, for instance, personnel trained in different  generations of languages.9 Since all AI tools—whether supervised or unsupervised—are  data-hungry, agencies must also invest in the necessary  input data. Investing in data capacity requires addressing  the interrelated challenges of data collection , data  standardization , and data security . A. Data collection  Deploying AI tools requires collecting the right data and  enough of it. But before collecting data at scale, agencies  may need to clarify their statutory and regulatory authority. A  far-flung statutory fabric, including constitutional provisions,  federal, state, and local laws, defines government duties and  obligations around data and includes transparency statutes  such as the federal Freedom of Information Act and state  law equivalents. At the federal level, the Privacy Act and  amendments provide the closest to a comprehensive scheme  for information practices.10 Among other things, agencies  must, where possible, obtain data from individuals and may  not use data for secondary purposes without consent.11 The  law also significantly constrains the government’s ability to  knit together datasets across agencies.12 Other pillars of the  federal regime include the Paperwork Reduction Act, which  constrains an agency’s ability to collect new data from the  public,13 and t he Information Quality Act, which constrains  agencies’ ability to open-source data holdings to achieve  transparency.14  Agencies may also face data collection limitations due to lack  of specific authority. For example, NHTSA’s enforcement and  vehicle safety research divisions seek to use AI/ML to model  historical crash data for simulated testing of automated  vehicles. But NHTSA may currently lack authority to compel  manufacturers to produce crash data.15 The agency’s voluntary  data collection mechanism16 captures only a fraction of the  vast data that manufacturers generate.17Data collection poses related logistical challenges for agencies  that rely on third-party data. Third-party data may be hard  to obtain, incomplete, or unrepresentative due to selective  or inaccurate reporting.18 For example, pharmaceutical  companies may not want to share the most comprehensive  clinical trial data on which the FDA could train its AI/ML.19 At  present, agencies like NHTSA and the FDA are encouraging  third parties to voluntarily provide data. B. Data standardization To be of any use, data must be in an appropriate format.  Different types of AI tools require different levels of data  standardization, but standardization can pose significant  barriers to virtually any AI deployment. As detailed in Part II,  an alternative path at the FDA is to defer the agency’s NLP  projects until it can obtain standardized, fit-for-purpose data.  Some standardization issues arise from the data storage  or submission medium. The IRS, for example, continues to  process paper-filed tax returns that often contain missing  information.20 Even digital data may not be standardized. The  SSA, as another example, processes unstructured digital text,  such as paragraphs describing disability circumstances and  non-uniform medical records maintained in PDF files. The  SEC, too, struggles to compare companies in its centralized  CIRA system because companies can use varying semantic  tags or use incorrect tags.21 Many agencies face a trade-off  between data depth and uniformity.22 In addressing data  standardization challenges, agencies must consider which  data they are willing to standardize and at what stage: at  the collection phase—by “outsourcing” standardization to  regulated entities—or at the processing phase by developing  advanced tools that can standardize unstructured data. C. Data security Data often comes with security requirements. The Federal  Information Security Management Act, for example, requires  agencies to develop data security programs, breach  notification policies, and disposal routines,23 and then  subjects them to civil suits for failures.24 Building data capacity  requires agencies to address these requirements, typically by  developing strict internal guidelines for the use and sharing  of data that contains personal information. Agencies should  also leverage technology to reconcile data sharing needs  with data privacy concerns. Researchers at the Department  of Veterans Affairs, for example, used cryptographic hashes to  obscure lab results and other sensitive data in its partnership  with Alphabet’s DeepMind unit.25 An official at the IRS similarly 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 73proposed employing Generative Adversarial Networks  (GANs),26 and the CFTC proposed anonymizing data to enable  collaboration with market participants.27 II. BUILDING INTERNAL STAFF CAPACITY An agency’s AI tools must be both usable and compliant. As to  usability, optimal design and deployment will often depend  on a deep understanding of the problem an algorithmic tool  seeks to solve, an ability to convince skeptical agency staff to  utilize the tool, and a user-friendly interface that eases that  pitch. And as to compliance, algorithmic tools themselves  encode legal and policy choices, some of which will be subject  to judicial review.28 Software engineers, especially those  outside the agency, may lack the insights or training necessary  to faithfully translate law into code. While in-house production  may strain project budgets and introduce recruitment  challenges, building internal staff capacity may yield tools that  are better tailored to the relevant task and legal requirements. Several agencies have already demonstrated the value of  embedded expertise. As detailed in Part II, the SSA developed  NLP tools to identify potential errors in draft disability  determinations as a result of a multi-year strategy to hire and  then repurpose lawyers with technical skillsets. 29 This strategy  helped facilitate an iterative design process in which system  architects could readily work back and forth between code  choices and legal, policy, and organizational considerations.  The Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) development of  algorithmic enforcement tools similarly illustrate the value of  in-house, embedded expertise in automating tasks that are  inherently dynamic. As Part II’s case study of the SEC noted,  enforcement agencies must engage in continuous, iterative  updating of their AI tools as enforcers unearth new modes of  wrongdoing .30 Federal agencies seeking to build internal technical capacity  must grapple with budgetary and other human resource  constraints. In addition to overall budget caps, civil service  laws capping allowable salaries can price government  agencies out of the technical labor markets. Agencies can  offer job stability and work-life balance, whereas technology  companies incentivize talent by offering competitive salaries  or stock options. The Competitive Service hiring process also  constrains recruitment,31 although the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) has taken steps to ease hiring burdens for  technical positions, including by establishing a “data scientist”  classification.32 OPM also recently established a government-wide “direct hire” appointing authority for a variety of STEM  positions and for all IT positions for agencies that can  demonstrate “the existence of a severe shortage of candidates  or critical hiring need.”33 III. INVESTING IN AI STRATEGY AND “SANDBOXES” Deploying AI technology requires agencies to invest in  comprehensive strategies to test, evaluate, update, and  retire AI tools. An important part of this strategic process is  articulating metrics for measuring the success of innovations  that align with the agency’s risk-profile and level of  comfort with failure. Agencies should also develop testing  “sandboxes” that allow for failure and iterative evaluation  of new governance tools and, for agencies that regulate  private-sector AI, a testing infrastructure that can help guide  regulated entities. A. Evaluation metrics In advance of deployment, agencies should develop metrics  for measuring the success of AI tools. These evaluation  metrics should be tied to the agency’s broader mission, rather  than focused purely on efficiency or return on investment.34  Correspondingly, agencies should establish a process for  “returning to the drawing board” when tools fail to satisfy  these metrics. Given the dynamic nature of AI/ML models,  these metrics should also guide subsequent evaluations and  decisions about when to refine or retire a given tool.35 Frontline enforcers may provide ongoing feedback on models.36 B. “Sandbox” testing and regulatory infrastructures To build technical capacity, agencies will likely have to  develop a comfort level with technological failure—and  this may be easier for some agencies than for others.37  Agencies like the FDA must maintain a relatively low risk  tolerance: Failing to detect adverse postmarket effects of a  pharmaceutical can have critical public health consequences.  By contrast, the IRS has continued to experiment with  technology despite low accuracy rates.38 Risk-taking is crucial to developing successful tools, and  agencies seeking to employ AI must be willing to fail.39 As  many agencies found, initial efforts and failures create a  “supersized sandbox”—a playground for developing future  AI applications and learning important lessons. Agencies  should structure projects to allow some margin of error and  treat failures not as losses but as opportunities to share  lessons across the agency.40 Although it began over twenty 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 74years ago, the IRS’s Compliance Data Warehouse established  a foundation that is enabling the agency to consider more  complex AI applications moving forward.41 Similarly, agencies that regulate AI deployments in the  private sector should also build regulatory “sandboxes.”  For example, at the FDA, “INFORMED has created a unique  sandbox for networking, ideation and sharing of technical and  organizational resources, empowering project teams with the  tools needed to succeed in developing novel data science  solutions.”42 These sandboxes, moreover, can signal minimum  standards for AI and help regulated entities “de-risk” their  development decisions. The proliferation of guidance and  reports can also serve this goal. In the context of cybersecurity,  the FDA has provided some guidance on what the agency  expects to see in premarket submissions, including certain  specific design features and cybersecurity design controls.43  Recent approval of several AI-included devices along with  the release of a discussion paper on its plans to regulate AI/ ML-based software as a medical device,44 serve to provide  additional guidance to manufacturers. Further, the FDA, in  conjunction with MITRE, released a report entitled Medical  Device Cybersecurity: Regional Incident Preparedness and  Response Playbook.45 The FDA explained that the report  can serve ”as a customizable tool for health care delivery  organizations to aid in their preparedness and response  activities for medical device cyber incidents.”46 IV. LINKING CAPACITY TO ACCOUNTABILITY Building internal expertise and technical capacity may also be  essential to accountability and building trust.47 The scholarly  literature may be moving away from individual, privately  enforced rights as the best way to achieve accountability  in favor of “accountability by design.”48 Kroll et al. offer  a catalog of tools that engineers can incorporate into  algorithmic systems to facilitate evaluation and testing.49 This  “accountability by design” trend links to longstanding calls  among administrative law scholars for agencies to develop an “internal law of administration” distinct from—and often more  effective than—externally imposed accountability.50 However,  some agencies are more likely than others to incorporate  accountability and transparency by design—with agencies  such as the FDA and NHTSA being more incentivized, given  that both are subject to a high potential of judicial review and  public scrutiny.Building internal expertise and  technical capacity may also be essential  to accountability and building trust.  
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 75Transparency and Accountability Administrative law—the mix of constitutional and statutory law that governs how  agencies do their work—is premised on transparency, accountability, and reason-giving.51  When government takes action that affects rights, it must explain why. Yet many of the  algorithmic tools that federal agencies use to make and support public decisions are not,  by their structure, fully explainable.52 The challenge is how to craft concrete legal and  regulatory mechanisms for algorithmic tools that meaningfully fulfill transparency values  and ensure fidelity to the agency’s legislative mandate and other legal commitments ( e.g.,  non-arbitrariness, non-discrimination, privacy). I. BRIDGING TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY Subjecting algorithmic decision systems to meaningful  accountability poses two main challenges: achieving  transparency into a tool’s workings, and then selecting the  best regulatory mechanism for translating that information  into desired compliance. The gold standard of transparency in any decision-making  context is a full account of a decision’s “provenance,”  including its inputs, outputs, and the main factors that drove  it.53 The problem, as Part II noted, is that machine learning  models are often inscrutable. Even a system’s engineers may  not understand how it arrived at a particular result or be able  to isolate the data features that drove the model’s prediction.  Algorithmic outputs are also often nonintuitive in that the data  relationships they surface may not map to any common-sense  understanding of how the world works. Even full disclosure  of a system’s source code and data and an opportunity to  observe its operation “in the wild” will not necessarily facilitate  either insight or accountability.54 Two approaches to transparency have begun to emerge in  response to these concerns. One camp focuses on how to mix  modes of explanation to achieve desired transparency. For  instance, an incomplete accounting of a particular decision  can be supplemented by a “system-level” accounting of the  tool that made it,55 including data descriptions,56 modeling  choices,57 and general descriptions of factors that drive the  model’s predictions.58 A second camp advocates simplification  of models to make them more parseable.59 These measures  might take the form of a ceiling on the number of data features used or outright bans on particular tools ( e.g., facial  recognition) or particular models, such as powerful “deep  learning” techniques that generate more accurate predictions  but are often less interpretable.60 Even where AI systems can be made transparent, there  remains the challenge of choosing regulatory mechanisms  that can translate that transparency into meaningful  accountability. Here regulatory architects have numerous  options. They can choose mechanisms that promote legal  accountability ( e.g., judicial review of agency action) or  political accountability ( e.g., public ventilation through notice  and comment or mandatory agency-conducted “impact  assessments”61). They can also opt for “hard” rules ( e.g.,  prohibitions on certain models, a licensing or certification  requirement prior to use akin to FDA drug approvals, or  liability rules that allow injured parties to recover damages),  “soft” rules ( e.g., impact assessments designed to ventilate  concerns about algorithmic tools but confer no substantive  rights),62 or something in between ( e.g., notice, consent,  correction, and erasure rights like those given data subjects in  the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation63 or  the U.S. Fair Credit Reporting Act64). If hard rules are chosen,  regulatory designers can choose to delegate enforcement  authority to public enforcers, including, as some advocate, an  “FDA for AI,”65 or to private enforcers deputized to sue in court  or incentivized via whistleblower bounty schemes.66 Finally,  regulatory architects can opt for ex ante  regulation before a  model runs—think once again of an FDA-style pre-certification  scheme or prohibitions on uses or model types—or ex post   regulation of results, as with lawsuits seeking damages.67
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 76II. DESIGN PRINCIPLES For the moment, no single best solution from this menu of  options has emerged. However, Part II’s in-depth case studies,  by showcasing a wide range of AI-based governance tools,  help establish some working premises that can frame the  possibilities and limits of competing approaches. First, consideration of actual use cases reveals hard  trade-offs between accountability and efficacy. Imposing  constraints on model choices—by, for example, limiting the  number of data features or prohibiting more sophisticated  modeling approaches—trades off interpretability against a  tool’s analytic power and, thus, its usefulness.68 As just one  example, requiring the SEC to deploy a less sophisticated but  more interpretable algorithmic tool in making enforcement  decisions may make it easier for regulated parties or agency  overseers to evaluate the tool’s workings but may also bring  substantial costs, subjecting regulated parties to undue  prosecutions and wasting scarce agency resources in the  process. Here and elsewhere, interpretability may come only  at the cost of efficacy.69 Second, the pros and cons of transparency will often vary by  governance task and the rights and interests at issue. In the  enforcement context, public disclosure of the “internals” of  an algorithmic enforcement tool can impair or defeat the  tool’s utility by facilitating evasion and gaming by regulated  parties—an issue we explore in more detail later in Part III’s  section on “Adversarial Learning.” In certain mass adjudicatory  contexts, by contrast, full open-sourcing of algorithmic  tools might make sense as an accountability measure. One  might conclude, for instance, that disability or veterans’  benefits determinations are too important to risk erroneous  determinations and, in any event, present a lower risk of  gaming by beneficiaries. Third, efforts to build effective accountability systems will  have to reckon with the existing structure of administrative  law. To date, much academic debate has focused, at a high  level of abstraction, on procedural due process under the  Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States  Constitution.70 Far less work explores the more fine-grained  statutory requirements of administrative law and, even then,  offers mostly a surface-level tour of potentially applicable  doctrines.71 This is problematic because the doctrine of  constitutional avoidance—which holds that courts should  avoid ruling on constitutional issues in favor of other grounds—means that much, or even most, of the hard  work of regulating algorithmic governance tools will come  not in the constitutional clouds but rather in the streets of  administrative law.72 So-called “reviewability” doctrines in administrative law  offer a compelling example. Current administrative law,  as exemplified by the Supreme Court’s Heckler v. Chaney   decision, insulates agency enforcement decisions from  judicial review except where Congress has clearly specified a  standard for the agency’s exercise of discretion or where an  agency has wholly “abdicated” its enforcement duties.73 The  reasons are many, but the main anxiety is about judges’ ability  to reconstruct or evaluate specific enforcement decisions,  which often rest on subtle judgments about how best to  allocate scarce agency resources. Interestingly, algorithmic enforcement tools may make these  reviewability concerns worse or better. On one hand, the black  box nature of machine learning tools may further obscure  agency enforcement decisions, strengthening the rationale  for hiving off those decisions from judicial review. Something  very near the opposite, however, may also result. By allowing  agencies to formalize and make explicit organizational  priorities, algorithmic tools have the potential to render  enforcement decision-making somewhat more tractable than  the dispersed human judgments of enforcement staff. For  instance, if appropriately balanced with the need for a degree  of confidentiality of agency enforcement goals, code may  help provide the missing “focal point” for judicial evaluation  of agency enforcement decisions and rebut the current  doctrine’s presumption against reviewability. Moreover,  because algorithms encode legal principles and agency  priorities, they perform regulatory work and so may qualify as  “rules” under administrative law, thus requiring mandatory  ventilation via the notice-and-comment process or exposing  them to pre-enforcement judicial review. The counterintuitive result is that continued proliferation of algorithmic  enforcement tools may, on net, yield an enforcement  apparatus that is more transparent and less opaque than the  current system.74 Reviewability only scratches the surface of ways that the  administrative law will modulate federal agency use of  AI tools. Administrative law may also need to adapt in  determining whether agency decisions made or supported by  an algorithmic tool are “arbitrary and capricious.” Courts will 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 77thus grapple once more with whether such review is a matter  of light-touch review75 or deeper “hard look” review.76 And,  as we explore in more detail elsewhere in Part III, agency use  of AI-based tools to support adjudication raises distinct legal  questions relating to hearing rights and due process. Fourth, looking across concrete use cases underscores  administrative law’s potential limits in achieving algorithmic  accountability. Meaningful accountability must be built upon  actionable  transparency. It does little good to give judges  transparency into an algorithmic system’s “internals” if they  lack the technical understanding necessary to make sense of  it. The same is true of ordinary citizens who are the objects  of algorithmic decisions. If engineers cannot understand a  system’s outputs, then there is little reason to believe that less  technically trained actors can do any better. Actionable transparency can also falter when data and  algorithms change dynamically. For instance, the SEC’s  supervised learning model for Form ADV disclosures is trained  on past referrals to the SEC’s enforcement arm, but the pool  of referrals grows over time, with different human input for  each referral. This means that each model may be distinct. A  model reviewed at one stage (during the notice-and-comment  process) may already be substantively different upon  deployment. Conversely, problematic predictions at one point  (a specific enforcement decision) might vanish as the model  is updated. By their nature, the notice-and-comment process  and APA-type judicial proceedings are static and may not  generate the information required to understand an algorithm  in action. Finally, administrative law works in tandem with an array  of data and disclosure laws that, at least in their current  form, can sharply limit transparency. In the SSA context,  individual data is protected under the Privacy Act of 1974.77  Similarly, the raw disclosures that serve as inputs for the  SEC’s enforcement tools are publicly available, but data from  prior investigations—that is, the filings that triggered elevated  review—are likely protected under the Freedom of Information  Act’s exemption for law enforcement purposes.78 Finally, a  contractor-provided algorithmic tool’s technical guts may  be protected by patent, copyright, or trade secrecy laws,79  and government use of the tool provides no further right of  disclosure.80 III. CONCRETE REFORM IDEAS Given these challenges, judges, agency administrators, and  legislators will face difficult questions about whether to retrofit existing accountability frameworks or mint new ones. A minimalist option would retrofit or, to the extent feasible,  reinterpret the APA to enable prudent ex ante  review of  algorithmic tools through the notice-and-comment process  and/or judicious ex post  review by courts. On the latter, ex post   side, Congress or courts may wish to relax the presumption  against reviewability of enforcement decisions under  Heckler v. Chaney .81 On the ex ante  side, an amended APA  could set new triggers for when an algorithmic tool is subject  to notice and comment. One could peg notice and comment  to whether staff use of the tool is mandatory or voluntary  as a crude proxy for how much the tool displaces human  discretion. A more technical approach would key notice and  comment to the numerical threshold the tool establishes. For  example, an enforcement tool that flags potential violators as  “high risk” necessarily sets a probability threshold from 0 to  1. The higher the threshold, the greater the risk that human  discretion is displaced.82 The chosen threshold also fixes  the relative number of false negatives and false positives to  be expected. As a result, the choice of threshold cannot be  made without weighing the social costs of each type of error— precisely where public participation via notice and comment  may be most useful. Given the limitations of ex ante  and ex post  review under the  APA, a more comprehensive institutional solution would be  to create an AI oversight board, either within each agency  or as a freestanding agency with oversight over all other  agencies. Staffed with technologists, lawyers, and agency  representatives, an oversight board could be tasked with  monitoring, investigating, and recommending adjustments to  agency adoption and use of AI.83 A third possibility would be to require agencies to engage  in prospective “benchmarking”84—that is, to create random  hold-out sets to compare AI-assisted outcomes and human  (status quo) decision-making. In the SSA context, for instance,  the Insight system could be deactivated for a random hold-out  set and each case adjudicated in analog fashion. In the SEC  context, investigators could be required to investigate a subset  of cases without the aid of risk scores. Benchmarking would  provide a practical test of a tool’s facial validity, smoking out  bias and arbitrariness and enabling agencies, courts, and  the public to meaningfully assess the impact of AI use cases.  Benchmarking would also generate new training data and  provide a check on procurement-provided tools.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 78IV. LINKING ACCOUNTABILITY TO CAPACITY While these are promising reforms, it is worth noting that  formal accountability frameworks are not the only way to  ensure responsible agency use of algorithmic governance  tools. Internal agency supervision and embedded expertise  can also be a powerful source of accountability. As noted  in the previous section on capacity building, embedded  expertise facilitates “accountability by design” in which agency  technologists proactively design and maintain systems that  are more transparent and auditable and less arbitrary and  biased not as a response to legal or other external threats,  but as a matter of good government, good engineering, and  professional ethics.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 79Bias, Disparate Treatment, and Disparate Impact The administrative state’s growing adoption of AI tools risks compounding biases against  vulnerable groups. If biases go unchecked, agency tools will only deepen existing inequities  and also likely run afoul of antidiscrimination law. Yet, many proposed solutions to combat  bias would themselves violate other core legal principles, such as equal protection. In  short, agencies can find themselves in a bind. Given these challenges, it is critical that  agency administrators, legislators, judges, and academics devote  more attention to  developing agency-level mechanisms to detect, monitor, and correct for bias, as well as  appropriate legal regimes to govern them. I. EMERGING EVIDENCE OF BIAS It is well-documented that AI tools have the potential to  exacerbate bias against vulnerable groups. Three lessons have  emerged from a rapidly developing literature on fairness and  machine learning. First, the potential for machine learning to  encode bias is significant.85 Criminal risk assessment scores,  for instance, may exhibit higher “false positive rates” (wrongly  classifying individuals as “high risk”) for African-American than  white individuals.86 An NLP-based engine for job applicants  may score applicants who graduated from women’s  colleges more poorly, because of the existing demographic  composition of the work force.87 Second, while many potential  approaches to “fair machine learning” have been proposed,  a basic challenge is that divergent notions of fairness can  be mutually incompatible.88 In the presence of underlying  differences between demographic groups, for instance, it is  not possible to simultaneously equalize false positive rates,  false negative rates, and predictive parity across groups. Third,  critical questions remain as to how AI-assisted decisions fare  compared to human decisions, given that human decisions  are themselves often the origin of bias.89 II. THE POTENTIAL FOR BIAS IN USE CASES BY THE  ADMINISTRATIVE STATE Our case studies corroborate this risk across the  administrative state. The sources of such bias can be  varied. First, training data may be unrepresentative of the  population of interest. Facial recognition technology that  has been trained disproportionately on lighter skin tones,  for instance, may be significantly less accurate for darker skinned individuals,90 potentially introducing bias into CBP’s  reliance on facial recognition. Second, a number of use cases  rely on linking different administrative datasets together, and  coverage may skew toward certain demographic groups.  Formal blindness can be functional  discrimination.  The Internal Revenue Service, for instance, developed a  Return Revenue Program (RRP) to detect fraudulent refunds.  This RRP program uses a wide range of sources, including  data from the Federal Bureau of Prisons and prison systems  in all states.91 Such record linkage poses a risk of disparate  impact on subgroups, although it remains hard to assess in  the abstract. To illustrate, consider a similar setting that has  been subject to more examination. The Allegheny Family  Screening Tool for child welfare relies extensively on record  linkage of administrative data from means-tested programs.  Eubanks argues that the system hence relies on data for the  poor that it does not observe for the wealthy ( e.g., private  drug treatment, mental health counseling). The effect is that it  disproportionately rates the poor as “high risk” of child welfare  placements.92 Third, some systems may simply replicate  existing bias in human decisions. If agencies used a predictive  model for which comments are likely relevant, for instance,  such decisions may simply encode existing agency tendencies 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 80to rely on lengthier documents, written in non-vernacular,  submitted by legal counsel.93 In the PTO’s prior art search, a  machine learning model trained on historical labeled data may replicate the tendency by patent examiners to neglect non-patent literature. 94 The rise of AI decision tools will  increasingly challenge conventional  principles of antidiscrimination law.  III. THE WAY FORWARD Grappling with such forms of bias will be a significant undertaking for federal agencies adopting AI/ML. First, the emerging consensus within machine learning is that“blinding” algorithms to protected characteristics is unlikely to be effective. As the feature set (i.e., the number of variables in the model) grows, protected characteristics, such as race and gender, can be inferred with extremely high probability. 95  Formal blindness can be functional discrimination. Researchers have hence argued that “fairness-through-awareness,” not blinding, will be a more promising approach to ensure fairness. 96 Yet because there are no consensus  measures for fairness, government agencies will have toincreasingly engage with evolving standards and methods for assessing the potential for bias in machine learning and such judgments may be highly domain-specific. Second, the rise of AI decision tools will increasingly challenge  conventional principles of antidiscrimination law. As noted, protected characteristics can be inferred with high likelihood as the feature set (of unprotected characteristics) grows. This challenges the anticlassification principle, which posits that the law should not classify individuals based on protected attributes (e.g., gender and race). Similarly, the rise of AI/ML tools will test doctrinal frameworks of narrow tailoring and “individualized” consideration under the Equal Protection Clause. The Supreme Court has not clarified the operation of those principles specifically in the context of machine learning, but its affirmative action cases illustrate the tension. In the affirmative action context, the Supreme Court held that the University of Michigan law school’s consideration of race in “individualized” admissions was constitutional, 97 but held that the practice of awarding 20 points on a 150-point scale  for underrepresented minorities in undergraduate admissions  violated equal protection.98 “[I]ndividualized consideration,”  the Court noted, “demands that race be used in a flexible,  nonmechanical way.”99 Machine learning, however, challenges this doctrinal  distinction. Is an algorithm that uses 1,000 features, including  a protected attribute, “individualized” or is it “mechanical”? Is  the mere use of the point scale problematic, or is it about the  relative weight of protected characteristics? In L.A. Water &  Power v. Manhart, the Supreme Court found that the use of  gender in calculating pension plan contributions violated  equal protection, despite the actuarial gender difference in  longevity.100 In State v. Loomis, the Wisconsin Supreme Court  did not find a due process violation when gender was used in  a criminal risk assessment score, finding that the “use of  gender promotes accuracy that ultimately inures to the  benefit of the justice system.”101 Due to the doctrinal  uncertainty, states and localities using criminal risk  assessment scores remain split in whether they rely on  gender.102 To the extent that the machine learning literature  calls for awareness of protected attributes to promote  fairness, it is on a collision course with equal protection  doctrine. Even if an algorithm passes constitutional muster, it is unclear  how administrative law will grapple with claims of disparate  impact. Litigants may claim that the adoption of an  algorithmic decision tool causes disparate impact across  demographic groups and that the failure to address and  explain such consequences is arbitrary and capricious. Yet  whether courts will entertain such claims and how courts  weigh the fairness-accuracy trade-off remains an open  question. The D.C. Circuit, for instance, has held that  disparate impact arguments may not be brought under the  APA when Title VI of the Civil Rights Act—then assumed to  provide a private right of action—provides an alternative  adequate remedy.103 Since that decision, the Supreme Court  held that there was no private right of action under Title VI,  but no court has explicitly considered whether that opens the  door to disparate impact claims under the APA. Mounting  evidence of the potential for disparate impact with AI decision  tools will put pressure on courts to grapple with this gap.104 Third, no agency examined in this report has established  systematic protocols for assessing the potential for an AI tool  to encode bias. While some application areas (e.g., facial  recognition) present obvious risks, the need for such 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 81protocols may be even greater for use cases where bias is  less obvious. Might FDA’s adverse event reporting system  be driven by reporting bias along demographic groups, say  due to differences in access to health care?105 If SSA builds  out its expedited review program using electronic health  records, does that advantage certain types of applicants who  are more likely to have access to health care providers with  interoperable electronic health record systems? Would neural  network models deployed by the PTO actually fail to capture  temporal drift and, as a result, disadvantage pathbreaking  research by smaller entrepeneurs?106 The upshot here, as  earlier, is that developing internal capacity to rigorously  evaluate, monitor, and assess the potential for disparate  impact will be critical for trustworthy deployment of AI in  federal administrative agencies.107 In sum, the rise of algorithmic decision-making raises novel  and important questions about disparate impact. Fortunately,  administrators, technologists, legislators, and judges can  draw from the rapidly emerging literature on bias in machine  learning to proactively assess the potential for bias. Efforts  will need to be focused on developing the appropriate  institutional mechanisms for detecting, monitoring, and  correcting for bias in AI decision tools.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 82Hearing Rights and Algorithmic Governance Much of the decision-making of modern administrative government comes after a  “hearing.” Such hearings provide affected parties the opportunity to submit evidence inperson or on paper to a decision-maker, often an administrative judge or other agency  employee. An array of laws dictates the form these hearings take, among them the default  requirements of the APA, agency enabling acts, agency regulations, and the Constitution’s  Due Process Clause. In some contexts, the procedural bundle is meager: An agency need  only rise above the floor set by due process by providing advance notice of the decision  and a brief opportunity to be heard.108 In others, constitutional and statutory mandates  require an administrative approximation of a full-dress trial, with rules dictating who can  participate, the types of evidence that can be considered, record-keeping requirements,  appeal rights, and restrictions on ex parte contacts.109 How will the rise of AI decision tools  alter the form and function of these hearings and how should administrative law adapt  in response? The role of hearing rights cuts across adjudicatory contexts, from formal  adjudication at the SSA to more informal patent decisions at the PTO and enforcement  decisions at the SEC, IRS, or CMS. This section makes three points about the future of hearing  rights in the face of the AI revolution. First, while the most  optimistic version of AI tools may improve accuracy and  efficiency of adjudicatory decisions, such tools may also  expose trade-offs in normative values underpinning hearing  rights. Second, we articulate how procedural due process  and statutory hearing rights may need to adapt if AI tools  proliferate. A core challenge in the near-term will be crafting  legal and institutional vehicles to detect and address  systemic sources of error in light on the current structure of  individualized decision-making. Third, the rise of AI tools in  adjudication potentially raises longer-term, foundational  questions: Do due process and statutory hearing rights imply  a right to a human decision-maker? And what role is left  for hearing rights in a world in which legal and regulatory  mandates are crafted, adjudicated, and enforced with  increasingly limited human involvement?The promise of AI is that it may cut the  Gordian knot of this accuracy/efficiency  trade-off by making possible efficiency  gains without reductions in accuracy. I. THE PROMISE AND PERIL OF ALGORITHMIC  ADJUDICATION Conventional wisdom holds that due process poses an  accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Adding procedures can improve  a decision’s accuracy by ensuring close consideration of  a wider range of evidence and subjecting arguments and  evidence to more robust and often adversarial testing. But  process is also costly. Importantly, procedure’s costs are both  social ( e.g., the resources required to operate the system)  and individual ( e.g., the costs to parties in real resources 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 83and delay). On the latter, one need look no further than the  significant backlogs at the SSA and PTO, which can delay  desperately needed disability benefits and innovationspurring intellectual property protections. The promise of AI is that it may cut the Gordian knot of this  accuracy/efficiency trade-off by making possible efficiency  gains without reductions in accuracy and vice versa. Some  AI-based decision tools may even yield simultaneous  improvements in both, yielding better decisions and  at lower  cost. The SSA’s tool for clustering like cases, for instance,  potentially enables adjudicators to work through cases  more quickly and  more equitably, improving the consistency  of decision making. Similarly, the SSA’s “easy grant”  identification tool routes easy cases to staff-level decisionmakers for rapid resolution so that administrative judges  can focus their energies on more difficult and demanding  cases. These and other AI-based tools profiled in  Part II’s case  studies might finally crack the code of mass adjudication,  improving accuracy while shrinking the inter-judge decision  disparities and backlogs that have long plagued a wider range  of agencies. If AI tools are indeed able to solve the quantity-quality tradeoff, they may also make room for other adjudicatory values.  As noted in the SSA chapter, AI tools might help reclaim  a part of constitutional due process that has been in part  sidelined in modern jurisprudence: the dignity interests of the  parties. By eliminating rote and repetitive tasks, AI might free  adjudicators to focus on procedural fairness: to engage parties  more extensively, to issue tentative orders, and to explain the  complex legal provisions to affected parties. A long line of  research establishes that individuals may perceive a process  as more legitimate if afforded a voice.110 Dignitary interests  may have value independent of accuracy.111 Despite such optimistic glosses, AI-based tools also raise  significant concerns. First, AI tools displace adjudicator  discretion and independence, potentially draining the system  of its deliberative and adaptive capacities.112 Importantly,  displacement of discretion can occur even where manual  review nominally remains. One reason is automation  bias— i.e., the over-reliance of decision-makers on automated  predictions, even when such deference is unreasonable and  mistaken.113 Faced with rigid quotas, patent examiners may  be unwilling to expend additional effort to second-guess AIprioritized search results. Adjudicators at the SSA may review cases solely to pass Insight quality flags, progressively ignoring  errors that evade automated detection. Machine predictions  might allow an administrative judge to readily compare her  inclination to that of others, threatening notions of decisional  independence. And algorithmic search tools may diminish  engagement with the record, functionally undermining de  novo  review. All of these dynamics can stifle the emergence of  exceptions and the dynamic, iterative effort to conform legal  mandates to changing circumstances. A key challenge then is to build  decision tools that complement, rather  than substitute for, human decisionmaking— i.e., human-centered AI.  Second, adjudicators may simply ignore AI tools. Such  aversion to algorithms erodes the accuracy and efficiency  gains of automation, even where human decision-making may  be demonstrably inferior.114 Under-reliance on algorithmic  tools may be particularly likely when decision-makers are  field experts, as is the case with administrative judges.115 And  because administrative judges may vary in their receptiveness  to AI tools and in their willingness to review machine  outputs or deviate from recommended results, inter-judge  decision disparities and high reversal rates may persist. A key  challenge then is to build decision tools that complement,  rather than substitute for, human decision-making— i.e.,  human-centered AI. Last, algorithmic systems may simply get things wrong,  eroding decision quality under a false veneer of efficiency  gains. Statutory interpretation and implementation are openended and difficult tasks. Algorithmic outputs might deviate  from the statutory mandate or prove non-policy-compliant.  And, as we describe next, current systems are ill-suited to  detecting such sources of systemic error. II. GETTING HEARING RIGHTS RIGHT As AI-based decision tools proliferate, how can hearing rights  adapt to harness AI’s positive potential while mitigating its  costs? Administrative hearings come in myriad policy contexts  and, as already noted, the procedures that apply in each take 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 84many forms. The optimal mix of procedural rights may vary  significantly across contexts. For now, we make several points  that can help guide judges, administrators, and legislators in  adapting the current system. First, the current system of hearing rights fits awkwardly  with the most pressing challenge raised by algorithmic  decision tools: identifying and remedying systemic  sources  of error. Part of the challenge is inherent to the structure of  individualized hearing rights. A single judicial challenge to  agency decision-making may correct a specific error, but such  challenges are unlikely to surface and remediate entrenched  pathologies within the system.116 Specific to the algorithmic  context, Danielle Citron argues that there is an additional  doctrinal challenge: The Supreme Court’s longstanding test  for procedural due process, which requires courts to focus  on only the case at hand and weigh the private interest,  the government interest, and the likely value of additional  process, may neglect the fact that algorithmic tools are  designed to operate at scale .117 Lost in case-level balancing  is the possibility that a one-time but costly increase in  procedural scrutiny of an algorithmic tool can yield massive  social benefits across the thousands or millions of cases to  which the tool is applied.118 Second, AI-based decision tools may progressively  scramble the foundational distinction between rulemaking  and adjudication under the APA and Constitution. For  adjudication, p rocedural due process and applicable statutes  safeguard the interests of a single person or a small group of  affected people.119 For rulemaking, the Constitution requires  little and the APA requires only a general level of public  participatory engagement when a rule is addressed to a large  class of people with common circumstances.120 In Heckler v.  Campbell , the Supreme Court affirmed the statutory authority  of the SSA to decide common issues in adjudications via  rulemaking.121 Despite the fact that the Social Security Act  requires “individualized determinations based on evidence  adduced at a hearing,” the Court held that the act “does not  bar the Secretary from relying on rulemaking to resolve certain  classes of issues.”122 As AI systems become more sophisticated,  a key question will be when they function as “legislative rules”  that have “binding effects” on the agency and regulated  parties, triggering notice-and-comment rulemaking. Was SSA  required to undergo notice-and-comment for its QDD system?  And if so, should it have been required to disclose more of the  underlying feature set and model? Answers to these questions  are easier for top-down expert-based AI systems (if-then rules). But modern machine learning systems are “bottom-up” in  that they construct rules based on learned associations from  prior decisions. Whether the system has a binding effect hence  depends empirically on (a) the level of adherence to the rule,  and (b) the extent to which models prospectively adapt. Such  adaptation also makes it more challenging ex ante  to disclose  the nature of the decision system in contrast to a decision tree  from an expert-based system. Third, as technology advances, parties may petition  agencies to adopt such systems. Forms of pure internal  agency management are typically seen to escape notice  and comment and judicial review, but as AI systems become  increasingly powerful, parties might challenge the failure to  adopt an AI-based system as arbitrary and capricious or as  violating due process. Going forward, judges, administrators, and legislators will  need to think about more appropriate legal and institutional  vehicles to challenge the accuracy not only of individual  decisions, but also of algorithms. The APA’s interpretation of  a binding rule may need to be pegged to the degree to which  human discretion is displaced or, alternatively put, the degree  to which a human remains “in the loop.” Agencies will need  to experiment with the best ways to surface, investigate, and  debug potential errors when adjudicators and affected parties  suspect such errors. Such mechanisms appear to be lacking  currently. In its audit of the Insight system, for instance, the  SSA’s Office of Inspector General surveyed adjudicators  and 20% indicated that the flagged errors were inaccurate  and 35% reported that there was no method for submitting  feedback where improvement was necessary.123 The broader  scholarship suggests that appeal rights alone are unlikely to  provide a full solution, so other institutional and managerial  solutions, such as quality control programs, audits, oversight,  and external review, are well worth piloting and evaluating. III. HEARING RIGHTS INTO THE FUTURE The academic literature is replete with references to “robojudges”124 and even an eventual state of “legal singularity,”125  when machines can perfectly predict the outcomes of  cases before they are filed. Only slightly less futuristic are  predictions that the law will steadily transform into a “vast  catalogue of precisely tailored laws,” or “microdirectives,”126  that adjust in real-time—for instance, an individualized speed  limit for a given driver with a given amount of experience  operating in specific driving conditions—and are enforced via  automatic penalties.127
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 85These possibilities may seem far-fetched in the current  moment, but the more limited tools profiled in this report  do gesture toward the longer technological horizon. The  SSA Insight system’s ability to spot errors in draft decisions  and arm administrative judges with raw materials, including  agency non-acquiescence decisions, point to a world in  which decision-making becomes more fully automated. While  administrative judges and other adjudicators may balk at  full automation, some interview subjects seek tools that can  build a “decisional shell” around a case by gathering factual  and legal materials to which an adjudicator can then more  efficiently apply her human discretion. Yet even decisional  shells will displace human discretion based on editorial  judgments about which legal issues, and which materials, are  and are not relevant. These tools may be different in degree,  not in kind. While it may be far away, fully automated decision-making  raises rich, and existential, questions to the American legal  system, built around participatory rights and adversarialism.  Does the notion of due process imply the right to a human  decision-maker?128 Full automation promises “a fast and  refined prediction of the relevant legal effect”129 and thus  achieves one of the highest purposes of law, but may drain  the law’s capacity to adapt and to ventilate legal rules though  dialogue and debate in fully public interpretive exercises.130  Something may be lost when the process of enforcing  collective value judgments about right conduct plays out  in server farms rather than as part of a prolonged and often  messy deliberative and adjudicatory process, even where the  machine-driven version proves perfectly accurate.131 These  debates are well beyond the scope of this report. But the tools  profiled herein suggest it is not too early to start them.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 86Gaming and Adversarial Learning A challenge that cuts across growing agency reliance on algorithmic governance tools is the  risk of adversarial learning and gaming by regulated parties. I. THE RISK OF GAMING AND ADVERSARIAL LEARNING Whenever the government brings greater transparency to  previously discretionary decisions, those decisions become  more gameable, with parties adjusting their behavior to  maximize their chances at a favorable outcome. Algorithmic  governance is no exception. Where algorithms are known  to rely on particular variables or cutoffs, regulated parties  can manipulate those variables and the values they take  in order to secure a desirable result from the system.  “Adversarial machine learning,” or the use of machine  learning to fool algorithmic models, only exacerbates this  inherent risk. 132 With simpler forms of adversarial machine  learning, adversaries can, for instance, exploit algorithmic  tools to obtain favorable determinations, without changing  the underlying characteristic the algorithm is designed to  measure.133 At the extreme, regulatory targets can even  gain access to the tool itself and feed it new data to corrupt  its outputs.134 As a concrete illustration, consider how adversaries might  exploit the PTO’s tools to adjudicate applications, as  described in Part II. These tools help classify patent and  trademark applications according to the PTO’s taxonomy, as  well as search for “prior art” and visually similar trademarks.  Patent applicants have long tweaked their applications to try  to obtain a desired classification, pushing their application  to a unit with higher grant rates. Machine learning magnifies  these opportunities for gaming. For example, adversaries  could manipulate images in their patent applications to  include random noise, which has been shown to dupe leading  machine learning models into mis-classifying images.135  Adversaries could thereby divert their applications to units  more likely to rule in their favor, undermining the fairness and  accountability of the underlying algorithm.II. THE EFFECT ON AGENCIES AND ALGORITHMIC  SYSTEMS Gaming and adversarial learning have profound implications  for the efficacy of algorithmic governance tools as well as  political support for their use. Gaming poses profound distributive  concerns.  At the outset, it is worth noting that gaming can sometimes  be salutary. While gamers are often self-serving—that is,  seeking to maximize their take or minimize their loss within an  algorithmic system—they need not be.136 Gamers, depending  on one’s perspective on automation, range “from parasitic,  to benign, to downright noble.”137 Gaming opportunities  can also be deliberately built into a system to avoid unduly  regressive policies, promote redistribution, or otherwise blunt  the force of rigid regulatory regimes. Some have suggested  that lax tax enforcement of the cash economy is one such  example, where gaming in fact serves potentially desirable  redistributive ends.138 That said, gaming often reduces the accuracy and efficacy  of algorithmic systems. Consider, for example, the SEC’s  Form ADV Fraud Predictor, which aims to identify bad apple  investment brokers and subject them to greater regulatory  scrutiny. Regulated parties with knowledge of that tool’s  inner workings can adversarially craft their disclosures; they  can include or omit key language in order to foil the system’s  classifier and keep their personnel off the SEC’s radar. This type of gaming poses profound distributive concerns.  Better-heeled and more sophisticated regulated individuals  and entities may have the time, resources, or know-how to  navigate or even reverse-engineer algorithmic systems and 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 87then take the evasive actions necessary to yield positive  determinations and avoid adverse ones. As noted in Part  II’s profile of the SEC’s enforcement tools, larger and betterresourced firms with a  deeper bench of computer scientists  and quantitative analysts may prove better able than smaller  ones to reverse-engineer algorithmic enforcement tools and  avoid regulatory action. These distributive concerns can be amplified by contractor  conflicts. Government contractors may seek to monetize or  exploit their relationship to algorithmic tools for financial  gain in other business relationships. Given that contractors  are responsible for roughly 30% of AI/ML use cases, these  concerns are grave. To take but one example, the company  that provides the PTO’s classification tool also sells services  to patent applicants, advertising its PTO experience as one  of its major assets.139 Yet because not all parties can afford  such services, better-resourced companies and individuals  will be better able to game the system, whether to obtain  government benefits or avoid regulatory scrutiny. These distributive challenges may politicize the use of AI/ ML tools over time. While regulatory “haves” may welcome  government uptake of algorithmic tools if they believe they  are better-equipped to game them or that the new tools will  yield enforcement against a more diverse set of regulatory  targets,140 the “have nots,” including the poor but also more  middling segments of society, may not support a more  efficient and effective algorithm-wielding government if they  believe they will disproportionately shoulder its burdens.  Indeed, some initial research suggests that citizens tend to  rate algorithmic decision-making negatively compared to  the status quo.141 Support for government innovation can  evaporate quickly if it is perceived as unfairly wielded. III. THE WAY FORWARD Given these challenges, administrative agencies need to  be mindful in developing and deploying algorithmic tools.  Architects of algorithmic models must consider whether and  how to design their models to minimize opportunities for  gaming and adversarialism.  For example, programmers can increase model complexity,  reconfigure models periodically, and/or add randomness,  all of which will make models harder to game.142 They can  also build models that rely on immutable traits, which  regulated parties cannot readily change.143 And they can use  generative adversarial networks, training new tools against  hostile adversaries that seek to fool them, which will make the algorithm less susceptible to attack in the long run.144  But these measures, while making AI/ML tools harder to  game, also come at a cost. They risk making models less  interpretable to regulated parties (let alone the average  citizen), reducing transparency and accountability. Another reform would have agencies impose sanctions to  encourage compliance with underlying regulatory procedures.  For example, the PTO sanctions parties who breach duties of  disclosure, candor, and good faith. To be effective, however,  this approach requires strong mechanisms to detect  regulatory violations, which can prove expensive and difficult  to implement. Ultimately, none of these reforms is a panacea. As  administrative agencies develop algorithmic tools, they  must balance the risk of gaming against other public  values, including transparency, efficacy, and distributive  concerns. Sometimes, agencies must tolerate gaming  and adversarialism in service of a more transparent, more  effective algorithmic system. In other cases, the right answer  may be to create no algorithm at all, especially if it would  lead to an expensive arms race of machine learning tools,  without ultimately improving efficacy or citizen confidence  in the system.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 88The External Sourcing Challenge:   Contractors and Competitions Part I’s canvass of federal agency use of AI identified 157 use cases. While more than half  of these (53%) were developed in-house by agency technologists, nearly as many came  from external sources, with one-third (33%) coming from private commercial sources  via the procurement process and a further, non-trivial proportion (14%) resulting from  non-commercial collaborations, including agency-hosted competitions and governmentacademic partnerships. This roughly even split between internal and external sourcing  suggests that each approach has significant advantages and disadvantages that agency  personnel must weigh when developing AI-based tools. This section focuses on the  benefits and costs of external sourcing over internal sourcing and fleshes out some of the  trade-offs agencies face when choosing between them. I. THE “MAKE” DECISION REVISITED Sourcing decisions, as noted in the earlier section on capacitybuilding challenges, reflect the basic make-or-buy choice that  agencies often face when performing governance tasks.145 An  agency can either hire and train personnel and assemble the  raw materials needed to perform government tasks, or it can  contract through the procurement process to buy them.146 As described previously, internal agency production of AI  tools requires substantial agency technical capacity but can  also yield a range of benefits. Advantages of internal sourcing  include tools that are better-tailored, more policy compliant,  and more accountable. An apt illustration, as described in  detail previously, is the Insight tool internally developed  at the Social Security Administration by Kurt Glaze, the  attorney-turned-programmer. In designing that system, Glaze  specifically designed the error flags that can be raised in draft  decisions based upon “the flags that [he would have] wanted  to have available as an adjudicator.”147 Importantly, colocation of policymakers and technologists can matter even  where an agency opts to make its own tools. James Ridgway,  who helped oversee the Board of Veteran’s Appeals Caseflow  project, ensured that the staff of the U.S. Digital Service would  remain on site to avoid “deliver[ing] a system two years later  that no one [would] use.”148Embedded technical expertise may also be necessary to  automate tasks that are dynamic and changeable. For  example, algorithmic enforcement tools like those deployed  by the SEC use classifiers trained on past enforcement actions  to “shrink the haystack” of current violators and direct the  attention of line-level enforcement staff. But as noted in Part  II, the misconduct those tools target is rarely static. Embedded  expertise facilitates the continuous, iterative updating of  algorithmic enforcement tools necessary to incorporate new  modes of wrongdoing unearthed by agency staff and avoid an  undue focus on past forms of misconduct. Finally, internal agency development of AI tools limits leakage  of information about a tool’s technical and operational details  that can undermine its utility. Here again, the enforcement  tools under development and in use at the SEC, IRS, CMS,  and EPA provide a compelling illustration because of their  potential vulnerability to being reverse-engineered and  evaded through adversarial learning. Another example is  DHS’s facial recognition system, which attackers might, with  access to technical details about the system, be able to trick  into incorrectly matching an innocent face with the no-fly  list or permitting an individual on the no-fly list to escape  detection. Even relatively simple attacks, as noted previously,  can defeat the most advanced algorithmic systems.149  Leakage of a tool’s technical and operational details facilitates  those attacks.
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 89II. THE “BUY” DECISION: PROS AND CONS While internal sourcing has many virtues, the benefits of  external production are also significant. First, external  sourcing may yield more technically sophisticated tools.  One reason is that the private sector is not burdened by  the compensation and hiring limitations that restrict the  pool of talent that government agencies can tap. Budget  constraints, civil service laws capping allowable salaries, and  political sensitivities mean that government agencies may  be priced out of labor markets for employees with advanced  technical skillsets. Further, agency leadership may not  prioritize technological innovation. Gerald Ray, a longtime  Administrative Appeals Judge at the SSA who eventually  became deputy executive director of the Office of Appellate  Operations (OAO), worked around limitations on hiring  technologists by identifying attorneys skilled in data analysis  and computer science in order to develop the agency’s AI  toolkit. While the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has  since established a “data scientist” classification, thus easing  the hiring burdens for technical positions, compensation caps  and other limitations remain.150 Differences across the public and private sector can also make  externally sourced governance tools cheaper than internally  sourced ones. A long academic literature concludes that  the private sector will often produce goods and services at  lower cost because of a better-incentivized workforce and  tighter managerial control.151 Government-side employment  constraints again loom large, including limits on hiring and  firing and an inability to offer incentive-based compensation. While external sourcing has numerous benefits, its  drawbacks are also significant. Some of these are merely  the flip-side of internal sourcing’s advantage in generating  well-tailored, policy compliant, and accountable tools.  Algorithmic enforcement tools, as just noted, may require  frequent updating to maximize efficacy in ways that generic  commercialized AI systems, and the often protracted backand-forth of the procurement process, are ill-suited to  provide.152 Because contractors typically operate at a remove  from agency operations, external sourcing can also impose  heavy monitoring and transaction costs. Where monitoring  costs are low, as with well-specified services like garbage  collection, the government can gain from the efficiency and  expertise of the private sector. Where monitoring costs are  high, however, and the governance tasks at issue involve  significant discretion, private contractors may have incentives  to engage in strategic corner-cutting, thus systematically  degrading quality.153 Profit-motivated contractors may also be less likely to ground key design and implementation decisions  in public values like transparency and non-discrimination  than civil servants as a matter of professional identity.154 In  the AI context, technically complex but standardized tasks,  such as consolidating databases and upgrading computer  infrastructure,155 may prove more amenable to external  contracting than the design and maintenance of enforcement  tools, where the need for tailoring and updating is greater and  consideration of public values are thought to be more salient. Usability may militate in favor of  internal capacity building. Finally, external sourcing of algorithmic governance tools  raises significant conflict-of-interest concerns. In the patent  and trademark context, the same contractor that produced  the PTO’s classification tool advertises its experience  supporting the agency in order to sell its services to patent  applicants.156 This raises the potential for conflicts of interest  and deliberate leakage of information about governance  tools. At the same time, because contractors seek to maximize  commercial gain, they also face incentives to cloak the  technical and operational details of AI tools by invoking  intellectual property and trade-secret protections. As just  one example, the DHS reported that it could not explain the  failure rates of iris scanning technology due to the “proprietary  technology being used.”157 This example underscores both the  potential accountability costs of procurement-generated AI  tools and also the importance of developing and maintaining  a baseline level of internal technical capacity even when an  agency chooses to buy  AI tools. In sum, usability may militate in favor of internal capacity  building. Privately produced, procurement-generated tools  may boast the most cutting-edge analytics, but may also  be less tailored to the task at hand, be less attuned to legal  requirements and an agency’s bureaucratic realities, and do  not necessarily come with ongoing and regular engagement  between technologists and agency enforcement staff . In  contrast, in-house production may strain agency budgets,  but will yield governance tools that are, on average, better  tailored to subtle governance tasks, more law- and policycompliant, more attuned to complex organizational dynamics,  and less subject to information leakage and conflicts of  interest that can reduce a tool’s efficacy and raise significant  distributive concerns.158
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 90III. A THIRD WAY: NON-COMMERCIAL COLLABORATIONS While the make-or-buy  choice clearly entails significant  trade-offs, a third approach may be gaining momentum: noncommercial collaborations and competitions.159 Questions  of scalability remain, but this third approach highlights the  potential for government to realize the benefits of make and  buy while avoiding some of the costs of each. Collaborations with professional associations, academe, and  NGOs allow the government to leverage mutually beneficial  relationships and gain access to external talent and expertise  while maintaining control and monitoring quality. Examples  of successful non-commercial collaborations are growing  and include: the FDA’s partnerships to address cybersecurity  risk;160 NHTSA’s use of IMB’s Watson to process and respond to  safety complaints;161 Stanford’s partnership with the EPA;162 the  VA’s partnership with Google’s DeepMind to protect personal  information and thus permit data-sharing;163 and the FDA’s  “regulatory science” with Johns Hopkins, MIT , Stanford, and  Harvard.164 The FDA is also “exploring the use of a neutral  third party [to] collect large annotated imaging data sets for  purposes of understanding the performance of a novel AI  algorithm.”165 Government-sponsored competitions, which leverage the  public’s ideas and talent around declared government  priorities, often with prize money attached, are a potentially  valuable source of innovation and an increasingly prevalent  part of the capacity-building landscape.166 Through the  use of prize money, public recognition, and even follow-up  contracting work, government can leverage the public’s talent  to generate and prototype ideas.167 While there is relatively  little empirical or theoretical work on the subject, the benefits  seem clear: incentivizing innovation while maximizing return  by only rewarding success.168  At the same time, of the 28 competitions documented in Part  I, half showed no public evidence of government adoption or  intended adoption of technology created in the competition,  raising doubts about their usefulness. Moreover, while  competitions have grown exponentially from $247,000 in  prize money awarded in FY2011 to over $30 million in FY2016,  this amount remains small in comparison to the trillions in  annual government outlays, raising questions about whether  competitions can sufficiently scale to meet agency needs.169  Finally, competition-generated tools are sometimes criticized  as interstitial and small-bore. They may not substitute for  a comprehensive automation strategy and, as with tools generated through the traditional procurement process,  be insufficiently attuned to the complexities of tasks or  organizational environments. Finally, agencies can collaborate with each other, pooling  scarce resources to tackle parallel technical challenges.  Preliminary examples of such partnerships include the  FDA and DHS’ announced cybersecurity “memorandum of  agreement … for greater coordination and cooperation … for  addressing cybersecurity in medical devices.”170 The FDA’s  analysis of drug adverse event reports is remarkably  similar in objectives to NHTSA’s identification of trends  in consumer complaints, raising the prospect of crossagency technical collaboration through a central team  building shared AI infrastructure.171 Agencies like the FDA  and SSA are consolidating technical expertise and selfassessing their technical infrastructure in order to improve  technical performance, and a new proposed bill has been  introduced to promote innovation and develop AI governance  government-wide.172 Collaborations with professional  associations, academe, and NGOs  allow the government to leverage  mutually beneficial relationships and  gain access to external talent and  expertise while maintaining control  and monitoring quality. 
Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 91Conclusion Across the federal government, we are beginning to observe the dawn of a new chapter— perhaps even a digital revolution—in how government does its work. Half of surveyed agencies have experimented with AI/ML. AI-based governance tools already touch virtually every aspect of government, from enforcement to adjudication and from regulatory  analysis and monitoring to citizen services. And though the sophistication of many of these  tools lags behind the private sector, the pace of AI/ML development in government seems to be accelerating. Few, however, have recognized, much less captured  in any substantial detail, the breadth and depth of this transformation or the extent to which it is already underway. Until now, the state of knowledge about algorithmic governance has been marked above all else by its generality. The resulting high-abstraction mappings of concepts and core trade-offs have laid a valuable foundation. But further progress in thinking about the optimal regulation of the new AI governance tools is unlikely to take the form of a unified field theory. Instead, it will require a relentlessly interdisciplinary approach that engages with, rather than abstracting away from, the technical and operational details of the government’s new algorithmic toolkit. This report has provided the first comprehensive effort to provide such an analysis by examining in detail what agencies are actually doing and then offering concrete recommendations for how agency officials, judges, and legislators should respond. In providing a synoptic accounting of government use of  AI, this report confirms both the promise and the peril of the current algorithmic moment. The prospect that AI can transform government has long excited some commentators and worried others, and with good reason. As we have detailed, the proliferation of AI throughout the federal administrative state is already raising urgent questions about how to resolve core trade-offs around accountability, efficacy, capacity building, and adversarialism. How much transparency is necessary to judge a tool’s fidelity to law, and to what extent should we be willing to ease commitments to accountability and reason-giving in the service of governance tools that promise more effective and more equitable deployments of government power? To what extent can existing legal oversight tools, particularly administrative law, achieve meaningful accountability, and to what extent will accountability require newly minted interventions? How to weigh the relative merits of internal agency production of new governance tools and capacity building as against agency reliance on the ranks of private contractors with AI-based solutions at the ready? Although the answers to these sorts of questions will in some  cases bring welcome progress in society’s efforts to make government more efficient and responsive to public needs, no doubt those answers will also deliver their share of surprises and continuing disagreement. What is clear at this point is that federal agencies are capable of significant innovation involving AI. They have begun making systematic use of AI for a vast range of functions, and have made, and will surely continue to make, widely varying assumptions about the  Further progress in thinking about the  optimal regulation of the new AI   governance tools is unlikely to take the  form of a unified field theory. Instead,  it will require a relentlessly  interdisciplinary approach that  engages with, rather than abstracting  away from, the technical and  operational details of the government’s  new algorithmic toolkit.

Agencies also have differential  capacity to anticipate challenges and to make the most of the  opportunities for innovation in this area as they are actively  exploring new ways of using AI to advance their missions.  Above all else, we hope the terrain we have covered through  the descriptions and ideas in this report will help agency  officials to talk to one another and ensure that they are asking  the right questions.

Robinson,  Upturn & Omidyar Network, Public Scrutiny of Automated Decisions:  Early Lessons and Emerging Methods 19 (2018). 4 For each agency, we took the following steps:  1. We conducted a search combining the agency’s full name and the terms  “artificial intelligence” or “machine learning,” with results collected from a  minimum of the first three resulting pages. Due to lack of specificity, we did  not rely on agency acronyms (e.g., USPTO).  2. We conducted agency site-specific searches for the terms “artificial  intelligence” and “machine learning.”  3. To identify all agency use cases, we used the boolean “-” operator to  eliminate previously identified applications from searches.  4. For each agency, we cross-checked documented use cases on  algorithmtips.org, an existing online database of noteworthy algorithms  used by the federal government. 5 It is possible, for instance, that agencies describe as “machine learning”  analytic approaches that are in reality more conventional forms of  statistical inference because of the perceived public relations benefit.  Where available, we examined technical or other documentation to  ascertain whether machine learning was deployed. For our definition  of machine learning, see the discussion of the study’s “Scope” in the  Introduction, supra. 6 As an illustration of this challenge, available descriptions and underlying  technology can change over time, making quality control efforts over the  course of the study period difficult. 7 These policy areas are tied to agencies. “Law enforcement” indicates  an agency whose primary mission is in law enforcement, not civil  enforcement activities at an agency that may be primarily engaged in, say,  energy regulation. 8 We should note that the distinctions between these task categories are not  always straightforward. As spelled out in our data collection protocol, in  all instances, we attempted to code the task category that “best describes”  the use case. 9 This statistic excludes use cases with mixed methods.

Comm’n, Citigroup Provided Incomplete Blue Sheet Data for 15 Years (July 12, 2016) (on file with the author). Note, however, that these enforcement actions are likely a patchwork approach to validating bluesheet data. Because inaccurate bluesheets are often not detected and charged for years after their submission, the resulting delays in the validation process may create the risk of the SEC using inaccurate training data for its AI/ML models.  26  For ins tance, in a takeover situation, the SEC tends to organize data  according to buy volume. For increased trading before a critical announcement, such as an FDA drug approval, the SEC sorts the data by sell volume to identify potential insider trading. A retail investor with a diversified set of index funds suddenly leveraging in a biotechnology company before an FDA approval would be flagged as an outlier.  27  SEC St aff Interview I, supra note 19.  28 “Ground truth ” is a term used in statistical analysis, including machine  learning, to refer to provable information derived from direct observation rather than inference.  29  Id. 30 The fe atures may include how often the trader normally trades the stock in  question, how often she trades other stocks, how many shares were traded in comparison to other trades, and the time between the announcement and trade.

Machine Learning Res. 993 (2003). 38 A st andard bag of words model works by constructing a frequency matrix  summing the number of times each word is repeated in a document. As an example, the document “John bought stocks. Mary bought stocks” would be converted to “BoW = {“John”:1,”bought”:2,”stocks”:2,”Mary”:1}.” LDA is described as an iterative generative statistical model because it is run for multiple epochs to find the top K topics that best represented the collection of documents. LDA outputs the probability that a word occurs given a specific topic. A topic is defined as a probability distribution over a set of words. LDA then scores each of the documents according to how closely they fit the top K topics. These topics are clusters and then used as inputs to a supervised learning algorithm. There is no public information about the specifics of the system’s implementation, but clustering on these topics could possibly be done by comparing their distance from each other using a cosine similarity metric or the Kullback–Leibler divergence metric.

Telephone Interview with Raymond Wedgeworth, Dir., Data Analytics & Sys. Grp., Ctrs. for Medicare & Medicaid Servs. (Mar. 1, 2019). Fraudulent claims that were not successfully prosecuted may not be included in training data. As an initial matter, this once again raises the possibility of encoded, human-level arbitrariness or bias. Unless explicitly accounted for, predictive models may be biased towards previously prosecuted groups or areas, running into similar issues as predictive policing. Further problems can result from ad hoc procedures for incorporating newly discovered forms of wrongdoing. At CMS, when investigators unearth a new form of fraud outside the FPS, they report it, and the technical team managing the system engages with investigators to determine whether it is worthwhile to add the new activity to the system. Id. If not done carefully, these updating efforts can aggravate overfitting by producing a narrow set of training data covering only a subset of claims successfully identified as fraudulent. As we note below, enforcement agencies can mitigate these problems by engaging in more systematic training of their systems through randomized claim sampling that includes both cases identified as problematic and cases that are not.  46  SEC Appro ves Plan to Create Consolidated Audit Trail, Sec. & Exch.

(Feb. 11, 2019) (on file with author) [hereinafter Butler Interview]. Unsupervised models are designed to find latent patterns in unlabeled data (i.e., data for which there is “no associated response yi” for observations of xi). Gareth James et al., An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R 26 (2013). Unsupervised learning techniques have become more popular in recent years with the rapid developments in neural networks—a set of algorithms that are well-suited to “discovering latent structures within unlabeled, unstructured data.” A Beginner’s Guide to Neural Networks and Deep Learning, Skymind, https://skymind.ai/wiki/neural-network#define (last visited Apr. 8, 2019); Geoffrey Hinton et al., The “Wake-Sleep” Algorithm for Unsupervised Neural Networks, 268 Science 1158, 1158-61 (1995). Based loosely on the biological structure of neurons firing in the brain, neural networks consist of “layers” of “nodes.” Id. 59  Butler Inter view, supra note 58. Butler in particular focused on Generative  Adversarial Networks (GANs). Ian J. Goodfellow et al., Generative Adversarial Networks, Cornell U. (June 10, 2014), https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661. GANs consist of a generator neural network and a discriminator neural network that are pitted against one another in order to anonymize data. Alec Radford et al., Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks, Cornell U. (Jan. 7, 2016), https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434; Tim Salimans et al., Improved Techniques for Training GANs, Cornell U. (June 10, 2016), https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03498. The generator is tasked with creating data instances and the discriminator tries to determine whether the new data instance is generated data or real data from the training dataset. Using GANs, an agency may be able to generate and release synthetic data. 60  Go v’t Accountability Office, GAO-18-544, Tax Fraud and Noncompliance  5 (2018). The RRP system ingests a wide range of data, from taxpayer and employer filings to federal and state prison records, and it uses a mix of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models to generate fraud risk scores for all national individual tax returns claiming a refund.

Indeed, one explanation for that shift, achieved via legislatively created private rights of action and whistleblower schemes, is a legislative desire to surface privately held information about misconduct while alleviating strain on public budgets.

Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 104Endnotes to Part II. Case Studies:  Informal Adjudication at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office 1 See 5 U .S.C. §§ 551(6), (7) (2018) (defining an adjudication as the process  for formulating an order, which is a final disposition “in a matter other than  rule making but including licensing”). 2 Due to the v ariety and lack of standard procedures, it is challenging to  report “case volume” for such decisions across the administrative state. Verkuil provided a rough estimate that 90% of federal agency adjudication is informal. Paul R. Verkuil, A Study of Informal Adjudication Procedures, 43 U. Chi. L. Rev. 739, 741 (1976). To be sure, Verkuil distinguished between formal adjudications under the APA and included Type B adjudications in informal adjudication. Id. This might mean that the 90% figure is an upper bound, but there is little rigorous data to support the fraction of all instances of adjudication that are informal. Id. 3  Michael Asimo w, Admin. Conference of the U.S., Evidentiary Hearings  Outside the Administrative Procedure Act 4 (2016). . We hence also implicitly adopt Asimow’s typology: “The term ‘informal adjudication’ should be reserved for Type C adjudication in which decisions are not required to be based on evidentiary hearings.” Id. at 3. 4  35 U.S.C. § 1 (2018) (es tablishing the USPTO).

It must  be pristine; [but] NLP doesn’t come anywhere close to that.” Additionally, it, perhaps, bears repeating that classical rule-based techniques for NLP may be more suitable for generating causal hypotheses, but they do not have high performance on prediction tasks. On the other hand, machine learning techniques that benefit from the large FDA datasets, such as neural network methods, may successfully uncover patterns and statistical relationships in the data. But these are typically less interpretable, and causal inference is even more difficult than with more structured rule-based systems. Together, this can create something of a regulatory catch-22 where performance and understanding are inversely proportional. 52  Hatim,  supra note 37, at 1, 22. 53 Use of Natur al Language Processing to Extract Information from Clinical  Text, U.S. Food & Drug Admin.

According to one FDA official, “We have the best AI researchers but . . . we’re stuck [due to various practical barriers].” Another official noted that the FDA has very good fellows and that, although pay may be a barrier for some, there are individuals working at FDA, including career officials and those with statistical backgrounds, who have taken to AI/ML. 56  Hatim,  supra note 37, at 22. 57 The critical import ance of standardized or otherwise fit-for-purpose data  is also something we heard from officials across a number of federal agencies.

If the purpose of rulemaking is to sharpen an agency’s analysis—that is, to improve the agency’s analytic rationality—then even purely bot-generated comments, separate from any type of political elite or grassroots mobilization effort, should be welcomed. If, however, the aim of rulemaking is to provide a measure of the weight of public support—that is, to serve a plebiscitory function—then bot-generated comments presumptively lack any value.

(2017), http://www.jpuigcerver.net/pubs/jpuigcerver_icdar2017.pdf . There has been some  work on extracting figures and charts from PDF documents, as well as classifying those figures (for example, to distinguish bar-charts from pie-charts). However, current AI techniques are not equipped to understand what a figure is meant to represent. See Yan Liu et al., Review of Chart Recognition in Document Images, 8654 Visualization & Data Analysis 1, 1 (2013), https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/8654/865410/Review-of-chart-recognition-in-document-images/10.1117/12.2008467.full?SSO=1.  7  Additionally, e ven when building a particular tool may not require an  immediate legacy system update, expanding those tools or integrating with other systems can require infrastructure upgrades. For example, the IRS is considering integrating its Return Revenue Program with an older linear scoring algorithm, the Discriminant Inventory Function System. Interview with Jeff Butler, Director of Research Databases, Internal Revenue Serv. (Feb. 11, 2019) (on file with author) [hereinafter Butler Interview]. Unsupervised models are designed to find latent patterns in unlabeled data (i.e., data for which there is “no associated response yi” for observations of xi). The IRS conducted its first audits using the Discriminant Inventory Function (DIF) System in 1969, which significantly increased the agency’s audit efficiency. William J. Hunter & Michael A. Nelson, An IRS Production Function, 49 Nat’l Tax J. 105, 108-09 (1996). The DIF was developed with the data provided from the Taxpayer Compliance Measurement Program that began operating in 1964, reviewed delinquent returns and accounts, and conducted detailed field audits. Combining programs at widely differing levels of technological maturity can require significant resources, and agencies should identify and upgrade legacy systems early on in order to avoid future setbacks. As an alternative, agencies may be able to build on top of existing technology by working closely with developers to design prototypes with existing systems in mind. Agencies such as the SEC and SSA have in some cases sought to integrate their tools with existing agency technology.8 Presentation at “A Roundtable Discussion on the Use of Artificial Int  elligence in the Federal Administrative Process,” NYU School of Law  (Feb. 25, 2019). Other agencies face the same challenge in upgrading legacy systems. Many applications used by the SSA, for example, utilize a programming language (COBOL) which was standardized 30 years ago and is now unfamiliar to most developers. As it transitions to modern languages like Java, the SSA has struggled to find personnel familiar with both languages. See Amelia Brust, SSA on Track to Modernize IT Systems Over Next Five Years, Fed. News Network (Apr. 17, 2018), https://federalnewsnetwork.com/it-modernization-month-2018/2018/04/social-security-on-schedule-to-modernize-it-systems-by/.

For  instance, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-191, 110 Stat. 1936 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18, 26, 29 and 42 U.S.C.), sets forth privacy and security standards for protecting personal health information. Other sectoral laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA), the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). 11  Computer Ma tching and Privacy Protection Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(b), (e)(3)  (2018). 12 See id. a t §§ 552a(a)(8), 552a(o)-(r). In particular, 5 U.S.C. § 552a(p)  requires independent verification before “adverse action” can be taken or, for information regarding the identification and amount of benefits granted, that “there is a high degree of confidence” in the information’s accuracy, while 5 U.S.C. § 552a(p)(3)(A) requires “notice from such agency containing a statement of its findings and informing the individual of the opportunity to contest such findings.” That said, the Privacy Act might be thought weak because its exemption for “routine uses” creates a loophole, permitting an array of data-sharing subject only to the requirement that an agency publish an entry in the Federal Register describing the use and, more generally, a “system of records” notice. 5 U.S.C. § 552a(e)(4)(D). 13  See P aperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. § 101. 14 44 U.S.C. § 3516 no te (2000) (requiring agency action to ensure the  “quality, objectivity, utility, and integrity of information”). 15 See, e.g.,  Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and  Documentation (TREAD) Act, Pub. L. No. 106-414, 114 Stat. 1800 (2000) (amending various provisions of 49 U.S.C. §§ 30101-30170 to require manufacturer disclosure of certain defect information in response to Congressional concern over high-profile tire defects). 16  See, e.g.,  Transportation Recall Enhancement, Accountability and  Documentation (TREAD) Act, Pub.

The agency could fully structure the input form, requiring complainants to select from a series of dropdown menus. However, this could extend or complicate the submission process or sacrifice information that cannot fit into a structured format. Furthermore, not all data should be standardized. The development team behind HHS Accelerate, a central procurement system, pointed out its decision to retain the divergent labeling schemes.

These direct hire positions are still subject to public notice requirements and prioritized hiring requirements for displaced agency employees. Agencies may hire employees under the direct hiring authority for a four-year period, renewable for up to eight years. 34  In det ermining the right metrics, agencies should avoid focusing  disproportionately on “quantifiable” projects. For example, CMS would benefit greatly from tools that identify types of fraud that humans have failed to consistently identify or do not have the capacity to monitor—yet the impact of such a tool would be difficult to quantify as compared to a tool that simply makes existing human processes more efficient. CMS has acknowledged that a Fraud Prevention System assessed based on return on investment could lead to biased enforcement: the program may more easily detect money from local providers who do not possess sophisticated offshore networks for hiding their ill-gotten gains.

Servs. 16 (2014), https://www.cms.gov/About-CMS/Components/CPI/Widgets/Fraud_Prevention_System_2ndYear.pdf . A return-on-investment system  is likely to prioritize such easily recoverable fraud, which the CMS notes is, “an undesirable result, given both types of fraud have no place.” Id. at iii. 35  Meredith Somers,  FPS 2.0 More User-Friendly, But Not for Medicare Frauds,  Fed.

Kaminski, Binary Go  vernance: Lesson’s from GDPR’s Approach to Algorithmic  Accountability, 92 S. Cal. L. Rev. 24, n.125 (forthcoming 2020). For those who advocate a move away from individual-level conceptions of transparency or remedial approaches, see Joshua A. Kroll et al., Accountable Algorithms, 165 U. Pa. L. Rev. 633, 661 (2017); Deven R. Desai & Joshua A. Kroll, Trust But Verify: A Guide to Algorithms and the Law , 31 Harv.

Rev. 1503 (2013); Mike Ananny & Kate Crawford, Seeing Without Knowing: Limitations of the Transparency Ideal and Its Application to Algorithmic Accountability, 20 New Media & Soc’y 973, 980 (2018). “Accountability by design” is a riff on “privacy by design,” an influential movement in privacy law circles to stimulate a “philosophy and approach of embedding privacy in the design specifications of various technologies.” See Ann Cavoukian, Privacy by Design 1 (2009), https://www.ipc.on.ca/wp-content/uploads/Resources/7foundationalprinciples.pdf . Part  of the explanation for this trend in thinking is the impossibility of full transparency over a specific decision’s provenance. Part of it arises out of a standard set of observations about the limits of private, litigation-centered enforcement by rights-bearing individuals. See, e.g., David Freeman Engstrom, Agencies as Litigation Gatekeepers, 123 Yale L.J. 616 (2013) (reviewing literature on pros and cons of private enforcement); Stephen B. Burbank & Sean Farhang, Rights and Retrenchment: The Counterrevolution Against Federal Litigation (2017) (reviewing constriction of private enforcement as a regulatory mode through legislation, procedural rulemaking, and judicial decisions). But the trend also grows out of a more general recognition that one-off, ex post challenges to decisions, even if numerous and leveled at regular intervals, may not reach systemic sources of error and so may not be as effective as internally driven, critically reflective system design at the outset, before a model is running, and continued systemic monitoring, testing, and experimentation thereafter. See Kaminski, supra, at 1558; Kroll et al., supra, at 640. For a more general argument for why individual, rights-based enforcement may be insufficient to correct systemic error within mass adjudicatory systems, see Daniel E. Ho, Cassandra Handan-Nader, David Ames & David Marcus, Quality Review of Mass Adjudication: A Randomized Natural Experiment at the Board of Veterans Appeals, 2003-16, 35 J.L. ECON. & ORG. 239 (2019). Deirdre K. Mulligan & Kenneth A. Bamberger, Saving Governance-by-Design, 106 Cal. L. Rev. 697, 759 (2018) (“Existing governance institutions often lack these tools, and substantive regulatory capacity—breadth of authority, competence, and vision on the one hand, and expertise on the other—must be built to support the rational use of technology to govern.”).  49  Among the tools are: or ganizing code into testable modules; writing  and running test cases; and incorporating code that crashes a system when it encounters an error rather than continuing in an errant state and automatically generates audit logs. See Kroll et al., supra note 48, at 644-56; see also Danielle Keats Citron, Technological Due Process, 85 Wash. L. Rev. 1249, 1277, 1305, 1310 (2008) (offering a similar set of prescriptions, including coding of “audit trails” and testing prior to implementation). Testing can take static (observational) and dynamic (testing with natural and synthetic inputs) forms. One of the more interesting arguments for “internal” constraints on algorithmic decision-making is that, while marquee uses of algorithmic decisions systems—e.g., the criminal justice context—will draw certain judicial scrutiny. Indeed, they already have. But algorithmic decision-making in less hot-button areas may evade review, creating a slow burn of biased or arbitrary decisions that, in aggregate, exact a significant toll but are not salient enough to attract judicial or other challenges.

Government by Algorithm: Artificial Intelligence in Federal Administrative Agencies 118Transparency and Accountability 51 This norm perv ades American administrative law, both in the  Administrative Procedure Act, see 5 U.S.C. § 557(c)(3)(A) (2018) (“All  [agency] decisions [with respect to procedures requiring a hearing] . . . shall include a statement of . . . findings and conclusions, and the reasons or basis therefor . . . .”), and in judicial decisions, see Judulang v. Holder, 565 U.S. 42, 45 (2011) (“When an administrative agency sets policy, it must provide a reasoned explanation for its action.”); FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., 556 U.S. 502, 515 (2009) (noting “the requirement that an agency provide reasoned explanation for its action”). Similar versions can be found in many Western legal systems. See Henrik Palmer Olsen et al., What’s in the Box? The Legal Requirement of Explainability in Computationally Aided Decision-Making in Public Administration, 162 iCourts Working Paper Series 14-22 (2019). 52  See, e.g.,  Jenna Burrell, How the Machine “Thinks”: Understanding Opacity  in Machine Learning Algorithms, 3 Big Data & Soc’y 1 (2016). 53 A more r obust accounting of a decision’s provenance would also convey  the minimum change necessary to yield a different outcome and provide an explanation for similar cases with different outcomes and different cases with similar outcomes. See Finale Doshi-Velez et al., Accountability of AI Under the Law: The Role of Explanation, Cornell U. (Nov. 3, 2017), https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.01134. For a real-world example, the Fair Credit Reporting Act requires credit reporting firms to disclose to consumers the four factors driving their credit score ranked in order of significance. 15 U.S.C. § 1681g(f)(1) (2018).  54  In addition, and contr ary to common perception, algorithmic tools are  human-machine “assemblages,” not self-executing creations. Ananny & Crawford, supra note 48, at 983. Analysts must make myriad decisions, including how to partition data, what model types to specify, what datasets, target variables, and data features to use, and how much to tune the model.

Hearing Rights and Algorithmic  Governance 108 See, e.g., Goss v. Lopez, 419 U.S. 565 (1975) (requiring minimal due  pr ocess before suspending a student). 109 As no ted in Part II’s case studies of the SSA and PTO, the APA creates  two types of adjudication: those subject to §§ 554-557 of the APA, and those subject to § 555 alone. See 5 U.S.C. § 554-557 (2012). The former cluster of APA provisions imposes three main requirements that apply in so-called “formal” adjudications: agency notice to affected persons; the opportunity for those persons to submit facts and arguments at a “hearing” before the agency, whether live or on papers; and, presiding at any live hearing an administrative law judge, or ALJ. We previously noted that these hearings are often referred to as “Type A” hearings. “Informal” adjudication is governed by the minimum requirements of Due Process and § 555, which requires that an agency allow affected persons to be represented by counsel and issue subpoenas for a party. We previously noted that these hearings are often referred to as “Type C” hearings. A third category of hearings, referred to previously as “Type B” hearings, are typically defined in an agency’s organic statute and can vary significantly in their procedural requirements, from something approaching Type A’s trial-like proceeding to something far more “informal” in procedural make-up. 110  Tom R.

Regulatory mechanisms designed to achieve transparency and accountability can likewise have a distributive cast. As just one example, erasure rights—that is, the “right to be forgotten” at the heart of the GDPR—are not costless to invoke and may be far more likely exercised by well-heeled individuals with an economic incentive to expunge negative information.

Donahue, The Transformation of Government Work:  Causes, Consequences, and Distortions, in Government by Contract:  Outsourcing and American Democracy 41, 49 (Jody Freeman & Martha Minow eds., 2009); Jody Freeman & Martha Minow, Introduction in id., 2. Creaming occurs when a service provider strategically privileges subjects for interventions who generate the greatest increase within agreed-upon metrics. Shirking (or, in economics, shading) is where a contractor takes advantage of fuzzy contract terms by reducing quality in ways that violate the spirit but not the letter of the contract. Note that this discussion maintains generality to yield simplicity. However, the public management literature further distinguishes between different types of contracting and outputs—for instance, “public-private contracting” (defined as private provision of governance services) and “direct service provision” (defined as private provision of services to third-party beneficiaries). See, e.g., Jody Freeman, The Contracting State, 28 Fla. St. L. Rev. 155, 165 (2000). 154  See Wendy Ne tter Epstein, Contract Theory and the Failures of PublicPrivate Contracting, 34 Cardozo L. Rev. 2211, 2222 (2013). 155 There has been some work on ex tracting figures and charts from  PDF documents, as well as classifying those figures (for example, to distinguish bar-charts from pie-charts). However, current AI techniques are not equipped to understand what a figure represents.
