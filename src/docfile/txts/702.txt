Strategy 1: Make long-term investments in AI resear ch. Recommendation: Boost non-defense AI R&D budgets, particularly on AI-related infrastructure,  to support long-term investments. A long-term commitment to sustained federal research and development (R&D) funding in AI is  critical to advance the United States’  leadership in global innovation. The federal government  should increase non-defense investment in AI and basic research to strengthen research in critical  fields of AI R&D, including healthcare, education, finance, and more, that underpin economic  stability and robust growth. Such investment should reflect a multidisciplinary approach, focused on advancing basic and applied R&D, research on AI governance and norm-setting, and  supporting research infrastructure with multi-agency collaboration. Current federal funding for non-defense AI R&D, however , does not meet the needs of the  fast-growing AI field. The public non-defense AI R&D budget requested by 25 federal agencies  participating in the Networking and Information Technology Research and Development  (NITRD) program and the National Artificial Intelligence Initiative in FY  2022 represents an  increase of just 8.8 percent over what was spent in FY  2021. 1 In contrast, the National Security  Commission on Artificial Intelligence (NSCAI) recommended in its final report to increase  public funding for AI R&D at compounding levels, doubling annually to reach $32 billion per  year by FY  2026. 2 Federal long-term non-defense investments—and high return-on-investment basic research funding 3 —can address the challenges the AI innovation ecosystem is currently facing in the  United States. For example, the high cost of compute and the lack of access to critical data are hindering ef forts by academic researchers to engage in cutting-edge AI R&D. 4 The federal  government is lagging behind the private sector on AI development, and federal standards for  technical and ethical AI are sorely needed. 5 Long-term public investment in AI-related  infrastructure can strengthen AI R&D by supporting a variety of federal initiatives, including the  National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource (NAIRR) that aims to expand access to  “critical resources and educational tools that will spur AI innovation and economic prosperity  nationwide.” 6 Another example of such an initiative is the Multilateral AI Research Institute  (MAIRI), recommended by the NSCAI report, that would “facilitate joint ef forts to develop  technologies that advance responsible, human-centric, and privacy-preserving AI/machine  learning (ML) that better societies and allow allies to pool their talents and resources.” 7 7 Schmidt et al., “Final Report.” 6 “The Biden Administration Launches the National Artificial Intelligence Research Resource Task Force,” The White House (The United States  Government, June 10, 2021), https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2021/06/10/the-biden-administration-launches-the-national-  artificial-intelligence-research-resource-task-force/ . 5 David Freeman Engstrom, Daniel E.

Strategy 2: Develop effective methods for  human-AI collaboration. Recommendation: Increase support for interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary AI research on  human-AI collaboration that expands beyond exclusively technical research. Intentionally building trustworthy AI that is unbiased and supportive of human flourishing is  crucial to ensuring the successful development and deployment of human-centered AI. A key  part of that ef fort requires an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary approach, involving  collaboration from a variety of fields to develop the hardware and software, to understand and design for people’ s behaviors and expectations when interacting with AI in dif ferent institutional  contexts, and to establish policies and regulations to determine human responsibilities as well as the required domain knowledge for various applications. A human-centric approach to AI calls  for wide-ranging collaboration among multiple disciplines. Harnessing the potential of AI with  rapidly growing capabilities while addressing its impact on existing structural inequalities and biases cannot rely on the voices of computer scientists and engineers alone. Yet current policies do not necessarily match this need. The National Science Foundation  program on algorithmic fairness, for instance, calls for interdisciplinary perspectives while stating that “this program supports the conduct of fundamental computer science research” and requiring the PI to “bring computer science expertise to the research.” 8 But producing  fairness-aware algorithms or just understanding the concept of fairness requires knowledge and expertise outside the computer science field to incorporate the social and legal contexts in which AI systems will be deployed. 9 The federal government should expand the support of  multidisciplinary AI research for human-AI collaboration to include critical academic fields such  as the social sciences, law , ethics, and the humanities—all of which should have a prominent  voice in providing the necessary frameworks for understanding AI today and in the future. Strategy 3: Understand and Addr ess the Ethical, Legal, and Societal Implications of AI. With respect to recommendations for Strategy 3, please refer to the Stanford HAI letter submitted in January 2022 in response to the White House Of fice of Science and Technology  proposal for an AI Bill of Rights that safeguards the American public against powerful  technologies. 10 Strategy 4: Ensur e the Safety and Security of AI Systems. Recommendation: Develop appropriate acquisition strategies and update existing procurement regulations to respond to AI procurement and acquisition challenges in the federal government. Public sector AI can rely heavily on contracting and procurement with external vendors to build  up technical capacity . Research shows that almost half of identified use cases of federal  agencies’  use of AI came from external sources, with one-third coming from private commercial 10 Michele Elam and Rob Reich, “Stanford HAI Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights,” Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial  Intelligence, January 2022, https://hai.stanford.edu/white-paper-stanford-hai-artificial-intelligence-bill-rights . 9 Andrew D. Selbst et al., “Fairness and Abstraction in Sociotechnical Systems,” Proceedings of the Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and  Transparency (January 2019): 59-68, https://doi.org/10.1145/3287560.3287598 . 8 “NSF Program on Fairness in Artificial Intelligence in Collaboration with Amazon (FAI),” The National Science Foundation, 2021,  https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2021/nsf21585/nsf21585.htm . 3
sources via the procurement process. 11 Compared to the internal sourcing of AI systems that may  be more policy-compliant and more accountable, the uses of procured AI in government raise  several concerns in terms of AI trustworthiness, transparency , and safety . The federal acquisition  regulation (F AR), for example, provides strong IP  protection for vendors. 12 But such protections  can obscure certain information about the inputs their tools use and how the tools operate behind trade secrecy claims, which in turn prevents appropriate analysis, audit, and testing to ensure the fairness of their use. 13 Moreover , those protections may also create uncertainty for acquisition  aimed at the black-box nature of AI systems. F AR makes a clear distinction between rights to  “software” and rights to “data,” but AI systems, particularly machine learning (ML), integrate  customer software with the new data generated in the process of training, and current procurement policies do not suf ficiently address how rights to that data and the resulting AI  systems are to be distributed, and under what constraints and conditions. 14 The federal government should develop appropriate acquisition strategies and update existing procurement regulations to help address some of the public sector ’s challenges in evaluating,  monitoring, and using AI systems. 15 Specific examples include developing clear standards that  call for the disclosure of data and information on the design and operation of contractors’ algorithms, requirements that ensure contractors adhere to ethical AI standards, and testing  infrastructures that allow for iterative testing and evaluation. 16 Strategy 5: Develop shar ed public datasets and envir onments for  AI training and testing. Recommendation: Expand government data access to academic researchers to train AI models  and develop frameworks for government agencies to evaluate such datasets and their applications in tandem. While there are publicly available resources for AI development, there is still more work to be  done to promote the open and collaborative non-commercial use of training and testing data and environments. For example, access to data resources suf ficient for training AI systems is  increasingly limited to lar ge private companies, which in turn direct resources toward developing  applications with a focus on private profit instead of public interest. 17 Because lar ge platforms  have unequaled access to data for AI development, smaller actors, some of which may  legitimately lack the financial resources to invest in building training data from scratch, are incentivized to mine the public sphere for data, violating individual privacy expectations and creating privacy risks both for individuals and society at lar ge. At the same time, there are 17 Jathan Sadowski, “When Data Is Capital: Datafication, Accumulation, and Extraction,” Big Data & Society (January 2019),  https://doi.org/10.1177/2053951718820549 ; Ho et al., “Building a National AI Research Resource.” 16 Engstrom et al., “Government by Algorithm.”; Lavi M.

significant barriers for interagency and external researchers to access a rich portfolio of public sector data (e.g., employment, healthcare, education). 18 As a starting point, the executive branch can use the NAIRR as an opportunity to make more and better quality government data available to the research community at no cost. 19 In doing so, the  federal government should weigh considerations such as privacy , security , and fairness, and it  should begin to develop its own frameworks for evaluating such datasets and their applications in tandem, informed by important developments under the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act of 2018 and the National Secure Data Service. Considering the lack of a  standardized framework to test and evaluate AI models for safety and security , the government  should pursue creating a testing environment for this purpose, especially for government-procured AI systems. 20 Strategy 6: Measur e and evaluate AI technologies thr ough standards and benchmarks. Recommendations:  ● Establish a mechanism to evaluate AI models within the exact context of their intended  use to ensure safe deployment.  ● Designate NIST  in collaboration with other federal agencies to benchmark AI models in  institutional contexts. Understanding the true in-domain accuracy , or the accuracy of AI systems’  deployment in  specific contexts (e.g., in dif ferent industries, with dif ferent subpopulation groups), is crucial for  the federal government to capture the capabilities of the technology and ensure safe deployment. Many current performance evaluations do not comprehensively assess how AI systems would  perform in a real-world context. 21 Object recognition systems, for example, are often evaluated  against lar ge-scale benchmark datasets to validate their performance, but such datasets are  limited in their coverage of non-W estern contexts and temporally bounded, capturing only parts  of the real world. 22 The same gap is observed in language models where these state-of-the-art  systems amplify human bias and discriminate against minority users, and their performance degrades when given out-of-domain text. 23 All told, the accuracy of AI systems in one domain  does not automatically translate to its uses in other domains, and changing context can significantly impact performance. 23 Kawin Ethayarajh and Dan Jurafsky, “Utility Is in the Eye of the User: A Critique of NLP Leaderboards,” Proceedings of the 2020 Conference  on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), 2020, https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.393 .; Thomas Manzini et  al., “Black Is to Criminal as Caucasian Is to Police: Detecting and Removing Multiclass Bias in Word Embeddings,” Proceedings of the 2019  Conference of the North , 2019, https://doi.org/10.18653/v1/n19-1062 . 22 Raji et al., “AI and the Everything in the Whole Wide World Benchmark.” 21 Inioluwa Deborah Raji et al., “AI and the Everything in the Whole Wide World Benchmark,” arXiv.org, November 26, 2021,  https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15366 . 20 Note that we recommend government agencies withhold certain data to allow sufficient testing. For example, NIST’s Face Recognition Vendor  Test (FRVT) challenge does not provide training images because "  the tests seek to mimic operational reality and, there, algorithms are almost  always shipped and used ‘as is’ without any training or adaptation to customer data.” Read “Face Recognition Vendor Test  Ongoing–Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs),” National Institute of Standards and Technology, November 6, 2019,  https://www.nist.gov/system/files/documents/2019/04/22/frvt_frequently_asked_questions.pdf ; Avrim Blum and Moritz Hardt, “The Ladder: A  Reliable Leaderboard for Machine Learning Competitions,” arXiv.org, February 16, 2015, https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04585 .

The White House should consider a proposal to char ge the National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST), in collaboration with federal agencies that have regulatory oversight for AI-powered products, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Consumer  Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration  (NHTSA), to develop improved AI benchmarking protocols. 24 Such benchmarks should  explicitly address and incorporate the institutional contexts in which the AI systems are  developed (e.g., commercial settings) and deployed (e.g., border control). NIST  should also  consider how to measure the ef fectiveness of deploying AI in real-world settings where enabling  technologies (e.g., cameras, microphones, computing hardware) and other factors may vary . For  instance, one field experiment of an earlier generation of predictive policing algorithms found that models that worked well in the lab did not perform well in the field, failing to reduce crime when used in context. 25 However , it should do so from a human-centered perspective grounded in  ethical frameworks, such as privacy by design, and not focus exclusively on identifying technical benchmarks. This requirement suggests a potentially dif ferent set of roles and expertise than  NIST  has had in the past. Strategy 7: Better  understand the national AI R&D workfor ce needs. Recommendations:  ● Update immigration policies to attract talent in AI and other technical fields.  ● Develop federal programs to hire AI talent and re-skill civil servants with both technical  capacity and institutional knowledge. Future U.S. leadership in AI hinges on the country having the necessary talent-generation  process and hiring pipeline—as well as the ability to attract and retain talent that already exists. The country needs individuals who are not only equipped with the skills to build AI systems, but  who also know when, where, and how to ask the right questions when such systems pose risks to individuals and society and/or break the law . While not every AI expert has or should have a  technical background, understanding the technology is essential to designing and implementing accountable AI initiatives. Such talent could also be a useful tool of accountability , helping  design and maintain transparent, auditable, and responsible systems as well as engaging with stakeholders to ensure trustworthiness in AI systems. 26 This could include expediting the hiring  process for certain kinds of AI talent, 27 updating immigration policies to attract and retain 27 See, e.g., problems hiring young tech talent: Jack Corrigan, “The Government’s Struggle to Hire Young Tech Talent Is Worse Than You  Thought,” Nextgov , December 1, 2017, https://www.nextgov.com/cio-briefing/2017/12/governments-struggle-hire-young-tech-talent-worse-you-  thought/144225/ . 26 Engstrom et al., “Government by Algorithm.” 25 Daniel E.

technical talent, 28 and expanding opportunities for permanent residency to those with AI and  other technical degrees, as well as opportunities for entrepreneurs. 29 Improving public sector capacity can be essential to accountability and oversight to ensure AI  systems are (or are not) built and deployed in ways that promote, rather than degrade, the public interest. Currently , the federal government faces numerous challenges in hiring AI talent,  including competing with private-sector salaries and benefits, competing with shorter private-sector hiring timelines, and enticing applicants who face an onerous and often confusing federal hiring process versus an often faster and easier one in industry or civil society . 30 The  White House should work on its own, as well as with Congress and with industry partners, to identify the biggest challenges in attracting AI talent to the government and ways to potentially  resolve them. Several agencies have initiated such ef forts. In 2019, the Of fice of Personnel  Management (OPM) established a classification of information technology (IT) positions to ease the hiring burden of the federal government’ s competitive service and the “direct hire”  appointing authority for several STEM and IT  positions for agencies with critical hiring needs. 31 In 2021, the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) launched a two-year fellowship aimed  at placing early-career software engineers, data scientists, and others with technical skills in federal agencies. 32 Finally , it bears mentioning that the government should take a long-term view to developing  future AI talent and expertise by investing in technical skills development in primary and  secondary education through STEM-focused educational initiatives. Strategy 8: Expand public-private partnerships to accelerate advances in AI. Recommendation: Strengthen partnerships with academic institutions and build a framework for a public-university-industry AI R&D ecosystem to drive AI development forward. The federal workforce to date can still lack appropriate training in AI to use it ef fectively in  public operations and to dischar ge regulatory responsibilities. A Government Business Council  and Accenture survey found that more than 60 percent of federal employee respondents worry about the “lack of technical support and user training” for public AI deployment. 33 An evaluation  of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)’ s facial recognition program used at air exit by  the Government Accountability Of fice (GAO) found that agents on the ground received little 33 Kristen Vaughan, Britaini Carroll, and Michael R.

training to use a feature of the system. 34 Not only does this undermine agencies trying to carry  out their missions, but individuals using AI systems without appropriate training can also create  or exacerbate threats to privacy , civil liberties, and even safety . Supporting AI education and  research in the university environment can help address some of the government’ s talent  problems and help fill the talent pipeline for the public sector . This kind of government-academic collaboration in scientific and technological areas can also fuel innovation. For example, after World War II, the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs (V A)  collaborated with academic institutions (specifically medical centers) to meet the increasing medical needs of returning veterans. 35 The collaboration between academic medicine and the VA  helped to revolutionize VA healthcare and spurred innovation in healthcare at many levels,  including, for instance, the invention of pacemakers and CA T scan prototypes. 36 * * * * As lead authors, we proudly submit this response on behalf of our colleagues and the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI).
