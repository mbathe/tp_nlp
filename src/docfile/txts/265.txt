The European Union  (EU) ,  however , approaches  AI primarily from an economic, social, and  regulatory angle. This paper discusses the way that AI  im pa cts   the European Union’s geopolitical power and its relationshi p  with other  countries.  It presents possible scenarios for how AI  may change the  international balance of power and  recommends ways for the EU and its M ember  States  to respond.

Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      5 PE 662.926  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   Background   There is widespread agreement that a rtificial intelligence will shape the future. The use of machine  learning technologies promises to revolutionise many sectors, transform business and the labour  market , and change the way research is done. This is well understood in Europe and throughout the  EU states are working on ways to strengthen their AI ecosystem, integra te AI in the private sector , and  support the use of AI in the public sector . The EU institutions are working at regulating AI, most recently  by proposing  the world’s first comprehensive plan to regulate artificial intelligence1, as well as through  a focus on trustworthy and ethical AI.   Unfortunately, while the economic, and to some extent the social repercussion s of the increasing use  of AI are understood in Europe , one area is largely ignored: the way that AI influences global po litics   and the global balance of power, and how AI may contribute to a reordering of international politics.   Aim   This study aims to support the work of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age   (AIDA)  by provid ing an analysis  of the geopolitical impact of AI. It discusses the way that AI impacts the  European Union’s geopolitical power and its relationship with other countries.   Six areas are being discussed through which AI may change the international balance of power :   • AI’s role in Sino -American competition;   • AI’s use for authoritarian control and weakening of democracy;   • AI nationalism;   • AI’s contribution to the rise in power of the private sector versus the state;   • AI’s impact on military power and the defence sector; and finally ,   • the possibility of a development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) with potentially wide ranging repercussions.   The EU will need to find answers to all these challenges, and , after an analysis of the (largely lacki ng)  current take of Member States  this topic,  this study recommends ways for the EU and its members to  respond.                                                                     1  Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence , European Commission , April 2021, https://digital strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal -regulation -laying -down -harmonised -rules -artificial -intelligence -artificial -intelligence .  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.926  6  1. INTRODUCTION   In the United States  (US) , a narrative has emerged: a rtificial intelligence will be a defining element of  geopolitical power, impacting heavily on the outcome of the great power competition between the US  and China, and  on the global balance of power more broadly. In 2018, the US Congress set up the  "National Security Commission on AI ". The commission’s final report was published in March 2021 and  presented a strategy for " winning the artificial intelligence era ". It noted that " AI systems will be used  in the pursuit of power "2. In August 2019, former US statesman and policymaker Henry Kissinger,  together with former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and the academic Daniel Huttenlocher, warned in T he  Atlantic that AI could develop new weapons, strategies, and military tactics and thus undermine or  cancel the exi sting military balance of power3. Russian President Vladimir Putin was an early adherent  of the ‘AI is power’ narrative, noting back in 2017 that " artificial intelligence is the future, not only for  Russia, but for all humankind. […]  Whoever becomes the leader in this sphere wil l become the ruler of  the world "4. Beijing’s 2017 AI plan fores ees overtaking the West by 20255. A global "AI race " has been  declared – although the term and underlying idea has been criticised by many experts6.                                                                 2  US National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, Final Report, March 2021, https://reports.nscai.gov/final -report/table -ofcontents/ .   3  Henry A.

Kania on Artificial Intelligence and Great Power KEY RECOMMENDATIONS   • The EU should establish a European Security Commission on AI whose members  should be drawn from different EU Member States , the private s ector, and civil society.  The Commission should analyse the impact of AI on European security and devel op  recommendations  on how to address  the security challenges created by AI.   • The EU should establish a European research centre which focuses on the AI -related  questions that are of immediate relevance to Europe. It could serve as a hub for the  burgeoning community of European researchers working on these themes in different  European states. It should also help educate policymakers, for example through shor t  trainings and regular engagement with relevant institutions and decision- makers.   • The EU and Europeans should work closely with the US. The study dis cusses some  difficulties in transatlantic cooperation on AI, but proposes a range of areas in whi c h  the EU  and the US can work closely together.   • The EU should keep its focus on ethical and trustworthy  AI and work to promote and  further disseminate this approach in other countries.   • The EU should encourage Member States to publish military AI strategies, in order to  allow for a harmonisation of approaches. Those EU members that are members of  NATO should work within NATO to ensure interoperability among the allies.  
Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      7 PE 662.926  Europe, however, approaches this  challenge  differently. A 2021 poll found that only 11% of Europeans  consider the risk from the technologies as one the main global challenges for the future of the EU, thus  ranking  it second -to-last of all options7. Nevertheless , EU institutions are active in the d igital space. The  Commission has proclaimed the " digital decade ", it works on a " digital compass ", and aims to become  a "global digital player "8. Discussions  about "European Digital Sovereignty " abound9. In April 2021, the  Commission unveiled the world’s first comprehensive plan to r egulate artificial intelligence10. There is  the Digital Services Act, the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Decade, the Cyber -Security Strategy, the  Data Strategy and more. After t he Gen eral Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR ), from 2018, the EU is  doubling down on its role as a global rulemaker on technology  and wants to take the global lead in  that area. However  it does not want to engage in the power politics increasingly associate d with AI.   Can Europe, can the EU, stay out of this apparent geopolitical power struggle over AI, ignore the  rhetoric, and focus on regulation? As tempting as this may sound, it seems unlikely – and might be  unadvisable – for two reasons.   First, the tech nological is geopolitical. AI regulation may sound like a boring topic for bureaucrats.  However  it is also a geopolitical battleground, as is technology development and technology adopti on  more generally. Breaking up US technology companies at a moment in which the US is fighting for  supremacy with China is a geopolitical act. Excluding Chinese telecommunication firms from European  networks is a geopolitical decision. Europe’s actions have geopolitical consequences that reach beyond  the union. I n the policy making process, however, this is often overlooked. Policymaking within the EU  is so complex that little time or space is left for anticipating the impact on external actors. If the impac t  on others is acknowledged, it is usually by referencing the " Brussel s effect ", the idea that EU regulation,  through the trade bloc’s market po wer, becomes a model for others11. This is often portrayed like an  automatic effect, rather than something that requires further thought. Generally, there is too little  thinking about international second and third order effects of EU actions.   Second, too little thought is put into the wa y internal EU (in)actions influence the union’s ow n  geopolitical power. Throughout history, technology has transformed economies and societies, has  redistributed (military) power among states, has empowered new actors, and shaped international  relations. However  the EU, for all its pathbreaking work on regulation, does not appear to have ful l y  registered just how geopolitical  today’s digital technologies, including AI are. At the 2020 Munic h  Security Conference, it was painfully obvious that the EU was at b est considered a moderator between  the two real powe rs, the United States and China12. Partly, this geopolitical blind spot is due to  questions of EU competency, but even more it is linked to the way the EU sees itself – despite more  recent rhetoric over a " geopolitical union "13. The EU is a market -driven  entity in which " h igh  po lit ics "                                                                Competition , The Diplomat , 31 December 2019,  https://thediplomat.com/2020/01/elsa -b-kania -on-artificial -inte lligence -and -gre a t power -competition/ ; FLI Podcast: Beyond the Arms Race Narrative: AI & China with Helen Toner & Elsa Kania , Future of Life Institute , 30 August  2019, https://futureoflife.org/2019/08/30/fli -podcast -beyond -the-arms -race -narrative -ai-china -with -helen -toner -elsa -kania/ .   7  Special Eurobarometer 500 - First Results , European Union, 2021,  https://w ww.europarl.europa.eu/at -your -service/files/b e heard/eurobarometer/2021/future -of-europe -2021/en -report.pdf .   8  The Digital Compass, European Union, https://digital -strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/digital -compass ; Brussels Europe's Digital Decade:  Commission sets the course towards a digitally empowered Europe by 2030 , Press release, European Commission, 9 March 2021,  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_21_983 .   9  Carla Hobbs (ed.), Europe’s digital sovereignty: From rulemaker to superpower in the age of US -China rivalry , Essay Collection, ECFR , 30 Ju ly   2020,  https://ecfr.eu/publication/europe_digital_sovereignty_rulemaker_superpower_age_us_china_rivalry/ .   10  Proposal for a Regulation layi ng down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence , European Commission , April 2021, https:// digital strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal -regulation -laying -down -harmonised -rules -artificial -intelligence -artificial -intelligence .   11  Anu Bradford, The Brussels effect: How the European Union rules the world , Oxford University Press, USA, 2020.   12  Ulrike Franke, Upstaged: Europe’s struggles to play the great tech game , ECFR , 25 February 2020,    https://ecfr.eu/article/commentary_upstaged_europes_struggles_to_play_the_great_tech_game/ .   13  Lili Bayer, Meet von der Leyen’s ‘geopolitical Commission ’, Politico , 4 December 2019, https://www.politico.eu/article/mee t -ursula -von -der leyen -geopolitical -commission/ .

However  the Member States   have not picked up the  geopolitical baton on AI. W hile one can see this as one of the many civilisatory   advances of the European Union, the fact remains that while Europe may not want to think about  geopolitics, geopolitics certainly is thinking of Europe.   So even if Europe does not want to adopt the AI power politics narrative , or join the rhetoric about an  AI race , it must take into account the geopolitical implications of AI. It needs to consider the external  dimension of its action, and how to deal with allies, partners, countries it wants to support, and  opponents. The EU nee ds a plan for AI diplomacy.   This paper looks at how AI influences geopolitics and what that means for Europe and the EU. It begi ns  with a short stock -taking: where are we at the moment in terms of AI capabilities (section 2) . It then  dives into the core of the issue, discussing six ways how AI could plausibly, or already is , influenc ing the  global balance of power and Europe’s standing within it  (section 3) . In section 4, it discusses whether  European Member States  are conside ring the issues raised in section 3  and are approaching AI as a  geopolitical topic. The paper ends with recommendations for the EU and its  Member States , aimed at  giving them the right tools to address the challenges they face.     
Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      9 PE 662.926  2. WHERE ARE WE A T THE MOMEN T? EUROPE ’S AI CAPAB ILITIES,  AN OVERVIEW   2.1. Artificial Intelligence – A short primer  Artificial intelligence is an ill -defined term, not least because its meaning has changed over time. AI  refers to efforts to build computers and machines able to perform act ions that one would expec t to  require human intelligence. However, whenever scientists created systems that could perform tasks  thought to be the preserve of humans, AI came to be defined by even more complex tasks. " O nce  something works, we stop calling i t artificial intelligenc e and start calling it software "14.  The field of AI has gone through several cycles of hype and disappointment, with the latter dubbed " AI  winters ". The field is currently enjoying an " AI spring ", with AI development and adoption acc elerating  significantly over recent years. This is due to the increased availability of large data sets, and  technological advances, most notably in computational performance. A 2017 report estimated that 90  percent of the world’s data had been created wit hin the preceding five years. The same period saw a  fifteen -fold growth in the number of developers of graphics processing units ( GPUs) – h a r dwa re cr u cial  for AI15. Together, these developments have led to a significant increase in AI research around the  world, resulting in better algorithms becoming more widely available. This, in turn, has generated more  research into further AI. At the moment, the most important advances in AI are being made through  machine learning techniques, particularly " deep learning " and neural networks. Machine learni ng  systems use computing power to execute algorithms that learn from data16. Three key inputs are crucial  for AI, the " AI Triad " of data, talent (to develop a lgorithms), and computing power17.   Some have called AI an omni -use technology , or general -purpose technology18, as it can be used in  various ways, from helping health -workers interpret x-ray readings , making warehouses run more  efficiently , enable military systems, or support data analysis19. Given this wide range of a pplications, it  is advisable to think of AI not as one technology, but as an enabler and speak of " AI-enabled " systems.   Despite discussions about possible " superintelligence" , today’s AI applications are " narrow ", meaning  that they have perfected doing one specific task, and " brittle ", meaning that they fail when confronted  with tasks that slightly differ from its training. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), capable of  reproducing human- level intelligence over different tasks, remains in the realm of sc ience fiction, with  considerable disagreement among experts on whether and when AGI is likely to emerge (see s ect ion   3.6 below).    AI is often grouped with other "emerging technologies ", which include 5G, quantum computing,  biotechnology, cyber, and more. It can be difficult to keep these apart, as they interact and feed of each                                                                14  Ben Buchanan and Taylor Miller, Machine Learning for Policymakers: What It Is and Why It Matters  (2017),  https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/files/publication/MachineLearningforPolicymakers.pdf .   15  Profiles in Innovation Revisited: AI hardware , Goldman Sachs Equity Research , 11 March 2018, p .7.   16  Ben Buchanan, "The AI Triad and What It Means for National Security Strategy ", CSET , August 2020,  https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp content/uploads/CSET -AI-Triad -Report.pdf .   17  "Profiles in Innovation: Artificial Intelligence: AI, Machine Learning and Data Fuels the Future of Productivity ", Goldman Sachs Research  Unit , 14 November 2016.

Overview of AI development and adoption in the EU   There is a general agreement that the adoption of AI will lead to substantial economic gains , even  though calculating these gains  exactly  is a difficult task . A McKinsey study estimates that AI has the  potential to deliver additional global economic activity of around $13 trillion by 2030, or about 1.2  percent additional C  growth per year20.   Europe’s AI capabilities, however, have received a lot of bad press. Kai -Fu Lee, former president of  Google China, claims that Europe is " not even in the running for bronze AI medal "21. A 2019 McKinsey  study warned that " Europe is adding an AI gap to its digital gap "22. It said that European companies lag  behind their US counterparts in their adoption of big data architecture and of the advanced machi ne  learning techniques that are the foundations of AI. The report , however, noted something that h as  plagued most such studies, namely that " available data on  diffusion are scarce ". In fact, overviews of  the state of AI often do not even feature Europe as an actor, or only look at some European states. This  might be explained by language barriers, and the fact that th e number of European states  is high  – but  it also is a testimony to a lack of interest by the EU and its Member States  in the topic, and a lack of  funding for such studies . The assessment of  AI abilities of  states  (or group of states) is hindered by  different understandings of what AI entails, and studies often rely on self -assessments, making them  less reliable. Comparisons between states also need to be read particularly carefully, as different  countries have diffe rent dominant industries, and AI -enabled systems are not affecting all industri es at  the same pace. Finally, when assessing a state’s AI capabilities, one should look at both AI ‘output’ and  ‘input’. The output are the actual AI capabilities, measured, for  example in the number of AI firms, or  the level of AI use by business. However  as important advances in machine learning and other AI  techniques are being made, it is equally important to study the key inputs for AI development  which   can point to likely f uture developments .   European AI Output : A 2020 survey found that only between one and three percent of EU companies  with ten employees or more say they use AI such as machine learning, natural language processing, or  speech recognition  (financial sector n ot counted)23. There are considerable differences between  countries: 20% of Irish, and 12% of Maltese firms report they analyse big data internally using machine  learning, against only 5% in Denmark, 2% in Germany, France, and Italy, and 1% in Greece, Latvi a, and  Poland (on the other measurements, like language processing, the divergences are not as  pronounced).   The Global AI ranking by Tortoise Media ranks states according to Implementation, Innovation, and  Investment and gives an aggregated score (arguably mixing output and input measures). Here, three  EU states are in the top ten (Germany, Netherlands, and France); 15 EU states are in the top 30, and 22                                                                 20  "Notes from the AI frontier: Modeling the impact of AI on the world economy ", McKinsey Global Institute , 4 September 2018,   https://www.mckinsey.com/featured -insights/artificial -intelligence/notes -fr om -the-ai-frontie r -modelin g-the-impact -of-ai-on-theworld -economy .   21  Carly Minsky, "One former Google exec says there’s no hope for Europe’s artificial intelligence sector ", Sifted , 14 December 2018,  https://sifted.eu/articles/interview -google -kaifu -lee-ai-artif icia l -intelligence/ .   22   "Tackling Europe’s gap in digital and AI ", McKinsey Global Institute , 7 February 2019, https://www.mckinsey.com/feature d insights/artificial -intelligence/tackling -europes -gap -in-digital -and -ai#.   23  Eurostat, Artificial Intelligence, last update 11/03/2021,    https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/ISOC_EB_AI__ custom_784358/b ookmark/table?lang=en&bookmarkId=f34cd95d 77aa -45bd -8496- eabf49549c02 .

On different indicators, different states are leading – for  exa m ple,  regarding the operating environment, EU countries  top the list with Poland, Slovenia, Lithuania,  Slovakia, Luxemburg taking the top five  spots . In this context it should be noted that the UK in thi s  ranking has the highest score of any European country (third place in aggregate ranking, after the US  and China). The UK is also home to important AI firms, such a Ocado, one of the most sophistic ated  player s in warehouse automation after Amazon. DeepMind, the AI -development superstar behind  the  Alpha Go/AlphaZero  programme  (see below) was founded in London, although it was acquired by  Google in 2014.   Input: Three key inputs are crucial for AI: data , talent, and computing power.   Data: For the moment, most AI is trained  by using large amounts of data25. For instance, an AI system  may be shown thousands of pictures to learn to identify objects. Data relevant for machine learning  can come in many forms, and includes, for example, census data, weather data, or health records.  Europe faces a challenge on dat a collection as European countries’ comparatively small size and strong  data security rules mean that, in comparison to colleagues elsewhere, European AI developers have  relatively limited access to data. Where China and the US benefit from large, homogeneous home  markets and many  customers abroad (see section 3.1. below ), Europeans face a fragmented market.  The EU has worked hard to create the digital single market, but data collection has not been unified to  the extent that is possible within individual c ountries, and even in the best of cases, language and  cultural barriers remain.    Talent (to develop algorithms):  The EU educates good talent. It ranks highly on peer -reviewed AI  publications – although it was overtaken by China in 2017 and the EU is losing  share in AI journal  citations26. However  Europe struggles to retain the talent it educates, with researchers and  entrepreneurs leaving, especially for the US. Funding is a problem, which is why AI developer Cédric  Villani recommends "hefty salary top -ups" in the French AI strategy27. Again, inner -European  divergences are noteworthy. Of the top 30 AI research organisations in the EU, Canada, Australia, New  Zealand, and the UK identified in a recent study, eleven are European. However  of those, seven are in  Germany while Denmark, Austria, France and Italy have one respectively28. And on AI workforce , a study  based on data from the professional networking website LinkedIn finds that France and Germany al one  make up 19% of the AI workforce in in the EU, Canada, Aus tralia, New Zealand, and the UK29.  Hardware/compute:  Although AI generally refers to software, it requires a hardware element on which  to run its computation, and train its algorithms. Advanced s emiconductor chips are at the heart of this  hardware – and are increasingly perceiving as strategic assets by policymakers. Chips are an important  element  of the intensifying technology rivalry between the United States and China (see  s ect io n 3.1.                                                                 24  The Global AI Index, https://www.tortoisemedia.com/inte lligence/global -ai/.   25  Not all AI requires big data as advances are being made into data efficiency and synthetic data. Therefore, headlines about data being  the new oil, or China being "the Saudia Arabia of data"  should be avoided. Nevertheless, many AI development methods rely on bi g  databases to train their algorithms.    26  Artificial Intelligence Index  Report 2021, Stanford University, p.20. https://aiindex.stanford.edu/wp -content/uploads/2021/03/2021- AIIndex -Report_Master.pdf .   27  "AI for Humanity ", March 2018,  https://www.aiforhumanity.fr/en/ .   28  Max Langenkamp, Melissa Flagg, " AI Hubs, Europe and CANZUK ", CSET , April 2021,  https://cset.georgetown.edu/research/ai -hubs/ .   29  Ibid.

Europe remains largely dependent on foreign chipmakers ; for the past three decades, the  global market share of the EU’s semiconductor industry was around 10%30.  This brief overview does not claim to be a comprehensive assessment of Europe’s AI capabilities . As  mentioned, such an assessment is difficult in any case,  given the scarcity of available data. But thi s  overview has shown that the EU has AI capabilities, but it lacks in certain areas, and does not have a  comfortable or secured lead in any of them. With regard to AI output, Europe is behind other players,  but it appears reasonably well positioned with regard to AI inputs. Still, the EU faces several challenges   such as  retaining AI talent  and  building up an AI ecosystem . The overview also showed that inner European differences are significant. A ddressing those differences, as well as taking on the other  challenges  is complicated  by a fragmented market , and lack of information.  Technology -po licy  r equ ires  a ‘whole -of-government’ approach which the EU, as a hybrid polit y, has a hard time implementing31.                                                                30  Semiconductor Industry Associ ation "SIA Factbook 2020",  https:/ /www.semiconductors.org/the -2020 -sia-factbook -your -source -forsemiconductor -industry -data/ .   31  Alice Panier, "Europe in the Geopolitics of Technology, Connecting the Internal and External Dimensions ", IFRI, April 2021, p.1,  https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/pannier_europe_geopolitics_technology_2021_.pdf .  
Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      13 PE 662.926  3. AI’S POSSIBLE IMPACT ON G EOPOLITICS AND THE G LOBAL  BALANCE OF POWER .  Throughout history, technology has transformed economies and societies, has redistributed (military)  power among states, and has empowered new actors. The following section outlines six ways h ow AI  could, and already is, shaping international relations and the global balance of power and what that  means for the E uropean Union .   3.1. US-China competition   Joe Biden, in one of his first major interventions as US President, said the future of the US rel a t io n ship  with China will be dominated by "extreme competition "32. No geopolitical development is likely to  shape global stability as much as Sino -American competition, which will directly impact Europe. And  AI plays an important role. Bill Burns, in his co nfirmation hearing for Director of the CIA noted that  technology is the central component of the competition with China33. The US National Security  Commission on AI took a similar position – its final report mentioned China a whopping 699 times,  more than any opponent or ally34. "We are in a competition with China and AI is at the absolute center  of that competition ", the Commission’s members emphasised35.   Fifteen March 2016 is an important date in that context. On that day, AlphaGo, an AI -enabled system  built by DeepMind, beat champion Lee Sedol at the Chines e game of Go36. This event has been labelled  China’s AI " Sputnik moment ", referring to the shock to the US when the Soviet Union brought the fi rst  satellite into orbit in 1957. That a western -built AI wou ld beat China at its own game was considered  humiliating. Although China had pursued AI research before, AlphaGo’s win motivated f urther research  and development37. Today, the US focus on China finds its mirror image across the Pacific: the Chinese  leadersh ip, in its 2017 "Next -Generation Artificial Intelligence Plan " proclaimed its aim to hav e caught  up with the US in 202038. Xi Jingping in 2013 noted that " Advanced technology is the sharp weapon of  the modern state. An important reason that Western countrie s were able to hold sway over the world  in modern times was that th ey held the advanced technology "39. References to an " AI (arms) race "  between the US and China have become so commonplace that a whole academic subfield ha s  emerged to fight this framing40.                                                                 32  Demetri Sevastopulo, "Biden warns China will face ‘extreme competition’ from US ", Financial Times , 7 February 2021,  https://www.ft.com/content/c23a4e67 -2052- 4d2f -a844- e5c72a7de214 .   33  Statement for the Record, Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Director of CIA Nominee William J.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.926  14  When looking at Chinese versus American AI capabilities, t he aforementioned difficulty of measuring  states’ AI capabilities should be kept in mind. Still, most AI rankings place the US ahead of China, though  not on all aspects. The Tortoise Global AI Index , for example, finds China ahead of the US on AI  development, the operating envir onment, and government strategy41. Kai-Fu Lee has argued that  China exceeds the US in bringing AI applications into the consumer market and is thus likely to benefi t  faster, tu rning into an " AI superpower "42. China has capable AI companies in Baidu, Alibaba, and  Tencent (the " BAT "), and features a dynamic start -up scene in Shenzhen. The importance of the BAT i n  China, and the GAFA M (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple , Microsoft ) in the US raises the question  whether these private companies should be considered Chinese or American, simply because they are  founded and headquartered in the countries . In the US, especially after the Snowden revelations, many  firms tried to d isengage from  the US government43. In 2018, Google employees protested against the  company’s involvement in " Project Maven ", an AI collaboration with the Pentagon44. This has led some  to raise concerns tha t the US will fall behind China45. While it would be a simplification to equate private  companies and the Chinese state (or military), compared to the US, Chinese companies are less likely  to be able to refuse working with the Chinese government, and private AI development is likely to  benefit the state somewhat. Nevertheless, experts have pointed out that US concerns over the Chinese  concept of "civil-military fusion, " which aims at making available the research advances from the  private sector to the state, and the Chine se military, may be exaggerated46.   Looking at the A I triad  of data, talent, and compute , it can be argued that the US is slightly ahead of  China. Both US and Chinese firms benefit from access to significant amounts of data. The usefulness of  data, however, depends on its quality and relevance to the respec tive AI. China’s internet users are  more numerous than those of any other country and access the internet using smartphones, whi c h  tends to generate particularly valuable data47. American firms’ products, however, are used around the  world, which makes thei r data more diverse. China is aiming to counter this effect through selling its  produc ts, and collecting data, abroad48. China’s access to data on Chinese shopping behaviour will  allow China to develop very good algorithms predicting Chinese shopping behavi our, but is unlikel y  to significantly empower its research on, say, military command and control.   Talent may turn out to be the more relevant indicator. The US world -leading research institutions train  significant numbers of AI specialists, including fore igners who often remain in the country to start fi rms.  More than half of the American AI workforce was born abroad, as were around two -thirds of current  graduat e students in AI -related fields49. Silicon Valley companies successfully attract talent from arou nd  the world, and the GAFA Ms continue to gain talent through so -called "acquihires ", the take -over of                                                                41  The  Global AI Index, https://www.tortoisemedia.com/inte lligence/global -ai/.  42  Lee, Kai -Fu.

Various US reports focus on AI talent i n  the US, recommending strategy on how to retain experts, especially those who were educated in the  US51. While not quite as attractive for global talent as the US, the Chinese education system generates  strong skills in maths, and the country has a tradition of language and translation research. China al so  sees talent as central; President Xi Jinping has repeatedly called talent " the first resource"  in China’s  push for innovation52. The Chinese leadership has devised strategies to build its talent base, through  the improvement of education, attracting talent from abroad, and bringing back Chinese talent from  abroad. According to a recent study, however, so far, these strategies have resulted in mixed results53.  On hardware, specifically chip capabilities to develop advanced AI, the US appear to be leading. I t has  the largest chip design industry and aims to make the leading chip manufacturers, Samsung and the  Taiwanese TSMC esta blish fabs in the United States54. Although factories in China produce a significant  share of the world’s mobile phones and computers,  the chips on which they run come from overseas.  Reportedly, even the manufacturing processes of China’s most technologically advanced chip maker  are years b ehind those of industry leaders55. It is here that the US -China competition has come to the  forefron t most clearly as the US has imposed exports control on Chinese companies in an effort to li mi t  China’s AI advances56.   The military element . Sino -American competition on technology also has a distinct  security and  defence element. Already in 2012, the US H ouse Intelligence Committee labelled Chinese firm Huawei  a major national security concern57. Military AI – AI used to enable military capabilities – is likely to have  an important impact on warfare, and possibly the geopolitical balance of power, as explai ned in  det a il  in section 3.5 below . Both the US and China are extensively funding efforts to use AI in the military,  and  are clearly focus ed on each other in this effort58. The US national security commission noted that the  US needed " ubiquitous AI capabilities and new warfighting paradigms ", as, without such AI capabilities,  the US  "will not be able to defend against AI -enabled threats ". In the US, fear is rising that an " innovati on  gap " is appearing between the United States and China – similar to the concerns over a " bomber gap "                                                                50  "Profiles in Innovation: Artificial Intelligence: AI, Machine Learning and Data Fuels the Future of Productivity ", Goldman Sachs Research  Unit, 14 November 2016, p.11.   51  Remco Zwetsloot, "Keeping Top AI Talent in the United States ", CSET , December 2019, https://cset.georgetown.edu/p ublication/keeping top-ai-talent -in-the-united -states/ .

The Chinese military is pursuing " m ilitary   intelligentiza tion ", the development and operationalization of artificial intelligence and the enabl i ng  and related technologies that are required for its realiz ation for military applications60. Chinese military  scientists and strategists are also undertaking extensive theoretical research on the impact of AI on  future warfare61. The hope is that developing and adopting AI in the defence and military realm i s a  "rare strategic opportunity for [China] […] to achieve a powerful military, a nd […] to surpass  [competitors]"62. It is in this context of a competition for military superiority, that the f ounder  of the  AI/surveillance firm Palantir,  Peter Thiel , has criticised US AI firms for working in China, as their research  could ultimately benefit the Chinese military63.   This brief overview of Chinese and American capabilities, plans, and visions for AI shows that the tw o  states are both capable AI powers – and increasingly locked in a competition with each other on AI . For  Europe, this competition poses several challenges.   First, a (military) confrontation between the two global powers is clearly  not in Europe’s interest,  whether it is over AI or over something else. However  beyond this worst -case scenario, other  challenges loom. Namely, there is a risk that spheres of influenc e are emerging, in which Europe will  have to take sides. A Sino -American decoupling is already happening; Nicholas Thompson and Ian  Bremmer note that " at the dawn of a new stage in the digital revolution, the world’s two most powerful  nations are rapidly r etreating into positions of competitive isolation "64. While the US is the EU’s most  important and closest ally, and China a systemic rival, China also is a cooperation partner on some  topics, and an important partner  in trade . Europe, therefore,  has to look  in two directions at once: " while  the US and China are engaged in a bilateral race, Europe  needs  to address  simultaneously  the  challenges  stemming  from American and Chinese technology policies, which are quite different ", A lice  Pannier notes65.  Kai-Fu Lee describes a particularly bleak dependency scenario for countries that are not the US or China,  "If most countries will not be able to tax ultra -profitable AI companies to subsidize their workers, what  options will they have? I foresee only one: Unless they  wish to plunge their people into poverty, they  will be forced to negotiate with whichever country supplies most of their AI software — China or the  United States — to essentially become that country’s economic dependent, taking in welfare subsidies                                                                59  Laura Schousboe, " The Pitfalls of Writing About Revolutionary Defense Technology ", War on the Rocks , 15 July 2019,  https://warontherocks.com/2019/07/the -pitfalls -of-wr iting -about -revol ut ionary -defense- technology/ .   60  "Translation: Tianjin Municipal Action Plan for Military -Civil Fusion Special Projects in Intelligent Technology ", C S ET ,  https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp -content/uploads/t0033_Tianjin_mil_civil_fusion_EN.pdf ; Elsa B.

Such economic arrangements would reshape today’s geopolitical alliances "66.  Furthermore, there is a concern that this competition could create danger ous incentives, such as  fielding immature AI in order to gain an advantage over the competitor. This might have particularly  problematic consequences in the military area (see section 3.5 below).   3.2. AI-empowered authoritarianism and weakening of democracy   The US -China competition has been framed not only as a competition for geopolitical power and  dominance, but also a competition between (AI -enabled) authoritarianism and liberal democraci es.  Robert O. Work, Deputy Secretary of Defence for both the Obama an d Trump administrations from  2014 to 2017 and co -chair of the US National  Security Commission on AI , argues: "This technologi c al  competition is very much a values competition. We already know how China wants to use AI. They w ant  to use it to surveill their  population they want to use it to suppress minorities, they don’t care about  personal privacy and civil liberties. And those type of values are just incompatible with democratic  nations around the world. So it is important that we have this alliance of de mocracies that work  together to establish the norms and values and that deploy pl atforms that reflect our values "67. Work  of course refers to the widely -reported increasing  level of surveillance in China68. The worry is that AI  may be a powerful enabler of a uthoritarian rule.   For a long time, there was a belief  that digital information technology would contribute to a diffusi on  of liberal ideas and values. Then US President Bill Clinton noted in 2000:  "In the new century, liberty will  spread by cell phone and  cable modem. [...]  We know how much the Internet has changed Ameri c a,  and we are already an open society. Imagine how much it could change China. Now there's no questi on  China has been trying to crack down on the Internet. Good luck! That's sort of like t rying to nail Jell- O  to the wall"69. Unfortunately, it appears that such hopes were somewhat misplaced. Human Rights  Watch  warns that authorities in China " conduct compulsory mass collection of biometric data, such as  voice samples and DNA, and use artifici al intelligence and big data to identify, profile, and track  everyone in Xinjiang " hom e of the Uyghur Muslim minority70. Elsewhere in China, the idea of a social  credit score had been tested, a " pervasive, highly intrusive AI -enabled surveillance system tha t trac ks  you all day every day and that largely determines all of your life chances "71. Not all of these surveillance  techniques are necessarily AI -enabled or need to be, but AI can contribute to supercharge them  further .   This is of immediate concern for the freedom of Chinese citizens. However , geopolitically speaking,  there is  further  concern that we might be moving into a new era of ideological confrontation, aki n to  the competition between liberal democracy and communism during the Cold War. Several  commentators are already framing th e competition in Cold War terms72. Nicholas Wright argues that                                                                66  Kai-Fu Lee, " The Real Threat of Artificial Intelligence" , New York Times, 24 June 2017,    https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06 /24/opinion/sunday/artificial -intelligence -economi c -inequality.html .   67  "Oh My, AI ", War on the Rocks podcast, 12 May 2021, https://warontherocks.libsyn.com/oh -my-ai.  68  Ross Andersen, "The Panopticon Is Already Here" , The Atlantic,  September 2020,    https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/china -ai-surveillance/614197/ .   69  "Clinton's Words on China: Trade Is the Smart Thing ", New York Times , March 9, 2000,    https://www.nytimes.com/2000/03/09/world/clinton -s-w ords -on-china -trade -is-the-sma rt -thing.html .   70  "China’s Campaign of Repression Against Xinjiang’s Muslims " Human Rights Watch, 9 September 2018,   https://www.hrw.org/report/2018/0 9/09 /eradicat ing -ideologi cal -viruses/chinas -campaign -repression -against -xinjiangs .  71  Francisco Toro, James Bosworth "Opinion: China exports its high -tech authoritarianism to Venezuela.

This concern is fuelled by China i ncreasingly exporting its surveillance systems. China deploys  facial recognition software in Zimbabwe and Malaysia, and Ethiopian security services rely on  telecommunications equipment from Chinese firm ZTE to monitor activists74. Many of these deals have  been part of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), the investment vehicle China uses to financ e   infrastructure projects abroad75.   Beijing has tried to mitigate such concerns, for example through the " Beijing AI Principles " released by  the Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence, that set out rules for the  ethical, diverse, inclusive AI76.  However, Elsa Kania, an expert of Chinese AI efforts noted  that it was " hard not to feel a degree of  cognitive dissonance when reading these Beijing AI principles ", and noted that she was " sceptical that  this espoused commitment to certain ethics will necessarily constrain  the Chinese government from  using AI in ways that it ap pears deeply committed to do so "77.  Such concerns come in addition to worries  over the larger democracy -undermining dynamics of digital   technology more broadly , such as the increased polarisation in social networks, (AI -enabled)  disinformation that chips away at social cohesion and public confidence in the democratic system itself   (see section 3.5.8 below) , and the rise of online media and big tech firms has undermined the traditional  media, making it harder for it to hold those in power accountable78.   This hits at the very heart of European values – and the EU’s understanding of itself. Democrac y and   the rule of law are primary EU values . And this is not an elite idea : Europeans, when asked about the  main assets of the EU rank " the EU’s respect for democracy, human rights, and the rule of law " as first  response79. And when asked about the role that the  EU should play in the world, almost 30 percent of  Europeans say that the EU "should be a beacon of democracy and human rights ", making it the number  one answer80.  3.3. AI Nationalism   The competition between major countries to lead in AI is growing, and states a round the world –  including Europe – are trying to support their AI ecosystem, through investments, tax breaks, the  creation of platforms for knowledge exchange, and more.

Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      19 PE 662.926  associated with AI – and the fear of potential lo sses for those left behind – states may have incentives  to go further. This could lay the foundation for a new type of nationalism. One of the most promi nent  proponents of this idea is Ian Hogarth, a British entrepreneur and investor. In a 2018 article he warned  that the "continued rapid progress in machine learning will drive the emergence of a new kind of  geopolitics: […] AI Nationalism. " Hogarth worries that in addition to ‘normal’ policies  of support for  national AI research and AI firms, states might a dopt more controversial, protectionist policies suc h as  blocking acquisitions of domestic AI companies by foreign companies to preserve their independence;  blocking investment in domestic AI companies by foreign investors; blocking international  partnershi ps; or even the nationalisation of key domestic AI companies. Such tendencies may be  exacerbated further by the fact that the world has seen China implement protectionist strategies rather  successfully over the last years.   A slide into AI nationalism is n ot guaranteed, but recent developments should keep everyone alert. The  British government is currently reviewing whether it should block the sale of UK -based computer chip  designer ARM Holdings to the American graphics chip specialist Nvidia81. The US has i mposed export  bans on chips  – and worked forcefully to convince European firms, such as the Dutch s emico n ductor  equipment company ASML , to not export chips to China either82. And the European discussions about  strategic (digital) autonomy83 can also be misconstrued as European nationalism. While th ese actions  are not necessarily nationalist , protectionist tendencies are developing in many regions  in the worl d.  This could endanger the free flow of goods and free exchange between nations that Europe ans in   particular benefits from and that Europe stands for  – and which create interdependencies that can help  ensure cooperative approaches between nations. Europe’s historical experiences have shown how  dangerous nationalism can be , and should thus be particularly attentive of such developments.   3.4. Empowering of the private sector   The shift in power from the state to the private sector, and particularly to big tech firms could become  one the most fundamental change s in how politics functions in  this ce ntury. This  development  is   related to  the rise of digital technologies more broadly, but AI can exacerbate this further, potentially  pushing it to an extreme through the development of  Artificial General Intelligence  (see s ect io n 3.6  below). While in the p ast decades, in the western world, a significant part of research was done in state funded (in the US especially military -funded) lab oratorie s and universities, today, most of the cutting edge AI research is happening in private firms.  Kate Crawford goes s o far as to say  that "AI began as a  major public project of the twentieth century and was relentlessly privatized to produce enormous  financial gains for the tiny minority at th e top of the extraction pyramid "84.  Whether AI developments by the private secto r directly benefit s a state (or  its military) depends on a  variety of factors . Most importantly, the relationship between the private sector and the state diverge  by country and world region. In the western world, the private sector tends to be independent from  the government, though there are many areas of cooperation. Elsewhere, the separation might be less  clear. What is clear is that the rise in digital technology has led to a significant r ise in power of the                                                                81  ARM had already been bought by Japanese conglomerate Softbank four years earlier.

The New York Times calculates that " the ten largest tech  firms, which have become gatekeepers in commerce, finance, entertainment and communications,  now have a combined market capitalizati on of more than $10 trillion. In gross domestic product terms,  that would rank them as th e world’s third -largest economy "85.   The rise in power of private firms raises several challenges. For one, it means that the state has less sway   to influence the direc tion of research  in a direction that is beneficial to it . A recent study of AI research  at the major US firms warned that " the private sector may be failing to make research investments  consistent with ensuring long -term national competitiveness. None of t he leading compani es  examined in this analysis appear to be prioritizing work on problem areas within machine learning that  will offset the broader structural challenges the United States faces in deploying and benefitting from  the technology when competing against authoritarian regimes "86.   Secondly, b ig tech firms ’ ability to influence and shape politics  is rising . Beyond the usual lobbying,  companies  such as Google or Facebook can reach more people than most official communications. I n  2012, the US Congre ss considered the "Stop Online Piracy Act ", legislation that Google opposed as i t  endangered its business model. As Jamie Bartlett recounts, " it used its status as the front page of the  internet to let this be known. For 24 hours visitors to the site found  a giant black box over the Googl e  logo and a link: ‘Tell Congress – please don’t censor the web’. On clicking, it redirected to a petition that  urged Congress to reject the bill. No company has ever been able to reach more people more quickly.  Millions clicked the link, of course, overwhelming the web servers of Congress.  The bill failed "87. In the  EU, no firms of the size of the GAFA M exist, but GAFA M’s (and potentially BAT’s) reach extends beyond  their countries of origin. The firms  power also mean that regulating some of their most problematic  practices, such as surveill ance capitalism, is a challenge88.   For the military realm, this shift of power, and innovation , from the state to the private realm  is   particularly problematic. The very beginning of modern AI was at least partly military -funded: the  Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence at Dartmouth College in 1956, which is by many  considered the birth of modern AI development, was funded by the US Office of Naval Resea r ch , which   coordinates, executes and promotes the science and technology programs of the Unit ed States  Navy   and Marine Corps89. The French strategic review 2017 notes this, stating that while " in the past, maj or  breakthroughs in armament have been the resul t of dedicated military R&D funding […] the civilian  public and private sectors are generating an ever increasing number of technolo gies with military  applications "90. Therefore, the military has less say, and is a customer, rather than in the driving seat  of  technological innovation . A striking demonstration of the change in power took place in December  2015. When the US government, following a terrorist attack in California, wanted to break into one of  the terrorist’s iPhone, it could not do so – and the p hone’s manufacturer, Apple, refused to bow to  pressure and provide a back door into the phone’s operating system . In the end, the FBI had to hire a  private firm from Israel, which  used a technology unknown to the FBI to break the phone’s encryption91.

Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      21 PE 662.926  concerns in the US but also in Europe have rise n that tech companies may not want to work with the  military, for ethical or economic reasons , thus further weakeni ng the military’s access to cutting -edge  technology92. Recent studies of cooperation between the US military and Silicon Valley firms, however,  suggest that this concern may have been overplayed93.  3.5. AI in Security and Defence   There have been several moments in history when warfare changed because of the introduction and  innovative use of a new military technology. From the crossbow to gunpowder, tanks to nuclear  weapons – when new technologies are introduced and used in novel w ays, they can have a  fundamental impact on how wars are fought, militaries are organised, and strategies are developed.  Such moments have been called "revolutions in military affairs ", and there is an extensive scholarly  literature and discussion on past r evolutions, how and when new technologies cause revolutions, and  how many revolutions have taken place in the past. Some of t hem had repercussions for society more  widely: the crossbow put untrained foot soldiers on a par with knights, thereby upending the  s o cial  balance. The nuclear bomb fundamentally changed great powers’ strategic assessments and affected  the lives of millions for decades.   AI in the military and defence realm often revolves around discussions of lethal autonomous weapons,  or "killer rob ots". However  the functions that AI can enable and support in the military realm are  manifold, reaching from logistics to autonomous weapons, cyber warfare, and disinformation. I t  includes offensive and defensive systems, frontline,  and support systems. Ne w weapon technology can  impact the relative military strength of a country or alliance, and might require, for example, the  reallocation of funds, the development and funding of new research and development strands, or the  creation of new doctrine and stra tegy. However  AI-enabled military systems also raise some more  fundamental, societal, and geopolitical concerns.   Military experts agree that AI will increasingly be used in the military realm, and that this inclusion will  have important implications. Asses sments of what kind of implications, however, range from  maximalist statements that AI may "alter the immutable nature of war "94, or that AI changes "the  psychological essence of strategic affairs "95, to less extreme views  that focus on more specific and  limited changes in weapons technology96. In recent years, the maximal reading has taken hold i n US  circles in particular. The US National Security Commission on AI argues that the US " will not be able to  defend against AI -enabled threats without ubiquitous AI capabilitie s and new warfighti ng  paradigms "97. A study notes that " the applications of AI to warfare and espionage are likely to be as  irresistible as aircraft. Preventing expanded military use of AI is likely impossible "98. Such extreme                                                                92  Rachel Olney, " The Rift Between Silicon Valley and the Pentagon Is Economic, Not Moral ", War on the Rocks , 28 January 2019,  https://warontherocks.com/2019/01/the -rift-between -sili con -valley -and -the-pentagon -is-economi c -not-moral / .   93  Patrick McGee, " Silicon Valley reboots its relationship with the US military ", Financial Times , 17 May 2021,  https://www.ft.com/content/541f 0a02 -ea27- 43a4- b554- 96048c40040d?shareType=nongift .   94  "Getting to grips with military robotics ", The Economist , 25 January 2018, https://www.economist.com /speci a l report/2018/01/25/getting -to-grips -with -military -roboti cs .   95  Kenneth Payne, " Artificial Intelligence: A Revolution in Strategic Affairs?

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.926  22  assessments might no t be universally shared. Nobody, however, seems to believe that AI will not  impact on the military realm, though some author s point to mitigating factors99.   Making predictions about where AI will have the biggest impact on military systems and operations i s  a difficult endeavour. First, making predictions about not just the likely development of military  technology, but especially its impact on warfare  and beyond is made difficult by the fact that what  matters for a military technology’s impact is not just the technology’s capabilities, but  how the new  technology is used100. In order for new technology to be impactful, novel ways of how to use the  technology need to be developed. Tanks were brought onto the battlefield already in 1916. However   it took until W orld War II and Blitzkrieg doctrine for their military potential to show – the German  Wehrmacht developed a novel way to use their tanks in combination with radios and as independent  units, allowing it to break through the French defences in a matter of day s. With regard to military AI,  we do not yet know which doctrines (as well as organisational changes, and new training regimes) wil l  be developed and what impact they will have.   Also, AI is still in development, with new methods still being invented, and important improvements  being made. Therefore, making definite statements on the impact on military systems is difficult. As  most of the most ground -breaking work on AI is not done by/for the military but in the civilian realm   (see above) , it becomes even h arder to assess what technological developments are likely in what  timeframe . This is made even more difficult as AI can enable many different military systems.   Finally , in parallel with development of AI, several other technologies are maturing, many of which are  relevant for the defence realm, such as quantum computing, 3D  printing, or hypersonic  systems. These  technologies interact with each other, further making it harder to make definite statements about their  development.   As in the civilian realm, it  is advisable to consider AI as an ‘enabler’ in the military realm, rather than a  single technology. AI is of interest for militaries as AI can improve (cost) efficiency, speed, stealth, may  help to shield humans from danger or alleviate psychological and physical pressure, and can offer new  military capabilities. For example, AI may allow a solar -powered drone to use its energy more efficiently  and thus stay in the air longer101. AI-enabled autonomy can allow to reduce, or even make completely  unnecessary, u p- and downlinks to unmanned systems. This can increase a system’s stealth. These  advantages will not necessarily happen together  (nor are they guaranteed) . At times they may even be  trade-offs; for example, a particularly elaborate AI -enabled system may b e more, not less expensive  than a system without AI -supported functions.   3.5.1.  Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconaissance (ISR)   The most obvious use of machine learning in the military realm is for intelligence, surveillance, and  reconnaissance (ISR). AI can help shift through the mass of data collected by various sensors, suc h as  the hundred -thousands of hours of video feed colle cted by US drones102. AI can look at photographs  and single out changes from one picture to the next, indicating, for example, an IED hidden in the ti me                                                                99  Andrea Gilli, "Preparing for " NATO -mation ": the Atlantic Alliance toward the age of artificial intelligence ", NDC Policy Brief 4 -19,  https://www.ndc.nato.int/news/news.php?icode=1270 .   100  Michael Horowitz and Casey Mahoney, " Artificial Intelligence and the Military: Technology Is Only Half the Battle ", War on the Rocks , 25  December 2018, https://warontherocks.com/2018/12 /artif icial -intelligence -and -the-milita ry -technol ogy -is-only -half -the-battle/ .   101  Kelsey D.

This is of particular interest in the context of urban warfare103. Other  AI applications in this context are image and face recognition, speech recognition and translati on,  geolocation, pattern of life analysis and more. According to a US C ongressional Research Service report,  the CIA alone has 140 projects in this area104.   3.5.2.  Logistics   Logistics des cribes the transfer of personnel and materiel from one location to another, as well as the  maintenance of that materiel. AI can help to better maintain equipment, reduce operational costs, and  improve readiness. For example, AI can support military logistics through " predictive maintenance "  which monitors the functioning of a system, such as an aircraft, and, based on various sensory inputs  and data analysis, predicts whenever a part needs exchanging. Equally, AI can improve efficienc y by  ensuring the right  amount of supplies are delivered at the right time105.  Since this is relevant also to the civilian market, AI -enabled logistics is comparatively far advanc ed.  Dassault’s Rafale aircr aft uses predictive maintenance106. The US Army’s Logistics Support Activity  (LOGSA) and IBM’s Watson work together to develop tailored maintenance schedules and to analyse  shipping flow s for repair parts distribution107.  3.5.3.  Cyber Operations   Cyber operations range from espionage activity and " non-peace " attacks108 to the complete shutdow n  of a country’s infrastructure109. Cyber warfare and artificial intelligence are intimately linked, as they  mutually influence and cross -fertilise each other, which can lead to some analyses conflating the tw o.  Howev er, the two are distinct, and cyberattacks predate the machine learning developments this  report is primarily concerned with. Russia’s cyber espionage campaign "Moonlight Maze " which  resulted in the theft of a massive amount of classified information from numerous US government  agencies dates back to 1996110. Work on what would become the " Stuxnet " worm that destroyed  Iranian nuclear enrichment centrifuges reportedly begun already in 2005. These cyberattacks were, as  far as is known, not AI -enabled. However  AI can contribute to increasing the po wer and utility of  cyberattacks111. And as there are almost no physical limitations, cyber warfare is an area in which some  of the most important changes through AI are being discussed.   One way that AI can support cyber operations is through AI -enabled data analysis  which  can contribute  to making cyber espionage operations considerably more powerful. In 2014, Chinese hackers stole an                                                                103  Margarita Konaev, " With AI, We’ll See Faster Fights, but Longer Wars ", War on the Rocks , 29 October 2019,   https://warontherock s.com/2019/10/with -ai-well- see-faster -fights -but-longer -wars/ .   104  "Artificial Intelligence and National Security ", US Congressional Research Service , 10 November 2020,  https://crsreports .congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R4517 8 .   105  Margarita Konaev, Husanjot Chahal, "The Path of Least Resistance, Multinational Collaboration on AI for Military Logistics and  Sustainment ", CSET , April 2021,  https://cset.georgetown.edu/research/the- path -of-least -resistance/ .   106  Dassault Aviation and Artificial Intelligence, https://www.dassault -aviation.com/en/group/about -us/artificial -intelligence/dassau lt aviation -and -artificial -intelligen ce/.   107  "Artificial Intelligence and National Security ", US Congressional Research Service , 10 November 2020,  https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R4517 8 .  108  Kello, Lucas.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.926  24  estimated 22 million files on American government employees from the US Office of Personn el  Management through a cyber intrusion112. Without data analysis tools, these mountains of files would be  largely useless. Data analysis tools, and especially AI -enabled data analysis tools, can not only hel p sort  them. AI could help identify spies in this network, by finding unusual trainings, or gaps in biographies.  Based on this data, an AI -enabled system might also be able to impersonate one of the individuals. Thus,  even past cyber incursions could be made more impactful  after the fact thanks to AI.    AI also could help make cyber -attacks more successful. Phishing emails used to distribute computer  viruses could become highly tailored by leveraging an AI’s ability to replicate natural language and  analysing  the context of an email thread113. Automated cyber wars could soon involve autonomousl y  attacking and self -replicating cyber weapons.  At the same time, AI can help reduce vulnerabilities in  the cyber realm and help defenders by detecting anomalous changes and help to quickly address  config uration errors and other vulnerabilities114.   Cyberattacks are likely to become more of a problem in a world in which AI -enabled systems become  more ubiquitous. Because AI promises to make many digital tools more capable, they are likely to  become more commo n ("Internet of things "). As cars get connected and Alexa manages peoples’  houses, more vulnerabilities will appear. Cyber expert Bruce Schneier noted that on cyber defence: " we  are getting better. But we are getting worse faster "115.  There is controversy ov er how decisive AI will be for cyberoperations in the future. A recent study  warned that machine learning could shape cyber operations in ways that drive more aggressive and  destabili sing engagements between states116. At the same time, another study notes that machi ne  learning has notable limitations, arguing that " as a result of these constraints and flaws, attackers are  less likely to apply machine learning techniques than many expect, and will likely do so only if they see  unique benefits "117. It is worth n oting is that in the cyber realm, autonomy is furthest developed. The  Stuxnet code, for example, did not require anyone to " pull the trigger ". Instead, it relied on several  exploits which allowed the code to spread without human help, autonomously looking for its target (a  special type of pump used in Nat anz) and engaging it once found118. The Russian attacks against the  Ukrainian electricity network in December 2016 followed a similar logic as their code had the ability to  "map out targets, then launch at a pre -set time, opening circuits on cue without even having an internet  connection back  to the hackers "119. Hence, while the discussion regarding autonomy in the physic al  world is lar gely about systems that are not quite yet in operation, in the cyber -world, a u t o n omy  is   already a reality.                                                                 112  Sanger, David E.

Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      25 PE 662.926  3.5.4.  Command and Control   AI in the command and control realm aims to centralise the planning and execution of military  operations. The idea is to use AI to link together and fuse information from different sensors, and create  a single source of information (a " common operating pictur e")120. AI could also help with  communication links (find alternative means to distribute information if communication links are cut).  This capability will be of importance for joint operations, most notably operations including different  armed forces (such as NATO  or EU operations). An example is Defense Advanced Research Projects  Agency ’s "Mosaic Warfare program " (DARPA)  which seeks to coordinate autonomous forces and  generate multidomain command and control nodes, thus building a "mosaic " battle plan121. As AI  advances further, AI algorithms may also be capable of providing commanders with a menu of possi bl e  courses of action based on real -time analysis of all available information, thus potentially improving  the quality and speed of decision ma king122.   3.5.5.  Autono mous vehicles and weapon systems   AI and autonomy are different things, but they are closely related and often discussed together. In this  context, AI denotes  a system’s ability to determine the best course of action to achieve its goals, while  autonomy de scribes a system’s freedom to accomplish its goals.  As the U nited Nations  Institute for  Disarmament Research notes, " more intelligent machines are capable of taking on more challenging  tasks in more complex environments "123. Thus, AI can enable autonomy as intelligent systems can be  given greater freedom to act.   Militaries are exploring autonomy because machines are faster than humans in analysing data and  taking decisions. AI -enabled autonomy is particularly attractive for d efensive systems, such as those  that provide protection against rockets or missiles. Providing unmanned systems with more autonomy  can also help to make them stealthier, as autonomous systems do not need communications upli nks  or downlinks to an operator, making them harder for enemy defences to detect. And autonomous  systems could help reduce militaries’ reliance on humans. While this factor is also a cause for concern,  it can reduce human error and costs, and alleviate the physical or cognitive strain on soldiers.   While AI -enabled autonomy promises many military advantages, it also comes with risks124. From an  ethical and legal viewpoint, autonomous systems are problematic because they may lead to the  delegation of decisions over life and death to machines and algorithms, or create ‘responsibility gaps’,  making it unclear who is responsible for mistakes. Th ere is also a danger that, following unexpected  events, AI -enabled autonomy could spark "flash wars " reminiscent of " flash crashes " on stock markets  – in which hundreds of billions of dollars have been wiped off share pric es faster than humans c an  react125.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.926  26  Nations have been discussing a possible regulation, or ban, of lethal a utonomous weapons since 2014,  though so far with limited success126.  3.5.6.  Swarming   Swarming describes the combination of many systems, for example drones, unmanned boats , or tanks  into a swarm whose units act independently but in a coordinated manner. Swarms do not just mean  "many units ". Rather swarms are syste ms that operate as a collective127. Hence, the drone " swarms " that  were used as firework substitutes over London on New Year’s  Eve 2020/21 are not, properly speaking,  swarms, but rather massed drones, as they were pre- programmed and did not  operate together. And  the Turkish attack on a Syrian military convoy in March 2020 that media reports characterised as  involving a " swarm " really involved multiple remotely controlled units128. Swarms are thought to be  ideal for " overwhelming a nonlinear battlespace, creating a focused, relentless, and scaled attack, using  a deliberately structured, coordinated, strategic way to strike from all d irections "129. This means that  swarms offer genuinely new capabilities, and make new tactics such as flying minefields, waves of  attacks, or ‘kill webs’ possible.   Because of this, there is a lot of interest in swarms by armed forces and the defence industry  around  the world. Th e US is working on drone swarms130, as is Russia131, India, or China132. In Europe, among  others, Spain, Italy, and the UK are looking int o swarms for their armed forces133. The EU’s  Ho rizo n 2020  funding also supports swarm research, namely " Roborder ": "autonomous border surveillance system  with unmanned mobile robots including aerial, water surface, underwater and ground vehicles,  capable of functioning both as standalone and in swarms "134.   3.5.7.  AI and Nuclear Weapons   There have been some discussion s on the integration of AI into nuclear weapons – such as an AI enabled automation of nuclear defence, or AI -enabled autonomous s ystems carrying nuclear  weapons135. An expert notes that " the key question is not if, but when, how and by whom recent                                                                126  Frank Sauer, " Stepping back from the brink: Why multilateral regulation of autonomy in weapons systems is difficult, yet imperative and  feasible ", International R eview of the Red Cross,  Volume 102, Issue 9 13, April 2020, pp. 235–259, DOI:  https://doi.org/10.1017/S1816383120000466 .

Still, broadly speaking there is a  reticence about  integrating AI in nuclear weapons, given the potential of catastrophic risk. However  AI  can still indirectly impact nuclear deterrence  and the global nuclear order . AI-enabled disinformati on  (see section 3.5.8. below) can undermine trust in intelligence that political leaders receive, and, as Maria  Favaro notes "If decision -makers have to assume that their intelligence collection means a re  compromised, this could result in their striking blindly, and  potentially first, in a crisis "137. There have  also been concerns that AI -enabled systems might  contribute to undermining states’ second -strike  capability , for example by  ‘turning  the oceans tr ansparent ’ through the combination of sensors and AI enabled data analysis, and thus undermining deterrence at sea138. Equally, AI -enabled systems may  improve the defence against nuclear attack to such an extent, as to undermine the current system of  nuclear  deterrence. As this systen , for better or worse, has been part of the international security  architecture of the last decades,  such a development could be massively destabilising.    At the same time, it has been pointed out that AI -enabled surveillance mig ht help improve information  availability and early warning, and thus decrease the risk of faulty decisions, while AI might also provi de  new tools for monitoring and verification of  (nuclear) arms control regimes139.  3.5.8.  Disinformation   Disinformation is a securit y challenge, as well as a political, societal, and ideological challenge.  Disinformation – AI-enabled or not – is guaranteed to play a role in any future conflicts. Propaganda  and disinformation predates AI by centuries, if not millennia , but appears parti cularly relevant at the  moment. An investigation by the Associated Press and the Oxford Internet Institute found that Chi na  deployed an army of fake Twitter accou nts to amplify state propaganda140. In the 2020 Nagarno Karaback conflict, drone videos were an important propaganda tool. And in March 2021, the US  National Intelligence Council concluded that Russia used disinformation to undermine voter  confidence in the electoral process and exacerbate exist ing divisions in the US society141. As far as i s  known, no ne of these efforts were AI -enabled,  but (as it is the case for cyber operations),  AI can make  disinformation even more powerful , more targeted  – or easier to produce : US company OpenAI created  the AI -enabled language model GPT -3 wh ich can produce human- like text142. It was obvious to the  developers that this system could be abused to create disinformation – which is why OpenAI original l y  did not release the complete code143. Equally, AI -enabled "deep fakes " allow to falsify videos, thus  making it possible, for example to create videos of poli tical leaders making statements144.   This overview has shown that, similar to the civilian realm, there are a multitude of ways how AI c an  impact military systems and military operations.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.926  28  military experts or practitioners. Others, however, may have direct geopolitical repercussions. For  example, AI-enabled military systems might change the military balance of power by giving one actor  overwhelming power against which o thers cannot defend themselves, or by undermining existing  capabilities . Of the AI -enabled systems listed above, none appear to represent such an obvious  overwhelming military advantage, but new developments are possible, and if, as mentioned above, AI enabled systems might undermine the existing system of nuclear stability, this could have significant  geopolitical implications. Also, even just the belief that a new weapons system may provide a  significant advantage may cause escalatory dynamics such as an arms race s between opponents . Arms  races are highly destabilising and can create dangerous incentives, such as fielding not-yet-mature   weapons . This is of relevance in the context of the aforementioned Sino -American competition.   A particular challenge for  Europe is the impact of AI on military interoperability , the ability of allied  militaries to work together.  As is shown in section 4 below, few European states appear to have made  the development and introduction of AI -enabled defence capabilities a prior ity, while the United States  is focussing on military AI in an intensity that has made experts warn of a hype145. There is a danger that   great variation in allied forces’ adoption of AI may cause interoperability problems, as different systems  may not be tec hnologically compatible. This  could end up causing problems within NATO . Discussi on s  about armed forces’ technology gap ( or "transformation gap ") in NATO goe s back to the military  alliance’s beginning. So far, the alliance has  always  succeeded in bridging  these technological gaps  during operations – but more detailed research is needed to determine how, and to what extent, this  will be possible with AI -enabled capabilities. At the same time, it has also been argued that AI -en a bled  command and control syste ms may, in fact, be able to improve intero perability between joint forces146.  Specifically, AI can help combine data from different sources, and distribute it quickly and efficiently,  thereby helping create joint situational awareness. Thus, it is conceivabl e that AI could help more  technologically advanced militaries act as hubs, which other militaries could plug in to and thereby  acquire the same level of intelligence.  This hope, however, should not  be used as an excuse for  Europeans to disregard AI -enabled  defence.   3.6. General Artificial Intelligence   Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), or " strong AI " describes AI able to understand or learn any  intellectual task that a human being can. Authors also use the term " Superintelligence"  to describe AI  that exceeds hum an intelligence across any task147.   AGI would have superhuman powers: " Imagine a human who, every time they opened their mouth,  had spent  a solid year to ponder and research whether their responsive was going to be maximally  effective. That is what a social AI would be like "148. In addition, an AGI would have equal superpowers  in, say, the economic realm, and would thus be able to perfectly read and profit from the stock mar ket.  That AGI would also be superhumanly skilled at tec hnology development: " it would do research and  development simultaneously in hundreds of technical subfields and relentlessly combine ideas  between fields. Human technological development would cease, and AI or AI -guided research  technologies would quickly  become ubiquitous "149. AGI could quite literally make humans obsolete.                                                                145  Julia Ciocca, Michael C.

Work ", Forum Alpbach,  27 August 2020, https://2020.alpbach.org/events/96 .   147  Some make a difference between AGI as AI that equals humans across tasks, while Superintelligence exceeds human intelligence,  but  this distinction is not universally shared. Usually, once a computer masters a skill, it automatically exceeds humans.   148  Arm strong, Stuart, Smarter than us: The rise of machine intelligence .

Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      29 PE 662.926  Stuard Armstrong notes argues that the dear of a super strong " Terminator " might be misguided.  Humankind’s comparative advantage over the rest of the earth’s species does not lie in our strength –  but our brain: " we should fear entities that are capable of beating us at our own game. It is the  ‘intelligence’ part of ‘artificial intelligence’ that we have to fear. If machines can outthink us and  outcompete us in the fields of human dominat ion – economics, politics, science, propaganda – then  we have a serious problem "150.   The emergence of AGI should not be discarded as belonging in the realm of science fiction, as unlikely  as it sounds. OpenAI, the US- based AI firm behind the GPT -3 language model has as its stated goal the  development of " discovering and enacting the path t o safe artificial general intelligence "151. A large  survey among m achine -learning experts found in 2018 that researchers believe there is a 50% chance  of AI outperforming humans in all tasks in 45 years152. Another survey, whose results were similar, notes  that the experts estimate " the chance is about one in three that this development turns out to be ‘bad’  or ‘extremely bad’ for humanity "153.   These "bad outcomes " for humanity would also have geopolitical implications – and, incidentally, some  of them would not  even require the actual emergence of AGI.   AGI could create an existent ial risk for humankind154. The primary concern is not about AGI turning evi l .  Rather, the risk emerges from a lack of " value alignment " – AGI need not h ave humanlike motives or  values155. An AGI tasked to manufacture paperclips might end up devouring all resources  on earth to  produce paperclips156. An AGI tasked with solving climate change could end up killing all humans since  this would indeed end human -made climate change. Considerations suc h as these have influenced the  field of AI safety and research is being carried out by AI firms on ensuring value alignment for AI in  development, in cluding AI falling short of AGI157.  If AGI that could be controlled were to be developed, Putin’s statement t hat whoever leads on AI  becomes the ruler of the world, might finally become appropriate. If one actor, whether it is a state or  private company, were to achieve AGI, this actor would gain unrivalled power, influence and gain.  Researchers at the University  of Oxford are trying to address these concerns, at least regarding  economic gains. They argue that if the financial revenue resulting from AGI (or very successful narrow  AI) were to accrue to a narrow set of actors, this could give rise " to a level of ine quality with no close  historical analogy " and propose ways how the winners could distribute the " windfall"  fr o m  s u ch   success158. Still, the potential gain in (geopolitical) power could be so significant that it migh t be  extremely difficult to rei n in.                                                                 150  Ibid., p.7.  151  OpenAI https://openai.com/ .   152  Also see Müller, Vincent C. and Bos trom, Nick (forthcoming 2014), ‘Future progress in artificial intelligence: A Survey of Expert Opinion, in  Vincent C.

Namely, concerns, or just rumours,  over the imminent emergence of AGI could create a secu rity dilemma. If a state were to believe that an  opponent was close to AGI, they might consider striking pre -emptively, in order to pre- empt the  associated boost in power.  
Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      31 PE 662.926  4. IS EUROPE PREPARING ITSELF? A COMPARATIV E ANAL YSIS OF  NA TIONAL AI STRA TEGI ES IN EU ROPE   European policymakers’ efforts to grapple with the rapid pace of AI development have gone through  several phases over the last years. The first phase was marked by uncertainty over what to make of the  rapid and seemingly ground -breaking developments in AI. This phase lasted until around 2018 –  though, in some European states, and on s ome issues, uncertainty remains159. The second phase  consisted of efforts to frame and AI challenges politically, and to address them, on a domestic level. In  its December 2018 "Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence ", the European Commission encouraged  Member States  to develop nat ional AI strategies by mid -2019160. As of May 2021, twenty -one Member  States  have now published these policy documents in which they identify areas of focus, develop  recommendations , and decide funding priorities161. The strategies differ in several aspects; the shortest  AI strategy is 10 pages (Estonia), the longest 152 pages (Fran ce); Finland has already published two AI  strategies, while some EU countries have not yet published their first. And four Member States  chose  to publish their strategies in their national language only.   A unifying characteristic is that many of these str ategies are strikingly ambitious. Czechia, for example  has set the goal to become " a model European country for AI ". The Swedish government’s goal is " to  make Sweden a leader in harnessing the opportunities that the use of AI can offer ". Portugal aims to b e  "at the forefront of AI education for all " by 2030, and Denmark wants to be "a front -runner i n  responsible development and use of artificial intelligence" . Even small states like Malta aim to be the  "Ultimate AI Launchpad "; Luxembourg wants to be a " digital frontrunner ".   However  the national AI strategies also reveal that in the EU, AI is primarily seen through economic  lenses. Almost all strategies are written by, or under the leadership of economy ministries (and  variations thereof) or, less often, min istries of innovation (and variations thereof). Within this field, the  national strategies discuss a wide range of topics, most notably AI development, adoption, and AI  principles.   On AI development, the strategies show that t he importance of talent is wel l understood throughout  Europe. Finland worries that Europe will soon start " suffering from brain drain " to other AI powers if it  does not act to prevent this. Germany, in its strategy, announces the creation of at least 100 additional  AI professorships, t o ensure the education of new talent and sufficient development space for existing  experts. France wants to triple the number of people trained in AI in France and proposes salary top ups and reductions in administrative formalities for AI researchers. How ever  AI education also goes  beyond the training of specialists and includes training the wider public on how to use and navi gate  AI. Portugal, for example, wants to foster " digital minds " and to be at the forefront of AI education by  teaching every student  computer science.   The strategies also aim to encourage data collection and sharing. France wants data to become a  common good, its strategy encourage economic players to share and pool their data and argues that  the state could act as a trusted third par ty. The French strategy says that in some circumstances publ i c  authorities could " impose openness on certain data of public interest ". Spain vows to create a " Na t ional  Data Institute " to plan and define governance over data from different levels of governm ent.                                                                159  Parts of this section are adopted from Ulrike Franke, "Artificial Divide.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.926  32  On AI research, there is agreement that international  and European cooperation is important,  especially for smaller states. Luxembourg’s strategy, for instance, notes that "the country’s  opportunities to develop ground -breaking fundamental AI research  are limited. " Its solution:  "Luxembourg could become part of a cutting -edge, cross -border hub for applied AI research of the  highest level of excellence. " However  larger states also consider research cooperation crucial: Germany  will form a European innov ation cluster providing funding for cooperative research projects over the  next five years. France and Germany have also agreed to build a joint virtual research and development  centre.   The strategies also aim to encourage the use of AI for private firms. Germany, home of many smal l and  medium -sized companies, aims to increase AI -specific support by employing " AI trainers " that visi t  companies and work with them on integrating AI. Lithuania wants to establish a platform for business  leaders to exchange experiences with AI. Slovakia is looking to set up public- private partnerships.   Finally, a topic that appears in all national AI strategies across Europe is ethical AI. Ethical, or  "trustworthy " AI is a topic that the EU early on defined as a primary area of i nterest and work , and no  actor, however, has so publicly put itself at the forefr ont of this issue as the EU has162. The European  Commission created a "High -Level Expert Group on AI ", which in April 2019 released its Ethics  Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, followed by its Policy and Investment  Recommendations for Trus tworthy Artificial Intelligence163. Ethical AI is not just a concern for EU  institutions: worry over the (un)ethical use of AI or its misuse164 is a shared concern throughout the  union , with every national AI strategy published by Member States  touches on the topic, and several  countries, such as Denmark and Lithuania, identify ethical rules as their first priority.  Malta proposes  the "world’s first national AI certification progra mme " as a concrete measure in its strategy. Spai n’s  proposes the drafting of an "AI Code of Ethics, aligned with the efforts made by the European  Commission ". Interestingly, t he Danish strategy notes that ethical AI is a particularly European  approach: "Europe and Denmark should not copy the US or China. Both countries are investing heavi l y  in artificial intelligence, but with little regard for responsibility, ethical principles and privacy. "   In addition to these shared themes, there are national idiosyncr asies such as Italy discussing how to  use AI for the conservation and protection of cultural assets, and tourism. The use of AI in agriculture  and ecology is mentioned by France, Poland, and Hungary, while Portugal is looking into AI for  sustainable cities , and sustainable energy networks.   Strikingly, however, the strategies largely ignore the topic of this report: the geopolitical implication of  artificial intelligence. The impact of AI on international stability, on international cooperation, and the  use of AI in the military realm – with very few exceptions, the European states do not engage with the  challenges posed by the way AI development and uptake might impact the international balanc e of  power165. Of the 21 national AI strategies, only a handful dis cuss the topic of the military implications  of AI. Even larger states such as Italy, NATO’s fifth -largest defence spender, do not engage with the  topic of military applications of AI and what they may mean for the future of military operati ons or  alliance interoperability. If the military elements of AI are mentioned, it is done in passing, suc h as i n                                                                162  Janosch Delcker, "In global AI race,  Europe pins hopes on ethics ", Politico , 25 April 2018, https://www.politico.eu/article/eur op e commission -andrus -ansip -hopes -ethical -approach -will- be-its-edge- in-global -ai-artificial -inte lligence -ra ce/ .   163  "Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence ", High -Level Expert Group on AI, April 2019, https://digital strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics -guidelines -trustworthy -ai; "Policy and investment recommendations for trustworthy Artificia l  Intelligence ", High -Level Expert Group on AI, https://digital -strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/policy -and -investment -recommendation s trustworthy -artificial -intellige nce.   164  On the misuse of AI, see " The Malicious Use of Artificial Intelligence ", Report February 2018, https://maliciousaireport.com/ .  165  On this also see Ulrike Franke, " Not smart enough: The poverty of European military thinking on artificial intelligence ", ECFR , December  2019, https://ecfr.eu/publication/not_smart_enough_poverty_europ ean_military_thinking_artificial_intelligence/ .

The research on AI applications, in particular for the protec tion   of external security and for military purposes, will be carried out within the scope of the departmental  responsibilities. " Most national strategies do not mention military AI at all, and very few note other  geopolitical challenges.   On this, the Frenc h AI strategy is an outlier. France’s national AI strategy  is grounded in and motivated  by geopolitical concerns . It notes  that "France and Europe need to ensure that their voices are heard  and must do their utmost to remain independent. But there is a lot  of competition: the United States  and China are at the forefront of this technology and their investments far exceed those made in  Europe. " The strategy also warns that " France and Europe can already be regarded as ‘cybercolonies’ in  many aspects ". The Fr ench national strategy  also  identifies AI -enabled defence as one of four strategic  sectors for industrial policy. It discusses at length how the US is able to utilise new technologies in the  military realm and what Europe may learn from this experience. Mo st strikingly, France is also the only  country in the EU that has published a de dicated strategy on military AI166. In addition to France, the  Netherlands are also showing increased interest in military AI. A military AI strategy is reportedly being  prepared by the Dutch Ministry of Defence, but has yet to be  published. The Dutch national AI strategy  notes opportunitie s offered by AI in the field of military decision support, intelligence gathering, data  analysis, and accelerated responsiveness in the defence of Dutch territory. It also notes that AI -en abled  unmanned systems could create opportunities to intervene in ar eas that are not accessible to people  due to anti -access/area denial weapons systems167. Other EU Member States  to at least briefly  acknowledge AI’s impact on the military and defence realm are Hungary, Sweden, and Latvia. In many  countries, officials seem u ncomfortable discussing the subject, unless the focus is on whether and how  to ban lethal a utonomous weapon systems (LAWS)168.                                                                    166  « Communiqué : Publication du rapport du ministère des Armées sur l’intelligence artificielle  », September 2019,   https://www.defense.gouv.fr/english/salle -de-presse/communiques/communique_publication -du-rapport -du-ministere -des-armees sur-l-intelligence -artificielle .   167  "Strategic Action P lan for Artificial Intelligence ", Government of the Netherlands, October 2019,   https://www.government.nl/documents/reports/2019/1 0/09 /s trategic -act ion -plan -for-ar tificial -intelligence .   168  Ulrike Franke, "Europe needs a plan for AI in the military realm ", The Security Times, February 2020, https://www.the -security times.com/europe -needs -plan -ai-military -realm/ .  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.926  34  5. WHERE TO GO FROM HER E? EUROPE’ S AI DIPLO MACY   Europe is working to develop a rtificial intelligence. Despite some hurdles, section  two of this paper  showed that European states are reasonably well placed to support research and development of AI,  as well as the adoption of AI -enabled systems. Challenges exist and need to be dealt with by national  governments and the EU, and inner -European differences should be addressed . The EU does face some  specific challenges, as a hybrid polity not hav ing the same capabilities as nations  but bring ing together  nations with different languages and cultures Still, there are no fundamental  reasons why  Europe  should not be in the running " for the bronze medal " – or more. Section 3  outlined six ways how AI could  have geopolitical implications – while section 4 demonstrated that all these concerns remain  worryingly underdiscussed in Europe. This last sect ion takes the six themes and recommends ways how  the EU, and its Member States , can address the challenges that arise from them. However,  more than  any of the recommendations below, it is crucially important for the EU to encourage the debate, and  fund Eur opean research on the geopolitical elements of AI , as the European viewpoint remains  understudied .   This paper has referenced  several times the 700+ pages report that the US National Security  Commission on AI published in early 2021. It has quoted the Comm issioners and discussed many of the  points the report raised. The paper has also cited many US studies, in particular analyses done by the  Center for Security and Emerging Technologies (CSET), a research centre at Georgetown University  which was founded in 2019 with support from philanthropical institutions and US technology fi rms.  This may be surprising in a study of European  geopolitical interest, and European security concerns  related to AI. But it is a testimony of the dominance of US thinking in this s pace – and a testimony of  the relative lack of European official publications.   This dominance of US research is a problem for Europe. Of course, a lot of the US analysis appli es to  Europe (and other allies) and therefore deserves  to be taken into account. But if Europe does not  engage with these themes from a European viewpoint, it leaves the interpretative power to others . US  thinking will shape the debate in a way that is most conducive to US interests. And these interests wil l  not always align perfectly with European interests. Second, this dynamic also risks that the focus i s on  those threats that are primarily threats t o the US w hich means that there is a danger that threats to  European interests and security will remain understudied unless Europe begins to take this on. The US  security community is focused primarily on China; the AI Commission’s report mentions China 69 9  times, CSET regularly translate s important Chinese -language documents relevant to China’s AI  strategy169. But other actors, such as Russia, attract less attention  (the Commission’s report mentions  Russia only 64 times)170. For European security, however, Rus sian plans, actions, and capabilities are at  least equally important. Furthermore, some questions relating to geopolitical and military power  changes caused by AI are less relevant to the US, but highly relevant to Europeans. For example, the                                                                169  See for example: " Translation: Outline of the People’s Republic of China 14th Five -Year Plan for National Economic and Social  Development and Long -Range Objectives for 2035" , CSET , https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/china -14th -five-year -plan / ;  "Translation: A Study of Shenzhen’s International Technology Transfer Model and Measures to Improve It ", CSET , April 29, 2021  https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/a -study -of-shenzhens -international -technology -transfer -model -and -measures -to-improve -it/;  "Translation: Miao Wei: Advancing the High -Quality Development of the Manufacturing Industry ", CSET , April 15, 2021,  https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/miao -wei-advancing -the-high -quality -development -of-the-manufacturing -industry/ ;  "Translation: Certain Opinions of the Ministry of Education, the China National Intellectual Prope rty Administration, and the Ministry of  Science and Technology on Improving the Quality of Patents at Institutes of Higher Education and Promoting [Patent] Conversio n and  Use", CSET , March 26, 2021 https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/certain -opinions -of-the-ministry -of-education -the-china -nation al intellectual- property -administration -and -the-ministry -of-science -and -technology -on-improving -the-quality -of-patents -at-institutes -of/.   170  CSET also works  on Russia: " Translation: Draft Resolutions Have Been Prepared Concerning the Allocation of 16.5 Billion Rubles in  Subsidies for the Development of AI in Russia ", CSET , April 15, 2021,  https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/draft- resolutions -have been -prepared -concerning -the-allocation -of-16-5-billion -rubles -in-subsid ies-for-the-development -of-ai-in-russia/ ; "Translation:  Development of Artificial Intelligence ", CSET , April 15, 2021,  https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/d evelopment -of-artificial intelligence/ .  
Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      35 PE 662.926  impact that A I-enabled military systems might have on smaller states is of crucial importance and  interest to Europeans and deserves  considerably more attention – which can only come through  European research.   Therefore, the first two concrete recommendations of this report are the creation of a European  research institute specifically focused on geopolitical and security impacts of AI, and the establishment  of a European Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence. The idea is not to copy the US institutions  (or approach), but to take the example and make  it work  for Europe. The European research institute  could focus on questions that are of immediate relevance to Europe. It could serve as a hub for the  burgeoning community of European researchers working on these themes in different European  states, and allow them to exchange their work and cooperate. It could also help educate policymakers,  for example through short trainings and regular engagement with relevant institutions and  decisionmakers171.   The European Secu rity Commission on Artificial Intelligence should bring together high -level European  experts, policymakers , and representatives from the private sector. It  should aim to have a pan European representation, thus allowing for different European views to be expressed and shape the  main messages. Importantly, its mandate should be specifically to study and make recommendati ons  on European security concerns on AI. Both the research institute and the commission could then reac h  out to partners outside of Europe, helping to achieve the goals set out below.   5.1. Europe’s interest s and goals  - Recommendations on how to face the geopolitical AI  challenges   Section three has laid out six areas in which AI pose s geopolitical challenges.  In all these areas, Europe  has interes ts. It may be to avoid catastrophic outcomes like flash wars caused by the uncontrolled and  too fast adoption of AI -enabled autonomous weapons, or the rise of a superintelligence able to  obliterate humankind. Or it can be an interest to shape the developments in its favour and benefit from  them where possible.   In the area of US -China competition , the first immediate European interest is to  help both  a cto rs  avoid  a (military) confrontation. A direct confrontation between the US and China, ( independently of the role  of AI in it ), would have catastrophic consequences for Europe and the world. This does not mean to  overlook differences, or to kowtow to China. But Europe could encourage both sides  to tone down their  rhetoric, to avoid an unnecessary escalation.   Working with the US : The US are Europe’s most important partner , and the EU should work closely  with the US on AI as well as on other t opics to face China . However, with regard to transatlanti c  cooperation on A I, it may be advisable not to place US -Europe an cooperation on AI in the confrontati on   with  China context. Although there is some change in European attitude s toward China happening at  the moment (see below), Europeans do not feel the same urgency as the US when it comes to pushing  back against Beiji ng. This means that the American interest in using transatlantic AI cooperation as a  means to curb Chinese power is likely to have only limited traction in Europe.   Calls for cooperation between the United States and Europe have become particularly loud in  recent  times. All discussions of American positioning on technology note the im portance of working with  allies172. The European Commission is proposing a " Transatlantic Trade and Technology Council ", to set                                                                171  Michael C.

In June 2020,  the Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was  founded to consider the responsible development of AI; it counts among its members the US, four  European states, and the European Union.  In September 2020, the US set up a group of like- minded  countries "to provide values -based global leadership in defense for policies and approaches in  adopting AI ", which included seven European states, in addition to countries such as Australia, Canada,  and South Korea. Several other forums, like a D -10 for democratic states, or a ‘summit fo r democracy’  have been proposed173.   The EU should keep an eye on such new forums. On the one hand, it might be advisable for EU Member  States  to join such partnerships. B ut groups or alliances that include only a few European countries and  some of the United States’ other like- minded partners might be problematic from an EU viewpoint.  Europeans should strive for Europe -wide harmonisation, not the creation of further differ ences.  Therefore,  the EU may want to mobilise existing multilateral frameworks to deal with technology and  AI, rather than create new forums . In addition , it would also be advisable for the EU  itself  to joi n any  such grouping as a member to ensure that Eur opean positions are not watered down , or Member  States  divided among themselves.   The EU’s aforementioned effort to strengthen ethical AI, and to make ‘trustworthy AI’ a unique selling  point for Europe, could also create problem s for transatlantic cooperati on174. Many EU policymakers  believe that the EU’s insistence on ethical AI could  eventually become a location advantage for Europe  (much like data privacy): as more people become concerned about unethical AI and data security, they  will prefer to use or buy AI ‘made in Europe’ rather than elsewhere. In this respect, two European aims  are at odds with each other: on the one hand, Europeans want to ensure that AI is developed and used  in an ethical way. Partnering with a powerful player such as the US on this m atter should be an obvious  way to help them achieve this goal. However, if the EU considers ethical AI not just a goal for humanity  but a development that may also create commercial advantages for Europe, then transatlanti c  cooperation on this issue is cou nterproductive, as it would undermine Europe’s uniqueness.   Furthermore, some  Europeans have expressed scepticism about the extent to which Europe and the  US are indeed aligned on ethical AI principles. For example, the Danish national AI strategy describes   ethical AI as a particularly European approach: " Europe and Denmark should not copy the US or Chi na.  Both countries are investing heavily in artificial intelligence, but with little regard for responsibility,  ethical principles and privacy. " Many Europeans feel that the US "has no idea how to regulate "  cyberspace and continues to show  little enthusiasm for doing so175.  None of these differences between the partners should, however, preclude US -EU cooperation on AI .  There are many  areas for tran satlantic AI cooperation , and investing in potentially less controversial  areas may help create new platforms and lay important groundwork for greater cooperation. For  example, the transatlantic allies should facilitate the exchange of knowledge and best p ractices on AI,  and invest in mutually beneficial research, such as privacy -preserving machine learning.  Defence might  also be a promising area for transatlantic cooperation, given the close military ties between the US and  Europe through NATO. Given the a forementioned concerns over how the introduction of AI onto the                                                                Chhabra, Tarun; Chahal, Husanjot, " Agile Alliances.

One issue was over whether to allow Chinese  investment into European technology and European digital infrastructures, something most important  to economically weaker countries. There was an agreement over the import ance of reciprocity and the  creation of a level playing field with China. However  the Europeans had problems agreeing on c ommon  positions, which contributed to the breakdown of  the simulation’s negotiations177.  There appears to be some movement on this. Whil e European policymakers so far do not want to follow  the US lead of  decoupling from China , and are generally sceptical of export controls, increasingly,  Euro peans are growing wary of China178. Relations have soured (exacerbated by the Chinese  sanctioning of EU policymakers, and there is more realisation that while a conciliatory approach is  laudable, if hedging and strategic indecisiveness continues, European policymakers risk new forms of  dependency that the Chinese leadership deliberately wants to create, t hereby actively undercut t ing its   own sovereignty agenda179. Surveys among policymakers have shown that there is a growing  agreement in EU Member States  that the EU needs to restrict Chinese investments in strategi c  sectors180, and most commentators agree that with the EU framework for screening foreign direct  investment (FDI) which  became operational in  October 2020 and which p rovides the EU Commission  and Member States  with a mechanism to exchange information about investment projects by thi rd  country investors , the EU has taken a major step forward in protecting its interests from harmful fo reign   investments and takeovers181. Still, the ultimate choice to accept or rejec t a foreign investment remains  within national capitals, which have different degrees of sensitivity. Revealingly, as of now, ten  EU  Member States  still do not have national FDI screening mechanisms182.  Europe’s position between the US and China will continu e to be a difficult one.  The EU will need to look  both ways, east and west, and its interests will not always align perfectly with the US’ interests.  But i t  should be clear that the transatlantic relationship is key to Europe’s external tech policy , and th at there  is and cannot be an equidistance between the US and China.   Authoritarianism and weakening of democracy : This area is a core concern for Europeans, and  arguable the area in which the EU can have the most important impact. Trustworthy or ethical AI  is  a   primary focus for the EU. Trustworthy AI is defined as lawful, ethical (adhering to ethical principles and                                                                176 "Virtual EU -China Technology Summit Simulation ", Aspen Institute , 17 November 2020,  https://www.aspeninstitute.de/wp content/uploads/Findings_Aspen- EU-China -Summit -Simulation.pdf .   177 "Virtual EU -China Technology Summit Simulation ", Aspen Institute , 17 November 2020,  https://www.aspeninstitute.de/wp content/uploads/Findings_Aspen- EU-China -Summit -Simulation.pdf .  178 Janka Oerte l, "The new China consensus: How Europe is growing wary of Beijing ", ECFR , September 2020,   https://ecfr.eu/publication/the_new_china_consensus_how_europe_is_growing_wary_of_beijing/ .   179 Janka Oertel, "US-China confrontation and repercussions for the EU ", ECFR , March 2021, https://ecfr.eu/article/us -china -systemic -riva lr y repercussions -for-the-eu/.   180  ECFR, EU Coalition Explorer 2020 , https://ecfr.eu/special/eucoalitione xplorer/policy_intentions_mapping/ .  181  Manisha Reuter, "Responding to the China challenge: The state of play on investment screening in Europe ", ECFR , 27 November 2020,  https://ecfr.eu/article/responding -to-the-china -challenge -the-state -of-play -on-investment -screening -in-europe/ ; "New EU screening  framework also targeting Chinese FDI is finally in place ", Merics , 22 October 2020, https://merics.org/en/short -analysis/new -eu-screening framework -also -targeting -chinese -fdi-finally -place .  182  Noted in Alice Panier, " Euro pe in the Geopolitics of Technology, Connecting the Internal and External Dimensions ", IFRI, April 2021, p.2,  https://www.ifri.org/sites/de fault/files/atoms/files/pannier_europe_geopolitics_technology_2021_.pdf .  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.926  38  values), and robust from a technical and social perspective. The 2021  EU AI regulation notes the union’s  objective of being a global leader in the development of trustworthy and ethical AI , And, as shown  above,  concern over unethical AI is shared throughout the union with every European national AI  strategy touch ing upon the topic. It is crucially important for the EU to keep this focus, and not  compromise on its values for alleged benefits.   Trustworthy AI is beneficial for all users of AI -enabled systems – in Europe and beyond. Ensuring that  all AI -enabled systems used in the EU are ethical is good for Europeans who can trust that their  technolo gies will not be biased, illegal or otherwise harmful. This is likely to encourage and thus  increase AI adoption rates, which can be expected to have a positive economic impact. If the EU  succeeded in encouraging others to adopt trustworthy AI standards, t his would further widen the circle  of beneficiaries. Even better would be if the EU succeeded to establish itself as a leader in the field of  ethical AI, making others follow its regulations. Not only would this ensure that those ideals that  Europeans valu e in particular would be adequately reflected. The EU could furthermore get a location  advantage, meaning that because of its leadership on ethical AI, ‘ AI made in Europe ’ would be known  to follow the highest standards, thus becoming a sought -after commodi ty.  In this context, the EU should also make offers to third countries, especially emerging countries. It is in  Europe’s immediate interest that these countries use (trustworthy) technology from Europe, instead of  Chinese systems that may help promote auth oritarian structures.   With regard to the dangers of AI nationalism , Europe’s main role will be to be aware of the danger,  and weigh each decision to support domestic AI development against the concern that it may fuel  nationalist tendencies. This report certainly does not want to discourage  efforts to build up European  Digital Sovereignty – but recommends not walking into the trap of AI nationalism in a European  disguise. Europe has a long history of working with partners around the world – it is in this contex t that  this ability will be of particular importance.   Empowering of private firms : When it comes to the regulation of firms, the EU is probably the furthest  advanced, which can be explained by the union’s competencies in the area of trade and regula tion.  Much has been made by the EU Commission’s "push against big Tech "183, driven most notably by  Commissioners Margrethe Vestager and Thierry Breton , and epitomised in the  high number  of  regulation s mentioned above.  Still, given that the major technology f irms  are American and  increasingly Chinese, the EU has limited power to impact the general shift of power from the state to  private firms described in section 3.4.   Defence and security : Section 3.5 has shown that AI in the military realm can create import ant military  advantages, while at the same time creating risks and danger that need to be addressed. So far, most  Europeans have overlooked the area of military AI in a way that is not sustainable. Europe s h ould  engage  with the use of  AI in the military an d defence realm  in order to  strengthen its defence  capabilities  and helping to guarantee the safety and security of its citizens. Europe’s military -in dus trial  base could get a boost through the work on cutting -edge technology. As they are new, AI -en a bled  capabilities could become an important are a of cooperation between different European companies,  thus strengthening common  European defence.   Given the lack of interest displayed in the topic by Europeans, the EU should officially ask its Member  States  to develop and publish military AI strategies184. The European Commission’s encouragement to                                                                183  Thibault Larger, Mark Scott, Laura Kayali "Inside the EU’s divisions on how to go after Big Tech ", Politico , 14 December 2020,  https://www.politico.eu/article/margrethe -vestager -thierry -bret on -europe -big-tech -regulation -digital -se rvices -markets -act / .   184  Ulrike Franke, "Europe needs a plan for AI in the military realm" , The Security Times , February 2020, https://www.the -security times.com/europe -needs -plan -ai-military -realm/ . 
Artificial Intelligence diplomacy  | Artificial Intelligence governance as a new external policy tool      39 PE 662.926  develop national AI strategies played an important role in encouraging Member States  to engage with  the topic185. A similar encouragement regarding military AI could lead to a better understanding i n  Europe of the challenges and potential benefits of the use of AI in the military realm and encourage  European cooperation and help guarantee European military interoperability.    EU Member States  that are also members of NATO sh ould encourage NATO to focus on allied  interoperability. With regard to transatlantic cooperation on military AI, non -controversial uses , like the  use of AI in sustainment and logistics may be a great area for cooperation. Transatlantic cooperation i n  this field would  uncontroversial, but extremely useful – especially when carried out within NATO, as  this could help bring allies closer together, establish joint procedures, and thereby ensure  interoperability186. In this context, t he EU may also w ant to react to the proposal of a creation of an  "Atlantic -Pacific Security Technology Partnership to improve defense and intelligence interoperability  across Europe and the Indo -Pacific"  which the US national security commission on AI p roposed187.  As pointed out above, the EU should create a European Security Commission on AI whose task it would  be to engage with the challenges and benefits AI can bring for European security and defence.  By  engaging in the debate on the problems related to the use of AI -enabled weapons, Europe can  contribute to mitigating the most problematic uses, such as lethal autonomous weapons.   Artificial General Intelligence:  With regard to the danger arising from AGI, Europe should pay more  attention to and invest in AI safety. The Centre for Long -Term Resilience in the UK has just published a  study of extreme risk, in which it identif ied AGI as a threat to humanity188. The authors recommen d  investing more into progress tracking in AI in Europe, and bringing more technical expertise into  governments.   5.2. Conclusion   The technological is geopolitical . Artificial intelligence has become an element of great power  competition. This is the reality that the EU and its Member States  need to face. AI is set to influence the  global balance of power, and the relatio nship between states, as well as geopolitics more generally.  The EU needs to take this challenge seriously, and engage with the changes outlined in this paper. It   needs to consider the external dimension of its action, and how to deal with allies, partners , co u n tries   it wants to support, and opponents. This paper has given an overview of the EU’s capabilities in AI, and  has discussed six ways how AI might influence  the global balance of power and Europe’s standi ng  within it . It has proposed ways how the EU and its Member States  can take on these challenges –  something most European states have not yet begun to do. It is high time for Europe to invest more  time, effort, and ultimately money to guarantee that Europe benefits from the international challenges  that AI is introducing, while mitigating the downsides of this development.                                                                  185  Coordinated Plan on Artificial  Intelligence, European Commission, https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/coordinate d plan -artificial -intelligence .  186  Margarita Konaev , Husanjot Chahal, "The Path of Least Resistance, Multinational Collaboration on AI for Military Logistics and  Sustainment ", CSET , April 2021,  https://cset.georgetown.edu/re search/the -path -of-least -resistance/  Also see Franke, Ulrike, "Artificia l  Divide.

The European Union (EU), however, approaches AI primarily from an economic, social, and  regulatory angle. This paper discusses the way that AI impacts the European Union’s geopolitical  power and its relationship  with other countries. It presents possible scenarios for how AI may change  the international balance of power and recommends ways for the EU and  its Member States to  respond.
