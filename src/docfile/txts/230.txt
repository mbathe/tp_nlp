Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   3 Introduction   In 2019 the High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG),2 set up by the  European Commission, published the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial  Intelligence.3 The third chapter of those Guidelines cont ained an Assessment List to help  assess whether the AI system that is being developed, deployed, procured or used, adheres  to the seven requirements of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI), as specified in our Ethics  Guidelines for Trustworthy AI:   1. Huma n Agency and Oversight;   2. Technical Robustness and Safety;   3. Privacy and Data Governance;   4. Transparency;   5. Diversity, Non -discrimination and Fairness;   6. Societal and Environmental Well -being;   7. Accountability.   This document contains the final Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) presented by  the AI HLEG. This Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) is intended for self -evaluation  purposes. It provides an initial approach for the evaluation of Trustworthy AI. It builds on the  one outlined in the Ethics Gui delines for Trustworthy AI and was developed over a period of  two years, from June 2018 to June 2020. In that period this Assessment List for Trustworthy  AI (ALTAI) also benefited from a piloting phase (second half of 2019).4 Through that piloting  phase, t he AI HLEG received valuable feedback through fifty in- depth interviews with  selected companies; input through an open work stream on the AI Alliance5 to provide best  practices; and, via two publicly accessible questionnaires for technical and non- technica l  stakeholders.6  This Assessment List (ALTAI) is firmly grounded in the protection of people's fundamental  rights, which is the term used in the European Union to refer to human rights enshrined in  the EU Treaties,7 the Charter of Fundamental Rights (the Charter)8, and international human  rights Law.9 Please consult the text box below on fundamental rights to familiarise yourself  with the concept and with the content of a Fundamental Rights Impact Assessment.   This As sessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) is intended for flexible use: organisations  can draw on elements relevant to the particular AI system from this Assessment List for  Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) or add elements to it as they see fit, taking into consideration the  sector they operate in. It helps organisations understand what Trustworthy AI is, in particular  what risks an AI system might generate, and how to minimize those risks while maximising  the benefit of AI. It is intended to help organisations identi fy how proposed AI systems might                                                   2 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/high-level -expert -group- artificial-intelligence.   3 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/ethics -guidelines -trustworthy -ai.  4 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ethics -guidelines -trustworthy -ai/register -piloting -process -0.  5 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/eu- ai-alliance/BestPractices.   6 https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/register -piloting -process.   7 https://europa.eu/european- union/law/treaties_en   8 https://ec.europa.eu/info/aid -development -cooperation-fundamental -rights/your -rights -eu/eu -charter fundamental -rights_en   9 https://www.un.org/en/section s/universal -declaration/foundation-international -human-rights -law/index.html.  
4 generate risks, and to identify whether and what kind of active measures may need to be  taken to avoid and minimise those risks. Organisations will derive the most value from this  Assessment List (ALTAI) by active engagemen t with the questions it raises, which are aimed  at encouraging thoughtful reflection to provoke appropriate action and nurture an  organisational culture committed to developing and maintaining Trustworthy AI systems. It  raises awareness of the potential im pact of AI on society, the environment, consumers,  workers and citizens (in particular children and people belonging to marginalised groups). It  encourages the involvement of all relevant stakeholders. It helps to gain insight on whether  meaningful and app ropriate solutions or processes to accomplish adherence to the seven  requirements (as outlined above) are already in place or need to be put in place. This could  be achieved through internal guidelines, governance processes, etc.   A trustworthy approach is  key to enabling ‘responsible competitiveness’, by providing the  foundation upon which all those using or affected by AI systems can trust that their design,  development and use are lawful, ethical and robust.10 This Assessment List for Trustworthy  AI (ALTAI) helps foster responsible and sustainable AI innovation in Europe. It seeks to  make ethics a core pillar for developing a unique approach to AI, one that aims to benefit,  empower and protect both individual human flourishing and the common good of societ y.  We believe that this will enable Europe and European organisations to position themselves  as global leaders in cutting- edge AI worthy of our individual and collective trust.   This document is the offline version of this Assessment List for Trustworthy A I (ALTAI). An  online interactive version of this Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) is available.11   How to use this Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   This Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) is best completed involving a  multidiscip linary team of people. These could be from within and/or outside your  organisation with specific competences or expertise on each of the 7 requirements and  related questions. Among the stakeholders you may find for example the following:   • AI designers and A I developers of the AI system;   • data scientists;   • procurement officers or specialists;   • front-end staff that will use or work with the AI system;   • legal/compliance officers;   • management.   If you do not know how to address a question and find no useful help on the AI Alliance  page,12 it is advised to seek outside counsel or assistance. For each requirement, this  Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) provides introductory guidance and relevant  definitions in the Glossary. The online version of this Assessment  List for Trustworthy AI  (ALTAI) contains additional explanatory notes for many of the questions.13                                                   10 The three components of Trustworthy AI, as defined in the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI.   11 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/item.cfm?item_id=682761   12 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/item.cfm?item_id=682761   13 https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/item.cfm?item_id=682761  
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   5       Fundamental Rights     Fundamental rights encompass rights such as human dignity and non- discrimination, as well as  rights in relation to data protection an d privacy, to name just some examples. Prior to self -assessing  an AI system with this Assessment List, a fundamental rights impact assessment (FRIA) should be  performed.     A FRIA could include questions such as the following –  drawing on specific articles in the Charter  and the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR)14 its protocols and the European Social  Charter.15    1. Does the AI system potentially negatively discriminate against people on the basis of any   of the following grounds (non -exhaustively) : sex, race, colour, ethnic or social origin, genetic  features, language, religion or belief, political or any other opinion, membership of a national  minority, property, birth, disability, age or sexual orientation?     Have you put in place processes to test and monitor for potential negative discrimination (bias)  during the development, deployment and use phases of the AI system?     Have you put in place processes to address and rectify for potential negative discrimination (bias) in  the AI system?    2. Does the AI system respect the rights of the child , for example with respect to child  protection   and taking the child’s best interests into account?     Have you put in place processes to address and rectify for potential harm to children by the AI  system?     Have you put in place processes to test and monitor for potential harm to children during the  development, deployment and use phases of the AI system?                                                        14 https://www.echr.coe.int/Documents/Convention_ENG.pdf.   15 https://www.coe.int/en/web/european- social -charter.  
6   3. Does the AI system protect personal data relating to individuals in line with GDPR ?16     Have you put in place processes to assess in detail the need for a data protection impact  assessment, including an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing  operations in relation to their purpose, with respect to the development, deployment and use phases  of the AI system?    Have you put in place measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security  measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data with respect to the  development, deployment and use phases of the AI system?     See the section on Privacy and Data Governance in this Assessment List, and available guidance  from the European Data Protection Supervisor.17    4.  Does the AI system respect the freedom of expression and information and/or freedom of  assembly and association?     Have you put in place processes to test and monitor for potential infringement on freedom of  expression and information, and/or freedom of assembly and association, during the development,  deployment and use phases of the AI system?    Have you put in place processes to address and rectify for potential infringement on freedom of  expression and information, and/or freedom of assembly and association, in the AI system?                                                         16 https://gdpr.eu.   17 https://edps.europa.eu/data -protection/notre-rôle -en-tant -que-contrôleur/data-protection -impact -assessment dpia_en, and https://edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/19-07 17_accountability_on_the_ground_part_ii_en.pdf . 
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   7 REQUIREMENT #1 Human Agency and Oversight   AI systems should support hum an agency and human decision- making, as prescribed by the  principle of respect for human autonomy. This requires that AI systems should both: act as  enablers for a democratic, flourishing and equitable society by supporting the user’s agency;  and uphold fundamental rights, which should be underpinned by human oversight. In this  section AI systems are assessed in terms of their respect for human agency and autonomy  as well as human oversight.   Glossary:  AI System; Autonomous AI System; End User; Human -in-Command; Human -inthe-Loop; Human- on-the-Loop; Self -learning AI System; Subject; User.   Human Agency and Autonomy   This subsection deals with the effect AI systems can have on human behaviour in the  broadest sense. It deals with the effect of AI sys tems that are aimed at guiding, influencing  or supporting humans in decision making processes, for example, algorithmic decision  support systems, risk analysis/prediction systems (recommender systems, predictive  policing, financial risk analysis, etc.). It  also deals with the effect on human perception and  expectation when confronted with AI systems that 'act' like humans. Finally, it deals with the  effect of AI systems on human affection, trust and (in)dependence.   • Is the AI system designed to interact, guide or take decisions by human end- users  that affect humans18 or society?   o Could the AI system generate confusion for some or all end -users or subjects  on whether a decision, content, advice or outcome is the result of an  algorithmic decision?   o Are end- users or other subjects adequately made aware that a decision,  content, advice or outcome is the result of an algorithmic decision?  • Could the AI system generate confusion for some or all end- users or subjects on  whether they are interacting with a human or AI system?   o Are end- users or subjects informed that they are interacting with an AI  system?   • Could the AI system affect human autonomy by generating over -reliance by   end-users?   o Did you put in place procedures to avoid that end- users over -rely on the AI  system ?  • Could the AI system affect human autonomy by interfering with the end- user’s  decision- making process in any other unintended and undesirable way?   o Did you put in place any procedure to avoid that the AI system inadvertently  affects human autonomy?  • Does the AI system simulate social interaction with or between end- users or  subjects?                                                       18 Henceforward referred to as ‘subjects’. The definition of subjects is available in the glossary.  
8 • Does the AI system risk creating human attachment, stimulating addictive behaviour,  or manipulating user behaviour? Depending on which risks are possible or likely,  please answer the questions below:   o Did you take measures to deal with possible negative consequences for   end-users or subjects in case they develop a disproportionate attachment to  the AI System?   o Did you take measures to minimise the risk of addiction?  o Did you t ake measures to mitigate the risk of manipulation?  Human Oversight  This subsection helps to self -assess necessary oversight measures through governance  mechanisms such as human- in-the-loop (HITL), human -on-the-loop (HOTL), or human- incommand (HIC) approac hes. Human -in-the-loop refers to the capability for human  intervention in every decision cycle of the system. Human -on-the-loop refers to the capability  for human intervention during the design cycle of the system and monitoring the system’s  operation. Hum an-in-command refers to the capability to oversee the overall activity of the  AI system (including its broader economic, societal, legal and ethical impact) and the ability  to decide when and how to use the AI system in any particular situation. The latter  can  include the decision not to use an AI system in a particular situation to establish levels of  human discretion during the use of the system, or to ensure the ability to override a decision  made by an AI system.   • Please determine whether the AI system (choose as many as appropriate):   o Is a self -learning or autonomous system;   o Is overseen by a Human -in-the-Loop;   o Is overseen by a Human -on-the-Loop;   o Is overseen by a Human -in-Command.   • Have the humans (human- in-the-loop, human -on-the-loop, human- in-command)  been given specific training on how to exercise oversight?   • Did you establish any detection and response mechanisms for undesirable adverse  effects of the AI system for the end -user or subject?   • Did you ensure a ‘stop button’ or procedure to safely abort an operation when  needed?  • Did you take any specific oversight and control measures to reflect the self -learning  or autonomous nature of the AI system?     
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   9 REQUIREMENT #2 Technical Robustness and  Safety   A crucial requirement for achieving Trustworthy AI systems is their dependability (the ability  to deliver services that can justifiably be trusted) and resilience (robustness when facing  changes). Technical robustness requires that AI systems are developed with a preventative  approach to risks and that they behave reliably and as intended while minimising  unintentional and unexpected harm as well as preventing it where possible. This should also  apply in the event of potential changes in their operating env ironment or the presence of  other agents (human or artificial) that may interact with the AI system in an adversarial  manner. The questions in this section address four main issues: 1) security; 2) safety;   3) accuracy; and 4) reliability, fall -back plans and reproducibility.   Glossary:  Accuracy; AI Bias; AI System; AI Reliability; AI Reproducibility; (Low) Confidence  Score; Continual Learning; Data Poisoning; Model Evasion; Model Inversion; Pen Test; Redteam.   Resilience to Attack and Security   • Could the AI system have adversarial, critical or damaging effects (e.g. to human or  societal safety) in case of risks or threats such as design or technical faults, defects,  outages, attacks, misuse, inappropriate or malicious use?   • Is the AI system certi fied for cybersecurity (e.g. the certification scheme created by  the Cybersecurity Act in Europe)19 or is it compliant with specific security standards?   • How exposed is the AI system to cyber -attacks?  o Did you assess potential forms of attacks to which the AI  system could be  vulnerable?   o Did you consider different types of vulnerabilities and potential entry points for  attacks such as:    Data poisoning (i.e. manipulation of training data);    Model evasion (i.e. classifying the data according to the attacker's  will);   Model inversion (i.e. infer the model parameters)   • Did you put measures in place to ensure the integrity, robustness and overall security   of the AI system against potential attacks over its lifecycle?  • Did you red- team/pentest the system?    • Did you inform  end-users of the duration of security coverage and updates?  o What length is the expected timeframe within which you provide security  updates for the AI system?                                                       19 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/eu- cybersecurity -act. 
10 General Safety   • Did you define risks, risk metrics and risk levels of the AI system in each specific use  case?  o Did you put in place a process to continuously measure and assess risks?  o Did you inform end- users and subjects of existing or potential risks?   • Did you identify the possible threats to the AI system (design faults, technical faults,  envir onmental threats) and the possible consequences?   o Did you assess the risk of possible malicious use, misuse or inappropriate  use of the AI system?   o Did you define safety criticality levels (e.g. related to human integrity) of the  possible consequences of faults or misuse of the AI system?   • Did you assess the dependency of a critical AI system’s decisions on its stable and  reliable behaviou r?  o Did you align the reliability/testing requirements to the appropriate levels of  stability and reliability?   • Did you plan fault tolerance via, e.g. a duplicated system or another parallel system  (AI-based or ‘conventional’)?   • Did you develop a mechanism to evaluate when the AI system has been changed to  merit   a new review of its technical robustness and safety?   Accuracy   • Could a low level of accuracy of the AI system result in critical, adversarial or  damaging consequences?  • Did you put in place measures to ensure that the data (including training data) used  to develop the AI system is up- to-date, of high quality, complete and representative  of the environment the system will be deployed in?  • Did you put in place a series of steps to monitor, and document the AI system’s  accuracy?20  • Did you consider whether the AI system's operation can invalidate the data or  assumptions it was t rained on, and how this might lead to adversarial effects?   • Did you put processes in place to ensure that the level of accuracy of the AI system  to be expected by end- users and/or subjects is properly communicated?21                                                        20 Accuracy is only one performance metric and it might not be the most appropriate depending on the  application. Monitoring false positives, false negatives, F1 score can help to determine if accuracy is actually  reflecting the system’s performance.   21 Confidence of system users will depend on how much their expectation of system performance fits with its  actual performance. Communicating accuracy metrics is therefore key.  
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   11 Reliability, Fall -back plans and Reproducibility   • Could the AI system cause critical, adversarial, or damaging consequences   (e.g. pertaining to human safety) in case of low reliability and/or reproducibility?   o Did you put in place a well -defined process to monitor if the AI system is  meeti ng the intended goals?22  o Did you test whether specific contexts or conditions need to be taken into  account   to ensure reproducibility?   • Did you put in place verification and validation methods and documentation   (e.g. logging) to evaluate and ensure differ ent aspects of the AI system’s reliability  and reproducibility?   o Did you clearly document and operationali se processes for the testing and  verification of the reliability and reproducibility of the AI system?    • Did you define tested failsafe fallback plans to address AI system errors of whatever  origin and put governance procedures in place to trigger them?    • Did you put in place a proper procedure for handling the cases where the AI system  yields results with a low confidence score?    • Is your AI system using (online) continual learning?   o Did you consider potential negative consequences from the AI system  learning novel or unusual methods to score well on its objective function?                                                        22  Performance metrics are an abstraction of the actual system behavior. Monitoring domain or application  specific parameters by a supervisory mechanism is a way to verify that the system operates as intended.  
12 REQUIREMENT #3 Privacy and Data Governance   Closely linked to the principle of prevention of harm is privacy, a fundamental right  particularly affected by AI systems. Prevention of harm to privacy also necessitates  adequate data governance that covers the quality and integrity of the data used, its  relevance in light of the domain in which the AI systems will be deployed, its access  protocols and the capability to process data in a manner that protects privacy.   Glossary:  Aggregation and Anonymisation; AI System; Data Governance; Data Protection  Impact Assessment (DPIA); Data Protection Officer (DPO); Encryption;  Lifecycle;  Pseudonymisation; Standards; Use Case.   Privacy   This subsection helps to self -assess the impact of the AI system's impact on privacy and  data protection, which are fundamental r ights that are closely related to each other and to  the fundamental right to the integrity of the person, which covers the respect for a person’s  mental and physical integrity.   • Did you consider the impact of the AI system on the right to privacy, the right to  physical, mental and/or moral integrity and the right to data protection?   • Depending on the use case, did you establish mechanisms that allow flagging issues  related to privacy concerning the AI system?   Data Governance  This subsection helps to self -assess the adherence of the AI system('s use) to various  elements concerning data protection.   • Is your AI system being trained, or was it developed, by using or processing personal  data (including special categories of personal data)?    • Did you put in place any of the following measures some of which are mandatory  under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), or a non- European  equivalent?   Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)23;   Designate a Data Protection Officer (DPO)24 and include them at an  early st ate in the development, procurement or use phase of the AI  system;    Oversight mechanisms for data processing (including limiting access  to qualified personnel, mechanisms for logging data access and  making modifications);    Measures to achieve privacy -by-design and default (e.g. encryption,  pseudonymisation, aggregation, anonymisation);                                                    23 https://gdpr.eu/data -protection -impact -assessment -template/ .  24 https://ico.org.uk/for -organisations/guide-to -data-protection/guide-to -the-general -data- protection -regulationgdpr/accountability -and- governance/data-protection- officers/. 
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   13  Data minimisation, in particular personal data (including special  categories of data);   o Did you implement the right to withdraw consent, the right to object and the  right to be forgotten into the development of the AI system?   o Did you consider the privacy and data protection implications of data  collected, generated or processed over the course of the AI system's life  cycle?   • Did you consider the privacy and data protection implications of the AI system's   non-personal training -data or other processed non -personal data?   • Did you align the AI system with relevant standards (e.g. ISO25, IEEE26) or widely  adopted protocols for (daily ) data management and governance?                                                      25 https://www.iso.org/committee/6794475.html.   26 https://standards.ieee.org/indus try-connections/ec/autonomous -systems.html.  
14 REQUIREMENT #4 Transparency   A crucial component of achieving Trustworthy AI is transparency which encompasses three  elements: 1) traceability, 2) explainability and 3) open communication about the limitations of  the AI s ystem.   Glossary:  AI System; End -User;  Explicability; Lifecycle; Subject; Traceability; Workflow of  the Model.   Traceability   This subsection helps to self -assess whether the processes of the development of the AI  system, i.e. the data and processes that yield the AI system’s decisions, is properly  documented to allow for traceability, increase transparency and, ultimately, build trust in AI  in society.   • Did you put in place measures that address the traceability of the AI system during  its entire lifecycle?   o Did you put in place measures to continuously assess the quality of the input  data to the AI system?27  o Can you trace back which data was used by the AI system to make a certain  decision(s) or recommendation(s)?   o Can you trace back which AI model or rules led to the decision(s) or  recommendation(s) of the AI system?   o Did you put in place measures to continuously assess the quality of the  output(s) of the AI system?28  o Did you put adequate logging practices in place to record the decision(s) or  recommendation(s ) of the AI system?   Explainability   This subsection helps to self -assess the explainability of the AI system. The questions refer  to the ability to explain both the technical processes of the AI system and the reasoning  behind the decisions or predictions that the AI system makes. Explainability is crucial for  building and maintaining users’ trust in AI systems. AI driven decisions –  to the extent  possible – must be explained to and understood by those directly and indirectly affected, in  order to allow for  contesting of such decisions. An explanation as to why a model has  generated a particular output or decision (and what combination of input factors contributed  to that) is not always possible. These cases are referred to as ‘blackboxes' and require                                                   27 This could take the form of a standard automated quality assessment of data input: quantifying missing values,  gaps in the data; exploring breaks in the data supply; detecting when data is insufficient for a task; detecting  when the input data is erroneous, incorrect, inaccurate or mismatched in format – e.g. sensor is not working  properly or health records are not recorded properly. A concrete example is sensor calibration : the process  which aims to check and u ltimately improve sensor performance by removing missing or otherwise inaccurate  values (called structural errors) in sensor outputs.   28 This could take the form of a standard automated quality assessment of AI output: e.g. predictions scores are  within ex pected ranges; anomaly detection in output and reassign input data leading to the anomaly detected.  
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   15 special attention. In those circumstances, other explainability measures (e.g. traceability,  auditability and transparent communication on the AI system’s capabilities) may be required,  provided that the AI system as a whole respects fundamental rights. The degr ee to which  explainability is needed depends on the context and the severity of the consequences of  erroneous or otherwise inaccurate output to human life.   • Did you explain the decision(s) of the AI system to the users?29  • Do you continuously survey the users if they understand the decision(s) of the AI  system?   Communication  This subsection helps to self -assess whether the AI system’s capabilities and limitations  have been communicated to the users in a manner appropriate t o the use case at hand. This  could encompass communication of the AI system's level of accuracy as well as its  limitations.   • In cases of interactive AI systems (e.g., chatbots, robo -lawyers), do you  communicate to users that they are interacting with an AI  system instead of a  human?   • Did you establish mechanisms to inform users about the purpose, criteria and  limitations of the decision(s) generated by the AI system?   o Did you communicate the benefits of the AI system to users?   o Did you communicate the technic al limitations and potential risks of the AI  system to users, such as its level of accuracy and/ or error rates?   o Did you provide appropriate training material and disclaimers to users on how  to adequately use the AI system?                                                         29 This depends on the organisation, if developers are involved directly with user interactions through workshops  etc they could be addressed by this questi on, if they are not directly involved the organisation needs to make  sure users understand the AI system and highlight any misunderstandings to the developing team.  
16 REQUIREMENT #5 Diversity, No n-discrimination  and Fairness   In order to achieve Trustworthy AI, we must enable inclusion and diversity throughout the  entire AI system’s life cycle. AI systems (both for training and operation) may suffer from the  inclusion of inadvertent historic bias, incompleteness, and bad governance models. The  continuation of such biases could lead to unintended (in)direct prejudice and discrimination  against certain groups or people, potentially exacerbating prejudice and marginalisation.  Harm can also result from the intentional exploitation of (consumer) biases or by engaging in  unfair competition, such as the homogenisation of prices by means of collusion or a nontransparent market. Identifiable and discriminatory bias should be removed in the collection  phase w here possible. AI systems should be user -centric and designed in a way that allows  all people to use AI products or services, regardless of their age, gender, abilities or  characteristics. Accessibility to this technology for persons with disabilities, whi ch are  present in all societal groups, is of particular importance.   Glossary:  AI Bias; AI System; AI Designer; AI Developer; Accessibility; Assistive  Technology; End- User; Fairness; Subject; Universal Design; Use Case.   Avoidance of Unfair Bias   • Did you establish a strategy or a set of procedures to avoid creating or reinforcing  unfair bias in the AI system, both regarding the use of input data as well as for the  algorithm design?   • Did you consider diversity and representativeness of end -users and/or subjects in the  data?   o Did you test for specific target groups or problematic use cases?   o Did you research and use publicly available technical tools, that are state -ofthe-art, to improve your understanding of the data, model and performance?  o Did you assess and put in place processes to test and monitor for potential  biases during the entire lifecycle of the AI system (e.g. biases due to possible  limitations stemming from the composition of the used data sets (lack of  diversity, non- representativeness)?  o Where rel evant, did you consider diversity and representativeness of   end-users and or subjects in the data?   • Did you put in place educational and awareness initiatives to help AI designers and  AI developers be more aware of the possible bias they can inject in desi gning and  developing the AI system?   • Did you ensure a mechanism that allows for the flagging of issues related to bias,  discrimination or poor performance of the AI system?   o Did you establish clear steps and ways of communicating on how and to  whom such issues can be raised?   o Did you identify the subjects that could potentially be (in)directly affected by  the AI system, in addition to the (end -)users and/or subjects?  
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   17 • Is your definition of fairness commonly used and implemented in any phase of the  process of setting up the AI system?   o Did you consider other definitions of fairness before choosing this one?   o Did you consult with the impacted communities about the correct definition of  fairness, i.e. representatives of elderly persons or persons with disabilities?  o Did you ensure a quantitative analysis or metrics to measure and test the  applied definition of fairness?  o Did you establish mechanisms to ensure fairness in your AI system?     Accessibility and Universal Design  Particularly in business -to-consumer domains, AI  systems should be user -centric and  designed in a way that allows all people to use AI products or services, regardless of their  age, gender, abilities or characteristics. Accessibility to this technology for persons with  disabilities, which are present in all societal groups, is of particular importance. AI systems  should not have a one- size-fits-all approach and should consider Universal Design  principles30 addressing the widest possible range of users, following relevant accessibility  standards.31 This will enable equitable access and active participation of all people in  existing and emerging computer -mediated human activities and with regard to assistive  technologies.   • Did you ensure that the AI system corresponds to the variety of preferences and  abilities in society?  • Did you assess whether the AI system's user interface is usable by those with special  needs or disabilities or those at risk of exclusion?  o Did you ensure that information about, and the AI system's user interface of,   the AI system is access ible and usable also to users of assistive technologies   (such as screen readers)?  o Did you involve or consult with end- users or subjects in need for assistive  technology during the planning and development phase of the AI system?   • Did you ensure that Univer sal Design principles are taken into account during every  step of the planning and development process, if applicable?   • Did you take the impact of the AI system on the potential end- users and/or subjects  into account?   o Did you assess whether the team involved in building the AI system engaged  with the possible target end- users and/or subjects?  o Did you assess whether there could be groups who might be  disproportionately affected by the outcomes of the AI system?   o Did you assess the risk of the possible unfairness of the system onto the   end-user's or subject's communities?                                                    30 https://www.cen.eu/news/brief -news/Pages/NEWS -2019-014.aspx.   31 https://www.iso.org/standa rd/58625.html; https://www.iso.org/standard/33987.html;  https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso:9241: -171:ed- 1:v1:en ; http://mandate376.standards.eu/standard.  
18 Stakeholder Participation  In order to develop Trustworthy AI, it is advisable to consult stakeholders who may directly  or indirectly be affected by the AI system throughout its life cycle. It is beneficial to solicit  regular feedback even after deployment and set up longer term mechanisms for stakeholder  participation, for example by ensuring workers information, consultation and participation  throughout the whole process of implementing AI sys tems at organisations.   • Did you consider a mechanism to include the participation of the widest range of  possible stakeholders in the AI system’s design and development?     
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   19 REQUIREMENT #6 Societal and Environmental   Well- being   In line with the principles of fairness and prevention of harm, the broader society, other  sentient beings and the environment should be considered as stakeholders throughout the  AI system's life cycle. Ubiquitous exposure to social AI systems in all areas of our lives (be it  in educ ation, work, care or entertainment) may alter our conception of social agency, or  negatively impact our social relationships and attachment. While AI systems can be used to  enhance social skills, they can equally contribute to their deterioration. This could equally  affect peoples' physical and mental well -being. The effects of AI systems must therefore be  carefully monitored and considered. Sustainability and ecological responsibility of AI  systems should be encouraged, and research should be fostered into AI solutions  addressing areas of global concern, for instance the Sustainable Development Goals.32  Overall, AI should be used to benefit all human beings, including future generations. AI  systems should serve to maintain and foster democratic processes and  respect the plurality  of values and life choices of individuals. AI systems must not undermine democratic  processes, human deliberation or democratic voting systems or pose a systemic threat to  society at large.   Environmental Well -being  This subsection helps to self -assess the (potential) positive and negative impacts of the AI  system on the environment. AI systems, even if they promise to help tackle some of the  most pressing societal concerns, e.g. climate change, must work in the most  environmentally fr iendly way possible. The AI system’s development, deployment and use  process, as well as its entire supply chain, should be assessed in this regard (e.g. via   a critical examination of the resource usage and energy consumption during training, opting  for less net negative choices). Measures to secure the environmental friendliness of an AI  system’s entire supply chain should be encouraged.   • Are there potential negative impacts of the AI system on the environment?   o Which potential impact(s) do you identify?  • Where possible, did you establish mechanisms to evaluate the environmental impact  of the AI system’s development, deployment and/or use (for example, the amount of  energy used and carbon emissions)?   o Did you define measures to reduce the environmental impac t of the AI system  throughout its lifecycle?                                                      32 https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300.  
20 Impact on Work and Skills   AI systems may fundamentally alter the work sphere. They should support humans in the  working environment, and aim for the creation of meaningful work. This subsection helps  self-asse ss the impact of the AI system and its use in a working environment on workers, the  relationship between workers and employers, and on skills.   • Does the AI system impact human work and work arrangements?   • Did you pave the way for the introduction of the AI  system in your organisation by  informing and consulting with impacted workers and their representatives (trade  unions, (European) work councils)  in advance?  • Did you adopt measures to ensure that the impacts of the AI system on human work  are well understood?   o Did you ensure that workers understand how the AI system operates, which  capabilities it has and which it does not have?  • Could the AI system create the risk of de -skilling of the workforce?   o Did you take measures to counteract de -skilling risks?   • Does the system promote or require new (digital) skills?   o Did you provide training opportunities and materials for re - and up- skilling?   Impact on Society at large or Democracy   This subsection helps t o self -assess the impact of an AI system from a societal perspective,  taking into account its effect on institutions, democracy and society at large. The use of AI  systems should be given careful consideration, particularly in situations relating to the  democratic processes, including not only political decision- making but also electoral contexts  (e.g. when AI systems amplify fake news, segregate the electorate, facilitate totalitarian  behaviour, etc.).   • Could the AI system have a negative impact on society  at large or democracy?    o Did you assess the societal impact of the AI system’s use beyond the   (end- )user and subject, such as potentially indirectly affected stakeholders or  society at large?   o Did you take action to minimize potential societal harm of the AI system?   o Did you take measures that ensure that the AI system does not negatively  impact democracy?    
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   21 REQUIREMENT #7 Accountability   The principle of accountability necessitates that mechanisms be put in place to ensure  responsibility for the development , deployment and/or use of AI systems. This topic is  closely related to risk management, identifying and mitigating risks in a transparent way that  can be explained to and audited by third parties. When unjust or adverse impacts occur,  accessible mechanism s for accountability should be in place that ensure an adequate  possibility of redress.   Glossary:  Accountability; AI Ethics Review Board; Redress by Design.   Auditability   This subsection helps to self -assess the existing or necessary level that would be req uired  for an evaluation of the AI system by internal and external auditors. The possibility to  conduct evaluations as well as to access records on said evaluations can contribute to  Trustworthy AI. In applications affecting fundamental rights, including sa fety-critical  applications, AI systems should be able to be independently audited. This does not  necessarily imply that information about business models and intellectual property related to  the AI system must always be openly available.   • Did you establish mechanisms that facilitate the AI system’s auditability   (e.g. traceability of the development process, the sourcing of training data and the  logging of the AI system’s processes, outcomes, positive and negative impact)?   • Did you ensure that the AI system can be audited by independent third parties?   Risk Management  Both the ability to report on actions or decisions that contribute to the AI system's outcome,  and to respond to the consequences of such an outcome, must be ensured. Identifyi ng,  assessing, documenting and minimising the potential negative impacts of AI systems is  especially crucial for those (in)directly affected. Due protection must be available for   whistle -blowers, NGOs, trade unions or other entities when reporting legitim ate concerns  about an AI system.   When implementing the above requirements, tensions may arise between them, which may  lead to inevitable trade- offs. Such trade- offs should be addressed in a rational and  methodological manner within the state of the art. T his entails that relevant interests and  values implicated by the AI system should be identified and that, if conflict arises, trade -offs  should be explicitly acknowledged and evaluated in terms of their risk to safety and ethical  principles, including fund amental rights. Any decision about which trade- off to make should  be well reasoned and properly documented. When adverse impact occurs, accessible  mechanisms should be foreseen that ensure adequate redress.     
22 • Did you foresee any kind of external guidance or third -party auditing processes to  oversee ethical concerns and accountability measures?   o Does the involvement of these third parties go beyond the development  phase?  • Did you organise risk training and, if so, does this also inform about the potential  legal framework applicable to the AI system?   • Did you consider establishing an AI ethics review board or a similar mechanism to  discuss the overall accountability and ethics practices, including potential unclear  grey areas?   • Did you establish a process to di scuss and continuously monitor and assess the AI  system's adherence to this Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)?   o Does this process include identification and documentation of conflicts  between the 6 aforementioned requirements or between different ethical  principles and explanation of the 'trade -off' decisions made?   o Did you provide appropriate training to those involved in such a process and  does this also cover the legal framework applicable to the AI system?   • Did you establish a process for third  parties (e.g. suppliers, end -users, subjects,  distributors/vendors or workers) to report potential vulnerabilities, risks or biases in  the AI system?   o Does this process foster revision of the risk management process?   • For applications that can adversely affect individuals, have redress by design  mechanisms been put in place?    
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   23 Glossary   This glossary is informed by the glossary that accompanied the Ethics Guidelines for  Trustworthy AI.33  Accessibility:  Extent to which products, systems, services, environments and facilities can  be used by people from a population with the widest range of user needs, characteristics  and capabilities to achieve identified goals in identified contexts of use (which includes direct  use or use supported by assistive tec hnologies).   Accountability: This term refers to the idea that one is responsible for their action – and as  a corollary their consequences –  and must be able to explain their aims, motivations, and  reasons. Accountability has several dimensions. Accountabil ity is sometimes required by  law. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires organisations  that process personal data to ensure security measures are in place to prevent data  breaches and report if these fail. But accountability mi ght also express an ethical standard,  and fall short of legal consequences. Some tech firms that do not invest in facial recognition  technology in spite of the absence of a ban or technological moratorium might do so out of  ethical accountability considerations.   Accuracy: The goal of an AI model is to learn patterns that generalize well for unseen data.  It is important to check if a trained AI model is performing well on unseen examples that  have not been used for training the model. To do this, the model is used to predict the  answer on the test dataset and then the predicted target is compared to the actual answer.  The concept of accuracy is used to evaluate the predictive capability of the AI model.  Informally, accuracy is the fraction of predictions the model got right. A number of metrics  are used in machine learning (ML) to measure the predictive accuracy of a model. The  choice of the accuracy metric to be used depends on the ML task.   AI bias: AI (or algorithmic) bias describes systematic and repeatabl e errors in a computer  system that create unfair outcomes, such as favou ring one arbitrary group of users over  others. Bias can emerge due to many factors, including but not limited to the design of the  algorithm or the unintended or unanticipated use or decisions relating to the way data is  coded, collected, selected or used to train the algorithm. Bias can enter into algorithmic  systems as a result of pre- existing cultural, social, or institutional expectations; because of  technical limitations of their design; or by being used in unanticipated contexts or by  audiences who are not considered in the software's initial design. AI bias is found across  platforms, including but not limited to search engine results and social media platforms, and  can have impact s ranging from inadvertent privacy violations to reinforcing social biases of  race, gender, sexuality, and ethnicity.   AI designer:  AI designers bridge the gap between AI capabilities and user needs. For  example, they can create prototypes showing some novel AI capabilities and how they might  be used if the product is deployed, prior to the possible development of the AI product. AI  designers also work with development teams to better understand user needs and how to  build technology that addresses those needs. Additionally, they can support AI developers                                                   33 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/ethics -guidelines -trustworthy -ai. 
24 by designing platforms to support data collection and annotation, ensuring that data  collection respects some properties (such as safety and fairness).   AI developer: An AI developer is someone who performs s ome of the tasks included in the  AI development. AI development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, training,  programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining AI  applications, frameworks, or other AI c omponents. It includes writing and maintaining the AI  source code, as well as all that is involved between the conception of the software through  to the final manifestation and use of the software.   AI Ethics Review Board:  An AI Ethics Review Board or AI E thics Committee should be  composed of  a diverse group of stakeholders and expertises, including gender, background,  age and other factors. The purpose for which the AI Ethics Board is created should be clear  to the organi sation establishing it and the members who are invited to join it. The members  should have an independent role that is not influenced by any economic or other  considerations. Bias and conflicts of interest should be avoided. The overall size can vary  depending on the scope of the task. Both  the authority the AI Ethics Review Board has and  the access to information should be proportionate to their ability to fulfill the task to their best  possible ability.34  AI reliability: An AI system is said to be reliable if it behaves as expected, even fo r novel  inputs on which it has not been trained or tested earlier.   AI system:  Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and possibly also hardware)  systems designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical or digital  dimension by perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the  collec ted structured or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the  information, derived from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the  given goal. AI systems can either use symbolic rules or learn a numeric model, and  they can  also adapt their behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous  actions. As a scientific discipline, AI includes several approaches and techniques, such as  machine learning (of which deep learning and reinforcement learning are specific examples),  machine reasoning (which includes planning, scheduling, knowledge representation and  reasoning, search, and optimization), and robotics (which includes control, perception,  sensors and actuators, as well as the integration of al l other techniques into cyber -physical  systems).   A separate document prepared by the AI HLEG and elaborating on the definition of AI used  for the purpose of this document is titled "A definition of AI: Main capabilities and scientific  disciplines".35   AI system environment: This denotes everything in the world which surrounds the AI  system, but which is not a part of the system itself. More technically, an environment can be  described as a situation in which the system operates. AI systems get information f rom their  environment via sensors that collect data and modify the environment via suitable actuators.                                                   34 More information can be found here: https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF -107/Accenture-AI -And Data -Ethics -Committee -Report -11.pdf#zoom=50.   35 https://ec.europa.eu/dig ital-single -market/en/news/definition- artificial -intelligence-main -capabilities -andscientific -disciplines.  
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   25 Depending on whether the environment is in the physical or virtual world, actuators can be  hardware, such as robotic arms, or software, such as programs that make changes in some  digital structure.   Assistive Technology: Software or hardware that is added to or incorporated within an ICT  system to increase accessibility. Often it is specifically designed to assist people with  disabilities in carrying out daily activities. Assistive technology includes wheelchairs, reading  machines, devices for grasping, etc. In the area of Web Accessibility, common softwarebased assistive technologies include screen readers, screen magnifiers, speech  synthesizers, and voice input software that operate in conjunction with graphical desktop  browsers (among other user agents). Hardware assistive technologies include alternative  keyboards and pointing devices.   Audit: An audit is an independent examination of some required proper ties of an entity, be it  a company, a product, or a piece of software. Audits provide third -party assurance to various  stakeholders that the subject matter is free from material misstatement. The term is most  frequently applied to audits of the financial i nformation relating to a legal person, but can be  applied to anything else.   Auditability:  Auditability refers to the ability of an AI system to undergo the assessment of  the system’s algorithms, data and design processes. This does not necessarily imply that  information about business models and Intellectual Property related to the AI system must  always be openly available. Ensuring traceability and logging mechanisms from the early  design phase of the AI system can help enable the system's auditability.   Autonomous AI systems: An autonomous AI system is an AI system that performs  behaviors or tasks with a high degree of autonomy, that is, without external influence.   Confidence score: Much of AI involves estimating some quantity, such as the probability  that the output is a correct answer to the given input. Confidence scores, or confidence  intervals, are a way of quantifying the uncertainty of such an estimate. A low confidence  score associated with the output of an AI system means that the system is not too sure that  the specific output is correct.   Data governance:  Data governance is a term used on both a macro and a micro level. On  the macro level, data governance refers to the governing of cross -border data flows by  countries, and hence is more precisely  called international data governance. On the micro  level, data governance is a data management concept concerning the capability that  enables an organization to ensure that high data quality exists throughout the complete  lifecycle of the data, and data c ontrols are implemented that support business objectives.  The key focus areas of data governance include data availability, usability, consistency,  integrity, and sharing. It also regards establishing processes to ensure effective data  management throughout the enterprise such as accountability for the adverse effects of poor  data quality and ensuring that the data which an enterprise has can be used by the entire  organization.  
26 Data poisoning: Data poisoning occurs when an adversarial actor attacks an AI s ystem,  and is able to inject bad data into the AI model’s training set, thus making the AI system  learn something that it should not learn. Examples show that in some cases these data  poisoning attacks on neural nets can be very effective, causing a signif icant drop in accuracy  even with very little data poisoning. Other kinds of poisoning attacks do not aim to change  the behavior of the AI system, but rather they insert a backdoor, which is a data that the  model’s designer is not aware of, but that the att acker can leverage to get the AI system to  do what they want.   Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA): Evaluation of the effects that the processing  of personal data might have on individuals to whom the data relates. A DPIA is necessary in  all cases in which the technology creates a high risk of violation of the rights and freedoms  of individuals. The law requires a DPIA in case of automated processing, including profiling  (i), processing of personal data revealing sensitive information like racial of et hnic origin,  political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs (ii), processing of personal data relating to  criminal convictions and offences (iii) and systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area  on a large scale (iv).   Data Protection Officer  (DPO): This denotes an expert on data protection law. The function  of a DPO is to internally monitor a public or private organisation’s compliance with GDPR.  Public or private organisations must appoint DPOs in the following circumstances: (i) data  proces sing activities are carried out by a public authority or body, except for courts acting in  their judicial capacity; (ii) the processing of personal data requires regular and systematic  monitoring of individuals on a large scale; (iii) the processing of per sonal data reveals  sensitive information like racial of ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical  beliefs, or refers to criminal convictions and offences. A DPO must be independent of the  appointing organisation.   Encryption, Pseudonymi sation, Aggregation, and Anonymisation: Pseudonymisation  refers to the idea that it is not possible to attribute personal data to a specific data subject  without additional information. By contrast to pseudonymisation, anonymisation consists in  preventing any identification of individuals from personal data. The link between an  individual and personal data is definitively erased. Encryption is the procedure whereby clear  text information is disguised by using especially a hash key. Encrypted results are  unintelligible data for persons who do not have the encryption key. Aggregation is a process  whereby data is gathered and expressed in a summary form, especially for statistical  analysis.   End-user: An end -user is the person that ultimately uses or is intended  to ultimately use the  AI system. This could either be a consumer or a professional within a public or private  organisation. The end- user stands in contrast to users who support or maintain the product,  such as system administrators, database administrator s, information technology experts,  software professionals and computer technicians.   Explainability: Feature of an AI system that is intelligible to non- experts. An AI system is  intelligible if its functionality and operations can be explained non technically to a person not  skilled in the art.  
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   27 Fairness: Fairness refers to a variety of ideas known as equity, impartiality, egalitarianism,  non-discrimination and justice. Fairness embodies an ideal of equal treatment between  individuals or between groups of individuals. This is what is generally referred to as  ‘substantive’ fairness. But fairness also encompasses a procedural perspective, that is the  ability to seek and obtain relief when individual rights and freedoms are violated.   Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is the property that enables a system to continue operating  properly in the event of the failure of (or one or more faults within) some of its components. If  its operating quality decreases at all, the decrease is proportional to the severity of the  failure, as compared to a naively designed system, in which even a small failure can cause  total breakdown. Fault tolerance is particularly sought after in high -availability or safety critical systems. Redundancy or duplication is the provision of additional functional  capabilities that would be unnecessary in a fault -free environment. This can consist of  backup components that automatically ‘kick in’ if one component fails.   Human oversight, human- in-the-loop, human- on-the-loop, human- in-command:  Hum an oversight helps ensure that an AI system does not undermine human autonomy or  causes   other adverse effects. Oversight may be achieved through governance mechanisms such as  a human -in-the-loop (HITL), human- on-the-loop (HOTL), or human -in-command (HIC)  approach. Human -in-the-loop refers to the capability for human intervention in every  decision cycle of the system, which in many cases is neither possible nor desirable. Human on-the-loop refers to the capability for human intervention during the design cy cle of the  system and monitoring the system’s operation. Human- in-command refers to the capability  to oversee the overall activity of the AI system (including its broader economic, societal,  legal and ethical impact) and the ability to decide when and how to use the system in any  particular situation. This can include the decision not to use an AI system in a particular  situation, to establish levels of human discretion during the use of the system, or to ensure  the ability to override a decision made by a system. Moreover, it must be ensured that public  enforcers have the ability to exercise oversight in line with their mandate. Oversight  mechanisms can be required in varying degrees to support other safety and control  measures, depending on the AI system’s  application area and potential risk. All other things  being equal, the less oversight a human can exercise over an AI system, the more extensive  testing and stricter governance is required.   Interpretability: Interpretability refers to the concept of compr ehensibility, explainability, or  understandability. When an element of an AI system is interpretable, this means that it is  possible at least for an external observer to understand it and find its meaning.   Lifecycle:  The lifecycle of an AI system includes several interdependent phases ranging  from its design and development (including sub -phases such as requirement analysis, data  collection, training, testing, integration), installation, deployment, operation, maintenance,  and disposal. Given the complexity  of AI (and in general information) systems, several  models and methodologies have been defined to manage this complexity, especially during  the design and development phases, such as waterfall, spiral, agile software development,  rapid prototyping, and incremental.  
28 Model Evasion:  Evasion is one of the most common attacks on machine learning models  (ML) performed during production. It refers to designing an input, which seems normal for a  human but is wrongly classified by ML models. A typical example is to change some pixels  in a picture before uploading, so that the image recognition system fails to classify the result.   Model Inversion:  Model inversion refers to a kind of attack to AI models, in which the  access to a model is abused to infer information about the training data. So, model inversion  turns the usual path from training data into a machine- learned model from a one- way one to  a two -way one, permitting the training data to be estimated from the model with varying  degrees of accuracy. Such attacks raise serious concerns given that training data usually  contain privacy -sensitive information.   Online continual learning:  The ability to continually learn over time by accommodating new  knowledge while retaining previously learned experiences is referred to as continual or  lifelong learning. Learning continually is crucial for agents and robots operating in changing  environments and required to acquire, fine- tune, adapt, and transfer increasingly complex  representations of knowledge. Such a continuous lear ning task has represented a   long-standing challenge for machine learning and neural networks and,36 consequently, for  the development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The main issue of computational  models regarding lifelong learning is that they are prone to catastrophic forgetting or  catastrophic interference, i.e., training a model with new information interferes with  previously learned knowledge.   Pen test:  A penetration test, colloquially known as a pen test, pentest or ethical hacking, is  an authorized simulated cyberattack on a computer system, performed to evaluate the  security of the system. The test is performed to identify both weaknesses (also referred to as  vulnerabilities), including the potential for unauthori sed parties to gain acces s to the system's  features and data, as well as strengths, enabling a full risk assessment to be completed.   Red team: Red teaming is the practice whereby a red team or independent group  challenges an organisation to improve its effectiveness by assuming an adversarial role or  point of view. It is often used to help identify and address potential security vulnerabilities.   Redress by design:  Redress by design relates to the idea of establishing, from the design  phase, mechanisms to ensure redundancy, alternative systems, alternative procedures, etc.  in order to be able to effectively detect, audit, rectify the wrong decisions taken by a perfectly  functioning system and, if possible, improve the system.   Reproducibility:  Reproducibility refers to the closeness between the results of two actions,  such as two scientific experiments, that are given the same input and use the methodology,  as described in a corresponding scientific evidence (such as a scientific publication). A  related concept is replication, which i s the ability to independently achieve non- identical  conclusions that are at least similar, when differences in sampling, research procedures and  data analysis methods may exist. Reproducibility and replicability together are among the  main tools of the sc ientific method.                                                    36 https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/neural -networks.  
Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI)   29 Robustness AI:  Robustness of an AI system encompasses both its technical robustness  (appropriate in a given context, such as the application domain or life cycle phase) and as  well as its robustness from a social perspective (ensuring that the AI system duly takes into  account the context and environment in which the system operates). This is crucial to ensure  that, even with good intentions, no unintentional harm can occur. Robustness is the third of  the three components necessary for achieving Trustworthy AI.   Self-learning AI system: Self -learning (or self -supervised learning) AI systems recognize  patterns in the training data in an autonomous way, without the need for supervision.   Standards:  Standards are norms designed by industry and/o r Governments that set product  or services’ specifications. They are a key part of our society as they ensure quality and  safety in both products and services in international trade. Businesses can be seen to  benefit from standards as they can help cut cos ts by improved systems and procedures put  in place. Standards are internationally agreed by experts and they usually represent what  the experts think is the best way of doing something. It could be about making a product,  managing a process, delivering a s ervice or supplying materials – standards cover a huge  range of activities. Standards are released by international organizations, such as ISO  (International Organi sation for Standardi sation), IEEE (The Institute of Electrical and  Electronics Engineers) St andard Association, and NIST (National Institute of Standards and  Technology).   Subject: A subject is a person or a group of persons affected by the AI system (such as the  recipient of benefits where the decision to grant or reject benefits is underpinned by an AI system, or the general public for facial recognition).   Traceability: Ability to track the journey of a data input through all stages of sampling,  labelling, processing and decision making.   Trustworthy AI: Trustworthy AI has three components: (1) it  should be lawful, ensuring  compliance with all applicable laws and regulations (2) it should be ethical, demonstrating  respect for, and ensure adherence to, ethical principles and values and (3) it should be  robust, both from a technical and social perspective, since, even with good intentions, AI  systems can cause unintentional harm.37 Trustworthy AI concerns not only the  trustworthiness of the AI system itself but also comprises the trustworthiness of all  processes and actors that are part of the AI system’s life cycle.   Universal Design: Terms such as “Design for All”, “Universal Design”, “accessible design”,  “barrier‐ free design”, “inclusive design” and “transgenerational design” are often used  interchangeably with the same meaning. These concepts have been developed by different  stakeholders working to deliver high levels of accessibility. A parallel development of hu mancentred design emerged within ergonomics focusing on usability. These related concepts  are expressed in the human rights perspective of the Design for All approach. The Design  for All approach focuses on user involvement and experiences during the desi gn and  development process to achieve accessibility and usability. It should be applied from the                                                   37 This is informed by the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI, accessible here: https://ec.europa.eu/digital single -market/en/news/ethics -guidelines -trustworthy -ai. 
30 earliest possible time, and throughout all stages in the life of products and services which  are intended for mainstream use. A Design for All approach also focuses on user  requirements and interoperability between products and services across the end- to-end  chain of use to reach inclusive and non- stigmatizing solutions.   Use case: A use case is a specific situation in which a product or service could potentially   be used. For example, self -driving cars or care robots are use cases for AI.   User: A user is a person that uses, supports or maintains the product, such as system  administrators, database administrators, information technology experts, software  professionals and computer technicians.   Workflow of the model:  The workflow of an AI model shows the phases needed to build  the model and their interdependencies. Typical phases are: Data collection and preparation,  Model development, Model training, Model accuracy  evaluation, Hyperparameters’ tuning,  Model usage, Model maintenance, Model versioning. These stages are usually iterative: one  may need to reevaluate and go back to a previous step at any point in the process.
