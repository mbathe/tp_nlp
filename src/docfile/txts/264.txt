Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         9 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   This study reviews the main applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems in fisheries and identifies  current  challenges for fisheries that have the potenti al to be dealt with through AI.   Legal analysis of relevant EU fisheries legislation that enables the use of AI systems  The AI -related legal analysis in fisheries found that: 1) there is no explicit reference t o AI systems in the  most relevant EU fisheries legislation, but there are references to digitali sation that could include AI  systems; 2) the most relevant fisheries legislation is  drafted in a way that enable the use of AI systems;  3) the broad -ranging nat ure of the Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) proposal makes its application to the  fisheries sector straightforward ; 5) there are some concerns that the General Data Protection  Regulation would require adaptation  to the new realities brought by AI technolo gies;  and,  6) several  third countries are considering AI methods for further automation of Electronic Monitoring systems.   Analysis of the current and potential use of AI tec hniques in the fisheries sector   The review of AI techniques in fisheries revealed that: 1) Machine Learning (ML)  approaches have been  used to automate biological  sample processing; 2) ML  has been applied after image analysis and on  acoustic data to count and measure organisms; 3) researc h on catch classification by species and sizes   using AI has increased; 4) ML  is being applied to automatically classify or determine fishers’ behaviour ;  5) knowledge -based and expert systems have been applied to early warning systems and marine  spatial planning ; 6) traditional rule -based expert systems have been mainly applied in data -limited  situations; 7) statistical approaches, Bayesian estimation, search and optimization methods are not  traditionally considered AI, but can be integrated into AI systems ; 8) some of the uses identified are  applied to stock assessments and species distribution models; and, 9 ) fishing vessels could improve   energy  efficiency and reduce their CO 2 footprint by using AI systems.   Specific fisheries topics discussion  on the use of AI systems   Firstly, seafood in all of the supply chain  is analysed : 1) AI shows promising uses for traceability and  seafood product integrity ; 2) limited  data generation and collection is the main barrier; 3) the  processing industry is starting to use AI systems in  automation  processes ; 4) AI proofs -of-concept have  been developed in the field of  logistics; and,  5) ML has been used to infer consumer behaviour and  economic growth  forecasting .  The second topic  analysed  is the use of AI for more selective fis hing techniques: 1) there is a mismatch  between fisheries selectivity improvement management goals and industry’s tools to comply with  regulations; 2) species selectivity  can be further improved with AI ; and, 3) AI systems aimed at  autom ated species forecasting and detection, identification and sizing of catches could allow  improving fishing decisions and enable quota tracking.   The third discussion topic a ssesses  the use of AI as a driving force for young people to seek  jobs in  fisheries : 1) AI, similarly to digitali sation, is likely to create new skilled jobs while decreasing the need  for low skilled ones in the fisheries sector; 2) the marine transport sector has developed AI systems  focused on ship failure prediction and anomaly detecti on that could be applied in fishing vessels; and,  3) a more digitalis ed and AI -based fisheries sector might attract new young talent, but will be  competing against other industries currently offering  higher incentives.  Good practices in fisheries that coul d be useful for future good practices within the fisheries sector   when developing or using AI  are also analysed . Best practices guidelines for different fishery facets are 
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       10 commonly used by management organi sations to increase their  sustainability and AI technology  should follow this example .  Finally, t here are general AI groups and networks at the European level , but they lack marine domain  knowledge to develop fit- for-purpose AI systems for fisheries. There is at least one European working  group focus ing on AI for fisheries and several fisheries groups where AI has been discussed, but there  is a shortage of sufficient resources.   Conclusions and recommendations  for AI systems use in fisheries   The last chapter summarizes  opportunities and obstacles to the application  of AI  in the fisheries sector  based on the findings of previous chapters .  Main o pportunities  identified  are: 1) increas ed transparency of fishing activity and reduc ed impact on  the environment , thereby  improv ing the public image of the sector; 2)  early warning, forecasting and  spatial planning systems can help in the planning  activities considering trade- offs between them ; 3)  accelerated  and increased  data acquisition and coverage for stock assessments, sustainability  indicators evaluation and other management data needs ; 4) increased  economic sustainability of the  fishing industry, by  reducing operational costs ; and, 5 ) the moderni sation of  fisheries and  its  subsequent attractiveness to the younger popul ation .  Main o bstacles identified  are: 1) industry trust and reluctance; 2) initial costs and lack of expertise; and,  3) legal  and bureaucratic  uncertainty .  Although some AI approaches are considered black boxes (e.g. Artificial Neural Network s), there are  other suitable AI methods to understand the basis, processes and model forecasts and their uncertainty  (e.g. Bayesian Network s).  Finally, the study end s with the following p olicy recommendations  for the best use of AI in fisheries  and its supply chain :  1. Ame nd Regulations that are or will be subject to revision in this field to  include a reference to  AI systems and AIA definition in paragraphs where digital transformation and new  technologies are mentioned.   2. Amend the AIA proposal to include the fisheries sector. Its Recital 3 currently reads “[…] in  healthcare, farming, education […]” , it could be amended to  “[…] in healthcare, farming and  fishery, education […]” .  3. Promote formation of interdisciplinary fisheries experts with AI related skills and   multidisciplinary teams (e.g., AI, biological, ec onomic, and legal disciplines).   4. Find ways to incentiv ise job opportunities and promotion of multidisciplinary and  interdisciplinary experts not only in academia but also in the private fishery sector.   5. Attra ct young workers and empower women  with AI skills  in fisheries  sector jobs through  dissemination of information programs and by providing adequate incentives.   6. Promote  private data collection and sharing, including appropriate data aggregation and  anonymization safety protocol s to facilitate industry trust.   7. Support the development of good AI practices and standards for statistical validation and  ground truth verification  to increase consumer and industry trust in AI performance,  also  supported by strong science fit- for-purpose applications aligned with sustainability goals.  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         11 8. Regulate  the role of  AI technological  providers, ensuring some degree of experience in fisheries  to prevent  untrustworthy and  not-fit-for-purpose AI systems ( e.g., establishment of  audited  registr ation programs ).  9. Create regulations limiting the access of certain kinds of AI systems to the fisheries sector to  help avoid their application in illegal or un ethical activities (e.g., through regional fisheries  management organisations (RFMOs) or registers for vessel compliance with sustainability  practices from trustworthy organi sations) .  10. Support the development of  good AI practice guidelines in fisheries through collaboration with  stakeholders and organi sations (e.g., RFMOs, certification agencies,  NGOs) using mechanisms  and principles proven to be successful in other types of fisheries best practices guidelines.   11. Promote AI awareness, both benefits and constraints, among managers and industry to improve adoption processes at the whole  supply  chain.   12. Promote collaboration between u niversities, firms , AI developers  and other stakeholders  in  fisheries  though specific funding, specialized centres, and multidisci plinary networks.   13. Promote technological development  integrated with AI systems to develop  more selective  fishing gears and fishing strategies by funding  AI research and vessels digitalisation.     
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       12 1. INTRODUCTION     KEY FINDINGS   • The Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA)  proposal harmonizes the rules on the development  and  use of products and services making use of AI technologies in the EU single market, in the  private  and public sectors.   • The AIA proposal recognizes the potential of Artificial Intelligence ( AI) to help meet  some of  the sustainability challenges of the EU , which are aligned with UN Sustainable Development  Goals (SDGs) .  • The AIA proposal sets out a risk -based approach to regulating AI implications , to create an  ecosystem of trust in the use of AI by EU citizens, where fundamental rights and ethical  principles are respected.   • Fishing is an important economic activity in the EU and worldwide, intrinsically dependent  on the productivity of the marine en vironment, which is variable, and still insufficiently  understood . Therefore, achieving sustainable fisheries is a very challenging task.   • There is a growing need in fisheries science and management for larger amounts of data and highly trained experts, in which digitalisation and AI should play a central role.   • Recent  scientific review publications support the use of AI to address UN SDGs in fisheries .  Considering technological advances in AI and the challenges that it brings, in April 2021 , the European  Commission adopted a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying  down harmonised rules on AI  (Artificial Intelligence Act)1 and amending certain Union legislative acts  (COM ( 2021) 206 final; the  AIA proposal ). The proposal sets out a risk -based approach to regulate  AI  implications , both in the public and private sectors, to create an ecosystem of trust in the use of AI by  EU citizens, where fundamental rights and ethical principles are respected. Equally, the EU intends to  lead in setting the highest standards worldwide , so other countries  could follow this example .  The European Parliament has shown great interest on the development and use of AI in the EU. As a  reflection of this, the European Parliament set up in June 2020 a Special Committee on Artificial  Intelligence in a Digital Age (AIDA Committee) to analyse the impact of AI on the EU economy.  Furthermore, the European Parliament has adopted several  resolutions on AI , including  related to  ethical asp ects (2020/2012(INL))2, civil liability (2020/2014(INL ))3, intellectual property rights  (2020/2015(INI))4, and education (2020/2017/INI)5. The European Parliament has also called on the  Commission to continue addressing the challenges faced by the public a nd private sectors with  digital                                                                1 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligen ce (Artificial  Intelligence Act) and amending certain Union legislative acts, COM ( 2021) 206 final, 21.4.2021.   2 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with recommendations to the Commission on a framework of ethical aspects of   artificial intelligence, robotics and related technologies (2020/2012(INL)), P9_ TA ( 2020)0275.   3 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 with recommendations to the Commission on a civil liability regime for arti ficial  intelligence (2020/2014(INL)), P9_ TA (2020)0276, OJ C 404, 6.10.2021, p. 107.   4 European Parliament resolution of 20 October  2020 on intellectual property rights for the development of artificial intelligence  technologies (2020/2015(INI)), P9_TA  (2020)0277, OJ C 404, 6.10.2021, p. 129.   5 European Parliament resolution of 19 May 2021 on artificial intelligence in education, culture and the audiovisual sector (2020/2017(INI)),  P9_TA (2021)0238.  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         13 transformations, so that AI can enable and support these sectors. The publications of studies and  briefing notes on AI  also show the importance that the European Parliament places on  this matter.   The Commission points out that the proposition  on the AIA proposal is consistent with the EU Charter  of Fundamental Rights and the existing Union legislation on data protection, consumer protection,  non- discrimination, and gender equality. It is also compl ementary to the GDPR ( Regulation (EU)  2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural persons regarding   the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data)6 and other ongoing legislative  measures that address problems posed by the development and use of AI, including liability issues  related to new technologies. The proposal is also closely linked to the Data Governance Act  (COM (2020) 767)7, the Open Data Directive (Directive (EU) 2019/1024)8 and other i nitiatives under the  EU strategy for data (COM (2020) 66 final)9, concerning the mechanisms and services for the re- use,  sharing and pooling of data that are essential for the development of data -driven AI models of high  quality. Currently, the main objectiv e of the AIA proposal is to ensure that the use of AI is safe and  respect s existing law s on fundamental rights and Union values and contributes to wards  achiev ing  Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs) (Vinuesa et al., 2020; Palomares et al., 2021) . AI may have a  positive impact on 134 targets (79%) among all SDGs (Vinuesa  et al., 2020) . The advantages provided  by AI may also have a positive impact on several  SDGs within the Economy group on 42 targets (70%)  from these SDGs (Vinuesa et al., 2020).  In the Com munication  ‘Fostering a European approach to  Artificial Intelligence’  (COM  (2021) 205 final)10, the Commission highlighted potential safety issues such  as risks emerging from human -robot collaboration, autonomous machines, or privacy issues with  image recog nition. However, this communication also highlights important potential benefits , such as  new employment opportunities outweighing potential job losses, and an increase of c itizen  engagement initiatives.   Fishing is an important economic activity in the EU and worldwide, intrinsically dependent on the  productivity of the marine environment, which is variable, sensitive, and still insufficiently understood. Therefore, achieving sustainable fisheries is  a very  challenging  task . It demands , on the one  hand, some  stability in fishing opportunities to ensure a viable fishery sector. On the other hand, sustainable fisheries require some flexibility to adapt to critical ecological alterations  if functioning of the  ecosystem producing these resources is to be maintain ed despite  high uncertainty and limited  knowledge about the mechanisms  that regulate it. Moreover, many fish stocks are natural resources  whose distribution is not restricted to national boundaries  (Baudron  et al., 2021) . The setting of   measures  able to counteract threats and adapt to changes  (e.g., stock declines, global warming ), while  guaranteeing a sustainable activity from an economic, social , and environmental perspective, arises as  one of the principal  challenges faced by fisheries policy mak ers. These policies  require matching fishing  opportunities  with fishing capacity, incorporating the ecosystem s approach, implementing  regionalization, improving fisheries sustainability  through  governance, and incorporating fisheries  activities in  the b roader maritime dimension, where fishing is one element among multiple  activities .                                                                6 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with  regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46 (General Data  Protection Regulation), OJ L 119, 4,5, 2016, p. 1.   7 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on European data governance (Data Governance Act), COM (2020) 767 final, 25.11.2020.   8 Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on open data and the re -use of public sector  information (Open Data Directive), OJ L  172, 26.6.2019, p.  56.  9 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions ‘A European strategy for data’, COM  (2020) 66 final, 19.2.2020.  10 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the  Committee of the Regions ‘Fostering a European approach to Artificial Intelligence’, COM (2021) 205 final, 21.4.2021.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       14 The data produced by new technologies should contribute to a more sustainable exploitation, but  there are still challenges regarding the use of this huge amount of diverse data to provide solutions to  final users (Tanhua et al., 2019). The term big data wa s coined to capture the meaning of this emerging  trend (Hu et al. , 2014). In addition to its sheer volume, big data exhibits other unique characteristics  when  compared with traditional data. For instance, big data is commonly unstructured and requires  real-time analysis. This development calls for new system architectures for data acquisition,  transmission, storage, and large -scale data processing mechanisms (Boyes et al. , 2014). AI  is becom ing  a key factor in increasing the value of such data and has great  potential for  application in  fisheries  management and addressing industry challenges. AI systems, particularly the ones using Machine  Learning (ML) approaches, have already proved their  potential in many applications for fisheries ,  including : fisheries fo recasting (Fernandes et al. , 2010), automatic classification of samples (Irigoien et  al., 2009), marine spatial planning for resolving conflicts of fisheries and new activities (Coccoli et al.,  2018) , emission  reduction  (Chan et al., 2021), fishing activit ies tracking (Taconet et al., 2019), fishing  effort estimation ( Behivoke et al., 2021), indicators (Uusitalo et al., 2016 ; Lehikoinen et al., 2019 ), species  analysis for abundance indexes (Uranga et al., 2017), fishing gear selectivity (Joshy et al ., 2018) ,  traceability (Jothiswaran et al ., 2020), species identification in EM (Lekunberri et al., 2022), and other  topics as reviewed in this study. However, the se are still preliminary and limited applications that do  not yet fully exploit the vast potential for fisheries when combining ML and big data methodologies.   There is a growing need in f isheries science and management for larger  amounts of data and highly  trained experts, in which digitali sation and AI should play a central role . These data m ust be collected,  stored, managed, and transmitted to different users. Therefore, the digitali sation in this sector is very  important for achieving these purposes, and  AI systems could play a critical  role in the acquisition  and  use of the data. Digitali sation refers to enabling or improving processes by using digital technologies  and data. However, a digital transformation process does not always necessarily imply the use of AI,  despite its increasing presence in digitalized processes  (Figure 1). This can create misunderstanding  about some digitali sation approaches that can be useful for AI systems, but that strictly speaking are  not AI approaches. Some examples are web scrapping and blockchain technologies. Web scrapping is  the automation of data extractio n from websites , whereas blockchain are blocks of data linked by  cryptography. None of these examples are AI technologies but nonetheless can be used in  combination with them.  Ground truth/validation data and quality data for AI  and fisheries science  model ling is a challenge requiring findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR)  principles (Van Vranken et al ., 2020).  Four main challenges that can explain the lack of fisheries industry  digitali sation are: upfront costs and insufficient access to capital, legal and bureaucratic barriers, failure  to implement data collection standards, and lack of trust and buy -in from fisher ies (Bradley et al., 2019 ). 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         15 Figure 1: Conceptual diagram showing the role of A I in relation with other digitalis ation  activities     Source: AZTI.     The European digital strategy aims to facilitate this , and the AIA proposal can be an opportunity to  support this strategy . Legal and bureaucratic barriers need to be reduced to  gain trust from the fisheries  sector . Furthermore, a more digitali sed industry with  higher use of AI methods can lead to more  environmental and economically sustainable industries, aligned with the European Green Deal (EGD)11  strategy . To illustrate how AI  methods and digital technologies are used or could potentially be  developed in fisheries for a more digitalized and AI use industry, some examples are provided below:   • Catching sector: f ishing vessels could improve energy efficiency that will significantly help  to  reduce fossil fuel consumption (fuel represents up to 50% of a fishing vessel ’s operational costs ;  Basurko et al., 2013) , and reduce CO2 emissions . Improved forecasting of fishing grounds by  species could help fishers more effectively  manag e the use of their quotas and fishing effort .  Furthermore, AI could contribute to a better collection, storage , and transmission of  oceanographic and  fisheries data from vessels to administrations and scientific institutes,  provid ing more accurate and timely data.                                                                 11 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the European C ouncil, the European Economic and Social  Committee and the Committee of the Regions ‘The European Green Deal’, COM(2019) 640 final, 11.12.2019.   
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       16 • Marketing of fishery products: the placing of fishery products in the internal market is one of  the most important components of Common Organi sation of the Markets (COM) which is one  of the pillars of the CFP. Ensuring traceabilit y of fishery products, avoid ing mislabelling  and  fraud, ensuring public health and safety, fair prices for consumers and sellers, and guarantying   fish sold is legally caught are areas where AI  is utilized and could be further promoted .  • Administrations: public administrations could greatly benefit from the use of AI to digitalize  their services, drastically  reducing the amount of paper work  and simplifying everyday  procedures. Administrators are critical actors since they need to collect, process , and transmit  data to the European Commission . As previously stated , national policies can benefit from a  more intensive use of AI, for the management of fleets and quotas, improv ing safety and  security at sea, and the control of fishing activities that are very dependent on sophisticated  technologies. Social and employment policies, education and vocational training could be further enhanced and promoted with the use of AI as well. The role of AI  as a potential tool for  fisheries management is recognised by the European Parliament , which in May 2021 issued the  resolution (2019/2177(INI)) 12 on securing the objectives of the L anding Obligation (LO) under  Article 15 of the CFP. Amongst a set of manage ment tools, the European Parliament  recommended voluntary and incentive- based utilisation of AI for  improving selectivity, control,  and species identification.   • Marine spatial planning : AI is used for resolving conflicts of fisheries  with  current  and new  maritime  activities  (e.g. renewal energy and aquaculture; e.g. FutureMARES project13), and for  the MSFD14 indicators.   • Scientific Community: t he scientific community is one of the most important users and  developers of AI technologies  in fisheries . The core o f the scientific work is based on the data  gathering processing and interpretation. AI is used for different purposes, for example  fisheries  forecasting, automatic classification of samples, analys ing species for abundance indexes,  estimating  fishing gear selectivity to minimize the catch of unwanted species and to reduce  the impact of fishing on marine ecosystem s.                                                                   12 European Parliament resolution of 18 May 2021 on securing the objectives of the landing obligation under Artic le 15 of the Common  Fisheries Policy (2019/2177(INI)), P9_TA(2021)0227, OJ C 15, 12.1.2022, p. 9.   13 www.futuremares.eu   14 Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 establishing a framework for community act ion in  the field of marine environmental policy (Marine Strategy Framework Directive), OJ L 164, 25.6.2008, p. 19.

LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE MOST RELEVANT EU AND THIRD  COUNTRIES FISHERIES LEGISLATION THAT ENABLE  THE USE OF  AI SYSTEMS     KEY FINDINGS   • To date, there is no explicit reference to AI systems in the mo st relevant EU fisheries   legislation , but there are references to digitali sation that could include AI systems’  use.  • Many provisions of the most relevant fisheries legislation are drafted  in a way that  enable the  use of AI systems.   • The broad -ranging nature of the AIA proposal makes its application to the fisheries sector  straightforward .  • The fisheries legislation  does not have  any provisions that would hinder the implementation  or undermin e the coherence of the AIA proposal.   • The use of AI systems by operators in the fisheries sector is justified to improve the quality of  their fishing activities and sustainability of fishing resources.   • There are some concerns that the General Dat a Protection Regulation would require a  revision to adapt to the new realities brought by AI  technologies.    • Several third  countries  (Australia, New Zealand , US) have started to implement electronic  monitoring ( EM) system s extensively and are considering AI methods for further automation.   • In these third  countries , like in the EU, legislation has no explicit reference to AI systems.     The EU has ambitious goals for the use and protection of its natural resources, recently consolidated  under the EGD. This strategy aims to transform the EU into a fair and prosperous society with a modern,  resource- efficient, and competitive economy, where AI can play an important role in achieving these  objectives. The objectives of the EGD, including the EU commitment, is to reduce emissions by 50 -55%  by 2030 and become net carbon -neutral by 2050. The EGD recognises that the EU should promote and  invest i n digital transformation for enabling decarbonisation  changes. The EGD is aligned with other  initiatives such as the SDG s, circular economy and Green Growth, the long -term strategy to support  sustainable growth in the marine and maritime sectors (Blue Growth) . Furthermore, the EGD aims to  help the EU in its transition to a sustainable blue economy that promotes the use of sma rt digital  solutions and autonomous systems in various sectors, including the fisheries sector  (COM(202 1) 240  final)15. Since the 1 970s, and in particular since 1983 with the adoption of the Council Regulation (EEC)  No 170/83 of 25 January 1983 establishing  a community system for the conservation and management  of fishery resources16, the EU has been developing legislation regulating the activities of the fisheries  sector. The 'fishery sector' is understoo d as ‘the sector of the economy comprising all activities relating  to the production, processing and marketing of fishery or aquaculture products’17. The most relevant  EU fisheries legislation includes the provisions on: technical and conservation measures for marine                                                                15 Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the   Committee of the Re gions on a new approach for a sustainable blue economy in the EU: Transforming the EU’s Blue Economy for a  Sustainable Future, COM(2021) 240 final, Brussels, 17.5.2021.   16 OJ L 24, 27.1.1983, p. 1.   17  Article 5(d) of Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the common  organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1184/2006 and (EC) No  1224/2009 and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 104/2000  (OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 1).  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       18 biological resources; the management and control of EU fleets exploiting such resources; the  processing and marketing of fishery and aquac ulture products; the EU system to prevent, deter and  eliminate IUU fishing; the international fisheries agreements concluded by the EU. In addition, the provisions concerning the European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund (EMFAF Regulation) 18  are of particular importance. Some of these provisions are currently under legislative review (e.g.  Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 on fisheries control system19 – Fisheries Control Regulation) or  will soon be under legislative review (e.g., Regulation (EU) N o 1380/2013 of the European Parliament  and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the CFP20 – Common Fisheries Policy  (CFP) Framework  Regulation; Directive 2008/56/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008  establishing a framework for community action in the field of marine environmental policy21 – MSFD ).  The current EU fisheries legislation does not make any explicit mention of AI. Only the most recent  legislative declarations and especially the EMFAF Regulation refer, albeit indirectly , to AI. Thus, these  legal acts contain  references to the digital transition in the fisheries sector and in the EU blue economy .  AI can be one of the elements that contribute s to this transition (recital 51 and Article 8 (5)(a) of the  EMFAF Regulation). This normative  context is easily understandable considering  that the  generalization of AI is recent, whereas legislative developments on fisheries began several decades ago   (Churchill and Owen,  2010; Oanta , 2016; Penas , 2016). However, this absence of express references  to  AI in these normative texts has not prevented operators in several  fisheries sectors from using AI  systems in their activities as shown in this study.  In the authors’ view, the questions  that arise are   whether this fisheries legislation should expressly mention AI, and whether the AIA proposal should  mention the primary sector of  the economy , which includes fisheries, agriculture, forestry , and  other,   given their lower digitalis ation and AI use in compa rison to secondary and tertiary sectors  (Södergård   et al., 2021) . At present, the AIA proposal only mentions Directive 2014/90/EU of the European  Parliament and of the Council on marine equipment22 (Directive 2014/90/EU) focused on security, but  which  affects fishing vessels too. Indeed, Article 78 of the AIA proposal contains an amendment to  Article 8 of the Directive 2014/90/EU in the sense of adding a paragraph 4 to it, where AI systems are referred to  according to which ‘’ For Artificial Intelligence systems which are safety components in the  meaning of Regulation (EU) YYY/XX [on Artificial Intelligence] of the European Parliament and of the Council, when carrying out its activities pursuant to paragraph 1 and when adopting technical  specifications an d testing standards in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3, the Commission shall take  into account the requirements set out in Title III, Chapter 2 of that Regulation ‘’ 23.  This chapter is structured in four sections. The first section (2.1)  identif ies the most relevant fisheries  legislation , highlighting provisions that make possible AI system s use with a summary  table at the end.   The second section (2.2) present s the provisions that need  to be considered  when using AI systems  applicable to fishing activities, in particular the principles and values that inspire the process of                                                                18 Regulation (EU) 2021/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 July 2021 establishing the European Maritime, Fi sheries  and Aquaculture Fund and amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1004, OJ L 247, 13.07.2021, p. 1.   19 Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 of 20 November 2009 establishing a Community control system for ensuring compliance with  the  rules of the common fisheries policy, amending Regulations (EC) No 847/96, (EC) No 2371/2002, (EC) No 811/2004, (EC) No 768/2 005, (EC)  No 2115/2005, (EC) No 2166/2005, (EC) No 388/2006, (EC) No 509/2007, (EC) No 676/2007, (EC) No 1098/2007, (EC) No 1300/2008, (EC) No  1342/2008 and repealing Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1627/94 and (EC) No 1966/2006, OJ L 343, 22.12.2009 , p. 1.   20 OJ L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 22.   21 OJ L 164, 25.06.2008, p. 19.   22  Directive 2014/90/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 2014 on marine equipment and repealing Council Directive  96/98/EC, O J L 257, 28.8.2014, p. 146.   23 According to Article 78 of the AIA proposal, the Article 8(4) of Directive 2014/90/EU would set out as follows: ‘For Artifici al Intelligence  systems which are safety components in the meaning of Regulation (EU) YYY/XX [on Artificial Intelligence] of the Eu ropean Parliament  and of the Council, when carrying out its activities pursuant to paragraph 1 and when adopting technical specifications and testing standards in accordance with paragraphs 2 and 3, the Commission shall take into account the requirements s et out in Title III, Chapter 2  of that Regulation’.  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         19 European integration. The third section (2.3) include s a reference to the scarce jurisprudence of the  Court of Justice of the Europ ean Union (CJEU) that has so far, directly , or indirectly, considered AI related issues with projection on the fisheries sector. In the final section (2.4) , the practice of third  countries (e.g ., Australia, New Zealand, and the US) regarding the use of AI  systems in fisheries is  examined.   2.1. Analysis of the most relevant EU fisheries legislation that enables   the use of AI systems  As the relevant fisheries legislation in force is very extensive, this section  focuses only on the EU  secondary law that we consider to be the most significant and where we have identified  provisions that  already enable the use of AI elements by fishing operators. References to the legislative revisions in  which several of them are involved at present will be mentioned as well.   2.1.1.  The Common Fisheries Policy Framework Regulation   The CFP aims to ensure that fisheries and aquaculture activities are environmentally sustainable in the  long term and are managed with the objectives of generating economic, social and employment  benefits and contributing to the availability of foodstuffs (Article 2(1) of CFP Framework Regulation) .  CFP finds in the AI system an appropriate instrument for these purposes. Most AI systems in current  use are data- driven  despite  expert knowledge also being require d during the  phases of  design, data  selection and interpretation. The CFP Framework Regulation refers to data collection and processing  in several paragraphs  since  it considers that ‘fisheries management based on the best available  scientific advice requir es harmonised, reliable , and accurate data sets’  (recital 46).  Additionally, it  indicates that ‘Member States should collect data on fleets and their fishing activities, in particular  biological data on catches, including discards and survey information on  fish stocks and on the  potential environmental impact of fishing activities on the marine ecosystem. Member States should  manage and make the collected data available to end -users and to other interested parties’ (recital 46).  Furthermore, this Regulation stresses that ‘policy -oriented fisheries science should be reinforced by  means of nationally  adopted fisheries scientific data collection, research and innovation programmes’  (recital 49). It also  underlines the importance of exchanging relevant informati on to ensure sustainable  exploitation of fisheries resources and management thereof consistent with the objectives of CFP (recital 51). Additionally, the CFP Framework Regulation includes the wish of promoting ‘the use of  modern and effective technologies […] in the framework of the Union control, inspection, and  enforcement’, stating that ‘Member States and the Commission should have the possibility of  conducting pilot projects on new control technologies and data manag ement systems’ (recital 60).  It concl udes by integrating private operators in data collection (recital 64). The reference in Recital 60  to new control technologies could be applicable to the use of AI system and the rest of recitals are  applicable to the data needed to develop AI systems .  Within the articles of the CFP Framework Regulation, it is worth noting that Article 2 , which  sets out the  objectives of the CFP, includes, in paragraph 4, that of contributing to the collection of scientific data.  Article  3(k), when dealing with the principles of good governance, mentions ‘transparency of data  handling in accordance with existing legal requirements, with due respect for private life, the protection of personal data and confidentiality rules; availability of data to the appropriate scientific  bodies, other bodies with scientific or management interest, and other defined end -users’. This  principle of good governance also applies when the instrument used for this purpose is an AI system.   There are other provisions i n the CFP Framework Regulation that facilitate the use of AI.  Thus, Part III of  same , which contains the measures for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of marine 
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       20 biological resources, refers to  conservation measures that may include measures to  adapt  fishing  capacity of fishing vessels to available fishing opportunities  (Article 7(1 )I); to promote  fishing methods  that contribute to more selective fishing, avoidance  and reduction, as far as possible, of unwanted  catches, and with low impact on th e marine ecosystem and fishery resources (Article 7(1)(d)); or, also  to integrate  into pilot projects on other types of fishing management techniques and fishing gear that  increase selectivity or minimise the negative impact of fishing activities on the ma rine environment  (Article 7(1)(h)). In this sense, AI systems can be developed  as aids for technical measures aimed at the  conservation of marine biological resources . In these provisions, reference is made to additional  devices to improve selectivity or to minimise the negative impact on the ecosystem  (e.g., vulnerable   species  bycatch reduction  (Article 7(2)(b)). Thus , Article 14 focused on avoidance and minimisation of  unwanted catches, and to facilitate the introduction of the LO, indicates that ‘Member States may  conduct pilot projects, based on the best available scientific advice and considering  the opinions of the  relevant Advisory Councils, with the aim of fully exploring all practicable methods for the avoidance,  minimisation and elimination of unw anted catches in a fishery’. In the authors’ view,  these practicable  methods include those based on AI.   Part IV of the CFP Framework Regulation deals with the management of fishing capacity (Articles 21 24), in the implementation of which the use of well- designed AI systems can be an important  contributor  to the fair and efficient establishment of systems required for transferable fishing  concessions, adjustment and management of fishing capacity, entry and exit scheme for the EU  Member States’ fishing fleets or fishing fleet registers.  Part V of the CFP Framework Regulation deals  with the scientific basis for fisheries management, including data requirements for fisheries  management purposes and the principles underlying the data collection, management , and use of  such data (Article 25). This provision also applies when using the AI tool s to automate data collection   (e.g., classification of images of biological samples) . Part VI of the CFP Framework Regulation deals with  the external fisheries policy (Articles 28 -33). These provisions set out, among other aspects, the  sustainable fisheries partnership agreements (SFPAs) that enable the fishing activity of a significant  part of the EU Member States’ fleets (Oanta, 2017). This fishing fleet  could  employ  AI instruments and  its use would be included within the legal, environmental, economic and social governance framework  defined in these agreements, with rules similar to those applicable to EU fishing vessels operating in  the EU waters (Article 31). Part IX o f the CFP Framework Regulation deals with the control and  enforcement (Articles 36 -39). Thus, Article 36(d) establishes the use of efficient control technologies to  ensure the availability and quality of fisheries data. These technologies may include AI. M oreover,  Article 38 refers to pilot projects on new control technologies and data management systems, stating  that the ‘Commission and the Member States may carry out pilot projects on new control technologies  and systems for data management’. Potentially new systems that rely on AI could  be an essential tool.   The CFP Framework Regulation will be revised  soon . The European institutions, the Member States and,  finally, the operators primarily concerned, are already making the first moves in this direction. The  forthcoming debate seems an adequate  time  to examine the relevance of introducing explicit  references to AI tools in the areas concerned.   2.1.2.  The Fisheries Control Regulation   The success of CFP largely  depends on the implementation of an effective control and compliance  assurance system  and here AI systems can facilitate  such  implementation. FCR  dates back to 2009 and  builds over  CFP Framework Regulation and various initiatives adopted by the European institutions.  There is no express mention of AI in the FCR , but it is possible to identify control, inspection and  enforcement measures in which AI has the potential  to ensure compliance with CFP rules.  The FCR  is  concerned with the use of modern technologies to make the implementation of control, inspection,  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         21 and enforcement measures more effective. This is evident when it underlines that ‘modern  technol ogies, such as the vessel monitoring system , the vessel detection system and the automatic  identification system , should be exploited since they allow effective monitoring, systematic and  automated cross- checks in a rapid manner’. These technologies would ‘allow Member States to  combine the use of the various control instruments to ensure the most efficient method of control’  (recital 8). In the authors’ view, such a broad statement implicitly  covers AI new technologies.   The possibility of transmitting data  from the Vessel Monitoring System (VMS), the Automatic  Identification System (AIS), and the vessel detection system (recital 14,15), are also advantageous for  the utilization of AI systems. It is the Council that will ‘decide on the future use of tracking  devices and  traceability tools such as genetic analysis and other fisheries control technologies if these technologies  lead to an improved compliance with rules of the CFP in a cost -effective way (recital 16). In the authors’  view, this suggests that the Council will decide on the use of AI for these purposes and particularly for several aims of the recitals. The authors of this study consider that AI may be appropriate or could help to verify and control information on quantities of fish and fishery produ cts declared by those involved  in their landing and marketing (recital 18), and to improve controls on transhipments of fish on the high seas (recital 20). In addition, AI can be included in a coherent traceability system that applies to  the whole supply c hain of production and marketing of fish and fishery products (recital 28). Finally, AI  falls within the concern highlighted by the FCR when it states that ‘data collected and exchanged in  the framework of this Regulation should be treated in accordance wi th applicable rules on  confidentiality’ (recital 48). However, in the authors’ opinion, the confidentiality argument is overexploited by the sector to avoid sharing data. Additionally, this Regulation also notes that the EU  rules ‘on the protection of indi viduals regarding the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data’ should apply (recital 48) .  Throughout the articles of the FCR , we also find provisions that can be related to  AI systems. For  instance , in Title II, General Principles, it is stated that ‘Member States shall adopt appropriate measures,  allocate necessary financial, human , and technical resources , and set up all administrative and technical  structures necessary for ensuring control, inspection and enforcement o f activities carried out within  the scope of the CFP . They shall make available to their competent authorities and officials all adequate  means to enable them to carry out their tasks’ (Article 5(3)). In the authors’ view, it would be  understandable that t hese structures, techniques and means include AI systems. Moreover, the use of  AI would facilitate the management of fishing licences (Article 6), fishing authorisations (Article 7),  the marking of fishing gear (Article 8), the VMS (Article 9), the AIS  (Article 10), the vessel detection  system (Article 11), or the transmission of data for surveillance operations (Article 12). This would mean  a considerable reduction of the administrative burden. Special mention should be made to Article 13,  which refers to new technologies. Thus, under Article 13(2), ‘The Council may decide based on  Article  37 of the Treaty on the introduction of other new fisheries control technologies when these  technologies lead to improved compliance with the rules of the CFP in a cost -effective way’. This  provision, which was  adopted in 2009, leaves the door open to the use of new technologies as they  emerge, including AI.   Title IV of the FCR deals with the control of fisheries. In the authors’ view, the provisions of this Title  open up the possibility of applying AI tools in order to facilitate the control of the use of fishing  opportunities (Chapter I), as regards: the transmission of fishing logbook data (Article 15), the prior  notification (Article 17), the prior notification of landi ng in another Member State (Article 18), the  authorisation to access to port (Article 19), the transhipment operations (Article 20), the completion and submission of the transhipment declaration (Article 21), the completion and submission of the landing declaration (Article 23), the control of fishing effort (Articles 26 -32), and the recording and 
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       22 exchange of data by Member States (Articles 33 -37). This technology could also be applied to the  control of fleet management (Chapter II), or to the control of technical measures (Chapter IV), referring,  for example, to fishing gear (Articles 47 -49), particularly regarding catch composition (Article 49).   In Title V, the FCR  contains the provisions concerning the control of the marketing of fish and fishery  products. We consider that AI tools can facilitate the control of traceability of fishery and aquaculture  products at all stages of the production, processing,  and distrib ution chains, from catching or  harvesting to the retail stage (Article 58(1)). Moreover, Article 66 and Article 67 of the Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 lay s down detailed rules for the  implementation of the FCR 24 settin g out that traceability is to be ensured by adequate labelling for all  fisheries and aquaculture products placed on the EU market.  About  the minimum labelling and  information requirements for all fisheries and aquaculture products above, only the external identification number and name of the fishing vessel or the name of the aquaculture production unit could be seen as deserving special protection. The external identification number and name of the fishing vessel and the aquaculture production unit may all ow the identification of private persons and  companies when looking for information in fleet registers. This would fall under the definition of ‘personal data’ provided by Article 3 of Regulation 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council 25, wh ereby ‘personal data means any information relating to an identified or identifiable  natural person’. However, this is not the case in the EU register where the information of ownership is not publicly available.   Title XII of the FCR  focuses on data and in formation. Thus, Article 109(1) states that ‘Member States shall  set up a computerised database for the purpose of validation of data recorded in accordance with’ this normative act. Moreover, Article 109(2)(a) provides that ‘Member States shall perform cr oss- checks ,  analyses and verifications of’ data, using automated computerised algorithms and mechanisms, in particular concerning: VMS  data; fishing activities data, in particular fishing logbook s, the landing and  transhipment declarations and prior notifications; data from take- over declarations, transport  documents and sales notes; data from fishing licences and fishing authorisations; data from inspection reports; data on engine power. Additiona lly, Article 109(2)(b) states that cross- checks, analyses and  verifications shall be carried out, where appropriate, on the following data: vessel detection system data; data on sightings; data related to international fisheries agreements; data on entries  into and exits  from fishing zones, maritime areas where specific rules on access to waters and resources apply,  regulatory areas of RFMOs and similar organisations and waters of third countries; and the AIS  data.   The FCR  is concerned with the confidential ity of personal and commercial data. In this regard, Article  112 and Article 113 of this normative act clearly state that the FCR  in no way affects the level of  protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data under Union law and domestic  law of the Member States , and in particular does not alter the obligations of Member States relating to  their registration and processing of personal data under GDPR, or the obligations of the Union and  bodies relating to their processing of persona l data under Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 when fulfilling  their responsibilities. When Member States collect data and the Commission receives it, they have to  ensure that these data are treated in accordance with applicable rules on professional and commercia l  secrecy of data. This implies that the data thus exchanged shall not be transmitted to persons other  than those for which the data is intended. The data shall not be used for any purpose other than that  provided in the FCR. When data is transmitted to th ird countries and RFMOs there should be a legal                                                                24 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 404/2011 of 8 April 2011 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Coun cil  Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009 establishing a community control system for ensuring compliance with the rules of the Common Fisheries  Policy, OJ L 112, 30.4.2011, p. 1.   25 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural perso ns with  regard to the processing of  personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data,  and repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC (OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p. 39).  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         23 basis for authorizing it, meaning that there must be an international agreement between the EU and  the third country and RFMOs concerned whereby the European Commission  is obliged to send that  data. In any ev ent, the level of protection on the personal data is decided by Member States in their  national legislation .  Lastly, Article 115 and Article 116 of FCR  establish the obligation for Member States to make an official  website with publicly accessible informat ion collected in the framework of the FCR , and a restricted or  secured part. These provisions are also in line with the protection of personal data and confidentiality  rules, and the use of these data by algorithms will have to be aligned  with the rules go verning data  use,  mainly the Data Governance Act and the Open Data Directive.   In the authors’ view, the FCR  would allow the possibility for AI tools to be applied  for work on these  data. We consider that  AI tools would probably facilitate access to these data (Article 110) and the  exchange of such data, and their functioning would still be subject to the confidentiality of data and  the protection of personal data provisions  (Articles 112 -116).  Currently, the FCR is under revision  and  in April 2018, the Eur opean Commission  published the Proposal for a Regulation of the European  Parliament and of the Council amending Council Regulation (EC) No 1224/2009, and amending Council  Regulations (EC) No 768/2005, (EC) No 1967/2006, (EC) No 1005/2008, and Regulation (E U) No  2016/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council as  regards  to fisheries control26 (Commission  proposal for the revision of the FCR ). This soft law text revision represents an ideal time to question the  convenience of including a reference to AI elements in the new FCR . This incorporation would make it  possible , as indicated in the proposed Regulation, ‘to effectively address current and future needs in  terms of fisheries data and fleet control, to march the constant evolution of fishing practices and  techniques, and to take advantage of modern and more cost -effective control technologies and data  exchange systems’27. During  the debate on the revision of the FCR , and in relation  to the lack of control  of the LO and the need to fully document fishing and by -catches of sensitive species, the desirability of  progressing from traditional control methods to new digital systems has been highlighted. This would  be in line with the Commission's proposal  ‘On a new approach to the EU’s sustainable blue economy:  Transforming the EU blue economy for a sustainable future’28 when it considers that ‘digitisation and  advanced tools for fisheries (such as remote EM systems, catch reporting using mobile application s,  ecosystem modelling and AI tools) can optimise fishing operations and at the same time enable data  collection and analysis, improve control and monitoring, reduce administrative burden and ultimately  support the sustainable management of marine biologic al resources without requiring physical  presence’29. In addition, we consider that AI elements could be introduced into the legislative debates  of the Commission proposal for the revision of the FCR . Indeed, AI elements could be mentioned in  relation to: the fisheries control (a new recital between the current recital 15 and recital 16); the  traceability information (a new recital between the current recital 36 and recital 37); data recording in digital form and availability of technological tools (recital  44); the use of collected data (recital 55); the  data exchanges (recital 56); and processing of personal data (recital 58).   So far the European Parliament has already introduced certain amendments in its Report on the proposal for a regulation of the Euro pean Parliament and of the Council as  regards fisheries control,  which has been adopted on 10 February 2021 30. In this regard, we could mention the amendments that  emphasise the need for ‘a straightforward, simple, transparent , and effective control system that                                                                26 COM (2018) 368 final.   27 Ibídem, p. 1.   28 COM(2021) 240 final, cit.   29 Ibídem, p. 9.   30 A9-0016/2021, 10.2.2021.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       24 ensures effective, uniform , and up- to-date compliance in the Member States’ (amendment 2) that takes  ‘into account the latest scientific findings with respect to the environmental sustainability of fishing  and aquacul ture activities’ (amendment 3).   Finally,  Amendment 123 [Proposal for a Regulation. Article –1 - paragraph –1 - point 23. Regulation (EC)  No 1224/2009. Article 2 –a - paragraph 3 b (new)] provides that ‘in addition to EM  systems used to check  compliance with the LO, Member States may also support the use of systems , which make for closer  monitoring of the selectivity of fishing operations directly on gear’. In the authors’ view, these systems  could  be assisted by AI. This is reflected in the justification included in this Report. Thus, the European  Parliament affirms that ‘many innovations are being developed, such as ‘ real-time digital recognition  software or other AI-based tools,  which will allow  a closer monitoring of the selectivity of fishing  operations directly on gear. Since the purpose of the LO is to encourage greater selectivity, these tools  must be used to make fishing operations more selective in nature, rather than simply promoting ex post monitoring of fishing operations by means of CCTV’. Furthermore, the r apporteur  named by the  European Parliament in relation to this r eport  mentions explicitly that ‘following the unanimous  opinion of the experts consulted, the only way to carry out effective monitoring of the LO  is to equip a  minimum percentage of fishing vessels, identified under specific control and inspection programmes as representing a high risk of non- compliance with the LO and catching species subject to the LO, with  continuously recording Closed -Circuit Television  (CCTV)  systems and/or other alternative discard  monitoring systems incorporating data storage devices’.   The authors of this study consider that these ideas have been already put forward in the European  Parliament ’s resol ution adopted on 25 October 2016, which called on the Commission to review the  FCR. This resolution envisaged a series of proposals, including ‘the use of new monitoring and real -time  information transmission and communication technologies’ (paragraph 21).  2.1.3.  Regulation on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets   The EU’s exclusive competence for the conservation of fisheries resources is not limited to maritime  waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of its Member States, but also extends beyond that to fishing activities of fishers and fishing vessels of Member States in the waters of third countries or on  the high seas (Guggisberg, 2019; Sobrino Heredia and Oanta, 2015). It is in the development of this  competence that the EU has adopted Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of  the Council on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets 31 (Regulation on the sustainable  management of external fishing fleets).  The main objective of this normative act is that ‘any Union  vessel fishing outside Union waters should be authorised by its flag Member State and monitored  accordingly, irrespective of where it operates and the framework under which it does so […].  The  information gathered by the Member States and provided to  the Commission should allow the  Commission to intervene in the monitoring of the fishing operations of all Union fishing vessels in any given area outs ide Union waters’ (recital 14).   AI tools could contribute to a better management of the requirement in t he Regulation on the  sustainable management of external fishing fleets according to which ‘Member States should collect  all requested data about their fleets and their fishing operations, manage those data and make them  available to the Commission’ and tha t they also should ‘cooperate with each other, the Commission  and third countries where relevant to coordinate those data collection activities’ (recital 27). In the  authors’ view, the information  collected  and analysed by AI in real -time  would enable  the Commission  to intervene at any time and in any place in the control of fishing operations of all Union fishing vessels                                                                31 Regulation (EU) 2017/2403 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2017 on the sustainable management of  external fishing fleets, and repealing Council Regulation (E C) No 1006/2008, OJ L 347, 28.12.2017, p. 81.  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         25 outside EU waters. In addition, and in relation to fishing authorisations, the Regulation on the  sustainable management of external fishi ng fleets indicates that the Commission will set up an  electronic database on fishing authorisations comprising both a publicly accessible part and a secure  part. It clarifies that, as this database includes personal data, the processing of such data shoul d comply  with the provisions of EU law and applicable national law (recital 28). In relation to these operations, the Regulation on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets expressly states that ‘a  common system of data exchange and data stora ge should be used by the Member States and the  Commission to provide necessary information and updates while minimising administrative  burden‘( recital 33). Precisely , one of the raisons d’être  of the AI  systems is to reduce th is kind of   administrative burden. It is also interesting to note that the Regulation on the sustainable management of external fishing fleets empowers the Commission to develop these issues by means of a delegated  act to take account of technological progress (recital 36 and Article 44). Moreover, the provisions of this  Regulation develop these issues and, in particular, Title IV focuses on the issue of data and information  (Articles 39 -43), potentially addressing aspects where AI technology can be developed, such as  the  management, maintenance and access to the database centralised in the Commission.   2.1.4.  Regulation of the EU system to fight against IUU  fishing   IUU fishing is one of the greatest threats to the sustainable exploitation of living aquatic resources and  undermines the foundations of the CFP and international efforts to achieve better governance of the seas and oceans  and is a major threat to marine biodiversity . Therefore, addressing IUU fishing impacts  must be prioritised  in a decisive and effective manner  (Oanta, 2015; Rosello, 2017).   The EU adopted the  Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 establishing a Community system to  prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing 32 (IUU Regulation), which  entered into force in January 2010. The scope of the Regulation on IUU Regulation  is very broad as it  covers fishing activities i n the high seas and in maritime waters under the jurisdiction or sovereignty of  coastal countries, inc luding those under the jurisdiction or sovereignty of the EU Member States (recital  7). It aims at extending fisheries control measures to fishery products caught by third country fishing  vessels and imported into the EU, allowing a proper control of the s upply chain of fishery products  imported into the Union (recital 9). To this end, the measures for the information, certification, control,  inspection , and verification of fishery products imported into the Union are strengthened, supported  by the EU alert  system to report any doubts regarding the measures adopted by the flag states (recital  21), and establishing a list of IUU vessels drawn up by the Commission (recitals 26 -29).  Several provisions of the Regulation on the EU system to fight against IUU fish ing refer to the collection  and handling of data, the use of electronic means (Article 8 and Article 14) or electronic traceability  systems that ensure the same level of control by the authorities (Article 12). We consider that these are  procedures that co uld be strengthened through the use of AI tools. However, the Regulation on the EU  system to fight against IUU fishing does not explicitly provide for them. It has to be acknowledged  that  this Regulation predates the adoption of the CFP Framework Regulatio n and the FCR . It is also prior to  the conclusion of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations’  (FAO ) agreement on  Port State Measures  adopted  in the fight against IUU fishing. In this regard, this study authors believe  that the absence of an explicit mention of AI systems would not preclude their use in the measures adopted by the EU to combat IUU fishing. This would lead us to recommend that when this Regulation  is revised, these AI instruments should be specif ically considered . Furthermore,  the legislative debates                                                                32 Council Regulation (EC) No 1005/2008 of 29 September 2008 establishing a Community system to prevent, deter and eliminate ill egal,  unreported and unregulated fishing, amending Regulations (EEC) No 2847/93, (EC) No 1936/2001 and (EC) No 601/2004 and repealing  Regulations (EC) No 1093/94 and (EC) No 1447/1999, OJ L 286, 29.10.2008, p. 1.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       26 related to the AIA proposal should make a reference to the provisions of the IUU Regulation under  review , so as to include the  mention of AI systems.   2.1.5.  Regulation on the conservation of fisheries resour ces and the protection of  marine ecosystems through technical measures   Setting out the technical measures to support the implementation of the CFP is Regulation (EU)  2019/1241 of the European Parliament and of the Council on technical measures33 (Regulation on  technical measures). It aims to prevent the capture of juveniles, non- commercial species, marine  reproductive species and other marine animals by selective fishing gear means and the avoidance of  unwanted catches. It establishes technical m easures for the capture and landing of marine biological  resources, the use of fishing gear and the interaction of fishing act ivities with marine ecosystems.  The technical measures aim to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of the CFP to fish a t  levels commensurate with maximum sustainable yield  (MSY) , to reduce unwanted catches and  eliminate discards and to contribute to the achievement of good environmental status  (GES) . From  this  perspective, new technology tools such as AI systems can contri bute towards  these objectives and help   avoid, minimise , and eliminate unwanted catches (recital 22), improve the application of innovative  fishing gears (recital 30), and contribute to pilot projects on full documentation of catches and discards  (recital 3 3). The AI tools may be an  instrument to be used to achieve some of the objectives set out in  Article 3 of the Regulation on technical measures. Furthermore, Article 6 of the Regulation on technical measures contains numerous definitions of fishing gear s and various mechanisms associated with it.  Indeed, Article 6(42) of this normative act sets out that ‘gear monitoring sensors’ have to be understood  as ‘remote electronic sensors that are placed on fishing gear to monitor key performance parameters such a s the distance between trawl doors or volume of the catch’. These monitoring  tools could be  further improved  with  the integration of AI systems.   In summary, AI can be used to improve monitoring and control tools for fishing activities and targeting mechani sms, applicable both to fishing gear and conditions for its use (Article 8 and Article 9), the  protection of sensitive species and habitats (Articles 10 -12), to  protect  minimum conservation  reference sizes (Article 13), and to enhance measures that reduce discards (Article 14). AI tools could  also be included in pilot projects that develop comprehensive catch and discard documentation  systems based on measurable objectives and targets for results- based fisheries management (Article  23). They could also be t ools used in automatic size or sex grading equipment for certain fish species  (Article 33) 34.  2.1.6.  Regulation on the common organisation of the markets in seafood  products   Regulation (EU) No 1379/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the common  organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products35 (Regulation on the common  organisation of the markets in fishery and aquaculture products) provides for the legal framework for                                                                33 Regulation (EU) 2019/1241 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on the conservation of fisheries r esources and  the protection of marine ecosystems through technical measures, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1967/2006, (EC) No 1224/ 2009  and Regulations (EU) No 1380/2013, (EU) No 2016/1139, (EU) 2018/973, (EU) 2019/472 and (EU) 2019/1022 of the Euro pean Parliament  and of the Council, and repealing Council Regulations (EC) No 894/97, (EC) No 850/98, (EC) No 2549/2000, (EC) No 254/2002, (E C) No  812/2004 and (EC) No 2187/2005, OJ L 198, 25.7.2019, p. 105.   34 Article 33 of the Regulation on technical meas ures contains amendments to the Fisheries Control Regulation. Actually, the approach to  automatic size or sex grading equipment for certain fish species is set out by Article 54 c of the Fisheries Control Regulati on, as amended  by this Article 33.   35 Regula tion (EU) No 1379/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2013 on the common organisation of the  markets in fishery and aquaculture products, amending Council Regulations (EC) No 1184/2006 and (EC) No 1224/2009 and repeali ng  Counc il Regulation (EC) No 104/2000, O J L 354, 28.12.2013, p. 1.  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         27 producer organisations, marketing standards, consumer informati on and certification (eco -labelling),  competition  rules and market information.   The COM  in fishery and aquaculture products is an integral part of the CFP  and  should contribute  towards  the objectives of this policy. In this respect, AI  instruments can prov ide valuable support tools  for the achievement of these objectives for  the marketing of fishery and  aquaculture products in  the  Union market. The COM could contribute to improving the traceability of fishery products and grant  access to clear and complete information by consumers (Article 5(e) and Article 7(c)). C ontribution s by  AI could also be made for the fulfilment  of measures that may be adopted by producer organisations  in the fisheries and aquaculture sector to achieve Article 7  objectives . These include measures aimed  at adjusting production to market requirements, channelling the supply and marketing of their  members’ products, promoting them, carrying out collective planning and management of their  members' fishing activities, preventing  and minimising unwanted catches by participating in the  development and implementation of technical measures, managing the temporary storage of fishery  products, etc. (Article 8). We consider that these AI  instruments can facilitate the realisation by pro ducer  organisations of their production and marketing plans for the main species they market (Article 28), and also to improve the information reaching the consumer (Article 35 -39).  Furthermore, under Article 42 of the COM , the Commission has launched the European Market  Observatory for Fisheries and Aquaculture (EUMOFA), which is a market intelligence service consisting of a consolidated database of aggregated and harmonised data and a wide network of fisheries and  aquaculture experts. Market intelligence is the information or data that an organisation obtains from  the industry in which it operates to determine segmentation, penetration, opportunities , and existing  metrics. We consider that AI systems can be appropriate tools to enhance the performance of these  services.  2.1.7.  Data Regulation in the fisheries sector   Regulation (EU) 2017/1004 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the establishment of a  Union framework for the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries sector36 (Data  Collection Framework - DCF Regulation ) is i n line with the objectives  of the CFP. The DCF  Regulation   aims to lay down rules on the collection, management and use of biological, environmental, technical and socio -economic data relating to the fisheries  sector. The storage, processing and exchange of data  should  ensure compliance with  the personal data protection obligations laid down in EU law 37. The  DCF Regulation  is the main legal instrument establishing the rules on the collection, management, and  use of fisheries data to support scientific advice for the CFP. Under Article 1(1) and Article 3(9 ) of the  DCF Regulation,  the term ‘scientific data’ includes biological, environmental, technical , and  socioeconomic data in the fisheries sector. Where data nec essary for fisheries management are  collected under other EU legal acts (e.g., management plans, quota regulations  and  technical  conservation measures),  the Data Regulation in the fisheries sector only defines rules for the use and  transmission of those data. Meaning  that this Regulation  is a framework regulation to all other EU laws  requesting data for scientific purposes. All the rules on the processing , management and use of data  under the DCF Regulation  must comply with GDPR , Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European                                                                36 Regulation (EU) 2017/1004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2017 on the establishment of a Union framew ork for  the collection, management and use of data in the fisheries s ector and support for scientific advice regarding the common fisheries policy  and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 199/2008, O J L 157, 20.06.2017, p. 1.   37 Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the  processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 281, 23.11.1995, p. 31); Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 o f the  European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2000 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal  data by the Community institutions and bodies and on the free movement of such data (OJ L 8, 12.1.2001, p. 1).  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       28 Parliament and of the Council on the protection of personal data when processed by Union  institutions38 (Regulation on the protection of p ersonal data when processed by Union institutions) and  Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council on European statistics  (Regulation on European statistics)39.  The use of AI tools is a key opportunity to maximise the utility  of data for sustainable fisheries  management and for the assessment and monitoring of stocks and ecosystems, including data related  to the LO  (recital 29 ). Such a use could  facilitate scientific advice to fisheries management that requires  the processing of detailed data to address the needs of fisheries managers (recital 33 ), as well as  ensure  the timely availability of relevant data and respective methodologies to bodies having a scientific or  management role in the scientific analysis of data in the fis heries sector and to any interested party  (recital 34). Moreover, AI systems could be included among the appropriate procedures and electronic  technologies employed  as referred to in the Data Regulation in the fisheries sector, when it calls for  the  need f or Member States to establish such procedures and technologies to ensure the availability of  data and to cooperate with other Member States, the Commission,  and end -users of scientific data to  develop systems for data storage and exchange. These systems should provide for appropriate  safeguards, such as a higher level of aggregation or anonymization of the data in case they include  information on identified or identifiable natural persons, ‘taking into account the purpose of the  processing, the nature of the data and the potential risks related to the processing of personal data’  (recital 35).   These AI tools are well fitted to operate  with multiple data types obtained from the fisheries sector. In  this regard, Article 3 of the DCF Regulation  defines concepts such as ‘ primary data’, ‘metadata’, ‘ detailed  data’  or ‘aggregated data’.  They can be useful in operations in relation to biological data on target and  non- target stocks including bycatches , data to assess the impact of Union fishing acti vities on the  marine ecosystem in Union waters and beyond, data on the activity of Union fishing vessels in Union  waters and beyond, including levels of fishing and fishing effort and the capacity of the Union fleet  (Article 5). They can also be useful too ls in Member States' national work plans for establishing data   source s, procedures and methods for their collection and processing into data sets that can  then be  provide d to end -users of scientific data (Article 6(f)). These AI  procedures may be present in the process  of data collection (Article 12), data management (Article 13 and Article 14) and, above all, data use  (Articles 15 ).  The collection,  management of data, and mak ing it available to end -users, is an obligation for Member  States. They are respo nsible for data storage, protection of confidentiality, and completeness and  quality of the data (Article 25 of CFP Framework Regulation, and Article 2(4), Article 13 and Article 14  of DCF  Regulation). Thus, according to Article 25 of CFP Framework Regulation, such data is needed to  enable the assessment of the state of exploited marine biological resources, the level of fishing and the  impact that fishing activities have on the marine biological resources and ecosystems, and the socio economic performance of the fisheries, aquaculture,  and processing sectors within and outside Union  waters.  Fisheries data are to be made available to bodies with a research or management role  in the  scientific analysis of data in the fisheries sector, except where protection and confidentiality are  required under applicable EU law. By ‘scientific bodies’ the regulation refers mainly to  the Scientific                                                                38 Regulation (EU) 2018/1725 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with  regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies and agencies and on the free movement of such data, and  repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC, OJ L 295, 21.11.2018, p.39.   39 Regulation (EC) No 223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009 on European statistics and repealing  Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1101/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the transmission of d ata subject to statistical  confidentiality to the Statistical Office of the European Communities, Council Regulation (EC) No 322/97 on Community Statistics, and  Council Decision 89/382/EEC, Euratom establishing a Committee on the Statistical Programmes of the European Communities,  OJ L 87,  31.3.2009, p. 164.  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         29 Technical Economic Committee on Fisheries (STECF), which is the scientific body of the Commission for  fisheries matters . However  other relevant scientific bodies (e.g., the International Council for the  Exploitation of the Sea ( ICES )) and the scientific committees of RFMOs are also considered  to be  bounded by the rules of data  protec tion . As an example, ICES data policy establishes  that data is put at  the service of the scientific community and is publicly available, with some exceptions such as  commercial, catch and VMS and logbook data.   2.1.8.  European Maritime, Fisheries and Aquaculture Fund Regulation   The European Maritime, Fisheries a nd Aquaculture Fund ( EMFAF ) Regulation is an EU fund that will be  active between 2021 and 2027. It channels financial resources from the EU budget to support the CFP, the EU maritime policy and the EU’s agenda for international ocean governance. It provides financial support for the  development of innovative projects ensuring that aquatic and maritime resources are  used in a sustainable manner. Its objectives are, among others, to support innovation and investment in low -impact, selective, climate -resilient , and low -carbon fishing pr actices , and techniques (recital 20),  which, in our view, would also include AI systems.   Similarly, the EMFAF Regulation should support innovation and investments that contribute to the full implementation of the LO, as well as the development and implementation of conservation measures  that contribute to selectivity. In this respect, it considers that it would be appropriate, inter alia , to grant  investments and aid to  selective fishing gear  with a higher rate than that applied to other operations  (recital  22). In this regard , we consider that AI tools have a huge  potential to contribute to selective  fishing gear  development and improvement . In addition, the EMFAF will promote  innovation and  investments on board Union fishing vessels, including support aimed at improving the quality of  catches (recital 23), which is one of the purposes of several  AI schemes. The EMFAF Regulation  recognises that the success of the CFP depends on the availability of scientific advice for fisheries  management and therefore on the availability of fisheries data (recital 24), and again AI tools can  certainly contribute to reliable and comprehensive marine data.   Moreover, when examining national projec ts eligible for EMFAF funding, the Regulation states that,  inter alia , their contribution to the digital transition shall be taken into account (recital 51), and  reiterates this in its articles, stating that the Commission, when assessing national programm es, shall  take particular account of the optimisation of the programme's contribution to the objectives of resilience, ecological transition and digital transition, in particular through a wide range of innovative  solutions (Article 8(5)(a)). It is also st ated that the EMF AF will support interventions that contribute to  reliable data for knowledge- based decision -making (Article 14(d)). Along these lines, it also states that  the EMFAF may support research and innovation programmes in fisheries and aquaculture, and the  collection, management, use and processing of biological, environmental, technical , and socioeconomic data in the fisheries sector (Article 23(1)). In this sense, AI systems are included in the digital  transition process, which contribute to da ta analysing  and enhance knowledge -based decision -making   processes .  2.1.9.  Marine Strategy Framework Directive  The MSFD  represents a major contribution to the conservation, protection,  and restoration of marine  ecosystems. It includes reduction and minimisation of pollution, aimed at achieving good  environmental status for EU waters by 2020. According to this normative act, the EU Member States  should progressively work towards achieving good environmental status to ensure that the seas are  clean, healthy , and productive, and to reduce the impact of human activities on marine ecosystems.  Among the main objectives of the MSFD , reference should be made to guaranteeing  that pressures

It shoul d be underlined that the MFSD  dates from 2008. Therefore, references to AI technology are  logically absent, but it provides for the Commission to be empowered to adapt it to technical and  scientific progress (recital 47). The authors of this study consider that the use of AI tools can be useful  in the preparation of the Marine Strategies referred to in Chapter II of this Directive, both in their assessment phase (Article 8), in the determination of good environmental status (Article 9), and in the establish ment and implementation of monitoring programmes (Article 11). Additionally, they might  also be appropriate instruments to reinforce the monitoring programmes referred to in Annex V, or the programmes of measures indicated in Annex VI. In any case, these i ssues related to the use of AI tools  may be taken into consideration during the legislative debates on the revision of the MSFD , which  should be undertaken by 15 July 2023, as provided for in Article 23 of the Directive.  2.1.10.  Directive on marine equipment  Final ly, although it is a regulatory act within the framework of the EU Transport Policy, we refer to the  Directive on marine equipment as it also affects fishing vessels in terms of safety. This Directive seeks  to enhance safety at sea as well as ‘to prevent marine pollution through the uniform application of the relevant international instruments relating to marine equipment to be placed on board EU ships, and to ensure the free movement of such equipment within the Union. As AI systems may be components  of marine equipment whose use or installation on board ships is deemed necessary to enhance  maritime safety, it could be understood that equipment legislation would apply to them. As mentioned before, this possibility is expressly included in the AIA proposal by virtue of Article 78, which contains an amendment to Article 8 of this Directive. Although these requirements refer to high- risk systems  which, as will be seen below, do not affect fishing activities , we think it is useful to refer to this situation.   2.1.11.  Final considerations   The most relevant EU fisheries legislation analysed in this part of the  study (see summary table 1) shows  how these provisions facilitate the use of AI applied to different fisheries activities. No provisions that  would conflict with  the AIA proposal  were found . The authors  consider that concerns for the respect of  fundamental rights, the protection of European consumers, product safety and liability are already present in fisheries legislation and are reinforced with the AIA proposal  text . The authors  also  consider  that the fisheries legislation currently in the process of legislative revision  or soon to undergo some  could and should include  references  to AI systems in those recitals w here digital transformation and  new technologies are mentioned . This would significantly contribute to greater legal certainty and  transparency for consumers and economic operators in relation to the use of AI systems in the fisheries  sector. As indicated by the CJEU on numerous occasions, EU legislation ‘[…] must be certain and its  application foreseeable by individuals. The principle of legal certainty requires that every measure of  the institutions having legal effects must be clear and precise […]’ 40. Additionally, transparency, as a  general principle governing the functioning of the EU institutional system, would help to make EU  regulatory provisions more comprehensible, including those relating to AI in fisheries .                                                                  40 Judgment of the Court of First Instance (Fourth Chamber) of 22 January 1997 in the Case Opel Austria GmbH v Council of the Eu ropean  Union, T -115/94, ECLI:EU: T:1997:3, punto 124.

EU legislation ensuring the protection of citizens and business  rights in AI systems  This section examines the main EU legislation that address es ethical, legal , and economic concerns,  mainly related to th e risks to human rights and fundamental freedoms  such as  the right to privacy, data  protection and discrimination rules.  The main concerns  related to the use of AI are related to  the  application of rules designed to protect fundamental rights (including personal data, privacy  protection and non -discrimination), as well as safety and liability- related issues41. Developers and  deployers of AI in the fishery sector are already subject  to European legislation on fundamental rights,  consumer protection, product safety42 and liability43 rules.   2.2.1.  Legislation laying down fundamental rights and EU values   The primary sources in the EU legal system regarding EU values and fundamental rights are the Treaty  on the European Union (TEU), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) (both being  the ‘EU Treaties’44), and the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights45 (Charter).  It is worth mentioning that                                                                41 White Paper on Artificial Intelligence –  A European approach to excellence and trust, COM(2020) 65 final, Brussels, 19.2.2020.     42 Directive 2001/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (OJ L 11, 15. 1.2002,  p. 4); Directive 2006/42/EC  of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC  (recast) (OJ L 157, 9.6.2006, p . 24); and Directive 2014/53/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on the  harmonization of the laws of Member States relating to the making available on the market of radio equipment and repealing Directive  1999/5/EC (OJ L 153, 22.5.2014, p. 62).   43 Council Directive 85/374/EEC  of 25 July 1 985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions on the Member  States concerning liability for defective products (OJ L 210, 7.8.1985, p. 29). This Directive was amended by Directive 1999/34/EC  as to  include agriculture and fisheries products.

IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       32 Article 2 TEU  states that the Union is founde d on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom,  democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons  belonging to minorities. The TFEU compels the Union to eliminate inequalities and promote equality  (Article 8), to combat discrimination (Article 10), and it recognizes the right of everyone to the  protection of personal data concerning them (Article 16). The Charter recognizes the right to privacy (Article 7) and of the protection to personal data (Articl e 8).  Since 2009, according to Article 6 TEU, the  Charter has the same legal status as the EU Treaties, being primary EU law on which EU legislation is based. European institutions must comply with it in all their actions, and EU Member States must comply with it when they implement EU law. National courts can apply the Charter in cases where EU  law is implemented and is relevant for the final judgement.   2.2.2.  Legislation related to the protection of personal data   Everyone has the right to the protection, access  and rectification  of their  collected  personal data (Article  8 of the Charter and Article 16 TFEU). The main EU legislation dealing with the protection of personal  data are: GDPR ; Regulation on the protection of personal data when processed by the EU institutions;  Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council on the protection of natural  persons with regard to the processing of personal data by competent autho rities for the purposes of  the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offenses or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data 46 (Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive); and  Directive 2002/58 of the  European Parliament and of the Council o n privacy and electronic  communications47 (Directive on privacy and electronic communications ). These legal instruments are  key in the Communication published by the European Commission  on 21 November 2018, entitled  ‘European Commission Digital Strategy: A digitally transformed, user -focused and data -driven  Commission’48 (European Commission Digital Strategy), to creat e an ecosystem of trust by ensuring the  protection of the fundamental right to personal data protectio n and the fl ow of data among Member  States.   The GDPR protects  the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right  to the protection of personal data, and on the free movement of such data (Article 1), when these data are p rocessed wholly or partly by automated means or other means which form part of a filing system  (Article 2).  Personal data is defined as any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural  person 49. EU Member States must  ensure in their national laws that personal data are processed in  accordance with the principles of lawfulness, fairness , and transparency, processed only for specified  and explicit purposes, be limited to what is necessary and kept safe and only for as l ong as necessary  (Article 5).  Although AI is not explicitly mentioned in the GDPR, many of its provisions are relevant to  its use . However, t he GDPR provisions are often vague and open- ended, and therefore there is a need  to further refine them50.                                                                46 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 of April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard  to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or p rosecution  of criminal offenses or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing  Council Framework  Decision 2008/977/JHA,  OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 1.   47 Directive 2002 /58 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data and the  protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector,  OJ L 201, 31.7.2002, p. 37.   48 C(2018) 7118 final, Brussels, 21.11.2018.   49 Article 4 GDPR sets out: ‘An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person’.   50 EPRS, The impact of the General Data Protection Regulation on artificial intelligence.

Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         33 Regulatio ns on the protection of personal data when processed by the EU institutions establish the  rules applicable to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and  agencies. It creates the European Data Protection Supervisor (EDPS), which is an independent EU body responsible for monitoring the application of data protection rules within the EU institutions and for  investigating complaints. When citizens  data  is used by criminal law enforcement authorities for law  enforcement purpos es, the Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive ensures the right to data  protection 51. The Directive on privacy and electronic communications52 complements the General Data  Protection Regulation . This Directive harmonizes the provisions of the Member States required to  ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms. It applies to the  processing of personal data in connection with publicly available electronic communica tions services  in public communication networks in the EU (Article 1).   2.2.3.  Legislation dealing with data   The European Data Strategy acknowledges  that a ccess to data and the ability to use it are essential  conditions  for innovation and growth. This strategy  aims to create a single market for data to allow its   flow freely within the EU and across sectors for the benefit of all. The legislative instruments supporting  this strategy are the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on  European Data Governance (proposal for a Data Governance Act)53, the Directive (EU) 2019/1024 of the  European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on open data and the re- use of public sector  information  (Open Data Directive)54 and Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of  the Council on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data ( COM(2022) 68 final)55 (Data Act ).  The commission adopted the proposal for a Data Governance Act that reached a political agreement   by the Parliament and Council in December 2021 and will be soon voted in plenary in March 2022. The  objective for the proposal for a Data Governance Act is to create trustworthy data -sharing systems, so  that more data (personal and non- personal) is available and shared for the benefit of all. Data  governance refers to a set of rules and means to use data, for example through sharing mechanisms, agreements , and technical standards. It includes rules to share data in a secure manner, included  through trusted  third parties (‘data intermediaries’), and supervised by public authorities.  When public  data subject to rights of others is shared (e.g.,  data subject to data protection, intellectual property,  containing trade secrets or commercially sensitive informati on), Member States must ensure  compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation and respect for  privacy and confidentiality.  There are practices developed to protect privacy and confidentiality such as using ‘anonymization’ or  legally binding confidentiality agreements to be signed by the re- user. The proposal includes measures  to facilitate data to be used across sectors (so called ‘European data spaces’ ), such as the agricultural  sector, where fisheries are not included. The Open Data Directive lays  down rules for the re- use of  public sector information and provides common rules for a European market for government held data.  Within the framework of the European Strategy for Data, the Commission adopted the  proposal for a                                                                51 Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural pers ons with regard  to the processing of personal data by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or p rosecution  of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Council Framework  Decision 2008/977/JHA (OJ L 119, 4.5.2016, p. 89).   52 Directive 2002/58/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 July 2002 concerning the processing of personal data  and the  protection of privacy in the electronic c ommunications sector (Directive on privacy and electronic communications) (OJ L 201, 31.7.2002,  p. 37).   53  COM(2020) 767 final, Brussels, 25.11.2020.   54 OJ L 172, 26.6.2019, p. 56.   55 Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on harmonised rules on fair access to and use of data (Data Act),  COM (2022) 68 final, 23.2.2022.

This legal  instrument aims to encourage data sharing among businesses, and between business and governance.   2.2.4.  AIA proposal foundations , including  safety and liability issues   The White Paper on AI56 sets out policy options on how to promote the uptake of AI and address the  risks associated with certain uses of this technology. These options where considered in t he AIA  proposal aim  to develop an ecosystem of trust by proposing a legal framework for t rustworthy AI. The  Report from the European Commission  to the European Parliament , the Council and the European  Economic and Social Committee on the Safety and Liability Implications of Artificial Intelligence, the  Internet of Things and Robotics57 accompan ying the White Paper on AI identifies and examines the  broader implications and potential gaps in the liability and safety frameworks for AI. Consumers expect  the same level of safety and respect of their rights whether a product relies on AI  or not . However, the  technical complexity  of AI can create uncertainty about  the application and enforcement of safety  legislation including  cybersecurity, applications in critical infrastructures, or malicious use. The report  concludes that the current product saf ety legislation contains several  gaps that need to be addressed.   New challenges in terms of liability also need to be tackled to ensure the same level of protection  compared to victims of traditional technologies58. In line with the European Parliament reso lution59 on  the civil liability regimen for AI, the rise of AI systems presents a significant challenge for the existing  liability frameworks. Using AI -systems could lead to situations in which the opacity, autonomy and the  multitude of actors who intervene  in their lifecycle make  it expensive or impossible to identify who was  in control of the risk of using the AI -system in question or which code or input caused the harmful  operation. Moreover, the mere operation of an autonomous AI -system should not be a s ufficient  ground for admitting the liability claim. As a result, there might be liability cases in which the allocation  of liability could be unfair or inefficient, or in which a person who suffers harm or damage caused by  an AI -system cannot prove the fau lt of the producer, of an interfering third party or of the operator and  ends up without compensation. This creates legal uncertainty for businesses and makes it difficult for  consumers and other injured parties to get compensation for damage caused by pro ducts and services  that use these technologies.  The European Commission  plans to revise legislation on product safety  and on liability issues related to new technologies, including AI systems in 2022. It is also expected to adopt the Directive on civil lia bility to adapt the rules to a digital age and AI , during the third quarter  of 2022. This initiative is part of the Commission approach to developing an ecosystem of trust in the  use of AI and it will complement the proposal for an AIA and revised safety l egislation such as the  Machinery Regulation and General Product Safety Directi ve.  The AIA proposal, which is part of a package of measures that addresses problems posed in relation to   the development and use of AI, aims at providing enough protection of fundamental rights and safety,  and the creation of a single market of trustworthy AI systems. It includes a broad definition of AI  systems, as techniques and approaches including ML  approaches, logic and knowledge- based  approaches and statistical approaches. The objecti ve of the proposal is fivefold:   • To harmonize the rules for placing  AI systems on the EU market.  • To prohibit certain AI practices (that may infringe certain fundamental rig hts).  • To require specific conditions for high -risk AI systems and  the operators of such systems.                                                                 56 COM(2020) 65 final.   57 COM(2020) 64 final, Brussels, 19.2.2020.   58 European Commission, Directorate -General for Justice and Consumers, Liability for artificial  intelligence and other emerging digital  technologies, Publications Office, 2019.   59 European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020 on civil liability regimen for artificial intelligence (2020/2014(INL)), P9 _TA (2020)0276.    
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         35 • To harmonize transparency rules for AI systems intended to interact with natural persons .  • To lay down rules for market monitoring and surveillance.   The AIA pro posal requires full consistency with the Charter, and Union legislation on data protection,  consumer protection and competition law. The proposed rules will be enforced through a governance  system at the Member State level, and a cooperation mechanism at U nion level with the establishment  of a European Artificial Intelligence Board.  The AIA proposal also significantly strengthens the Union’s  role to help shape global norms and standards and promote trustworthy AI that is consistent w ith  Union values and interests.   Regarding the application of these rules to the fisheries sector, a priori , when algorithms use biological,  environmental , and technical  data  for the purposes of fisheries management and control, the rights of  persons and businesses are  not likely to be affected. However, the disclosure of catches taken by a  specific vessel in a specific  area and date  could be contrary to confidentiality of professional data,  commercial secrecy and generate unfair competition. For this reason, when Member States collect and  transmit these data, they are under the obligation to make sure that these are properly protected. The   current  practice for data publicly shown is to aggregate  it in a way that it is not possible to directly  identify which  individual vessels have generated the data or the specific contribution of a particular  vessel to the data . Although aggregation of data is necessary to protect certain rights, the way the data  are aggregated may in turn create limitations  for the algorithm  applications  or for  some scientific and  management needs . This a point that deserves special consideration since it can be a technical barrier  for an efficient use of AI  in the fisheries sector.   Socioeconomic data  is provided by Member States to the Commission and other end -users  who  are  bound by the rules on data protection and confidentiality . The purposes for which these data are  collected and processed is to contribute to the overall objective of the CFP to sustainably manage the  exploitation of fisheries resources. As discussed in the analysis of fisheries legislation, AI systems in the  fisheries are not to use socioeconomic data with the aim  to influence human behaviour, or  to affect the  rights of  individuals in a way that undermine fundamental rights and freedoms of  the person. Thus, as  a general statement , the use of AI techniques and algorithms processing personal and business data in  the fisheries sector should not create any additional risk s related to the protection of personal d ata and  confidentiality rules.   2.3. The jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the EU on the use of  AI  The CJEU as the judicial authority of the EU by virtue of Article 19 TEU, in cooperation with the judicial bodies of the EU Member States, ensures the uniform application and interpretation of EU law. As it is  responsible for reviewing the legality of the acts adopted by the European institutions, ensuring that  the Member States comply with the obligations laid down in the TEU and the TFEU, and interpreting  EU law at the request of national judges.  The CJEU has jurisdiction to examine disputes to which the  Member States, the European institutions, business companies and individuals can  be parties in  relation to the interpretation and application of the EU legal order.  The CJEU's jurisdiction is broad , and  the Court has been involved in  very few  cases on issues that directly or indirectly  might  relate to  potential uses of AI in the field of fisheries.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       36 2.3.1.  Case on commercial discrimination using AI   References to ML, a common AI systems technique, were found in the judgment of the General Court  of 10 November 2021 in the case Google and Alphabet v Commission (Google Shopping)60. The  applicant brought an action for annulment by virtue of Article 263 TFEU against the Commission  Decision C(2017) 4444 fi nal of 27 June 2017 adopted in relation to abuse of dominant position  occasioned by online general search services and specialised product search services . Thus, the  Commission mentioned ML twice to demonstrate to the General Court the abusive nature of the  practices of Google LLC. The Commission noted, quoting numerous statements in that regard, that  traffic led to ML effects, thereby improving the relevance of the search results and thus the usefulness  of the comparison -shopping  service offered to internet users (paragraph 64). Later on, the Commission  ‘explained that the traffic increased the relevance of specialised search results and in particular the freshness and breadth of the offering of comparison shopping services by enhancing their ability to  convince merchants to provide them with data abou t their  products [...] that it generated revenue  either via commissions paid by merchants or  online advertising [...] and that it provided information  about user behaviour, which improved the relevance and usef ulness of results, including through ML   effects [...] experiments or the suggestion of other search terms that might be of interest for users‘ (paragraph 170). A n appeal has  now  been brought against this judgment before the Court of Justice  61.  This case shows that, like many other technological developments , AI can give a competitive  advantage to companies.  However, that in fisheries a technological  provider can exclude others  from  the market is unlikely in the sort to medium term given the large history of non- monopolistic   competition and considering that these companies mostly specialise  on hardware, and not add -ons  like AI .  2.3.2.  Case on illegal mechanical device  for fish classification   A Court of Justice case was found where an illegal mechanical fish classification device  was used .  Despite this being a mechanical device not fitted with an AI system, in the authors ’ opinion the same  types of procedures could be applied to  AI systems.  These classification  devices can be very useful to  speed up the value chain process by separation of fish sizes during fish ing trips , but these devices  can  also foment illegal d iscards at sea  of less profitable  smaller sizes . In its judgment of 11 February 2021 in  Case K.M.62, the Court of Justice ruled on the reference for a  preliminary ruling received from the Irish  Court of Appeal under Article 267 TFEU. This request had been made in the context of criminal  proceedings brought against K.M., the master of a fishing vessel, for having on board his fishing vessel  an automatic size -sorting equipment for herring, mackerel , and horse mackerel, which was not  installed or located on the vessel in such a way that freezing was carried out immediately  to prevent   returning  marine organisms to sea.   Both the EU legal order legislation and  Ireland’s legislation63 prohibit the on-board  possession  and use  of such equipment. At the time of the commission of the acts, which gave rise to the case before the  Irish courts, Article 32(1) of the Council Regulation (EC) No 850/98 of 30 March 1998 for the conservation of fishery resources through technical measures for the protection of juveniles of marine organisms 64  was the relevant provision to be applied. Years later, this Regulation was  repealed by the Regulation  on technical measures. Additionally,  Article 33 of Regulation on technical measures, which also                                                                60 Judgment of the General Court of 10 November 2021, Google and Alphabet v Commission (Google Shopping), T -612/17,  ECLI:EU:T:2021:763.   61 It is about the case C -48/22 P.   62 Judgment of the Court of Justice of 11 February 2021, K.M., C -77/20, ECLI:EU:C:2021:112.   63 Article 14(3) of the  Sea Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006.   64 OJ L 125, 27.4.1998, p. 1.  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         37 introduced amendments to the FCR , introduced Article 54c on restrictions on the use of automatic  grading equipment  which  is only  permitted if: a) the vessel does not simultaneously carry or use on   board either towed gear of mesh size less than 70 mm or one or more purse seines or similar fishing  gear; or (b) the whole of the catch which may be lawfully retained on board: (i) is stored in a frozen  state , (ii) the graded fish are frozen immediately a fter grading and no graded fish are returned to the  sea; and , (iii) the equipment is installed and located on the vessel in such a way as to ensure immediate  freezing and to not allow the return of marine species to the sea.  The Court of Justice was asked whether Article 89 and Article 90 of FCR , read in the light of the principle  of proportionality enshrined in Article 49(3) of the Charter, were to be interpreted as precluding a national provision which, in order to penalise a n infringement of Article 32 of Regulation No 850/98,  provided for the imposition of a fine and the mandatory confiscation of prohibited or non -compliant  catches and fishing gear found on board the vessel concerned (paragraph 25). Under Article 89 and  Article 90 of FCR , Member States have to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to sanction  infringements of the CFP rules. These provisions do not impose specific sanctions, but they stablish   certain criteria that Member States must consider, and the principle that such sanctions must be  effective, proportionate, and dissuasive (paragraph 30). According to settled jurisprudence, in the  absence of harmonisation of EU legislation in the field of applicable sanctions, Member States remain competent to lay dow n the sanctions they consider appropriate. However, they have the obligation to  exercise this competence in compliance with EU legal order and the general principles of EU law and,  consequently, in accordance with the principle of proportionality 65. The Cou rt of Justice found that the  mandatory confiscation of prohibited or non -compliant catches and fishing gear may deter the persons  concerned from infringing the prohibition on sorting equipment, laid down in Article 32(1) of  Regulation No 850/98, by deprivi ng them of the illegally obtained benefits which they could otherwise  enjoy, and of the possibility of continuing to use such equipment (paragraph 44).  This may be an important  judgment  since AI systems developers will need to ensure their design ed  tool s do not enable  (or make difficult) their misuse to avoid potential bans on their methodologies. On  the other hand, as shown in this study in later chapters , various AI systems are being developed with  the aim of avoiding  discards or bycatch before the fishing event happens by forecasting and observing  the fish at sea to  prevent this problem .   2.3.3.  Other cases where the term AI is mentioned   The term ‘AI’ has been mentioned in other cases brought before the CJEU.  Thus, in its ju dgment of 15  December 2021 in Case Breyer/REA, the General Court noted that ‘questions of principle on the use of  artificial intelligence’ were being raised  in this case66. However, it does not develop this idea.  In  addition, in five other cases in whose op inions the respective Advocate General used the term ‘AI’ ,  namely:   • Opinion  of Advocate General delivered on 15 April 2021 in the case KRONE – Verlag (footnotes  10 and 16)67.  • Opinion  of Advocate General delivered on 17 December 2020 in the case The Software  Incubator (footnote 29)68.                                                                65 Among other judgments, see: judgment of the Court of Justice of 16 July 2015, Chmielewski, C -178/03, ECLI:EU:C:2015:475, paragraph  21.  66 Judgment of the General Court of 15 D ecember 2021, Breyer/REA, T- 158/19, ECLI:EU:T:2021:902, paragraph 182.   67 C-65/20, ECLI:EU:C:2021:298.   68 C-410/19, ECLI:EU:C:2020:1061.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       38 • Opinion  of Advocate General delivered on 15 July 2021 in the case Poland v Parliament and  Council (footnote 74)69.  • Opinion  of Advocate General delivered on  11 March 2020 in the case Blackrock Investment  Management (UK) (paragraph 1)70.   • Opinion  of Advocate General delivered on 9 February 2017 in the case Lahorgue (paragraph 2)  71.  These opinions refer to AI as one of technologies , among other,  that can change the work in several  sectors and bring new challenges . However, these are not considered exclusively to be AI and  no  express link has been identified between the use of this term in these cases  and the field of fisheries.   2.4. State of l egislatio n of  third countries on the use of AI: Australia,  New Zealand, U nited States  and China   FAOLEX, the F AO’s database of legislative and policy documents,  was consulted by employing the  searching terms ‘artificial intelligence’  and ‘machine learning ’ in combination with ‘fisheries ’, but no  results were found. Nonetheless, in some countries  such as Australia, New Zealand, and the United  States of America ( US) the use of AI in fisheries management is being considered and explicitly  mentioned in some off icial  government documents  (Fisheries New Zealand, 2021). An example  is the  ‘Consultation of the wider rollout of on -board cameras ’ launched by the Ministry of Primary Industries  (MPI) of New Zealand in 2021 (Fisheries New Zealand , 2021) . The MP I states that ‘ alongside the  introduction of  electronic catch and position reporting, on- board cameras will support better, more  nimble decision -making  and as technology and AI develops there will be further transformative  opportunities ’.  Since  2014 the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) started to implement EM in several   pelagic fisheries targeting tunas and sharks , and in small pelagic fisheries  (AFMA, 20 19). The goals of  the implementation were to collect real time and accurate data on fishi ng activities such as catches,  discards, bycatch , and interaction with protected species and to monitor compliance with fishing  regulations (AFMA,  2020) , but AI is not yet incorporated in these systems (see chapter 3 for literature  review).  AFMA employs  EM data to fulfil its functions in accordance with the Fisheries  Management Act  of 199172 which allows use  of EM . AFMA complies with requirements on privacy and freedom of  information as per the Freedom of Information Act of 198273, which applies to data in written or visual  form  (AFMA, 2020) .  In New Zealand, EM  systems use  started in November 2019 with a group of 28 vessels operating off the  west coast of the North Island  (Fisheries New Zealand, 2019 ) to verify interactions with endangered  Māui dolphins. The re are specific regulations concerning the use EM for control purposes74. Release of  fisheries information  coming from EM is in turn  regulated by the Official Information Act75 and Privacy  Act76 obligations.                                                                 69 C-401/19, ECLI:EU:C:2021:613.   70 C-231/19, ECLI:EU:C:2020:196.   71 C-99/16, ECLI:EU:C:2017:107.   72 Fisheries Management Act 1991.

Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         39 In the US, AI is not currently applied in fisheries management and control. Nevertheless, EM systems  are being widely applied  and AI  is being seriously considered to automatically process video   recordings77. There are specific regulations in place for EM  (EDF , 2020 ). In turn, data confidentiality  issues are dealt with in accordance with fisheries and fisheries related regulations i.e., MagnusonStevens Fisheries and Conservation act78, and the Marine Mammal Protection Act79 respectively. Data  confidentiality is also aff ected by general regulation such as the Freedom of Information Act80.  Finally, t he Chinese government aims to become a world leader in both the development and use of  AI by 2030. In 2015, it pu t forward the ‘Made in China 2025 plan ’, and in 2017 China's State Council  released the ‘New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan’ , expressing the national  ambitions to lead the global Al industry by 2030. The term ‘ Al’ is not well -defined in China’s policy and  legislation . Many  laws govern Al in the sense that China's legal and administrative institutions already  govern every industry and individual conduct s. It is unclear to what extent the use of Al affects these  existing laws (Lucero , 2019) . Although this document makes no specific reference to fisheries, it will  likely apply to this industry in some way as China has one of the most powerful  fishing fleets worldwide,  especially its distant water fleet (DWF) operating in the high seas.                                                                   77 https://blogs.edf.org/edfish/2021/03/01/computer -assisted -monitoring -technologies -are-set-to-revolutionize -fisheries/   78 Magnuson -Stevens Fishery Conservation  and Management Act.

IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       40 3. ANAL YSIS OF THE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USE OF AI   TECHNIQUES AND APPROACHES IN THE FISHERIES SECTOR   In this chapter , firstly the main areas of fisheries science and management are  described . Secondly, AI  techniques , following the categorization of the AIA proposal , are explained highlighting their  similarities and differences. Thirdly , a review of scientific publications focused on  AI methods in  fisheries show s the areas of fisheries science where AI techniques have been more broadly applied  with  an example of fuel redu ction . Finally, opportunities and obstacles identified in stakeholders’   consultation are summarised. KEY FINDINGS   • The Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA)  proposal classifies  AI techniques and approaches in  three groups: a) machine learning (ML), b) logic - and knowledge -based approaches and  c) statistical approaches, Bayesian estimation, search and optimization methods.   • ML approaches have been mainly used to automatize sample processing to infer the  biological parameters for species status assessments and their management.   • ML has been applied in image analysis and acoustic data to count and measure  organisms.   • Recently AI research on ca tch monitoring has increased, especially for classification by  species and sizes .  • ML is being applied to automatically classify or determine fishers’ behaviour based on  monitoring systems data .  • Knowledge -based and expert systems have been applied for early  warning systems and  Marine Spatial Planning using ML  and statistical approaches .  • Traditional rule- based expert systems have been mainly applied in data -limited  situations.   • Statistical approaches, Bayesian estimation, and search and optimization methods ar e  not traditionally considered AI, but can be integrated into AI systems .  • Some of the statistical uses identified are applied for vessel route optimization, stock  assessments and species distribution models.   • Fishing vessels could improve  energy  efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions combining all  the above AI methodologies to locate target fish more accurately with less fuel.   • Scientists highlight the current use and potential of AI in sample processing and data  analysis for fisheries ecology and management purposes .  • Data collection and its processing could improve significantly with AI if  collaboration  between fishers and scientists from various fields  increases .  • There is a lack of experts  (and incentives) with multidisciplinary skills that combine  computing , marine and legal knowledge.   • European Commission  experts highlight the potential of AI to better implement fishing  regulation compliance control, improve marine spatial utilization, increase the amount   and availability velocity of biological and socio- economic data  and provide forecasts on  production and consumption .  • NGOs consider that AI should be used in the framework of a long -term strategy  embedded into an ecosystem -based management plan and not as an isolated tool.  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         41 Fisheries is a multidisciplinary science traditionally drawing from disciplines such as oceanography,  biology, ecology, population dynamics, statistics, economics, decision analysis and management.  Nowadays , new disciplines are emerging such as computational biology, fisheries law and bio  economics.  For example , AI is increasingly being used in fisheries science. Modern fisheries  management aims to produce sustainable biological, social , and economic benefits from renewable  aquatic resources. P roperly manag ed fisheries are considered a renewable resource since  an annual  surplus can be harvested  without reducing future productivity. Consequently , a lot of the work of  fisheries management  focuses  on building the biological and ecological understanding to estim ate this  surplus and defining rules for its harvesting. Another important activity of  fisheries management is  the  monitoring control and surveillance for compliance with these rules and harvesting  outcomes.   Furthermore, it is also important for industry and society  to know  this surplus distribution  and impact  of other human activities in a broader ecosystem approach. ML  and big data (Hu et al ., 2014) have  already shown their potential in marine sciences applied to fisheries forecasting (Fernandes et al .,  2010), automatic classification of zooplankton samples (Fernandes et al ., 2009; Uusitalo et al ., 2016),  and evaluation of ecosystem changes (Uusitalo et al ., 2018; Maldonado et al ., 2019). A transdisciplinary  approach is needed that brings different doma in experts, AI experts and policy and stakeholders’  knowledge together to co -create fit -for-purpose systems beyond the state -of-the-art AI technology in  more than one discipline simultaneously (Andonegi et al ., 2011; Fernandes et al ., 2013; Uusitalo et al .,  2020), bridging the gap between expert tools by scientists and the need of end -users in a co -creation  process.   The AIA proposal in Article 3 point 1 defines an ‘ AI system as ’software that is developed with one or  more of the techniques and approaches li sted in Annex I and can, for a given set of human- defined  objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing  the environments they interact with’ . The AI techniques and approaches listed in Annex I are clas sified  in three groups  (Figure 2):  • a) ML approaches , including supervised , unsupervised and reinforcement learning, using a  wide variety of methods including D eep Learning  (DL) .  • b) Logic - and knowledge- based approaches,  inclu ding knowledge representation, inductive  (logic) programming, knowledge bases, inference and deductive engines, (symbolic) reasoning and expert systems .  • c) Statistical approaches , Bayesian estimation, search and optimization methods.   While (a) and (b) groups refer to specific fields within AI in computer science, group (c) includes generic  fields that are usually considered outside AI  or part of their mathematical or statistical foundation. In  the case of statistics, they represent a m athematical science on its own. With the aim of having an open  definition of AI system that is future -proof, this classification is neither exhaustive nor exclusive. Some  specific techniques and approaches may not be explicitly listed, whereas others can b elong to more  than one group (e.g. Bayesian ML approaches). Furthermore, according to Article 4 of the AIA proposal,  the Commission is empowered to adopt delegated acts to amend this list to update for market and  technological developments . Figure 2 illust rates the c lassification of AI techniques and approaches in  the AIA proposal expanded with further subca tegories used in this study. Straight arrows show  common classification and use of AI techniques, whereas dotted lines show occasion al uses of the AI  techniques.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       42 Figure 2: Classification of AI techniques and approaches in the AIA proposal expanded with  further subcategories used in this study     Source: AZTI .    In the AIA proposal, an AI system is defined as software that is developed with one or more of the  techniques and approaches in Annex I of the AIA proposal. An AI system can, ‘for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions  influencing the environments they interact with’. The AIA proposal is quite open; whereby, almost any  algorithm can be somehow considered as an AI system if it influences the environments it interacts with. Only the last part of the definition restricts it by requiring that ther e is an ‘interaction’. An  interpretation is that an AI system needs to interact directly with an environment (e.g., automatic   engine swich off), but it is unclear if it includes systems that only give advice to an operator (who  decides to press the swich o r not). Such a definition is the result of provid ing a technology -neutral  definition of AI systems that is futur e-proof (COM(2021) 205 final).   3.1. ML approaches, including supervised, unsupervised and  reinforcement learning, using a wide variety of methods  including DL  ML can be defined as a  set of algorithms that learn from data without predetermined equations or   explicit instructions , allowing automated detection, classification, and predictions  (Figure 2). The  dataset used to  build the model  is called  a training set , where examples are usually labelled by humans.  An example is the labelling of fish images with their corresponding species name. The ML algorithms  infer the relationships of the labels (class or response variable) among  the rest of the data , which are   often called attributes, characteristics, variables, or predictors  (Table 2). The aim of ML is that the  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         43 algorithm can predict the label given to the attributes (supervised methods) for each example,  data  instance or observation. However, sometim es there are no pre- assigned labels, and the ML algorithms  learn patterns from the attributes, for example grouping similar data (clustering; Sonnewald et al. ,  2020) or inferring relationships between attributes (unsupervised learning; Trifonova et al ., 2015). Semi supervised ML algorithm s use both, labelled an unlabelled data, for example when labelled data is   costly of difficult to obtain.   Table 2: Similarities , differences and keywords associated to specific ML methods    Labelled  Unlabelled  Optimi sation   Objective  Keywords   Supervised  YES NO NO Learning from  examples   Unsupervised  NO YES NO Learning of p atterns   Semi -supervised  YES YES NO Examples & patterns   Deep learning  YES YES NO Convolutional n eural  network   Reinforcement learning  YES YES YES Agents   Source: AZTI .  Table 2 explains the similarities, differences and keywords associated to specific methods. Labelled and  unlabelled refers to the need of an expert previously labelling the data (e.g. species name or type of  vessel activity). The Optimisation Objective column highlights if the algorithm aims to maximize or  minimize one or more objectives by optimization approaches. This table does not aim to be exhaustive,  it is only shown to enable non -experts to eas ily understand similarities and differences among methods  through some concepts and keywords .  DL approaches are a type of ML method usually applied to supervised problems, where large amounts  of labelled data are available to apply algorithms based on convolutional neural networks (Malde et al., 2019; Goodwin et al., 2022). Convolutional neural networks are a type of neural network that have  proven to be effective in some problems such as image analysis. Neural networks algorithms consist of  multiple an d flexible parameter layers to learn from data similarly to the way a brain works and is  commonly used in ML. Neural networks have been shown to possess high capacity in image  recognition or with large amounts of data .  Reinforcement learning is an algorithm that can act or decide (agent) and learn through trial and error  towards maximizing a reward or objective. Reinforcement learning is sometimes used for parameter  learning in neural networks. Many ML algorithms have the distinction between learning the st ructure  (relationships between variables) and the parameters (weights of these relationships). However, many  algorithms impose limitations to the structure and parameters to reduce complexity and avoid  overfitting the data. Overfitting is produced in  model s that are too complex, which fit the training data  well but have poor generalization power when new data are available. The overfitting can undermine  the trust of ML users if the algorithms do not use robust statistical and ground truth validation  approac hes (Fernandes et al ., 2010; Lekunberri et al ., 2021).  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       44 In fisheries science, the most widely known and used ML approach is supervised learning. Supervised  learning based on data classification from image analysis has often been used for increasing the  biological and ecological knowledge required in fisheries management. Supervised learning based on  data from otolith image analysis has been applied to infer fish aging with image analysis and ML (Fablet  & Le Josse; 2005; Bermejo et al., 2007; Smoliński et al. , 2020; Stock et al., 2021) and with DL approaches  (Moen et al., 2018; Politikos et al., 2021). Similar approaches have been used for estimating food  availability by analysing plankton samples (Zarauz et al., 2009; Irigoien et al., 2009), habitat mapping  (Beijbom et al., 2012), invertebrate classification (Kiranyaz et al., 2011; Joutsijoki et al., 2011), and marine  litter identification (Cózar et al., 2014; Lorenzo -Navarro et al., 2018; Granado et al., 2019; Kylili et al.,  2020) .  In relation to fisheries ma nagement, ML has been used to estimate stock life -history parameters (Liu et  al., 2020; Morais & Bellwood, 2018) and to simulate fisheries management scenarios (Dreyfus -Leon &  Kleiber, 2001; Russo et al., 2014). Supervised ML has been used to infer complex  stock -recruitment  (adults/new fishes), and relationships considering environmental effects (Chen and Ware, 1999; Chen  et al., 2000; Huse, G., & Ottersen, 2003; Megrey et al., 2005; Fernandes et al., 2010; Fernandes et al., 2013;  Fernandes et al., 2015; Sm oliński, 2019). These relationships are key to understanding some of the  drivers of fish stocks collapses beyond fishing and to establish fishing rules that allow exploitation while  reducing the likelihood of collapse under negative environmental conditions .  Acoustical oceanography consists of emitting sound pulses into the water and analy sing their echoes  to obtain information (identification, abundance , and size) about the targets present (Simmonds and  MacLennan, 2005). Using sonars and echosounders it is possible to observe organisms in the marine  environment to depths of hundreds of meters. The new generation of broadband acoustic equipment  has increas ed dramatically the information obtained in each ping, by changing from the discrete, single  point response of the ‘ narrowband ’ signal (Korneliussen et al. , 2016) to the continuous acoustic  signature of the ‘broadband ’ one (Stanton et al ., 2010; Forland et  al., 2014). ML approaches are also  commonly used to estimate biomasses and species composition in scientific a coustic surveys through  supervised learning  (Robotham et al. , 2010; Baidai et al. , 2020; Mannocci et al. , 2021) , DL (Rezvanifar et  al., 2019; Sarr et al. , 2020) , unsupervised learning (Korneliussen et al. , 2009; Peña, 2018), semi supervised learning  (Woillez  et al. , 2012) or statistical approaches ( Anderson et al. , 2007; Boluki et al. ,  2017). However, early attemp ts that used more statistical ap proaches can be found in the literature  (Scalbrin et al. , 1996; LeFeubre et al. , 2000; Lawson  et al. , 2001). Despite these scientific surveys being  key for high quality data, there are important limitations to the amount of data that can be gathered  by sci entists given the high economic cost of oceanographic surveys. Recently, the complementarity  of using data from industry together with scientific data is emerging (Uranga et al ., 2019).   There were earlier successful applications of classic ML approaches an d image analysis approaches to  catches for species identification (Strachan et al. , 1990; Storbeck & Daan , 2001; White et al. , 2006).  These  have continued with a recent trend to increase EM  (Wang et al. , 2018) and capitalizing on neural  networks and image analysis methodological development . The utilization of DL has also increased  recently on species identification of catches (French et al. , 2020;  Tseng & Kuo , 2020; Yu et al. , 2020;   Lekunberri et al. , 2021; Qiao et al. , 2021; Palmer et al. , 2022). However,  most of these publications are  just proof -of-concept in controlled environments. Recently Lekunberri et al.  (2022 ) have approached  the problem of identifying tuna species in vessels using current commercial digitali sation systems  already installed  on board . Species identification is becoming crucial for catch  tracking and monitoring.  It is likely that species identification on board vessels will allow quotas to be monitored by industry and  authorities in near real time (e.g ., daily captures) with stand ards currently under development . It is also   expected that AI will allow the early identification of species that can raise issues with discards. 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         45 However, DL requires large amounts of labelled data that are currently difficult to obtain in  experimental tri als. Some recent research work has focused  on fish size estimation without  differentiating species (Monkman et al. , 2019;  Álvarez -Ellacuría  et al., 2020;  Yu et al. , 2020; Garcia et al. ,  2020) . Species identification has been also the objective  behind  using  genomic datasets and  ML  algorithms (Sylvester et al. , 2018; Brophy  et al. , 2020). Fish species identification and counting  with   underwater in situ  devi ces has used  classification with  supervised ML and DL which can be used in  biodiversity studies or  to improve fishing selectivity  (Salman  et al., 2016; Marini et al., 2018; Villion et al. ,  2018; Labao & Naval , 2019) . Supervised classification has also been used on genetic data in other  species for ecological quality status assessment ( Cordier et al. , 2017) despite current limitations with  genetic data (Hanse et al. , 2018).  DL as also  been employed for  underwater detection of sea life and  debris floating on the ocean surface using satellite data ( Watanabe et al. , 2019) .  The estimation of  presence and intens ity of fishing using  detailed tracking data from logbooks and  VMS is an area where large datasets and ML  are evolving . Logbook and VMS data are usually requested   by national governmental authorities or RFMOs for monitoring, control, and surveillance s ystem s.  Commonly, VMS is a mandatory system for vessels above a given size, but the regulations vary by  jurisdiction. Detailed VMS data, however, are usually not shared publicly by authorities or are only  provided as aggregated values and with a time lag (Tacon et et al ., 2019). Alternatively, s atellite AIS  reporting position through a satellite system are mandatory in all passenger ships irrespective of size,  in all vessels >300 MT (gross) transiting international routes, and in any cargo ship > 500 MT transiting  within national waters (Eguíluz et al. , 2016). AIS was initially intended to improve ship safety by  broadcasting and receiving AIS signals to prevent  collisions between vessels, and is used by large,  oceanic vessels. Whi le the purpose of these signals is to alert nearby marine traffic of a vessel’s  presence, the messages can be received by a wide array of satellites and terrestrial receivers that  operate worldwide (Taconet et al. , 2019). ML  has been used to analyse VMS an d AIS data to differentiate  active  fishing events  (e.g.,  setting a net)  from fish searching activities  (de Souza et al. , 2016), and to   distinguish the fishing gear type (Russo et al. , 2011; Russo et al. , 2016; Kroodsma et al. , 2018; Fernandes  et al. , 2019;  Joo et al. , 2021). This differentiation is has enabled the estimation of consequent impacts  such as emissions (Coello et al., 2015; McKuin et al., 2021) or seafloor potential impacts (Kroodsma et  al., 2018) despite the controversy caused by the data resol ution used (Amoroso et al., 2018); or to help  in spatial planning (Watson et al., 2018; Queiroz et al., 2019; White et al., 2020) althought there are also  some disagreements with the interpretation of the results (Murua et al., 2021a); or spotting illegal  fishing (Belhabib et al. 2020; Chuaysi & Kiattisin, 2020; Seto et al. 2020); and forced labour at sea despite  doubts raised about its accuracy at local scales (McDonald et al. 2021a; Swartz et al., 2021; McDonald  et al., 2021b). However, false positives ca n have political, economic, and ethical implications (Swartz et  al., 2021; Harry and Braccini, 2021). ML has also been used to analyse other various research topics in  fisheries sciences (Syed and Weber, 2018; Syed et al, 2018 ).  Spatial planning is an emer ging area where ML is being used  to develop  expert systems ( Coccoli et al.,  2018). Moreover, ML is also being employed to generate useful information  needed for these expert  systems and other a pproaches . Recently in the Mission Atlantic H2020 P roject81 the current  status of  mapping human activities and potential role of ML  in this mapping as well as the inference of human  pressures due to different sectorial  activities has been revised. Some examples  include : litter estimation   from fishing activity (Kuczenski et al., 2021) , underwater noise worldwide based on vessel type and  their speed inferred from AIS data (Jalkanen et al., 2021),  estimation of shipping emission ( Moldanová  et al. , 2018 and 2021, Ytreberg et al. , 2021)  or oil spill detection and mapping (Pais et al., 2013; Ozigis et  al., 2018; Al -Ruzouq et al., 2020).                                                                81 https://missionatlantic.eu/

Logic - and knowledge -based approaches, including knowledge  representation, inductive (logic) programming, knowledge  bases, inference, and deductive engines, (sym bolic) reasoning  and expert systems   Knowledge -based  systems are a form of AI  that, instead of learning from data , aim to capture the  knowledge of human experts to support decision -making  and problem solving. To do so, they usually   have two main components : a knowledge base, where the expert knowledge is stored, and an  inference engine, which applies reasoning to bring the light  new facts and relations between data  (Ahmed et al ., 2019).   Knowledge  bases store information about the real world represented in a  way so that a computer can  understand and apply reasoning to it. The information in the knowledge bases is described in a logically  consistent way, which make them a good tool to easily share expert knowledge. Several knowledge representation methods can be used to formalize the knowledge and make it understandable for computers . One of the most common  ways to represent  knowledge is the use of rules . These are ‘ifthen’  constructs that allow to express complex statements, such as  ‘IF you are thirsty THEN d rink’. Fuzzy  rules can also be used to represent knowledge. These are rules whose antecedents, consequences or both , are fuzzy rather than crisp (Dubois and Prade, 1996), and which are often used by humans on  their decision- making in their everyday life. A n example of this type of rule is ‘ IF temperature is hot  THEN fan speed is fast’ , where hot and fast are fuzzy concepts since they do not have  strict boundaries .  Ontologies are also a well -known way to represent knowledge. They  are defined as ‘ a formal explicit  specification of a shared conceptualization of a domain of interest ’ (Grimm et al. , 2007). They define  concepts, relations between these concepts and instances to describe the knowledge of a do main of  interest, making it intuitively understandable for humans. In 2002, FAO designed the Fish Ontology  Service project to create, integrate and use ontologies for information integration and semantic interoperability in fishery information system s (Gangemi et al.,  2004). Following th is work, they created  a network of ontologies to represent information related to fish stocks, formalizing , and integrating  data from different sources (Caracciolo et al. , 2012). Ontologies have also been used to collect  controlled  and structured vocabulary of terms that describe fish anato my, morphology, ecology , and  various developmental stages, which  can be utilized  to classify unknown fish (Ali et al.,  2017). They have  also been applied  to help mak ing early diagnosis of shrimp and fish diseases i n aquaculture  by  consi dering  their morphological symptoms (Tran et al., 2020).  Recently, an ontology for assessing fish  welfare in aquaculture has been presented, which is applicable to different species, different aquaculture systems and different locations (Tschirren et al.,  2021).   Description logic s are a family of knowledge representation languages that can be used to represent  the knowledge of an application domain in a structured and formal way  (Baader et al.,  2005).   Description logic -based knowledge bases have been built  to represent knowledge on coastal  ecosystems, population dynamics, descriptions of habitats, interactions between species, etc . This kind  of knowledge could  help  for example  in the process of designing management models for artisanal  fisheries (García -Allut et al ., 2003).  Once the knowledge base is built, the inference engine (the second  main component of the knowledge- based systems) applies reasoning to extract new conclusions  from  the knowledge. In this context, reasoning refers to first -order or higher order logic, which can be  deductive or inductive. The reasoning is deductive when a conclusion is established by means of premises that are assumed to be true. For example, if it is known that all whales are mammal and all  mammals have kidneys, if can be concluded, using deductive reasoning, that whales have kidneys. On  the other hand, inductive reasoning tries to induce a hypothesis that generalizes observations. For 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         47 example, i f it is known that tuna is a fish and it lives underwater, and cod is a fish and it lives underwater,  using inductive reasoning, it could be concluded that fish live underwater. Inductive logic  programming is defined as the intersection between logic programming and inductive learning. It uses logic programming to represent examples and background knowledge, to then derive hypotheses that  generalize these examples, learning new relations between data (Muggleton and  De Raedt, 1994).   Expert systems  are knowle dge -based systems (Fig ure 3) that in an interactive setting ask a person for  information and draw conclusions based upon the response, or give advice, emulating the decisionmaking ability of a human expert. They are useful when an expert is not available to make decisions,  when the knowledge of more than one expert is necessary, and when intelligent assistance or training  are needed for problem solving. Additional advantages are the educational benefits and the ease of  knowledge documentation (Akerkar and Sajja, 2009). Expert systems can be classified into several  categories, depending on the knowledge representation they use. Rule- based expert systems are the  most common ones, where the knowledge is represented by rules and the inference engine uses  deduct ive reasoning to make decisions or extract conclusions. Fuzzy expert systems, on the other hand,  use fuzzy rules to represent the knowledge. Traditional rule- based expert systems have been applied  to several problems related to the fisheries sector, mainly  in data limited situations. They have been  employed in areas related to fisheries management to estimate the vulnerability of some fishes to  fishing methods (Cheung et al., 2005). The use of expert systems in aquaculture has also been studied,  for tasks such as aquaculture management (Alagappan and Mariappan, 2015) or fish disease diagnosis  (Li et al., 2002) .  Figure 3: Simplified diagram of an expert system     Source: Reproduced from Tan et al . (2016) .    In addition to those traditional expert systems,  where a rule -based knowledge  base and an inference  engine  are the main components , many  current expert systems use ML methods for decision making . The main advantage that these systems offer is that they learn from available data instead of  learning from formalized expert knowledge, making the process of incorporating new knowledge  much easier, or combine both approaches (e.g., Bayesian network approaches). These expert systems  can be based on many ML methods, such as artifici al neural networks (ANN), Support Vector Machines,  Bayesian models or DL methods. In ANN expert systems, for example, the knowledge is encoded within  the nodes and the weights of the network, and the network itself generates the inference rules. There  are studies that suggest that expert systems can be beneficial for traditional small -scale fisheries  (Deepananda et al., 2016), since they allow the knowledge that traditional fishers acquire through their  professional life to be formalised for application to the management of these fisheries. Such systems  have also been applied to the taxonomic identification of fishes, which is a time- consuming task for  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       48 non- experts (Chen et al., 2005; Guisande et al., 2010), algae identification (Setiawan et al, 2021) or  eval uation of sustainability policies (Cisneros -Montemayor et al., 2018) among other applications.  Usually, morphological characteristics of the fishes are analysed to identify its species, but the  automatization of this process is a difficult task. Expert systems have been used to make the process  easier for the non- experts. Lately, with the growth of available data, ML based expert systems have  become more popular, and many applications of these systems to the fisheries sector can be found.  Some examples of t hese applications are the assessment of fish vulnerability to climate change (Chen  et al., 2020), early warning systems (Campbell et al., 2013; Granado et al., 2019; Fernandes -Salvador et  al., 2021), FROODS (Granado et al., 2021), automatic fish recognitio n (Sharmin et al., 2019) and Marine  Spatial Planning (Coccoli et al., 2018 ).  3.3. Statistical approaches, Bayesian estimation, search and  optimization methods   Even though  statistical approaches , Bayesian estimation, and search and optimization methods  not  being  necessarily AI approaches, the AIA proposal includes them within the techniques and  approaches that could be  used as part of AI systems.  The interplay between these concepts is not  always clear, but it has been acknowledged that they play a substantial ro le for the theoretical and  practical understanding of AI and its further development (Friedrich et al. , 2021).   Statistics  is the science of collecting, analy sing, presenting, and interpreting data.  It has two main  types of methods: descriptive statistics that summarise data from a sample , and inferential statistics  that draw conclusions about the population from a sample subject to random variation (Casella and  Berger, 2002). The later includes problems of point estimation, hypothesis testing, interval esti mation,  sampling design, model checking and model prediction, aligned with the AI system definition .  Statistics is one of the basic disciplines in fisheries science,  where these methods have been used  extensively  since their foundation (see for instance Ricker, 1945) . Examples of applications include  model s of biological processes, such as length -weight models (Ma et al. , 2017;  Froese, 2006),  growth  models  (Weisberg et al.,  2010; Katsanevakis  and Maravelias , 2008), length at maturity relationships  (Chen a nd Palo heimo, 1994; Schnute and Richards, 1990) or stock -recruitment relationships  (Subbey  et al., 2014; Needle, 2002 ; Megrey et al., 2005 ). From an ecolo gical perspective, statistical models have  been used to understand how  environmental drivers affect  fish dynamics  (Pepin, 2015) , describe  essential fish habitat (Guisan and Zimmermann, 2000 ; Melo -Merino et al., 2020; Pickens et al., 2021) and  have been applied to disentangle  spatial dynamics (Petitgas et al., 2014) , with an increasing interest in  recent  years in the impact of ocean warming and climate change (Rijnsdorp  et al., 2009; Chust et al.,  2019; Bruge et al., 2016) .  The design of laboratory experiment s and sampling for  data collection from the fishery or from  research surveys often relies on statistical analyses ( Thomas et al, 2010; Petitgas, 2001 ; Hirzel and  Guisan, 2002; Borges et al., 2011). The subsequent analys es of these data  usually require complex  statistical approaches . Some of the most common applications in the case of fishery data  are related to   characteriz ation of  fishing fleets (Dolder et al. , 2020), catch and effort standardization (Maunder and  Punt , 2004) or comparison of fishing technologies (Miller, 2013 ); whereas , for fisheries independent  data they are related to obtaining  abundance indices (Borchers et al ., 1997) or characterizing the  ecosystem ( Doray et al., 2018; Boyra et al., 2018 ).  Finally , statistical models have been broadly used in fisheries for  stock assessment (Maunder and Punt,   2013), stock management (Little et al., 2016) and  ecosystem approach to fisheries management  (Christensen and Walters, 2004). S tatistical  developments have been successively introduced into 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         49 fisheries science as they were developed. One example of how increasingly complex statistical  methodo logy has been gradually introduced in fisheries science are stock assessment models   (Maunder and Punt, 2013 and references therein; Buckland et al., 2004; Nielsen and Berg, 2014, Thorson  et al., 2015; Anderson et al., 2017 ). Inversely, fisheries science has also triggered the development of  new statistical techniques and approaches. A clear example is the Automatic Differentiation Model  Builder  (ADMB ) developed by Fournier in the late 1980’s that was originally designed for fish stock  assessment models (Fournier et al. , 2010), but has later been a pplied to many other fields.   Bayesian statistics  is one of the two main paradigms in statistics. In contrast to frequentist or classic  statistics where the unknowns are considered fi xed values, in Bayesian statistics the unknowns are  treated as random variables and their distribution conditioned on the observed data is calculated  according to the Bayes’ theorem (Gelman et al. , 2013). It was  in the early 1990s when the development  of p owerful computers and the implementation of computer- intensive methods led to an expansion  of Bayesian statistics. In fisheries science, the first applications date from the mid 1990’s and were  mostly related to stock assessment (Hilborn et al ., 1994;  Hoen ig et al. , 1994;  McAllister et al. , 1994;  Punt  and Hilborn, 1997). Current applications in fisheries science have a broader scope . Some examples  include  basic biological processes ( Froese et al.,  2014) , acoustic surveys (Fassler et al., 2009; Juntunen  et al., 2012), mark- recapture models (Mäntyniemi  and Romakkaniemi, 2002), catch estimates  (Fernandez et al., 2002; Hirst et al., 2004), hierarchical spati o-tempor al models  (Paradinas et al., 2015 ;  Thorson et al. , 2019)  and relationships with the environment using BNs (Trifonova et al. , 2015; Uusitalo  et al. , 2018).   Search and optimization methods  (Hoos and Stützle, 2004; Gendreau and Potvin, 2010; Martí et al .,  2018) are methods that select the best solutio n or best available solution (maximize or minimize one  or more  objectives or value functions) given a defined domain (or inputs). In simple problems it works  by systematically testing inputs and checking if the solution produces a maximum given a value  function. In most real-world  complex problems optimization methods search for the solutions in a  space instead and systematically test all possibilities. There are many different types of optimization  and search algorithms , but nature inspired ones are the most used  in AI (Granado et al ., 2020). Nature  inspired algorithms are heuristic methods based on mimic king  natural processes. The most used  method is the genetic algorithm, which is a population -based approach that iteratively improves the  set of best sol utions or population by using mutation, crossover , and selection operators ( Ueno  et al.,  2003;  Muttil  et al., 2005;  Álvarez -Diaz et al., 2006; Mesquita  et al., 2017).  Other examples include (i)  simulated annealing algorithm, mimic king  the annealing process  of metallurgy, which is a heat  treatment that involves warming a material and then slow ly cooling it (Cook et al., 2005; Vázquez et al.,  2016); (ii) a nt colony algorithm, which is a probabilistic technique inspired by ant foraging behaviour  (Lazarowska, 2014); and (iii) p article swarm optimization, which is a population -based method  mimic king  the social behaviour of organisms in groups, such as birds or  fish (Zheng et al ., 2019).  Some  of the uses identified above are applied to: vessel route optimization (Groba et al. , 2015; 2018;  2020;  Granado et al. , 2021); stock assessments (Maunder et al. , 2013); or species distribution models (Pennino  et al. , 2014).     3.4. Example of fuel consumption reduction   Fuel consumption can represent up to 50% of a fishing vessel 's operational costs and is an important  contributor to the increment in shipping Green House Gas Emissions and contaminants (Olmer et al.,  2017). For insta nce, g lobal fishing fuel consumption and consequent emissions per landed tonne of  catches increased by up to 20% between 1991 and 2011 (Parker et al., 2018). This was due to an increase 
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       50 in fishing effort worldwide without a parallel increase in fish landings (Bell et al., 2017). Furthermore,  Lotze et al. (2018) forecast that by the end of the century there will be no increase in  global fish biomass  in the best -case climate scenario, or up to a 30% decrease in fish catches, in the worst- case scenario;  and even worse scenarios are predicted by the next generation of climate projections (Tittensor et al.,  2021). This, along with volatile fuel prices , can have a major impact on the fishing industry, fish prices  and food security of some c ountries (Parker et al.,  2018).   This is a  field of work  where different AI techniques can lead to the development and application of  effective route and fishing decision support systems to mitigate and adapt to climate change and economic challenges (Granado et al., 2021). Th is example of a route optimization expert system for   fishing vessels can correspond with the combination of the three types of AI methods found in Annex  I of the AIA proposal  and reviewed in this chapter. A Fishing Route Optimization Decision Support  System (F ROODS) is an expert system compiling and representing the knowledge from the fishers and  managers, taking the decision (type b) but using mathematical optimization and searching methods  (type c), and likely to be complemented by ML methods to forecast the best fishing grounds (type b).  FROODS may be one of the most complex examples. Most of the examples specified above are simpler  and focus on ML (type a) approaches based on learning from data. Nowadays, type b approaches based  on knowledge extraction or ru les determination are still sparse as a standalone approach in fisheries  but are often combined with type a and b methods. Type c methods are often utilized  for specific  applications such as Bayesian statistics for stock assessments, but not necessarily fo r its automatic  application and not always can be considered AI.   3.5. Opportunities and obstacles consultation with  stakeholders  During this study , scientists and stakeholders were interviewed to identify the main advantages,  disadvantages, and barriers to the use of AI in fisheries, and the necessary legal framework for its  development while preserving people’s rights and safety. An online survey was conducted from mid January to mid -February, targeting a variety of fisheries stakeholders: scientists, European Commission   administration (DG MARE), environmental NGOs, and the fishing sector. Four similar questionnaires were adapted to each stakeholder category .  3.5.1.  Results of consultation with scientists and researchers   Some scientists considered that AI is currently more applied to data analysis than to data collection or  automated sample evaluation, although there is a strong interest in the latter (e.g., automated aging of fish from otoliths, zooplankton samples classification, acoustic data categorization, etc.). I n terms of  data analysis, the AI approaches currently employed are very close to classical statistical methods, using  certain ML algorithms for species distribution modelling or alternatives to standard clustering  methods. A researcher commented that there are ongoing projects to research the potential of  underwater AI for improving selectivity and monitor fishing effort. According to respondents, sample  analysis (e.g., automated fish identification, aging, and all image -related tasks) is one of the researc h  branches with the greatest optimization potential for AI approaches. Use of these methods in fishing  gear or remotely via Remotely Operated Vehicle or ROVs has selectivity improvement potential in  fisheries. Another scientist pointed out that stock assessment could be one of the first instances where  AI is applied since that application does not rely on collaboration from fishers. Along the same lines,  another respondent considered that data inputs collected through AI can greatly contribute to  population  dynamics models (e.g., faster aging of fish from surveys, plankton ID and development of  similar environmental indices). As regards fleet monitoring, AI would increase processing efficiency of 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         51 EM data particularly from fleets or gears with large numbers o f vessels and where poor observer  coverage is in place .  Researchers stressed the need for AI and ML experts who have a fisheries science or computer science  background who are then specifically trained for fisheries research. Shortages in technological services  such as insufficient cloud storage and computing infrastructure are also pointed out as constraints.  Therefore, more funds and infrastructure are required for conducting research on AI in fisheries. Other  scientists considered that a collaborative pr ocess is required where, first, fishers and scientists establish  close collaborations. According to some respondents, fishers tend to be reluctant to accept the  installation of new technologies for data collection on board their vessels. Thus, the fishers’   cooperation is strictly necessary to improve trust and a sense of shared solution co -ownership. Better  collaboration between scientists on database sharing of annotated/labelled data is also regarded as  necessary. With respect to the main constraints for the use of AI in fisheries research, respondents  agreed that there is a scarcity of adequately trained personnel. Some researchers considered that computer scientists mainly work for the industry as they can obtain higher salaries rather than in fisheries science where salary conditions are less attractive. Fisheries scientists are slowly adapting to  the new technologies, but there is generally a lack of training in these specialised activities .  3.5.2.  Results of consultation with European Commission experts   Europ ean Commission  experts in fisheries management provided insights on the potential benefits of  AI in fisheries control such as image recognition for catch monitoring as part of EM systems. Vessel  position data analysis to characterize movement patterns to forecast future vessels’ behaviour could  enable more focus on control activities on certain vessels based on a risk classification. In turn, data  mining could be used for the Fleet Register to spot capacity changes and determine errors/anomalies.  Automatic  recognition of species using ML could be applied to determine risk areas for more targeted  fisheries inspections. Ad hoc sensors for discard detection is also of potential interest for fisheries  control. Treatment and analysis tracking equipment onboard s mall -scale vessels (i.e., overall length  below 12 m) can improve spatial and temporal fishing effort distribution knowledge for these boats. AI  would also improve fisheries management ability to verify adequate licensing, and detect  infringements of seasonal closures and protected areas, thus contributing to solve marine space use conflicts .  European Commission  experts in data collection underlined the potential of AI in image recognition to  identify species and sizes on board and at auctions, which would i ncrease the quantity, quality, and  diversity of the sampling data and traceability of products. Furthermore, sensors could provide real time data collection. Satellite images could be employed for cross checking fishing and enable faster  online catch reporting during fishing operations. AI could also be used for the production of interactive  maps. However, there are several constraints on the wider use of AI such as considerations on data sharing, data protection, confidentiality, and alleged interaction between data collection for scientific  purposes and for control and enforcement. Technical constraints include power supply on small or/and  older vessels, connectivity, and network coverage at sea. Lack of trust by the fishing industry can also create an imp ortant obstacle for advancement. Quality assurance is yet another crucial factor. Checking  data quality and completion of databases with voids currently requires very laborious human work.  This may be an area where AI can provide solutions. There is also t he risk of how to use all the data  collected and how to deal with wrong data use that can lead to ‘false news’ .  European Commission  experts in market policies commented that AI has potential for market  intelligence purposes to better forecast production and consumption. In this latter case, AI could be  employed to fill the gaps between the latest official data available and the present time. Eurostat data, 
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       52 for example, generally becomes available after a two -year delay. AI could be used to help anticipate  what the data over the two most recent years would most likely be. Nonetheless, the main constraint  for AI use in the field of market intelligence is the absence of an EC legal mandate for the administration  to provide forecasts (production, consumption, et c.) to external stakeholders. Thus, while the  production of accurate forecasts would be relevant for market intelligence, legal mandates are not in force yet. Therefore, there are reputational risks such as institutions making forecasts, which go beyond  their reporting obligations based on existing datasets. This would in fact influence market operators  whose behaviour is altered by these estimates. Thus, there is a reputational risk due to either being  wrong in the forecast or passing over institutional ro les. Other constraints mentioned by EC officers  were the scarcity in skills and training programs for users and also the opposition by some operators who perceived these innovations as controls and limitations on their activities.   European Commission  exper ts mentioned that the EMFAF can finance onboard equipment for vessels  in terms of innovation concerning  AI, linked to control and monitoring, data collection and research  and innovation. For example,  Horizon Europe can finance research projects to develop new  technologies and innovations  including those for fisheries .  3.5.3.  Results of consultation with industry and other stakeholders   Respondents from the fishing sector reported that AI is not currently employed in harvesting activities. AI, however, would be of g reat use for identification of fishing grounds. Regarding the use of AI to  reduce fuel consumption, costs, and emissions, some respondents considered again that the short  supply of expertise and lack of technology are limiting factors. In turn, a company p roviding services to  large fishing operators commented that they have different AI algorithms in place for processing EM  system footage. For this purpose, algorithms are trained to identify fishing operations, detect when  catches are brought on board and c lassify different species. The development of AI will yield benefits  such as costs reduction in EM systems, both in terms of reducing footage and its review time. AI  developments would in turn facilitate a wider implementation of EM to improve monitoring, control,  and enforcement of fishing vessels, particularly where the presence of observers onboard is not  practical (e.g., small -scale vessels). Surveys highlighted the necessity to set a new legal framework (or  better our understanding of current framework s) to have a clear view of where AI can be used and how  to handle the issues that can arise from it (e.g., privacy and management of failures). The main  constraint is the paucity of specific standards setting AI algorithm validation protocols. It is essential to  establish well defined guidelines and clear minimum requirements for AI algorithms .  An NGO representative considered that weak monitoring is a major challenge to understand and  characterize the interactions taking place between fishing activities and PETs. In this context, AI has the  potential to record and improve data provided for long -term ecosystem -based management plans.  One of the main constraints for the implementation of AI is that developing, testing and adapting AI  tools  to the specificitie s of a particular fishery requires time and staff trained to deal with and analyse  large amounts of data. Thus, cost- efficiency studies are required to establish priorities in the use of AI  within a long -term strategy. Another barrier for a wider adoption of AI is the introduction of new  requirements in a sector that is already highly regulated.   3.5.4.  Other recent stakeholder surveys   In the context of the seafood industry, a survey was conducted by EIT Food amongst processors  and  manufactur es exploring  their read iness for AI adoption in their processes  (EIT Food, 2021). Respondents   agreed that the main limitations  for a wider AI adoption were  the lack of digital skills and the difficulties  to acquire the necessary know -how. Another  important  issue for SMEs within the food industry was  the 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         53 capacity to recruit and retain staff with digital skills in a context where these professional profiles are  highly valued in the labour market. These experts normally prefer to work in larger companies which   offer higher salaries. In addition, many food SMEs are in rural and often  isolated areas with limited  access to leisure activities  and other facilities which may be less attractive to younger AI skilled staff.  Another issue observed in seafood industry respondents was the little awareness on potential benefits  offered by AI tools. Many respondents did not understand the meaning of AI and its potential beneficial  impacts in their sector. The survey also found that those SME managers most aware of AI technol ogy  were also keener to attempt their implementation in their companies. Many respondents considered  that failure to implement AI in their industries may let their companies behind in a competitive market.  However, the economic cost of implementing AI is c urrently high and acts as a barrier for a more  intensive use of these technologies. Respondents considered that funding plans at EU and national  level would lower the economic barriers for a more intensive adoption of AI.   The University of Cambridge (Centre for the study of Existential Risk) and CGIAR (platform for big data  in Agriculture) reported on a survey targeting 72 scientists and researchers in the domains of digital agriculture, big data in agriculture and agricultural supply chains to see how they  assessed (a) the  expected vulnerabilities of supply chains to risks and (b) the expected receptiveness of supply chain  phases to AI system (Tzachor, 2020). This report explained AI systems have the potential to mitigate  some of the vulnerabilities across supply chains, and thereby improve the state of global food security.  This study results suggested that, for the next decade (2020 -2030), AI will be needed the most in highly  vulnerable supply chain phases in developing countries, where its integration is estimated to be most restricted. On the contrary, although agricultural supply chains in developed countries were  considered less vulnerable, the involved agents were significantly more receptive to AI  experimentation and integration.

SPECIFIC FISHERIES TOPICS DISCUSSION     The EU fisheries sector is large and complex, encompassing an activity which has  a relative low  contribution to the economy. According to  the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for  Fisheries  (STECF’s AER , 2021), the fishing fleet generated a gross value added (GVA) of EUR  3.4 billion  in 2019 . Despite fisheries making a relatively minor contribution to the EU economy, the activity has a  high relevance in terms of food security, coastal community identity, employment, and incom e. The  fishing fleet comprises over 57,236 active vessels in the EU, directly employing more than 129,540  fishers. The EU fleets generally operate around the world, including Atlantic Western Waters, North Sea, KEY FINDINGS   • There is an increasing interest in the application of AI systems in the fish value chain,  although current developments are mostly proof -of-concept and not yet commercially  operational.   • Traceability and seafood products integrity is where more promising us es of AI  application already exist, closer to operational systems within the value chain .  • Lack of data generation and collection, both in quality and quantity, is the main barrier  for the application of AI systems in the fish value chain .  • The processing industry is starting to use AI systems to help with the automation of processes in which manual techniques have been traditionally employed .  • AI proofs -of-concept have been developed within logistics for supplier selection,  inventory management, storage time prediction, frozen chain break detection,  production cost and risk loss estimation and, travel and lead time estimation.   • Machine Learning (ML) has been used to infer consumer behaviour and to forecast  economic growth.   • Species selectivity can be further imp roved with AI.   • AI systems aimed at automated species forecasting and detection, identification and  sizing of catches could allow improving fishing decisions and enable quota tracking.   • AI, similarly to digitalisation, is likely  to create new skilled jobs while decreasing the need  for low skilled ones in the fisheries sector, as observed in other sectors .  • A more digitalis ed and AI -based fisheries sector might attract new young talent, but it  competes against other industries with  higher incentives .  • Best practices guidelines for different fisher ies sectors are commonly used by  management organi sations to increase their  sustainability and AI systems guidelines can  follow this example .  • Existing AI guidelines in other sectors can prov ide a basis to develop AI guidelines for  fisheries following the principles of lawfulness, human rights, responsibility,  transparency, sustainability,  and wellbeing.   • There are general AI groups and networks at the European level but lacking marine domain k nowledge to develop fisheries fit -for-purpose AI systems.  • There is at least one European working group focused on AI for fisheries and several  fisheries groups where AI has been discussed, but there is a shortage of sufficient  resources .

AI use to enhance traceability in seafood product trade across the  supply chain   This section focuses on the use of AI to enhance traceability in fish and seafood product trade across  all steps of the supply chain. The value chain (Fig ure 4) describes the full range of activities required to  bring a product or service from conception, through the different phases of production (involving a combination of physical transformation and the input of various producer services), and delivery to  final consumers: ‘ from sea to fork ’ (Rosales et al ., 2017) . Tracking of information in the fish food supply  chain is difficult but needed for consumer trust in compliance with high levels of food safety that  European legislation aims to achieve (Nicolae et al., 2017).  Figure 4: Simplified schema of the Fish Value Chain     Source: AZTI.   Knowledge of the origins of food  products  is important for public health reasons , and  because of  increasing people’s awareness and demand s relating to  environmental and social sustainability  aspects. Food traceability information  must be collected throughout the supply chain and be  registered on a platform external to all operators , but  available  to value chain operators , public health  authorities  and to customers for making  timely  decisions about the products with objective  information (Oliveira et al ., 2021).  The basic concept of traceability only includes the record and track  of necessary information in all value chain steps from procurement of raw materials and parts to  machining, assembly, distribution, and sales. However,  advances in  the data science allow more key  aspects to be included. For example , the use of AI in traceability covers  elements  like food integrity,  sustainability, processing, logistics and market (Fig ure 5).  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       56 Figure 5: Traceability aspects improvable by AI  systems     Source: AZTI.   The implementation of AI in fish chain traceability is driven  mainly by regulatory requirements, ICT Systems, assessment of product quality and improvement of sustainability (Haleem et al., 2019). There  is interest in obtaining certifications because they can provide competitive advantages and traceability  is a key element. The use of AI impacts traceability in the different steps of the value chain by means of  different tools and information that can be managed to improve the overall workflow and the ability  to track events with accuracy throughout all the stages. Traceability is a key requirement for trustful AI  systems in the supply chain  (Mora -Cantallops et al., 2021). T he evolution of the papers published in the  topic  of traceability in  combination with fisheries and/or AI keywords  show a  constant increase  (Figure 6). However,  only 100 publications  out of 1 ,600 refer to  traceability, and this number drops to 6  if the AI keyword  is added .     
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         57 Figure 6: Published paper s related to  fisheries , AI and traceability  keywords     Note: Right axe:  traceability; Left Axe: traceability combined with fish, fisheries &/or artificial intelligence.   Source: AZTI     4.1.1.  Chain sustainability   The implementation of AI could help to improve the social, environmental, and economic chain  sustainability level (Vinuesa et al., 2020). Chapter 3 provides several examples of AI systems helping  with sustainability improvement at the beginning of the chai n, for example in fisheries tracking,  catches monitoring, spotting illegal fishing, spatial planning, reducing fuel consumption and  associated emissions. However, different agents along the value chain also demand improvements in  sustainability for their p rocesses  (Tzachor , 2020 ).  4.1.2.  Seafood products  integrity   Food Integrity, f raud misidentification , and adulteration of food , whether intentional or not, are  concerns worldwide. The complex  organisation of the international fish supply and market  chain ,  makes it difficult  to prevent  counterfeiting and falsification of these products . Species identification is  an essential aspect to expose commercial fraud. However, many species cannot be easily identified  visually , and the development of fast and reliab le omics strategies and  AI has been attracting great  interest . Studies on methodologies for  fish and seafood authenticity  by food scientists have increased  considerably in recent years  (Ghidini et al ., 2019; Monteiro, 2021). Wang et al.  (2022)  presents a  literature review on ML applications for monitoring and predicting food safety  and references several  studies addressing  fish safety . Also, ML approach es in analysing bioaccumulation of pollutants in fish  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       58 tissues to effectively estimate tissue concentrations of heavy metals have been developed ( Petrea et  al., 2020) .  4.1.3.  Fish p rocessing and circular economy    The fish processing  industry has traditionally employed manual techniques in most of the steps in the  chain, which leads to inefficiencies and fluctuations in the quality of the final product and reductions  in economic sustainability. Seafood by -products are significant, constituting approximately 40 -60% of  the weight (Islam et al., 2021) and they have become an economic burden for fish industries. Cooney  et al. (2021) proposed a multi -criteria decision support tool employing ML techniques as a solution for  the sustainable production of fish feeds. Also, ML has been used during processing to detect bones in  fish products (Mery et al., 2011). Smart  machines (Elíasson, 2019) can avoid bone removal and cut fish  differently, depending on the quality of the fillets, keeping a good portion of the most expensive parts  instead of having to downgrade the whole defective part to a lower- cost product. Image a nalysis  combined with DL have been also used to help in the packaging stage (Xu et al., 2018). In Azadbakht  et al. (2017), an ANN was employed to predict the energy and exergy parameters applicable to seafood  processing .  In a circular economy, AI systems c an enable a transition of the production chain toward a low -waste  and resource- saving model, thus making companies more resilient (Uribe- Toril et al., 2022). There are  three main aspects where ML techniques can be applied (Akinodnd Oloruntoba, 2020): 1) design of  Circular Materials by using rapid ML -driven prototyping and testing; 2) operate Circular Business  Models with ML improving product circulation through intelligent demand prediction, pricing,  inventory management and predictive maintenance; and, 3) optimising Circular Infrastructure through  ML-based enhancement of components remanufacturing, products sorting and disassembling and  materials recycling (e.g. Pichara et al., 2021 ).  4.1.4.  Logistic aspects   The rapid growth in the volume of data generated in supp ly chain management systems has forced  companies to develop new technologies capable of interpreting large amounts of data in terms of storage, transport, risk assessment and supplier selection. AI methods are especially appropriate for  coping with this ma jor data- related challenge (Tirkolaee et al., 2021 ).  Traceability in the transport sector  refers to the ability to follow and monitor container movements  and trace back information from its internal and external environment. Stakeholders involved in multi modal shipment  agree on the need to develop tools for the container supply chain risk management  that enable  prompt actions if required . To achieve q uality  and safety of seafood during container multi modal shipment, supply chain management must fulfil fou r requirements: 1) control  the expeditions  by enabling the automatic exchange of tracking and monitoring data; 2)  generate alerts to warn supply  chain actors of abnormal events so that they can take prompt corrective actions; 3)  improve decision making thr ough an analysis of data collected during expeditions; and, 4) perform  predictive analysis to  detect hazards and to suggest avoidance plans dynamically.  ML approaches are widely used to  estimate travel and lead time (Dosdo ğru et al. , 2021;  Askin  et al., 2017) . In Alnahhal  et al. (2021) , the  dynamic weekly forecasting process for each customer order was  performed from the point of view of  the third -party logistics provider . Furthermore, in Atwani et al. (2020)  a neural network  was applied to   setup  times, optimal lot- size across SC processes, and required inventory levels to demand and  production planning .  Risk assessment  is a crucial step for identifying risks presented by supply chain partners who can have  a significant impact on a company’s abili ty to achieve its production targets.  ML and big data analytics 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         59 have also been utilized to deal with risk assessment s. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are among the  most used ML techniques that have shown a good  potential in accurately model ling risk assessment s  (Tirkolaee et al., 2021) . For example , Bruzzone & Orsoni  (2003)  employed an ANNs to calculate the  expected costs and risks of production losses and compare d them  with another methodology based  on simulation , high lighting the better performance  of AI .  Supplier selection  is the most important stage of the purchasing activity  (Pang et al.,  2017) . Due to  the fundamental role played by suppliers in time, costs , and quality, supply chain managers typically   dedicate  much of their effort in the supplier  selection process.  In Zhao  and Yu ( 2011),  an ANNs  was  used  to solve the key problems of the Case Based Reasoning system of supplier selection. Thanks to its  strong self -adaptability, the ANNs improve d the accuracy of updating phases and the efficiency of the  decision -making in the companies’ process of supplier selection. Bayesian learning was applied  in Chen   et al. ( 2009 ) to evaluate the suppliers ’ reliability and to show that, although several parame ters were  not considered, the model remain ed flexible and can be even further improved by including those   other variables.   Storage  accounts for  significant  costs of the  supply chain management , averaging  15% -35% of their  total business value per year  (Tirkolaee et al., 2021) . Supply chain inventory management seeks to  decrease costs, increase product variety, and improve customer service as well. However, precisely  estimating, predicting, and accessing the information by traditional decision rules is ha rd because the  uncertainty associated with this information is usually high according to the experience of inventory  managers. In recent years, the inefficiency of traditional methods in facing uncertainty has led  researchers to apply AI  for better results . For example, ML tools can detect in detail patterns in  warehouse datasets. Gumus et al. (2010)  applied neural networks to lead -time forecasting , resulting in   inventory management performance improvement . In Tan et al. (2020)  neural networks  were used to  predict storage time of glazed frozen squids and Loisel  et al. ( 2021)  presented  several ML techniques  for detecting frozen chain breaks . All the studies cited in that work demonstrate that ML can be applied  to estimate the temperature distrib ution inside a pallet in several stages of the cold chain. However,  obtaining high -precision predictions for the temperature distribution in a pallet using a limited number  of temperature sensors was  a challenge for ML , highlighting the need for high data quality and quantity  to feed AI systems.  4.1.5.  Market aspects   The fresh fish market  has experienced  significant changes and new trends are emerging  (EU, 2020) .  This  is of particular interest to international  researchers for political and economic reasons. Market   aspects deal main ly with consumer need/ behaviour , policies and product  import/export  where quality  and customer service are valued under the constraints of acceptable costs .  Consumer behaviour  is a determining factor for fishery and distributor operations. Consumers make  buying decisions based on market conditions and on various attributes of the product such as the species, the place of purchase/catch, the size and quality (Al -Mazrooei et al., 2011). The high amount of  data generated by consumers in the form of purchase choices, reviews, ratings, and comments can be exploited by using ML (Shrirame et al., 2020). Passos (2019) carried out an in- depth study on consumer  behaviour related to fresh fish. This behaviour was defined through a series of critical variables such as  the frequency and value spent, the adherence to promotions, the relative consumption of different species of fish, the type of fish (farmed or wild), and even the relationships among the various products  in the shopping cart. The results emphasized not only the clear differences among groups of fresh fish  buyers, but also their preferences. In Petrea et al. (2020) three time series algorithms were used to  forecast fish consumption. The preferences in association with the socio -economic characteristics of 
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       60 the consumers were considered to assess how they would influence the intention to buy these  products in the future. Origin and traceability of fish products were particularly relevant. The analyses  of socio- demographic characterist ics revealed the emergence of new types of consumer preferences .  Public policy  plays a major role in realising a sustainable fishery. However, there is a major gap in  research on policy interventions that promote AI use for sustainable fishery systems (Ebrahimi et al.,  2021). Fish detection and counting are crucial for policy formulation to effectively control fish  harvesting and prevent stock depletion (see Chapter 2 of this study). However, only one of the reviewed articles (Fanelli et al., 2020) touc hes upon policies such as the Blue Growth call, which points at AI as a  tool to strengthen the marine industry and support the global monitoring of the marine environment .  Trade factors  (Import/exports ) are important ingredients for the analysis of economi c growth. There  have been s everal attempts to link trade factors and economic growth. However, formulating models  capable of capturing the effect of import/exports on economic growth is a complex task. Countries with high incomes tend to trade more,  even t hough incomes may not be due to trade. Thus, it is crucial  to find more advanced algorithms for the prediction of economic growth rate in relation to trade, imports , and exports. For example, Feng & Zhang ( 2014)  employed  an ANN for economic growth  forecast ing and Sokolov -Mladenović  et al. (2016)  used another ANN to overcome the problem  associated with economic growth forecasting high nonlinearity based on trade.   4.2. The use of AI to develop and use more selective gears and fishing  techniques    Fishing selectivity is the ability to target and capture fish by species, size, or sex (or any combination of  these) during harvesting operations, allowing all unwanted catch to be released unharmed or not be  caught at all. The selection process begins when searching for fish and continues when fish accessible  to the gear are caught or not. Then the fish that encounter the gear are either retained or they escape  whilst in the water, and the final selection process takes place once the gear has been recovered and  brought on deck. There, fishers decide whether the fish should be landed or discarded. Fish discards  refer to the portion of a catch of fish which is not retained onboard during fishing operations and is returned to the sea. In EU waters, for example, fisher ies activities are quota regulated and subject to  the LO (CFP). The LO means a step forward in resource sustainability but imposes a challenge for  managers and industry (Catchpole et al., 2017). Different fishing gears and fishing strategies lead to  incide ntal fishing a variety of species of non- target species (bycatch) with complex trade- offs (Oliver et  al., 2015; Hazen et al., 2018 ).  Traditionally, to address different regulation challenges, fishers and scientists have focused on selective  fishing gear development, by physical gear modifications to influence the targeting and sorting  process. Nowadays EU vessels operating in EU waters are starting to improve their selective  performance by adjusting where, when, and how they fish. However, commercial fishing is still today a relative “blind process” where operational decisions are based on catch compositions from the last  haul. This implies that fishers obtain too little information too late, resulting in a limited control over  the catch process. Additionall y, a single fishing operation may represent a four to eight hour process  with undetermined fuel consumption, which can have important consequences in time and money invested if there is a poor catch of target species. Fishers lack efficient decision making  tools to better  control the catch composition that is taken on board. The fishing sector would benefit from  improvements in fishing precision (species and sizes selectivity), ecosystem impact mitigation (development of lower impact and efficient gear), fu el consumption and CO2 emission reduction and  an increase in regulation compliance. Therefore, a fisher should be able to monitor or even better 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         61 forecast the following information: 1) the target species fishing ground areas; and 2) the species and  sizes be ing caught.   4.2.1.  AI for forecasting and planning activities   The fishing industry is starting to utilize  Earth Observation data to characterize environmental  conditions of marine areas to geolocate high -quality fishing grounds with less effort (i.e., for minimiz ing  time, fuel, and costs). For example, high digitali sation of  purse seiner  tuna vessels can help with data  availability (McCauley et al., 2016). However, due to the large volume, diversity of sources and quality  of recorded data, they are sparsely tapped  into  for further analysis and remain intact and unstructured ,  thus requiring lots of resources for real -time analysis. Big data processing techniques, enhanced by ML  methods, can increase the value of such unexploited data and their  applicability to socie ty, industry,  and management challenges. ML has already started to prove its potential in marine sciences applied  to fisheries forecasting (Fernandes et al., 2010; 2013; 2015). Other tools such as optimization heuristics,  designed in recent years to optimi ze their routes (Groba et al., 2015; 2018; 2020; Granado et al., 2021 )  or Species Distribution Models to assist the fishing industry optimizing distribution for catches (Breece  et al., 2021; Dolder et al., 2018; Stock et al., 2020), have shown to be promis ing tools for dynamic ocean  management. These tools enable more efficient adaptation to changing biological, oceanographic, or  economic conditions and are faster than traditional, static, time -area closures (Breivik et al. 2016; Dunn  et al. 2016; Howell et  al. 2008,  2015). Despite recent AI fishery -specific developments  (e.g., SusTunTech  H2020 project82), the AI implementation in the fishing industry is behind  other shipping sectors, both  in state -of-the-art and day to day applications  (Christiansen et al., 2004 ; Agra et al., 2015).   4.2.2.  AI for improving timely observation and catch monitoring   In-trawl camera systems are being introduced in several fisheries (Rosen and Holst, 2013; Mallet and  Pelletier, 2014; Underwood et al. , 2015; Williams et al. , 2016; DeCelles et al. , 2017) . However, these  systems have been used for scientific monitoring purpose s only  without  the operational use of AI  systems. The developed catch monitoring methods are associated with extensive storage and manual  processing of video rec ordings (Needle et al., 2015). To become an efficient decision support tool, these  systems require automated processing of the data. Recently, this automated processing has become  more common in various industries, and fisheries are no exception. Several s tudies describe automated  fish detection and classification commonly performed with the aid of DL  model application (Allken et  al., 2019, 2021; Christensen et al. , 2019 ; French et al. , 2020; Garcia et al. , 2020; Lekunberri et al., 202 1;  Sokolova et al. , 2021a,b; Tseng and Kuo, 2020).   These studies demonstrate that the DL  models for object detection and classification are efficient tools  for processing the on -board (French et al., 2020; Khokher et al., 2021) and  the underwater collected  catch recordings (Christensen et al., 201 9; Sokolova et al., 2021a ,b). Underwater video recordings are  often challenged by poor visibility conditions, especially in demersal trawls, for which technological advances supporting AI development will still be required (Sokolova  et al., 2021b). In this area , 3D  camera systems employing methods such as stereo imaging (Fisher et al., 2013; Rosen and Holst, 2013) or ‘time of flight’ (time taken for a light pulse to reach the object and return) developed in the Utofia  H2020 project 83, may soon permit fish position and size capture  even in turbid environments.   Recent studies have developed algorithms applicable to  AI automated data processing that would  allow  near real -time observation  (e.g., H2020 projects SmartFish84 and DeepVision85). Present and                                                                82 https://www.sustuntech.eu/   83 https://www.utofia.eu/   84 http://smartfishh2020.eu/   85 https://www.deepvision.no/  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       62 future work includes embedding these  algorithm s in portable hardware for practical use and exploring  the possibilities for automated catch measurements. Nowadays, these AI tools still require long  distance wired communication s from the vessel t o collect data, which can be difficult to handle,  especially in deep sea fisheries, and are more expensive. Therefore, further work should also focus  on  developing wireless communication systems (e.g., acoustic s).  4.2.3.  AI for timely  operational decision -making   Advances in AI image analysis, with  ML and other techniques will allow real -time species identification  and automatic analysis of acquired images, permitting the skipper or a control system to make real time fishing activity decisions. These could be as si mple as deciding to continue or stop fishing, based  on observations of what  type of  fish are present in the fishing  ground or enter  their gear. Alternatively,  they could be used in conjunction with remotely controllable selectivity instruments that, for ex ample,  in the case of trawl gears, open/close the codend  at the end of the net  or operate flaps/doors that direct  fish into different compartments.   The AI systems could be trained to  control other stimuli; for example, to remotely switch lights on/off  to attract/repel species (e.g.,  SmartFish H2020 project86), or control pulse s and  hydrojet s (Jordan et al.,  2013) . AI can also be applied in sail drones  that assist fishing fleets . During  fishing opera tions, skippers   can detect pelagic fish in the water column by employing  the on- board echo sounder o f the fishing  vessel. However, to date the se echo sounder s lack  the ability  to produce informa tion or  parameterization of the distribution of  fish species present , estimated bycatch  and potential discard  rates  (Christensen et al., 2019). Autonomous vehicles combined with AI methods have the potential to  search for biomass, register species and size that  would directly  inform fishers to substantially improve  selectivity.  Transforming the current blind/semi -blind fishing process into a  more  informed process will  improve the sustainability of commercial fisheries both in economic and ecological terms. F ishing only   when the availability and catch composition is favourable  will lead to increase d catch efficiency,  reduced  fuel consumption, and minimized  seabed impact s (of those fishing gears interacting  with the  bottom ). Besides, full visualization of the catching process could also highlight f isheries/areas/periods  in which selective gear use is most needed and therefore, target the development and optimization of  selective fishing gear for hotspot areas and seasons.  As a final consideration, fishing activity is nowadays mainly regulated through technical measures  (Regulation (EU) No 2019/1241), which set out rules on how, where, when, which and how many marine  biological resources  can be caught in EU waters to conserve target species and protect marine  ecosystems. However, the performance of a fishing gear depends on the structure of the fished  population, the Minimum Conservation Reference Size, the TAC, etc. that can vary inter- annually.  Decision -making on technical regulations usually entails a slow and inflexible process . Full near real time documentation on catches or control on what can be caught by the fishing gear should lead to a more immediate, flexible , and dynamic application of conservation measures and decrease fisher  opposition to regulations .   4.3. AI as a driving f orce for young people to look for jobs in fisheries   This study also examines AI as a driving force for young people to seek jobs in the fisheries sector.  Employment in the fisheries sector is a subject close to the heart of the European Parliament . For  example,  the European Parliament resolution ‘Fishers for the Future: attracting a new generation of  workers for the fishing industry and generating employment in the coastal communities’                                                                86 http://smartfishh2020.eu/  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         63 (2019/2161(INI) adopted in September 2021. The European Parliament stresses that improving fishers’  living standards, with better working and safety conditions, is one of the elements to attract young  people and achieve the generational renewal (point 24). The European Parliament also affirms that  appropriate and specific educ ation and training are essential to encourage young people to  perpetuate coastal fishing activities and traditions (point 47). It encourages the creation of an association of young European fishers to promote the generational renewal of the fisheries secto r  (point 48) and welcomes the financial support from 2021 -2027 EMFAF to support young people (point  97). In addition, the European Parliament underlines that the actions to attract young people to fishing  activity must ensure gender balance and consider the role of women in the entire fishing industry  (point 61) .  Fishing activities are hard due to the often- long periods at sea separated from family and friends,  intense physical demands, and safety risks. These conditions make this sector unattractive to y ounger  generations and there is now a high demand for a new specialized workforce. Some of these historical  issues are improving due to technological improvements. For example, a growing number of ship owners are installing computer systems and faster internet connection onboard to guarantee access to internet and social media, so fishers can communicate regularly with family and friends. On the other  hand, there are applications focused on fishing efficiency that contribute to reduced time spent at sea  (e.g., faster fishing trips). In addition, considering the meteorological conditions among other factors, there are AI -based applications that investigate reducing the energy consumption and time at sea and  increase safety (e.g., alert of dangerous weather co nditions). These are examples of technological  applications, potentially improvable with AI, that could contribute to reduce the hardship of the job  and make this sector more attractive to young people interested in technical and computing skills.  Moreover, moving towards more autonomous fishing vessels would lead to reorganisation of jobs in  the industry, requiring less people working onboard at sea and more in land supporting with technical  and AI skills. Displacement of labour from the vessel to the offi ce in the fishing sector can be beneficial  from a human safety, health, or well -being perspective (e.g., lower risk of injuries, more time with  family). However, establishing inter-  and multi -disciplinary research teams is difficult, but it can also  help a ttract talented young people looking to cooperate in a thriving work environment that covers  multifaceted aspects (Haapasaari et al., 2012). Modernising fisheries with the introduction of new technologies, such as AI, with their increasing appeal for the y ounger population, will help make the  fishing industry more attractive to the next generations. In recent times, new generations of skippers  for example are more accustomed to novel technologies such as high- tech sonars, radars, echo sounders, oceanographi c software, etc. (Lopez et al., 2014). Younger fishers with skills in modern fishing  technology are highly valued by fishing companies, especially in modern industrial fleets due to their  increasing reliance on these technological aids .  As fishing technolo gy, assisted by AI, continues to advance towards vessels requiring less onboard crew  (e.g., fishers) and relies more on assistance by highly skilled land -based staff, this could attract younger  generations who are interested in the technological world. The International Maritime Organization  (IMO) has analysed the use of maritime autonomous surface ships (MASS) as a key strategy direction to integrate new and advancing technologies in the regulatory framework. The IMO defines autonomy for vessels in four ascending categories, from the first category (ship with automated processes and  decision support) to the fourth category (fully autonomous) corresponding to vessels with AI systems.  This involves balancing the benefits derived from new technologies against safety and security concerns, the impact on the environment, the potential costs for the industry and their impact on personnel, both on board and ashore. In this regard, the IMO has recently finalized a legislative scoping  exercise encompassing an extensi ve range of issues, such as the human element, safety, security,  liability and compensation for damage, interactions with ports, pilotage, responses to incidents and 
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       64 protection of the marine environment. There are other aspects of concern with regards to t he use of  MASS, including the clarification of the meaning of terms like ‘master’, ‘crew’ or ‘responsible person’ in  different degrees of autonomy (remotely controlled ship, fully autonomous ship). The IMO considers  that the best way to address the legal i ssues raised by MASS is by developing a specific legal framework,  the ‘MASS Code’, that is expected to be completed in 2025 .  Finally, these analyses will help to provide good practice recommendations on the use of AI in fisheries  during these key early sta ges of their emerging application within the fisheries field. Socialization of  the best practices among fishing communities, industry and fisheries managers will help raise  awareness amongst these key stakeholders as to the benefits of the adequate and fai r use of these  tools. This can generate acceptance and appreciation of the positive results of AI technology in their daily work. These sets of guidelines will also identify poor AI technology practices which can potentially prevent or deter future AI developers from its misuse and help protect the rights of those involved in fisheries activities. These AI good practices agreed among fisheries participants will form a first  blueprint on which future recommendations can be incorporated as the state of this t echnology and  its applications in fisheries inevitably develop over time in the coming years. There is generally still a  slow formalized integration of science, regulatory authorities, and the fishing industry. AI tools can help to build trust among fisher s, scientists and society through neutral and impartial decision -making  processes based on quality data. Results from several recent studies hint at the potential benefits of using AI for social good, specially related to agriculture in developed countries .   4.3.1.  Theoretical and empirical evidence in the economy   The digitalisation processes in the economies have shown that while high skilled jobs increased, low skill ones decreased (Balsmeier & Woerter, 2019). Although there could be an initial labour saving,  markets have the potential to compensate it through higher levels of productivity that lead to induce  lower prices and higher quantity demand which at the end increases the labour demand of firms. AI is  not different from the general aspects of digitali sation explained above. However, collaborative AI  (when both agents – human and machine-  are autonomously contributing to solve a single problem)  can make low skilled workers focus on tasks where they have comparative advantages over machines,  increasing the individual productivity of workers (Qaiser et al., 2020). Fisheries can be an example  where collaborative AI can help in predicting patterns while fishers can take advantage of these  automatic predictions to catch their quotas and reduce working time or fuel  consumption (Fernandes  et al., 2021). This collaborative AI, with modern technologies, which assists in improved fishing yields,  can also boost recruitment of young(er) fishers to cover the existing scarcity of labour renewal in the fisheries sector. Whil e women play a prominent role in the fisheries sector around the world 87, their  contribution is still overlooked (Harper et al., 2017; Gopal et al., 2020). In a world in which the working  lives of women will be affected by AI ( Collett et al. , 2022), AI coul d also help  to empower women  in the  fishery sector. Furthermore, this would be  critical to avoid gender -biased AI systems (Leavy, 2018).    Examples from aquaculture  show a trend of increased AI applications  in this sector  and has attracted  some start- up firms88. Expansion of aquaculture can increase through help of novel emerging  technologies which have the potential to revolutionize this industry. These technologies include  robotics, information/digital technologies, offshore farming, RAS, replacement of fish meal and oils  with alternative proteins and fish oil, and oral vaccines. These technologies will also generate opportunities for businesses and jobs, including opportunities for women and younger people. However,  some of these new technologies may gen erate barriers for small/family -based fish farmers,                                                                87 https://www.europarl.europa.eu/EPRS/TD_Women_in_fisheries.pdf   88 https://www.aitrends.com/ai -and-business- strategy/ai -applied -to-aquaculture -aims -for-improved -efficiency -healthier -fish/  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         65 who lack financial resources to adopt them  (Yue, 2021).  Although it is still in the ‘proof’ of concept  stage, the Kindai University Aquaculture Research Institute (Shirahama, Wakayama Prefecture), Toyota  Tsusho Corporation (Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture) and Microsoft Japan (Minato, Tokyo) have collaborated  to develop a new aquaculture selection system  to automate the manual process for selecting  fingerling s for cultivation.  Some evidence in other non- EU Member States show how AI reduces the  average age of the aquafarm workers. This is the case in the South Korean aquaculture industry89.  Valuable skills are not always transmitted to young generations, and in this case,  AI can help to collect  and reproduce them.  For example, the ‘tuna scope’  app  in Japan90 evaluates the quality of tuna at the  selling point.  4.3.2.  AI based products in the maritime sector   The offer of AI products for the maritime sector has increased  in the last decade  as shown in the creation  by Lloyds Register (LR) of its Artificial Intelligence Register91. This is  a standardized digital register of LRcertified AI suppliers and solutions, which is the first of its kind for the maritime industry. The  applications range from digital tw ins, virtual commissioning, and autonomous navigation systems. To  support this uptake in technology, LR’s AI Register has been developed to signpost proven and reliable AI technology to help maritime stakeholders benefit from the latest applications. Each AI solution  introduced in  the LR AI Register will be categorised against their LR certification status, such as Digital  Twin Ready, Digital Twin Approved, Digital Twin Commissioned and Digital Twin Live from LR’s ShipRight Digital Compliance framework. The  AI Register will also provide details about what each  specific solution offers, such as key business benefits, target applications, functions, and performance.   The AI providers currently listed in LR’s AI Register include international firms such as Furun o, HAT  Analytics, Korea Shipbuilding & Offshore Engineering (KSOE), Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI), Hyundai  Heavy Industries (HHI) and ZhenDui Industrial Artificial Intelligence (ZDIAI). At present, v irtually all AI  solutions proposed by these companies are digital twins dedicated to ship failure prediction and  anomaly detection, only one of the products in this register  is dedicated to route optimization.   Outside of standardized services, there is a growing number of companies dedicated to offering AI base d solutions to companies in the maritime sector, but most of them focus on two problems, the  prediction of ship arrivals, which is important for the management of commercial ports, or the  calculation of optimal routes between ports to minimize time or fuel  consumption and weather  associated risks.  Most of the companies offering these AI products are small start -ups or spinoffs of  bigger companies, this being one of the typical characteristics of an emerging market.  4.3.3.  AI based products in fisheries and fisheries science   The search for similar AI solutions used specifically in the fisheries  sector  gave almost no  results when  searching for industrial products developed for fishers , only some vague claims of AI -based bird  detection by two radar manufacturers.  In comparison, the number of AI solutions being used in  fisheries monitoring and fisheries studies by the scientific community is quickly increasing  as shown in  Chapter 3 . The bibliographic review by Honarmand Ebrahimi et al. (2021) shows that interest in using  AI tools for fisheries research has increased drastically, as exemplified by the eight -fold increase in  fisheries AI papers published between 2011 and 2020. When Beyan and Browman (2020) asked for contributions for a special themed issue by the IC ES Journal of Marine Science the main topics  forwarded were:                                                                 89 https://www.ajudaily.com/view/20201216100927147   90 https://www.theverge.com/21318402/japanese -app -ai-grade -fish-quality -tuna -scope -sushi   91 https://www.lr.org/en/ai -register/ai -solutions/  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       66 • Automatic marine ecosystem monitoring based on visual and/or acoustic data .  • Automatic fish detection .  • Automatic coral reef state detection (e.g. , health, dead/alive).   • Underwater measurement of fish length .  • Automatic fish counting, for example to analyse the effect of global warming.   • Automatic fish tracking (e.g. , swimming speeds and trajectories).   • Automatic fish species classification/recognition/identification .  • Characterizing interactions between fish (e.g. , predator –prey relationships) .  • Fine- grained automatic object recognition in underwater visual data (e.g. , substrate  classification, plankton) .  • Applications of block chain technology/systems.   • Automatic detection/classification of acoustics produced by marine animals (e.g. , whales,  dolphins, and fish).   • Automatic systems for fisheries management.   These research topics fit very well into the research agenda proposed by Ebrahimi et al. (2021). Both  Honarmand Ebrahimi  et al. (2021) and Fosso  Wamba  et al. (2020) found that academic interest in AI inspired fishery literature focuses mostly on automation of fishery resources monitoring, while up till  now, key issues in AI development for fishers’ needs and policy responses by governments have received limited attention .  4.4. Best practices of the use of AI in the fisheries sector in the EU or  worldwide    In this section good practices in fisheries are introduced and good practices for AI are revised to  understand their applicability to fisheries.   4.4.1.  Fisheries good practices   Fishing practices develop through a combination of social, economic, environmental, and regulatory  factors operating in each fishery. To achieve sustainable fisheries outcomes local, national, and international management bodies like RFMOs a dopt conservation measures that set out to protect  stocks from overexploitation and mitigate ecosystem impacts, while achieving Maximum Sustainable Yields (Gilman et al., 2011; 2014). Numerous institutional measures establish best practices on aspects such  as stock exploitation limits, vulnerable species bycatch release methods, marine po llution   prevention or aquaculture standards. One of the better- known best practice guidelines is FAO’s Code  of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (FAO, 1995), on which many regional and international fishing  regulation principles are based. These user guidelines were defined mostly in a top -down fashion by  fisheries management bodies, in which operational requirements were defined with little consultation  with the fishing ind ustry. This non -inclusive approach has led in some instances to poor application  and compliance of regulations by fishers who feel excluded from decision- making processes (Kirby and  Ward, 2014; Barz et al., 2020).   In recent years, the role of fishing indus try in the development of better practices has been  instrumental thanks to joint collaborative efforts with other stakeholders like scientists and NGOs  (Poisson et al, 2016; Österblom et al., 2017; Koehler, 2020; Murua et al, 2021b;). This proactive role o f  the fishing industry has been partly instigated by growing consumer and market pressures to deliver sustainable seafood (i.e., eco -certified products) (Adolf et al., 2016). For instance , the Global Seafood  Alliance has set best practices in aquaculture i ndustry standards covering the whole production chain 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         67 from farm to factory92. Another example  is the International Seafood Sustainability Foundation (ISSF),  a global coalition of fisheries scientists and industry members (https://www.iss- foundation.org/), w hich  has been developing best practice guidelines on non -entangling and biodegradable fish aggregating  devices (FADs) that minimize environmental impacts (e.g ., reduce shark bycatch and marine pollution)  (ISSF, 2019)  while advocating for their implementati on. Other guidelines for new fisheries -related  technologies such as EM systems are also being developed (Restrepo et al., 2018; Murua et al., 2020).  The guidelines are living documents which are reviewed regularly and updated when considered  necessary. Some best practices are self -imposed by the fishing industry  (e.g., Codes of Best Practices  adopted by the EU tuna purse seiner fleet; Grande et al., 2020; Maufroy et al., 2020), and have been  gradually taken up by RFMOs as part of a bottom -up process. Sin ce fishers and industry were actively  part of the solution from the early stages of setting best practices, the acceptance and implementation  of such guidelines have been faster and more implementable thanks to the acquired sense of  stewardship (Murua et a l., 2017; Restrepo et al., 2019). The benefits of fishing industry stakeholder  inclusiveness in cooperation processes for setting better sustainability standards has been reported in  many cases (Johnson and van Densen, 2007; Stephenson et al., 201 8). In re cent times, institutions, such  as the EU, have also tried to increase fisheries stakeholder representation in decision- making processes  (Aanesen et al., 2014; Linke et al., 2020). Nevertheless, not all best practices can be left in the hands of industry, a nd other stakeholders like fisheries scientists and managers should play a part. This might be  the case with the incorporation of novel technologies, where fishers lack technical expertise in the field .  Guidelines and recommendations for best practices hav e been developed in many fisheries, from  small- scale to large scale (Lodge et al., 2007; Rocliffe, 2018; Westlund and Zelasney, 2019; March et al.,  2022) and aimed towards different stakeholders including fishers, scientists, and managers. These guidelines  cover many aspects (e.g., bycatch mitigation, fishing effort, gear selectivity, marine  pollution, social ethics, etc.) across the principal fisheries such as trawling (Grieve et al., 2015;  McConnaughey et al., 2020), longline (Løkkeborg , 2011; Bealey, 2021) or purse seine (Hutchinson et al.,  2017; Pacifical, 2021). Similarly, ethically, and ecologically sound practice guidelines promoting  sustainable actions exist for the aquaculture industry (Tucker and Hargreaves , 2008; Kamaruddin et al.,  2015). This sho ws how the production of best practice guidelines is a general feature across the fishing  and aquaculture sector and could provide a reference point for the development of AI guidelines .  4.4.2.  The EM example of  digitalis ation  good practices in f isheries   Fisheries monitoring programs are essential for effective management of marine resources, but are very costly due to the need for skilled human observers and are not exempt from errors (Duparc et al.,  2019). EM (Ruiz et al., 2015; Gilman et al., 2019) . Programs enhanced with automatic species  identification (Lekunberri et al., 2021) are of growing interest for industry and managers. EM is a proven technology for fisheries monitoring that has been widely tested and continues to grow, primarily in industrial fleets but with potential applications in smaller vessels. It provides a good example of  development that could be useful for AI systems good practice development. An effective EM system should meet several requirements (i.e., Minimum Standards) to guarant ee quality and consistency  across vendors. All tuna RFMOs have engaged in recent years in the definition and implementation of  these minimum standards, with different progress among RFMOs. In the Pacific (WCPFC and IATTC)  draft standards have been prepared  for the longline and purse seine fisheries, while in the Atlantic  (ICCAT) and Indian (IOTC) oceans, minimum standards for the purse seine fishery have been preliminary adopted by the Commission (Ruiz et al., 2016; Ruiz et al., 2017; Román et al., 2020; ER andEMWG4, 2020) .                                                                92 https://www.bapcertification.org/Standards  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       68 Several EM practices are in place in New Zealand, where invasion of privacy  is one of the main concerns  raised by fishers. These concerns are addressed by conducting monitoring in vessel areas where only  fishing -related activities take pla ce. EM footage is recorded electronically and automatically encrypted .  Therefore, only authorised staff can access the footage . This footage allows dolphin interactions with  vessels and gears to be identified. A sample of this footage is also reviewed to v erify species fish catch  composition. The information collected is then compared to fishers' reports. The MPI conducts an impact assessment to identify risks to privacy. Owners and skippers are involved in the process of  installation to guarantee full tran sparency in decisions about location of cameras to ensure that the  video footage  concerns only fishing activities. The MPI aims to install cameras in more than 300 vessels  by 2024, which represents around 85% of the catches starting in late 2022. A vast co nsultation process  about the wider application of EM took place between October 2021 and December 2021. Hence, a wide array of stakeholders had the opportunity to provide insights on the technical and management aspects of this proposal (New Zealand Fisher ies, 2021). A tendering process will likely take place to call  for expressions of interest concerning AI systems able to analyse the EM footage 93.  In the US, EM was first employed in 2015 in the pelagic longline fishery to monitor bluefin tuna bycatch.  EM is currently in place in at least 113 fishing vessels  (EDF, 2020). The use of EM was expanded to US   tuna longliners  under the purview of ICCAT to evaluate whether the shortfin mako  shark was released  alive . It is expected that EM could provide evidence to reopen fisheries currently closed due to  conservation issues. In 2011, a 100% monitoring at sea was implemented in the Pacific ground fisheries.  In 2015, EM arose as an alternative to full observer coverage. Video review and storage is carried out by  National Fisheries Marine Service (NFMS). The system introduces the ‘third -party scheme’ which  consists in the certification of the providers of hardware, software, installations, etc. These providers have to submit a plan to NFMS to describe how they will prov ide NFMS with the information necessary  for fisheries management. Similarly, to the observer program, the industry will be required to outsource  the services through private certified providers. In turn, fishers must prepare a plan for the use of the  EM sy stem onboard and obtain certification and guarantee complete identification of catch,  continuous vessel location monitoring, recording of any haul, set, or discard event, prevention of radio  frequency interference, etc. Consultation is taking place and the program is expected to be fully  operative by January 2024 (NOAA, 2021).   At the EU level, the European Fisheries Control Agency published in 2019 sets out guidelines and  specifications for the implementation of r emote Electronic Monitoring (EM) in EU fishe ries (EFCA, 2019).  Meant as a guidance document for Member States, it describes minimum technical requirements and  standards for EM systems which could be used as a tool to monitor and document compliance with the  CFP, and specifically compliance with the LO. Similarly, in 2021 UNE, the Spanish standardization body  at the national level, published the UNE 195007:2021. This standard establishes the requirements and  technical conditions that must be meet when implementing an EM system in any fishing vessels g reater  than 12 m. This standard includes the characteristics that the equipment should meet, as well as the  requirements for all the operators involved in the electronic observation (fishing vessel owners,  technology companies that manufacture onboard equi pme nt and data analysis entities).  However,  these standards are not considering future use of AI in EM systems and they will need to be adapted .  Fortunately, there are AI good practices developed by AI experts that can be used to adapt fisheries  guidelines  (see next section).                                                                93 https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/124404842/ai -to-help -protect -endangered -marine -species- but-what -about -fishermens privacy  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         69 4.4.3.  AI good practices guidelines useful for development of AI good practices in  fisheries   Policy makers should  not leave  loopholes  in regulations that allow undesirable  industry  actions   (Rosenberg and Glass, 2007). For this reason, it is h ighly recommended that AI best practice guidelines  are established in a cooperative and transparent manner between industry, regulators, and the  scientific community to set the minimum standards in these early phases of technological adoption. It  appears t hat successful AI guidelines across many sectors share common ethical traits such as  transparency, fairness, responsibility, good faith, trust , and sustainability ( HLEG -AI, 2019; Ryan & Stahl,  2020; Leimanis & Palkova, 2021;  Makarov  et al ., 2021;  Stix, 2021)  where the following principles and  good practices have been identified:   • AI should be lawful: well- thought out current and future regulations should be established.   • AI should respect human autonomy: AI systems should allow for human oversight, allowing for  monitoring of results accuracy and termination. Consequently, the outcome of AI decisions  should be reversible. Accountability strategies should be created within companies and individuals should have the possibility to lodge complaints and request j ustifications on the  results from  AI system s.  • AI should prevent harm: AI should preserve the quality, integrity, and privacy of the data.   • AI should be fair: all affected stakeholders through the AI system life cycle need to be taken into consideration and  be allowed to participate .   • AI should not discriminate: all stakeholders have equal access and treatment without  discrimination against individuals or groups of individuals. There should be steps to ensure that  data used by AI is not unfair, or contains bias, errors or inaccuracies t hat can lead to  discrimination.   • AI should ensure human rights: developers and organisational users should ensure that AI does  not infringe on human rights by ensuring their technology’s safety.   • AI should protect integrity: not only physical, but also mental integrity, personal and cultural  sense of identity, and satisfaction of people ´s essential needs.   • AI with clear use requirements : users need to be notified so they know they are not interacting  with another human being .  • AI should protect d emocratic values : which  should not be jeopardised as a result of AI use, and  citizens should receive accurate and impartial information without interference or  manipulation for political purposes.   • AI should empower and benefit individuals: p roviding equal opportunities while distributing  the rewards from its use in a fair and equitable manner.   • AI should be harmless : designed with the intent of not doing foreseeable harm to human  beings   • AI responsibilities should be defined: where developers and users are responsible for  errors and  harm by AI. Therefore, there needs to be a clear and concise allocation of responsibilities to deal with harm when it occurs .  • AI should show transparency: technical as well as industry capacity and aims should be clearly  communicated.   • AI should be technically robust: having suitable fallback plans, reliability , and reproducibility.   • AI should be safe: where attacks against AI should not compromise the bodily and mental  integrity of people by ensuring the reliability and internal robustness of  the systems (fail  gracefully).  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       70 • AI systems should improve citizen s´ wellbeing: used to respect and better the q uality of the  lives of citizens   • AI should show accountability: i t should report potential negative impacts or trade -offs among  other good practices.   • AI should be designed to use little or no personal data: if required, then i t should be  anonymised, encrypted , and securely processed.  • AI should contribute to the environmental sustainability: contributing to resource efficiency,  mitigate emissions and the protection of biodiversity.   • At the core of any AI project should be high quality data that are well -understood, consistent  and use FAIR principles. Data should be  accurate, up- to-date , and fit -for-purpose . Models  should be published with code, training , and testing data  along with scientific results.   • Regarding AI safety protocols, a list of prohibited uses should be prepared, and a r isk  management system set in pla ce as a continuous iterative process through the AI system ’s  lifecycle.   • AI should protect d emocratic values , which  should not be jeopardised as a result of AI use, and  citizens should receive accurate and impartial information without interference or  manipulation for political purposes.   • In all cases AI models should be combined with human insight. Improving AI -related skill sets   among company member s is considered important.   4.5. Coordination at the EU level, such as working groups on AI   Several existing or recent working groups on ML and statistical approaches in fisheries and marine  sciences at EU and international level, where authors from this study have participated, have been analysed in the following lines to determine possible coordination needs at EU  level:  • ICES Working group on ML in Marine Science (WGMLEARN) is led by European organizations,  but has a major presence of North American members. This group has been quite active in the  last three years, holding two or three meetings per year. However, t he rotation of active  members has been high, resulting in a reduction of finalized outputs and variable interests of  the contributing members. This group has prepared an AI bibliographic database that is  regularly improved by members. This group is current ly preparing three scientific publications.  The group seems to be dominated by experts on image analysis and DL despite attempts to  have a broader coverage of expertise.  • The OCB Phytoplankton Taxonomy Working Group is a group leaded mainly by NASA and  WHOI  in North America. The aim of the group is to establish standards and best practices for  submitting taxonomic and morphological information for plankton collected by imaging instruments. The group was  very active until mid -2019 with a recent publication de fining  potential standards in 2021 (Neeley et al ., 2021).   • I/ITAPINA: Imagine/Imaging The Atlantic – A Pelagic Imaging Network Approach , is a recent ly  formed group led mainly by European institutions which has organized only a single event  in  mid -2021. This  group work appears  to focus more on the technical aspects of image acquisition  than on its potential later use by AI algorithms.   • NCAI Community of Practice , promoted by NOAA Cent re for Artificial Intelligence , is a  community led by the United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  (NOAA). The group also was  recent ly creat ed after  a workshop during 2021 and had an  event  scheduled for February 2022 . 
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         71 • ICES- FAO Working Group on Fishing Technology and Fish Behaviour (WG FTFB)  is a group with  a technological background that i s within the scope of the AI group in fisheries technology  despite it not being its principal focus.   • ICCAT: At least two AI studies have been presented and discussed in this forum. In a first study,  Uranga et al., (2017) used image analysis of fishers' sonar images and supervised classification  to provide data for abundance indices in combination with scientific surveys. In a second study  that has not yet been published, the use of AI for a Candidate Ma nagement Procedure was  attempted. The group expressed that there is potential in such developments, but there was  concern with the apparent black box nature of some of the AI methodologies .  • The main objective of ICES ACEGG working group is to evaluate and provide estimates for small  pelagic species  in ICES sub- Areas 6 -9. In relation to the acoustic methodology, multifrequency  acoustic studies have shown potential in continuous monitoring. Currently, it is possible to  discriminate acoustic scattering groups (as fish with swim bladders, fish without swim bladders,  and certain plankton groups) based on its acoustic properties, but visual interpretation or  scrutiny by experts is still widely extended. Currently, there are studies aiming to develop AI   classification models to identify the pelagic fish species e chotraces in the Bay of Biscay.   These relatively few AI working groups that specialise in fisheries reveal the need to coordinate efforts  and exchange ideas and experiences identified by the scientific commu nity in this emerging field.  However, these AI focused groups are in general poorly coordinated with a short supply of stable  members. These scientific groups mostly operate by experts giving their time as an in- kind contribution  or as part of ongoing proj ects that are using or developing AI or generating data that might be useful  in AI systems. These projects usually funded travelling for meetings and workshops, but lately with the  COVID situation these groups have been meeting remotely. This scarcity of s pecific funding hinders  the long -term commitment of their members and weakens the group’s outcomes. Many of the groups  have changing agendas and objectives depending on the interests of the principal coordinators. This  is likely exacerbated by the dominanc e of members with a particular AI -related skill set, but with a  sparsity of members with multidisciplinary skills. Despite all this, these groups are somewhat effective  at increasing the networking of people in the AI field, but on average they yield poorl y in terms of actual  developments and publications when compared with other working groups. This could be due to a  lack of AI expertise in fisheries and competition for AI experts with other industries that also demand  AI knowledge and are able to provide more interesting salaries and conditions (e.g., remote work and flexible timetables). Currently, AI experts are few and far between and AI experts with some fisheries  knowledge are even harder to find. While developing a simple AI proof -of-concept with som e example  data might not require deep understanding of fisheries, developing a trustworthy pilot that can be  tested in the real environment under commercial fishing conditions requires a deep knowledge of  fisheries. This includes understanding all the comp lexities, limitations, and realities of fishing activities  to produce realistic outputs. Moreover, possibly highly technical experts are unlikely to be skilled or  interested in writing project proposals or engaging in the long -term process associated with the  involvement in these fisheries scientific groups .  Other AI groups of international reference that do  not focus on fisheries or marine science have been  identified:   • High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG). The AI HLEG is an independent  expert group that was set up by the European Commission  in June 2018. A first draft of this  document was released on 18 December 2018, together with the first draft  of the AI HLEG's  Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI. Its work has helped the AIA proposal formulation. It is not  a fisheries, marine,  or environmental focus group.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Structural and Cohesion Policies       72 • The European AI Alliance94 is a platform for providing feedback to AI HLEG, to share AI  documents and events. There were  two major events in June 2019 and October 2020.   • The European Network of AI Excellence Centres  (ELISE): This is a network of institutions working  on data -driven learning and builds on top of and in collaboration with  the ELLIS  Society  (European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems). The main activities seem to be  exchang es and training of researchers.  These groups could be a good opportunity for training fisheries scientists and industry in AI  technologies, but they have the partial disadvantage of a lower understanding of the marine  environment and its data characteristics than the previous list of groups. This fit -for-purpose  knowledge is critical for successful application of AI in fisheries. There is an alarming number of  technological companies without sufficient previous experience trying to sell AI developments to the  fisheries industry and scientists, which might not be adapted to the reality of this sector. We have  discussed in previous sections how ML has alr eady proven its potential in marine sciences. However, if  AI methods are not fit for purpose, then trade- offs necessary to accomplish appropriate performances  can be missed (Fernandes et al., 2009) or overfitting without robust validation can lead to over confidence in AI capacities (Fernandes et al., 2010). A multi -disciplinary approach where the domain  experts and AI experts work together is key for enabling this fit -for-purpose AI that can go beyond the  state -of-the-art in more than one discipline (Ferna ndes et al., 2013; Hernández -González et al., 2019).  As combining leading class experts in AI and fisheries might not be feasible in all instances, an  intermediate approach can be employed to enable greater progress. An example may be training a  marine eco logist or other marine biology/fishery expert who is interested in statistics and ML (Grosjean  et al. 2004; Fernandes et al., 2012; Trifonova et al., 2015; Uusitalo et al., 2016), or a person with a computing or statistical background with an interest not only in theoretical algorithms but also in their  application to fisheries and other marine issues .                                                                   94 https://digital -strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/european -ai-alliance  
Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         73 5. CONCLUSION S AND RECOM MENDATIONS   5.1. Analysis  of the impacts of AI use  in the fisheries sector:  opportunities and obstacles   The use of AI for fisheries confers important  benefits to the fisheries industry, scientists,  and policy  managers  thanks to the ability of these methods to quickly process large data from different sources  and with different formats , interpret the inputs  and provide advice for i mproved results. The following  main advantages  of AI use in fisheries  have been identified :  • AI can help to  reduce the impact of fisheries on the environment (e. g., emissions, bycatch  and  discards) while  reduc ing operational costs for the industry  and improving the public image of  the industry.  • Early warning , forecasting  and spatial planning  systems can be develop ed using  AI methods,   even under high uncertainty , to assist industry and managers  in their planning activities , mainly   when trade- offs between activities, impacts and potential benefits need to be considered.  KEY FINDINGS   • Main opportunities identified are: 1) increased  transparency of fishing activity  and reduced   impact on the environment , thereby  improving the public image of the sector; 2) early  warning, forecasting and spatial planning systems can help in the planning activities  considering trade- off between them ; 3) accelerate d and increased  data acquisition and  coverage for stock assessments, sustainability indicators evaluation and other  management data needs; 4) increased  economic sustainability of the fishing industry, by  reducing operational costs; and, 5) the m odernisation of fisheries and its subsequent  attractiveness to the younger popul ation.   • Main obstacles identified are: 1) industry trust and reluctance; 2) initial costs and lack of  expertise; 3) legal and bureaucratic uncertainty.   • AI can increase efficiency and reduce costs for industry, but there are important barriers  such as developing and instal lation costs, the scarcity of standards, and a lack of  multidisciplinary expertise (biological, AI and legal) to develop fit -for-purpose systems.   • Although some AI approaches are considered black boxes (e.g. Artificial Neural Networks   (ANNs )), there are other suitable AI methods to understand the basis, processes and model  forecasts and their uncertainty (e.g. Bayesian Networks  (BNs).   • Policy recommendations relevant to EU decision- making to achieve a better use of AI  systems in the fisheries sector are: 1) add AI references to fisheries legislation and AIA  proposal; 2) regulate the role of technological companies; 3) promote multidiscip linary  academia and professionals; 4) regulate the role of AI technological providers, ensuring  some degree of experience in fisheries to prevent untrustworthy and not -fit-for-purpose  AI systems;  5) develop AI good practices guidelines  for fisheries; 6) cr eate incentives for the  development and use of fit -for-purpose fisheries AI systems; 7) improve and promote  public and private data sharing; and, 8) promote awareness and collaboration with  fisheries sector.

However, other AI methods are more suitable to  understand model forecasts  and their uncertainty  (e.g. , BNs) .  • Method standardization for results integration and comparison are needed to understand the  performance of AI systems among providers.   • AI use can i ncrease fishing ac tivity transparency  and public perception , increase the economic  sustainability , and reduce waste in the full supply chain.   • Modernising fisheries , with the introduction of new technologies, such as AI, will help  to make  the fishing industry more attractive to the current and next younger generations.  About  the obstacles, there are some limitations to the use of AI systems that are inherent to their  reliance on data availability. For instance, i n a public consultation95, the main barriers to data sharing  identified where: 1) legal uncertainty due to different rules in Member States ; 2) l egal barriers in the use  of business data for the public interest, including competition rules ; 3) lack of commercial incen tives to  share data ; 4) l ack of awareness of related data bases or platforms ; and, 5) l ack of assurance that the  data will only be used for the public interest purpose for which it was requested . Another  barrier could  be that c ompanies may feel that with the  AI their know -how can be exposed to competitors or other  third parties. There is a fear in the fishing sector (and other industries) that data provided for AI will not  only be used for the public interest purpose for which it was requested. Furthermore, there is perhaps  a sense by fishers that with AI they lose the privacy and ownership of their day -to-day working data.   Moreover, fishing industry is quite conservative in their approaches and some members might be  unwilling to voluntarily embrace changing technologies.  Misuse of AI tools leading  to overexploit  resources or misbehaviour is a general worry  by fisheries managers and environmental organi sations .  A frequent concern with AI is the fear that there will be too much reliance on decisions taken by  automated systems, with little human supervision and proper ground truth verification. For example,  if erroneous AI -based fisheries interpretations based on poorly designed algorithms go unchecked by  experts in the field it could lead to ineffective management measures. The costs associated with initial  implementation of AI technologies can be a concern  for fishing companies , particularly for small -scale  artisanal members. In some cases, it might help that  governmental  bodies provide direct or indirect  econ omic incentives that favour AI adoption. As AI technology becomes more affordable, it could even  be more cost -effective than non- AI options. Finally, s ome fishers fear that AI might bring about new  more rigid and inflexible regulations that can have deleterious consequences on their economic status.  The reality of AI in fisheries is that there is still much doubt on its potential overall repercussions. In part ,  this could be due to  the still not very  formalized integration of science, regulatory authorities , and the  fishing industry, which could help to clarify each stakeholders’ role and position within this new field.   5.2. Policy recommendations for the  best use of AI in the fisheries and  its value chain   This study team , based on the literature reviewed, their own expert knowledge and the stakeholder  surveys , suggest the following policy recommendations:                                                                 95 Summary report on the public consultation on data act and amended rules on the legal protection of databases.

Artificial Intelligence and the fisheries sector         75 1. Amend Regulations that are or will be subject to revision in this field to  include a reference to  AI systems and AIA definition in paragraphs where digital transformation and new  technologies are mentioned.   2. Amend the AIA proposal to include fisheries sector. Its Recital 3 currently reads “[…] in  healthcare, farming, education […]” , it could be amended to “[…] in healthcare, farming and  fishery, education […]” .  3. Promote formation of interdisciplinary fisheries experts with AI related skills and  multidisciplinary teams (e.g., AI, biological, ec onomic, and legal disciplines).   4. Find ways to incentivise job opportunities and promotion of multidisciplinary and interdisc iplinary experts not only in academia but also in the private fishery sector.   5. Attract new young workers and empower women  with AI skills in fisheries  sector jobs through  dissemination of information programs and by providing adequate incentives.   6. Promote  private data collection and sharing, including appropriate data aggregation and  anonymization safety protocol s to facilitate industry trust.   7. Support the development of good AI practices and standards for statistical validation and ground truth verification t o increase consumer and industry trust in AI performance, also  supported by strong science fit -for-purpose applications aligned with sustainability goals.   8. Regulate the role of AI technological providers, ensuring some degree of experience in fisheries  to p revent untrustworthy and not -fit-for-purpose AI systems (e.g., establishment of audited  registration programs).   9. Create regulations limiting the access of certain kinds  of AI systems to the fisheries sector to  help avoid their application in illegal or unet hical activities (e.g., through regional fisheries  management organisations (RFMOs) or registers for vessel compliance with sustainability  practices from trustworthy organi sations) .  10. Support the development of  good AI practice guidelines in fisheries through collaboration with  stakeholders and organi sations (e.g., RFMOs, certification agencies, NGOs) using mechanisms  and principles proven to be successful in other types of fisheries best practices guidelines.   11. Promote AI awareness, both benefits and constraints, among managers and industry to  improve adoption processes at the whole chain (e.g., faster data provision in stock assessment, near real -time quota monitoring or agile product traceability).   12. Promote collaboration between u niversities, firms , AI d evelopers  and other stakeholders  in  fisheries  (e.g., though specific funding, specialized centres, and multidisciplinary networks).   13. Promote technological development  integrated with AI systems to develop  more selective  fishing gears and fishing strategies (e.g.,  better camera systems, wireless communication for  real-time control, etc. ) by funding  AI research and vessels digitalisation.
