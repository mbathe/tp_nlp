2 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandThe world is changing. We are becoming greener, more  sustainable, and more digital. These changes have been  accelerated since the onset of the COVID-19 crisis.  Overnight, businesses and workers had to adapt to a  new reality, embracing new technologies and new ways  of working. Digitisation is transforming our lives and  our economy, and artificial intelligence (AI) will be at the  forefront of this transformation. As we move into the  early phases of a recovery, we must look ahead at the  opportunities presented by AI and other technologies  to build back to a society and economy that is stronger,  fairer and more resilient.  AI is not a technology of the future, it is a technology of  the present. Given its wide application to all sectors, and  its high capacity for impact, growth and contribution to  improving competitiveness, AI is one of the technologies  with the greatest potential for transformation in all  areas of productive activity. But not just that, AI also  poses significant opportunities in addressing and  overcoming pressing societal challenges and creating  new value and possibilities for everyone not just the  economy. The National AI Strategy therefore sets out a  high-level direction, so we are best able to harness AI as  a positive force for transformation.  Underpinning our Strategy are three core principles  to best embrace the opportunities of AI – adopting a  human-centric approach to application of AI; staying  open and adaptable to new innovations; and ensuring  good governance to build trust and confidence for  innovation to flourish, because ultimately if AI is to  be truly inclusive and have a positive impact on all of  us, we need to be clear on its role in our society and  ensure that trust is the ultimate marker of success.   With these guiding principles, it is our ambition to put  Ireland at the frontier of a people-centred, ethical and  responsible rollout of AI. This will further enhance  Ireland’s reputation as a place where it pays to invest  in innovation. Through the ingenuity, invention, and  imagination of our people and our businesses we can  help to create a smarter, more prosperous country.  We can already see the many applications of AI in our  daily lives, our workplaces and across the economy.  Many Irish businesses are harnessing AI in a variety  of ways; using it to improve productivity, gain a better  understanding of customers, and offer better products.  We want to support more businesses to benefit from AI  and help businesses already using AI to achieve more  sustainable growth through trustworthy AI. We will  do this by building on Ireland’s capabilities; its thriving  community of indigenous supply chain SMEs and the  presence of world-leading software and ICT industries. AI and other technologies are central to nearly every  aspect of our lives, so everyone should be able to  contribute to the development of AI in Ireland and also  benefit from it. We cannot afford to leave people behind  because they do not have the skills to participate in this  changing economy. For a fairer, more evenly distributed  recovery, we must ensure that the skills and talent of  our people keeps up with the technology. Education  and training in Ireland must respond to the scale of the  digital transformation and the evolution of skills needs.  This will allow the continued creation of sustainable,  high quality jobs for workers. Providing workers with  the right skills will go hand-in-hand with ensuring the  benefits of the recovery and the digital transition are  felt across the economy and throughout society. However, we will not forge ahead by ourselves. Working  with our colleagues and partners across Europe and  beyond, we will build a more prosperous Ireland  within a prosperous Europe. This will help to create  conditions conducive to a safe, responsible and ethical  international environment for AI-enabled companies to  operate in.  If we are to attain the economy and the society  we would like -  greener, more productive, and  technologically responsive - we need to create the  conditions for this to happen. The National AI Strategy  will serve as a roadmap to an ethical, trustworthy  and human-centric design, development, deployment  and governance of AI to ensure Ireland can unleash  the potential that AI can provide. This will ensure we  not only recover from the pandemic, but prosper as a  modern, dynamic and ambitious nation.   Robert Troy T.D.

4 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandIntroduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to machine-based systems, with varying le vels of  autonomy, that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions,  recommendations or decisions using data.1 Machine Learning, a subset of AI, is  software which is able to learn from applicable datasets to self-improve, without being  explicitly programmed by human programmers. AI is part of a suite of digital technologies  which will play a major role in shaping  global competitiveness and productivity over the coming decades, granting early  adopters significant societal, economic and strategic advantages. AI and other digital  technologies are also transforming the world of work; in the words of one commentary  “the future of AI is the future of work” .2 Executive Summary There are many assumptions and misunderstandings  about AI and its short- and long-term impacts on the  economy and society. Popular narratives, science  fiction, and media hype tend to influence our thinking  about AI but are often unrealistic and lacking in nuance.  However, AI offers great opportunities to improve our  socio-economic performance and productivity, as well  as our environmental and social wellbeing.   AI is already changing how we learn, work and live:  from how we pay for online shopping, to using the apps  on our phones. That change will continue to shape our  economy and society, as AI’s transformative, disruptive  technologies are embraced by new sectors and future  generations.  Ireland is well-placed to be at the forefront of that  change. As a country we have invested heavily in  developing IT talent, entrepreneurship and connectivity.  We’re also home to many of the world’s largest ICT  businesses. As that transformation happens, computers will begin  to complement or replace specific tasks otherwise  performed by people. Now is the time to put safeguards  in place to make sure that happens securely, and in a  manner that is fair, transparent and builds public trust.This Strategy sets out how Ireland can be an  international leader in using AI to benefit our economy  and society, through a people-centred, ethical approach  to its development, adoption and use.  In recognition of the wide-ranging effect AI will have on  our lives, this Strategy considers AI from a number of  perspectives. These are: Building public trust in AI Strand 1:  AI and society Strand 2:   A governance ecosystem that promotes  trustworthy AI Leveraging AI for economic and societal benefit Strand 3:  Driving adoption of AI in Irish enterprise Strand 4:  AI serving the public Enablers for AI Strand 5:  A strong AI innovation ecosystem Strand 6:  AI education, skills and talent Strand 7:  A supportive and secure infrastructure for AI Strand 8:  Implementing the Strategy A theme that runs through the entire Strategy is  Government’s commitment to an ethical approach  to AI and to the secure use of AI and other digital  technologies.  Ultimately the ambition of this Strategy is to make sure  that AI is here for good. 1.  OECD Council Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence, OECD/Legal/0449, (adopted 22 May 2019).   2.

6 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland Strand 1:  AI and Society The more people who understand and trust in the potential of AI, the more who will  embrace it. The Government recognises the need to have meaningful engagement  with the public on the development, governance and use of AI. Objective Strong public trust in AI as a force for societal good in Ireland Strategic Actions i. Appoint an AI Ambassador to champion AI as a positive force for the economy and society [DETE]   ii.  Open a conversation with children and young people about AI through Comhairle na nÓg, the  national structure for consultation with children and young people [DETE / DCEDIY] iii. Promote and expand courses which educate the general public about AI [DFHERIS]  iv. Expand AI for Societal Good Challenge Funds [DFHERIS, SFI / DPER / relevant Departments] v.  Include opportunities for AI in climate action as part of the development of future climate policies  [DECC / DFHERIS, SFI / DETE / DoT] Human rights and ethical principles are a key focus  of this Strategy. It is vital that we listen to people’s  views and embed AI in society in ways that respect  and promote diversity, inclusion, equality and nondiscrimination.AI offers transformative potential for tackling many  societal, environmental and economic challenges.  However, for this to be successful, widespread societal  buy-in is required. The Government intends to begin  the process of engagement and building trust through  the following actions:
7 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandStrand 2:   A Governance Ecosystem that Promotes Trustworthy AI Ireland is committed to an AI approach which is responsible, ethical and trustworthy.  That will require an agile and appropriate governance and regulatory environment  across three key areas:  Legal Framework:  Various pieces of legislation already apply to the  development and use of AI today, and much of Ireland’s  existing legal framework should be sufficient to provide  for the smooth deployment of AI. However, some legal  gaps may require additional regulation and work is  ongoing across Government to examine and address  legal gaps for AI. At EU level development of a horizontal European  regulatory framework for AI is underway. Ireland is  playing an active part in shaping this work, to develop a  framework that ensures the protection of fundamental  rights, while fostering innovation and benefiting from  the opportunities presented by AI.  Ethics:  AI must support the ethical values of society and  protect human rights. T o achieve this, the EU has  developed Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI.  An ethical approach will be at the forefront of  Government’s work to drive AI adoption in the private  and public sectors, and we will provide a range of tools  to help in assessing the trustworthiness of AI systems. Standards and Certification:  Compliance tools, such as standards and certification,  will be used to underpin both legal and ethical  obligations with respect to AI. This work will be led  by the T op T eam on Standards for AI, which was  established in 2020 by the National Standards  Authority of Ireland (NSAI) to develop a standards and  assurance roadmap for AI. Objective An agile and appropriate governance and regulatory environment for AI Strategic Actions i.  Continue to play an active part in discussions at EU level to define a horizontal regulatory  framework for AI [DETE] ii.  Consider an appropriate mechanism for ensuring a coordinated approach by Irish regulators to  Digital, including AI, as part of the forthcoming National Digital Strategy [DOT / DETE / DECC  D/ Justice / DTCAGSM / DCEDIY] iii.  Examine and promote ways to help businesses self-assess the trustworthiness of their AI  systems, including through development of case studies and toolkits for SMEs [DETE-EI, IDA /  DFEHRIS] iv.  Publish a Standards and Assurance Roadmap for AI [DETE-NSAI] v.  Investigate the potential and requirements of regulatory sandboxes for AI [DETE-NSAI / DETEEI / IDA / DFEHERIS-SFI] vi. Join the Global Partnership on AI [DETE / DFA] vii.  Continue to advocate within multilateral fora for an ethical and human rights-based approach  to AI [DFA / other Departments as appropriate] viii.  Consider the implications of AI as part of a planned review of equality legislation [DCEDIY]
8 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandStrand 3:  Driving Adoption of AI in Irish Enterprise AI is already an important productivity driver in a wide range of sectors, including  technology, financial services, agriculture, engineering, healthcare and life sciences.   As we emerge from the pandemic, there is the  opportunity to reap a productivity dividend from AI (as  well as other digital technologies) in businesses of all  sizes and in all sectors. This Strategy  aims to encourage  and help those enterprises, large and small, to adopt and  benefit from AI. T o achieve that aim, Government will partner with  Industry to drive widespread adoption of AI across  enterprise through a phased approach of awareness  building, opportunities to experiment with and pilot  AI applications, assistance with planning and capacity  building for AI, and help for implementation of AI  solutions. Government will also encourage strong interaction between research and industry, as well as  promoting collaboration and spillovers between SMEs  and leading-edge technology MNEs.  An AI Innovation Hub will also be established, as part  of Ireland’s planned programme of European Digital  Innovation Hubs, to act as a National First Stop for AI,  providing expertise and guidance to enterprises on their  AI adoption journey. Government will also consider the technology  and infrastructure requirements to underpin the  widespread and secure adoption of AI by businesses. Objective Increased productivity through a step change in AI adoption by Irish enterprise Strategic Actions i.  Establish an Enterprise Digital Advisory Board to advise and work with Government to drive  industry adoption of AI and other digital technologies including by:  a.  Assessing the current spectrum of AI resources available to industry from Government to  inform actions to maximise the potential of the existing infrastructure   b.  Developing an AI programme for enterprise of targeted funding and advisory measures for AI  adoption   c.  Raising awareness among businesses of all sizes of the resources available to help with AI  adoption   d.   Developing a national AI cluster or platform to drive collaboration between MNCs and SMEs    [All actions above for DETE, EI, IDA, LEOs, SFI] ii.  Consider the best model for a data and AI infrastructure platform to accelerate the onboarding  and adoption of AI in industry [DETE/IDA/EI/DPER-OGCIO] iii.  Establish an AI Innovation Hub, as part of Ireland’s planned programme of European Digital  Innovation Hubs, to act as a National First Stop for AI, providing expertise and guidance to  enterprises on their AI adoption  journey [DETE, EI, Digital Europe]
9 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandStrand 4:  AI Serving the Public The public sector has already embedded AI into the  provision of certain public services, and is also piloting  AI applications in a range of areas including agriculture,  revenue and health. This has made the delivery of those  services more efficient and has provided useful analytic  data that can be applied in the formation of future  public policies. T o achieve the full potential offered by  AI requires a coordinated public service-wide, strategic  approach to the implementation of AI, that is secure  and ethical. The GovT ech Delivery Board, which is  being established to drive digital transition in the Public  Service, will consider AI adoption by the Public Service  as part of its workThis will be done in a manner that is responsible  and ethical. Government will lead the way and drive  growth in AI by purchasing and developing ethical  and trustworthy AI applications, and  by using public  procurement policies to stimulate and encourage  industry to provide AI based products and services  to government. We want Ireland’s public service to  become a showcase of AI adoption and reference site  for industry solutions. By doing so, this will help to build  public trust in AI. Objective Better public service outcomes through a step change in AI adoption by the Irish  public sector Strategic Actions i. The GovT ech Delivery Board will consider the adoption of AI by the Public Service, including:   a.  What appropriate safeguards are needed to ensure a secure system for AI development and  use in the public service  b.  The approach to developing  and promulgating principles for trustworthy AI which will apply  to all AI developed for and used by the Public Service   c. The development needs for AI talent in the Public Service   d.  Opportunities for public procurement of AI, using public purchasing power to drive  innovation and growth in the development of ethical and trustworthy AI ii.  Promote an ‘open’ environment for accelerating and testing AI applications in the Public Service,  e.g. Hackathons and Workshops [DPER]
10 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandStrand 5:  A Strong AI Innovation Ecosystem If we want AI to thrive, a strong and supportive  ecosystem for AI innovation is essential. Our ambition  therefore is to drive AI innovation through world class  research and development. Ireland already has strong industry-academic research  credentials built around Science Foundation Ireland  (SFI)-run programmes, and many of our academic  researchers are internationally renowned for their  excellence in AI. As part of this Strategy, we want  to build on that reputation, promoting strong links between industry, research and academia, so that  innovative researchers, enterprises and entrepreneurs  that are involved in developing and using AI are  connected  to each other and to appropriate support  systems. Other important elements of the ecosystem include  a supportive funding environment, opportunities to  connect with international partners, and access to  testbeds where AI applications can be experimented  with and piloted in real world environments. Objective A strong Irish ecosystem for high-quality and responsible AI research and  Innovation Strategic Actions i. Conduct a mapping of the AI R&I ecosystem [DFHERIS-SFI] ii.  Identify sectors of opportunity for establishing AI testbeds and experimentation facilities [DETE,  EI, IDA & NSAI / DFHERIS, SFI, Enterprise AI Advisory Board] iii.  Promote Irish participation in international AI R&I programmes and relevant EU funding calls  [DFHERIS, SFI/ DETE] iv.  Explore potential mechanisms for all-island cooperation on AI R&I in strategic sectors, for  example through the Shared Island initiative [DFHERIS, SFI/ DoT] v.  Promote Ireland as a centre for talent in AI R&I as part of Global Footprint 2025 [DFHERIS/  DETE/ DFA]
11 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandStrand 6:  AI Education, Skills and T alent With one in three jobs in Ireland likely to be disrupted by the adoption of digital  technologies, our workforce needs to be prepared for the impact of AI.  Some of the  disruption, however, is likely to be around changes to job roles and tasks, rather than  actual job losses. While AI will lead to some displacement, as with other pre vious  disruptive technological advances, it will also lead to the creation of new jobs and  higher productivity and incomes. The policy challenge is to ensure that these gains are  shared equitably. The Government will prioritise policies that ensure  workers can access opportunities to upskill or reskill, so as to adapt to these changes. Crucially, other  interventions, including in the labour market regulation  and social protection spheres, will be needed in order  to protect workers’ interests and ensure that increasing  use of AI does not serve to deepen inequalities.  Alongside this, Ireland needs to develop, attract and  retain AI talent. In this Strategy, Government has  set out how our workforce and population will be  prepared for driving and adopting AI, through the provision of digital, technical and complementary skills  at all education levels, from primary school upwards,  and how we will make Ireland an attractive place for  international AI talent. In recognition of the importance  of cybersecurity, a suite of M.Sc. programmes has been  developed to build future skills in this area. We will also  take steps towards improving gender balance in AIrelated  careers, which tend to be well remunerated but  male-dominated at present.   Objective A workforce prepared for and adopting AI Strategic Actions i.  Deliver a review in 2021 of the skills implications of AI over the next 5 to 10 years, and the skillsrelated actions needed to realise the potential of AI [DETE, EGFSN] ii.  Encourage Higher Education Institutions to take a coordinated approach to delivering AI  education and training informed by the outcome of the EGFSN review [DFHERIS, HEA and HEIs] iii.  Assist employers to expand workplace-focused AI upskilling and reskilling, including through  apprenticeships, SOLAS programmes, Skillnet Ireland training programmes and enterprise  partnership schemes [DFHERIS, Skillnet Ireland, HEA, & SOLAS / DETE, Enterprise AI Advisory  Board] iv. Consider how AI can be incorporated into future policy for digital learning [D/Education] v.  Review the criteria for employment permits for critical AI-related skills, having regard to the  research and analysis of AI skills needs that is undertaken [DETE]  vi.  Establish an expert group to develop an action plan to increase the participation of women in  reslated careers [DETE / DFHERIS / D/Education / DCEDIY]
12 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandThe building blocks for a healthy AI infrastructure  include access to high-quality and trustworthy data;  robust data governance and privacy frameworks; secure  high-speed telecommunication networks; and sufficient  computing power and storage capabilities.  Many of these components are already core strengths  for Ireland, including a strong track record in open  data, and a commitment to rigorous data protection  standards. Government has put in place legislation to  allow public bodies to share personal data, which will be  overseen by the Data Governance Board. Broadband  rollout and High Performance Computing (HPC)  are long-standing Government priorities, on which  substantial progress has been made in recent years.  A strong national approach to cyber security is a  prerequisite for building and maintaining trust in AI  systems.  Under Ireland’s National Cyber Security  Strategy, Government will protect the security of  the country’s computer networks and associated infrastructure, led by the National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC). As the 2021 ransomware attack  on the HSE has demonstrated, there is no room for  complacency with respect to cyber security, and the  development of the NCSC will evolve continuously, to  reflect its important mandate. AI technologies can be  used as a tool to strengthen cyber security, for example,  through the deployment of active firewalls or smart  antivirus protection. Under this Strategy, Government will build on these  strengths to create world-class data, digital and  connectivity infrastructure for driving AI development  and adoption in Ireland and to solidify our role as a  trustworthy data governance hub. Where possible,  Government will make more public sector data openly,  safely and securely available and will facilitate the  development of trusted data sharing mechanisms and  research environments to enable access to data and  collaboration across different organisations. Strand 7: A Supportive and Secure Infrastructure for AI Objective A data, digital and connectivity infrastructure which provides a secure foundation  for AI development and use in Ireland Strategic Actions   i.  Building on initiatives such as the EMPOWER program, provide a framework for trustworthy  data governance across the private sector and develop tools and methodologies to apply the  framework.  [DFHERIS, SFI / DETE, EI, IDA] ii.  Promulgate standards and guidelines for ethical data sharing within the Public Service [DPER /  Data Governance Board] iii.  Increase the availability of open government data for AI training and testing, including by holding  an AI Open Data Challenge [DPER / CSO] iv.  Identify public sector climate and environmental open datasets to encourage development of AI  solutions for climate action [DPER / DECC, EPA, SEAI]
13 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland Strand 8:  Implementing the Strategy The AI Strategy forms an important part of overall digital strategy for Ireland; the  drivers and enablers for AI are very similar to those for other digital technologies.  Therefore, the AI Strategy will be implemented through the framework that  Government is establishing to drive and oversee Ireland’s digital transition, with  specific strategic actions led by nominated Government Departments, State agencies  or other bodies, as set out in the relevant Strands.  An Enterprise Digital Advisory Board will be  established to advise and work with Government  to drive enterprise adoption of digital technologies,  including AI. The Board members will include relevant  Government Departments, representatives from MNEs  and SMEs, AI experts, IDA Ireland and Enterprise  Ireland. The Board will be chaired by the Minister  of State for Trade Promotion, Digital and Company  Regulation. The Board will oversee the implementation  of the enterprise elements of the AI Strategy.  Government also plans to establish a GovT ech Delivery  Board, which will lead the digital transformation of the  Public Service. The Board will consider AI adoption by  the public service as part of its work. T o reflect the specific complexities of AI, some  additional structures will also be put in place, to deliver  the objectives of the Strategy.   Driving Public Trust in AI  Building public trust in and engagement with  AI will be essential to the overall success of  the AI Strategy. Government will appoint an  AI ambassador to promote awareness among  the public and businesses of the potential  that AI offers, serving as a champion of AI as a positive force for the economy and society,  and emphasising an ethical approach. The AI  ambassador will be a member of the Enterprise  Digital Advisory Board and will be supported in  their work by the Board and by the Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Employment.     Driving Standards in AI  Government has established a T op T eam on  Standards for AI to expand Ireland’s international  leadership in AI standards development. Led by  the NSAI, the T op T eam is working with academia,  industry and regulators to develop a roadmap for  AI standards.  Ongoing Review of Strategy This Strategy will be responsive and flexible, in keeping  with the rapidly evolving technologies and the issues  it must address. As AI technologies and applications  develop, there may be a need for new approaches and  initiatives that we cannot foresee today. T o allow for  this responsiveness, Government will develop a detailed  action plan, to drive implementation of the Strategy, and  this action plan will be updated each year to address  emerging challenges and opportunities. 
14 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandIntroduction What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?   Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to machine-based systems,  with varying levels of autonomy, that can, for a given set of  human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations  or decisions using data.3  Machine Learning, a subset of AI, is  software which is able to learn from applicable datasets to  self improve, without being explicitly programmed by human  programmers. What is the Opportunity? AI will play a major role in shaping global  competitiveness and productivity over the coming  decades, granting early adopters significant societal,  economic, and strategic advantages. Globally, it is  estimated that the application of AI could double  economic growth by 2035.4 AI-based systems have already begun to permeate  many aspects of our daily lives, from the way we  work and do business, to the way we communicate  and treat diseases. Continued advancements in AI,  enabled by sustained investment in areas of national  importance, offer opportunities to improve our socioeconomic performance and productivity, as well as our  environmental and social wellbeing.  AI technologies can drive productivity in all core  economic sectors, creating new jobs, enterprises,  products and services, as well as new business models.  They also provide an opportunity to improve the  efficiency and effectiveness of our public service  delivery. AI-enabled solutions are transforming  a breadth of industries and activities, including  agriculture and food, robotics, financial and professional  services, transport, sport, healthcare, culture and  tourism. What is the Policy Context?  The recent Economic Recovery Plan and Enterprise  2025 Renewed, the national enterprise strategy, set out  an ambition for Ireland to be at the frontier of disruptive  technologies, including AI. Ireland’s AI policy development is also underpinned  by our engagement in relevant international AI policy  and governance processes at the European Union  (EU), the United Nations (UN) and the Organisation  for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).  In May 2019, Ireland signed up to the OECD’s  Recommendation on AI, including a set of voluntary,  values-based principles for the responsible stewardship  of trustworthy AI.5   Digitalisation, including AI, is a strategic priority of the  European Commission. 6  The EU views AI as a critical  success factor in achieving the vision of a climate  neutral, circular and resilient economy. 7   The Commission Communication on Artificial  Intelligence for Europe (2018) outlined an ambition for  Europe to become the world-leading region for cuttingedge, ethical and trustworthy AI. It set out a European  approach to AI, resting on three pillars:  1.   Boost the European Union’s (EU) technological and  industrial capacity and AI uptake across the economy 2. Prepare for socio-economic changes 3.  Ensure an appropriate regulatory and legal  framework.8 3.  OECD Council Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence, OECD/Legal/0449, (adopted 22 May 2019). 4.

15 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandIn December 2018, Member States joined forces with  the European Commission in a Coordinated Plan on the  Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence Made in  Europe .9  Ireland is fully committed to the objectives of  this Plan, which proposes joint actions in the following  areas: increasing investment; making more data  available; fostering talent; and ensuring trust. The Plan  was built on in 2020 by an EU White Paper on AI, which  set out the aim of fostering a European ecosystem of  excellence to encourage the adoption and benefits  of AI, as well as an ecosystem of trust in AI through  governance and regulation.10   In April 2021, the Commission presented a proposal for  a regulatory framework on AI and a revised coordinated  plan on AI, to both promote the development of AI  and address the potential risks it poses to safety  and fundamental rights. The 2021 review of the  Coordinated Plan puts forward four key sets of  proposals to seize the opportunities of AI  and to  facilitate the European approach that is human-centric,  trustworthy, secure, sustainable and inclusive: 1.  Set enabling conditions for AI development and  uptake in the EU 2.  Make the EU the place where excellence thrives  from the lab to the market 3.  Ensure that AI works for people and is a force for  good in society 4. Build strategic leadership in high-impact sectors.11 What are the Challenges? The increasing use of AI-based systems entails potential  risks, such as job displacement, opaque decisionmaking, discrimination, intrusion in our private lives,  or use for criminal purposes. There are also challenges  in terms of ensuring explainability, accountability and  fairness, as well as the safety and security of AI-based  systems. It will therefore be important to maximise  the benefits of AI for both individuals and society at  large, while minimising any adverse risks that could be  present. A regulatory balance must be struck to achieve effective  protection against such risks, without unduly stifling  innovation.  What is Ireland’s Strategic  Approach to AI? AI must advance in a way that builds user confidence  and trust, and which is accountable and acceptable  to society. Thus, while research and innovation in AI  must be enabled, at the same time, an appropriate  governance framework based on our ethical values  must be provided, to ensure that AI contributes to the  public good.  Through this Strategy, AI – Here for Good , Government  aims to ensure a responsible, rights-respecting and  inclusive approach to developing, applying and adopting  AI. This will require a strong partnership between  Government, our enterprises and innovators, our  research communities and civil society; we are all  responsible for responsible AI.  In the development of this Strategy, there has been  an open and extensive consultation with a wide range  of stakeholders on how to successfully drive forward  progress in AI together. This has included stakeholder  meetings with industry and their representative bodies,  with academic and research communities, as well as an  online public consultation. 9.

17 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland Strand 1:   AI and Society 1.1 Introduction This Strategy is titled “AI – Here for Good” to highlight  the transformative potential of AI for addressing many  societal, environmental and economic challenges. For  example, AI applications can advance our objectives in  areas such as climate action, public health, education,  housing, urban development, preservation of cultural  heritage, food security, human rights, crisis response  and disaster management, amongst others. While  Government will play a key role in facilitating and  enabling AI for Good, this is a journey involving all of  society. AI must be developed and used with trust, transparency  and accountability. By making human rights and ethical  principles a key focus of one of the eight strands of this  Strategy, Ireland is making a commitment to ensuring  that AI-based systems and solutions developed and  used in this State are trustworthy, fair and inclusive.  1.2 AI for Societal Good and  Sustainability The State is already using AI to address important  societal issues, for example in the areas of environment  and climate action, health, and social inclusion.Objective Strong public trust in AI as a force for societal good in Ireland   12.  The Government Statement on the Role of Data Centres in Ireland’s Enterprise Strategy (2018), together with the Climate Action Plan,  outline the opportunity that Renewable Energy Corporate Power Purchase Agreements provide in increasing the amount of renewable energy  being used by data centres in Ireland (and consequently the amount of renewable energy being used to power certain types of AI in Ireland).  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is currently undertaking policy resear ch in this area. See https://enterprise.gov.ie/en/ Publications/Government-Statement-Data-Centres-Enterprise-Strategy.htmlAI FOR ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE ACTION AI has great potential in the area of climate action,  where AI applications can be used to monitor and  reduce energy usage; provide real-time environmental  monitoring and risk management; and to help prevent  and mitigate environmental crises among other things.  A new Industrial strategy for a green and digital Europe (March 2020) links the twin transitions towards climate  neutrality and digital leadership in industry. Ireland’s Climate Action Plan 2019  envisages that digital  technologies like smart metering (including the use of  AI) will play an important role in managing domestic and  commercial energy consumption, as well as balancing  the energy grid. At the same time, it is important to  recognise the energy demands of AI in the context  of environmental and climate changes. AI must be  developed in a sustainable manner, balancing benefits  against the potential environmental impacts. Data  centres in Ireland will be encouraged and supported to  embed circular economy principles, as mandated by the  EU Ecodesign Regulation standards.12  Opportunities for AI in climate action will be explored  by the Research and Modelling Group convened  across the Government system to examine the role of  innovation more broadly in climate action. 
18 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandCase Study: AI to improve energy efficiency and customer services ESB Networks ESB Networks  are using AI to optimise the rollout of their smart meter technology. Utilising Computer  Vision and Machine Learning, ESB Networks  ensures that its new smart meters are safely and correctly  installed. ESB Networks  can now easily identify meter readings from photographs – a critical requirement  for ESB Networks  to ensure it can respond to any customer queries quickly. This project won the Intelligent  Automation – Best Use of Robotic Process Automation & Cognitive award at the AI Ireland 2019 AI  Awards.  ESB’s Smart Energy Services An innovative proof of concept study carried out by ESB’s Smart Energy Services, together with IBM  Research-Ireland, assisted T esco Ireland to reduce its total annual energy bills by 25%. Savings on  refrigeration alone totalled 10Gwh. The study focused on the high energy consumption of refrigeration  units in the retail sector, using AI-based analytics and the Internet of Things to identify and validate the  savings potential. AI FOR HEALTH AI has huge potential in the area of healthcare from  improving patient experiences to providing more  accurate interventions for patients. AI has played an  important role in the global response to the COVID-19  pandemic. Governments around the world are making  use of AI in the development of vaccines, in outbreak  prediction and modelling, automated contact tracing,  intelligent supply chains and space mapping for social  distancing, amongst other applications. AI FOR SOCIAL INCLUSION   While there is a risk that AI could result in new forms of  inequalities, it may also offer opportunities to improve  access and inclusion - in work, in education, in everyday  life, and in making human connections. For example,  robots incorporating AI and smart home assistants are  being used to assist in providing health and social care.13   There is also significant potential for AI to provide  educational resources for people with disabilities and  special needs.14  The development of AI-based semantic  technologies to extract digital content can render  navigation and access easier and more effective for  people with low levels of vision. In addition, AI-based  innovations like real-time live captioning can assist  those with impaired hearing. STATE INVESTMENT IN THE ONGOING   DEVELOPMENT OF AI FOR SOCIETAL GOOD The State is incentivising research into how AI can be  used for societal good through Science Foundation  Ireland (SFI), which is investing in this area across all  their funding programmes.  Research projects include developing AI for smart and  sustainable cities and safer transport; for more efficient  agriculture; for improved human health; and for a  more robust understanding of the environment. These  projects are very often carried out in close collaboration  with industry partners. For example, researchers  at Lero, the SFI Research Centre for Software, are  working with Microsoft to develop AI-based “chatbots”  to provide opportunities for young refugees to access  and avail of high-quality educational resources in their  own languages. AI for Societal Good is also one of the themes for the  SFI Future Innovator Prize Challenge Fund, in which  interdisciplinary teams are supported to develop  AI-based solutions addressing significant national and  global societal challenges.15  Thirteen projects were  awarded funding in 2020 to undertake scoping and  concept validation activities, with six of these teams  progressing to the seed phase for further validation and  prototyping of their proposed solutions in the areas of  Health, Environment and Sustainability. Building on this  initiative, Government will expand on AI for Societal  Good Challenge Funds in areas of national importance  and for transformative social impact. 13. See Akara Robotics 14.

19 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland1.3 Engaging the Public on AI and Building Trust There are many assumptions and misunderstandings about AI and its short- and  long-term impacts on the economy and society. Popular narratives, science fiction,  and media hype tend to influence our thinking about AI but are often unrealistic and  lacking in nuance.  Building public trust in and engagement with AI will  be essential to the overall success of the AI Strategy.  An important element of this will be the robust  ethical and regulatory framework set out in Strand 2.  However, Government must also prioritise measures  to raise awareness about AI and create meaningful  opportunities for public participation in discussion  around AI development, governance and use cases. As part of this Strategy, Government will appoint an  AI ambassador to promote awareness among the  public and businesses of the potential that AI offers,  serving as a champion of AI as a positive force for the  economy and society. The AI ambassador will lead  a national conversation around the role of AI in our  lives, emphasising an ethical and compliant approach  and leveraging opportunities such as Science Week,  sponsored by SFI every November. T o inform the work of the AI ambassador, a Youth  Assembly on AI will be convened to discuss young  people’s attitudes to, concerns about, and visions for  an AI-powered future – its benefits, risks and impacts  on different groups in society. The Citizen’s Assembly  model has been successfully used in Ireland to facilitate  public engagement on topics such as climate change and  gender equality. Resources such as the Massive Open Online Course  (MOOC) on the Elements of AI, hosted by University  College Cork (UCC) will be used to educate the general  public about AI. This MOOC is freely available and  aims to deliver AI education to at least 1% of the Irish  population.  Elements of AI Massive Open Online Course  (MOOC) - https://www.elementsofai.com/ie “The Elements of AI” is a free online course, already being used in ma ny countries and now being made  available here in Ireland by UCC through a dedicated Irish portal. The objective of the course is to  encourage everyone, regardless of age or educational background, to learn the basics of AI. In completing  the course online at their own pace, students will become familiar wit h many key concepts from the field  of AI and will be provided with a certificate of completion from UCC. The course was originally designed  and organised by the University of Helsinki and Reaktor, a Finnish technology company. It has been made  available for free in all Member States by the Finnish EU presidency of 2019. An Irish language version of  the course will be released in 2021.

21 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandStrand 2:   A Governance Ecosystem that  Promotes Trustworthy AI  2.1 Introduction The use of AI-based systems brings risks such as opaque  decision-making, discrimination, bias, privacy issues,  or use for criminal purposes. There are also challenges  in terms of ensuring explainability, accountability  and fairness. Successful and smooth deployment of  AI across the economy and society requires a robust  governance framework to safeguard against these  risks and underpin public trust in AI. Such a framework  must balance the need to ensure that businesses and  organisations can reap AI opportunities, with the need  to protect citizens and consumers against potential  risks.  Government will ensure a strong governance  framework for AI, based on three pillars:   An agile and appropriate legal framework;   Active promotion of ethics guidance and  frameworks; and   A robust system of standards and certification. 2.2 Potential Risks of AI POTENTIAL FOR DISCRIMINATION AND BIAS   There is a risk that AI systems could lead to unfair  discrimination and unequal treatment.16  The risk of  discrimination can arise in many ways, for instance  biased training data, biased design of algorithms, or  biased use of AI systems.  AI-based systems have the potential to exacerbate  existing structural inequities and marginalisation  of vulnerable groups. For instance, AI-based facial  recognition technology that has been trained  disproportionately on lighter skin tones may be  significantly less accurate in relation to people of colour  and can thus exhibit higher false positive rates for this  population.  The effects of decision-making and profiling by unfairly  biased and discriminatory AI-based systems can be  far-reaching. Public administrations around the world  are experimenting with the use of algorithmic decisionmaking and predictive analytics in high-stakes areas  such as policing, housing assistance, healthcare and  eligibility for social benefits. In the private sector, the  use of algorithms in decision-making can also have  significant effects, for instance in decisions concerning  recruitment or access to insurance and credit. Objective An agile and appropriate governance and regulatory environment for AI  16.  See for example Safiya Noble, Algorithms of Oppression (2018); Virgina Eubanks, Automating Inequality (2018); Ruha Benjamin, Race After  T echnology (2019), Meredith Broussard, Artificial Unintelligence (2018); Angwin, J., Larson, J. Mattu, S. and Kirchner, L., ‘Machine Bias’ ,  ProPublica. 23 May 2016.  
22 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandTRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY   Transparency in the use of AI systems is critical for  building public trust. The opaque nature of many AI  algorithms may also obscure the reasoning behind  AI-based decisions and can cause problems from the  perspective of explainability and accountability. It is  therefore important to ensure that information about  how AI systems make consequential decisions is public  and understandable. 2.3 Legal Framework for  Trustworthy AI   PROPOSED EU HORIZONTAL REGULATORY FRAMEWORK FOR AI The European Commission sees a clear European  regulatory framework for AI as essential to building  public trust, and therefore for accelerating uptake,  innovation and investment in these technologies. The  Commission White Paper on Artificial Intelligence – a  European approach to excellence and trust (2020) outlined  the main principles of a future EU regulatory framework  for AI and proposes to establish an ‘ecosystem of trust’  (as well as an ecosystem of excellence) in order to  address the perceived risks that AI may present. The  Irish national position on the European Commission’s  White Paper on AI can be viewed online. 17 In April 2021, the Commission proposed legislative  action on a horizontal framework for AI, focusing on issues of safety and respect for fundamental rights.18   The combination of the  proposed Regulation and a new  Coordinated Plan on AI with Member States is intended  to provide for an ecosystem of trust. The proposed  new rules are designed to be proportionate and  flexible, following a risk-based approach to address the  specific challenges posed by different categories and  applications of AI systems (classified as unacceptable  risk; high-risk; limited risk, and minimal risk). Ireland will continue to play an active part in discussions  at EU level to define a balanced and future-proof  regulatory framework that ensures the protection of  fundamental rights, while fostering innovation and  harnessing the opportunities presented by AI.  Given the evolving nature of and challenges  posed by AI, flexibility and experimentation can be  important elements to ensure an innovation-friendly,  evidence-based and resilient governance framework.  Mechanisms for voluntary and self-regulatory  oversight of AI will be considered for non-high-risk AI,  for example, pilot programs, standards, labelling and  certification schemes and regulatory sandboxes. Other  policy tools such as impact assessments, industry-led  codes of practice and ethical guidelines will also be used Such a multi-faceted approach effectively integrates  laws, regulatory institutions and voluntary systems. We  believe that this ‘smart mix’ of voluntary and mandatory  measures will help to protect our people, facilitate  innovation in AI and respect our democratic values.   17.

23 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandROLE OF RELEVANT NATIONAL AUTHORITIES AND  REGULATORY BODIES An effective system of monitoring and enforcement is  an essential component of the governance framework  for AI. The proposed EU rules on AI will be enforced  through a governance system at Member State  level based on a system of notifying authorities, and  a cooperation mechanism at Union level with the  establishment of a European Artificial Intelligence  Board.  Government will consider the establishment of an  appropriate mechanism for ensuring a coordinated  approach by different regulators in Ireland to digital,  including AI, as part of the forthcoming National Digital  Strategy.  EXPERIMENTAL REGULATION – REGULATORY  SANDBOXES FOR AI  In its proposed new regulation for AI, the EU  encourages Member States to establish regulatory  sandboxes to give small and medium enterprises  the opportunity to experiment with innovative AI  approaches and provides a specific framework to do  so.19  Such sandboxes provide a structured context for  experimentation, enabling the testing of innovative  technologies, products, services or approaches in a  real-world environment and for a limited time, under  regulatory supervision and ensuring that appropriate  safeguards are in place. They are particularly useful in  areas where there is uncertainty about how regulations should be interpreted. The Government will consider  the potential and requirements of regulatory sandboxes  for AI in selected sectors.  IMPACT OF AI ON EXISTING REGULATION Much of the existing regulatory acquis also applies in  the context of AI. However, given some of the novelties  posed by AI, some legal gaps may emerge where  existing regulations do not yet offer legal certainty or  do not comprehensively tackle the potential adverse  effects of AI. In some cases, the gap can be bridged  with interpretive guidance. However, in other instances  updated or new regulation may be needed.  In addition to proposals at EU level for the regulation  of AI, work is ongoing at national level to examine and  address legal gaps for AI. For example, the Company  Law Review Group submitted a report on AI to the  T ánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and  Employment in December 2020, which analysed  possible impacts of the increased use of AI in the  context of company law and corporate governance  matters.20 This work to address regulatory gaps spans a wide  range of legal and regulatory regimes including data  protection; justice; policing; intellectual property;  transport and haulage; finance; health; human rights,  export controls; consumer protection; competition law  and company law.A Risk-Based Approach to Regulation Prohibited Permitted subject to compliance  with AI requirements and ex-ante  conformity assessment Permitted but subject to information/ transparency obligations Permitted with no restrictions HIGH RISK  e.g. recruitment, medical devices AI WITH SPECIFIC TRANSPARENCY  OBLIGATIONS   ‘impersonation’ (bots) MINIMAL OR NO RISK UNACCEPTABLE RISK    e.g social scoring “NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE” 19.

24 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland2.4 Ethics and International  AI Governance  AI systems should also respect the ethical values of  society. In recent years, a number of ethics frameworks  for AI have been developed in order to encourage  developers and deployers of AI to integrate ethical  considerations throughout the AI systems entire  lifecycle. Most relevant within a European context are  the EU Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI.   THE EU ETHICS GUIDELINES FOR   TRUSTWORTHY AI The EU High-Level Expert Group on AI (HLEG on AI)  was established by the European Commission and  published a set of Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI in April 2019 after a wide stakeholder consultation, which  were subsequently endorsed by the Commission.21  An  Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) accompanies  the Guidelines and provides an operational framework  to support their application by AI developers and users.  A practical web-based tool has been developed to  facilitate compliance and is hosted by the Insight Centre  for Data Analytics at UCC, funded by SFI. 22  Government’s approach to driving AI adoption by  businesses will have ethics at its heart. This will be  assisted by the National AI Innovation Hub which  (together with the other European Digital Innovation  Hubs) will provide advisory support to businesses to help  them in assessing the trustworthiness of AI systems.  This will include providing case studies and toolkits for  SMEs to implement ethical and trustworthy AI.   EU High Level Expert Group on AI: Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI The EU High Level Expert Group on AI (AI HLEG), an independent expert group set up by the European  Commission, published a set of Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI in April 2019. They provide a useful  framework to consider the challenges posed by AI, based on three main components: (i) legality; (ii) ethics;  and (iii) robustness.    The Guidelines list seven more detailed requirements: Online T ool for Assessment of Trustworthy AI  The Assessment List for Trustworthy AI (ALTAI) is a check list of questions for business and organisations  to assess whether the AI system that is being developed, deployed or procured adheres to the seven  requirements of Trustworthy AI, as specified in the EU AI HLEG Ethics Guidelines.  An online tool, hosted by the Insight Centre at UCC, is available at: http://altai.insight-centre.org for all  users wishing to assess their AI systems and products. The tool has b een designed  to practically guide  developers and deployers of AI through an accessible and dynamic checklist for the seven requirements of  trustworthy AI.   Human agency and oversight   T echnical robustness and safety   Privacy and data governance   Transparency  Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness   Environmental and societal well-being   Accountability. 21.

25 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandINTERNATIONAL AI GOVERNANCE A human rights-based approach to AI is increasingly  supported by multilateral standard-setting  organisations, such as the United Nations (UN), the  UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation  (UNESCO), the Organisation for Economic Cooperation  and Development (OECD) and the Council of Europe.23   Human rights are protected by law and as such should  underpin ethics guidance for AI. In May 2019, the OECD released a Recommendation on  Artificial Intelligence , which includes a set of Principles for  responsible stewardship of trustworthy AI. 24 The OECD  also provides the secretariat for the Global Partnership  on AI (GPAI) launched in July 2020.  At Council of Europe level, an Ad Hoc Committee on  Artificial Intelligence (CAHAI) has been established  to examine the feasibility and potential elements  of a legal framework for the development, design  and application of AI. Recognising the limitations of  voluntary ethics guidelines, the CAHAI explicitly aims  at ensuring the protection of human rights, democracy  and the rule of law through a mix of binding and nonbinding legal instruments, possibly including a new  international convention on AI. At UNESCO, work  has begun on a draft Recommendation on the Ethics of Artificial Intelligence , to be adopted later this year. Irish  representatives are actively participating in these  discussions.  Ireland will continue to monitor and participate in  discussion on AI governance in these multinational fora. ETHICAL AND HUMAN RIGHTS IMPACT  ASSESSMENTS OF AI SYSTEMS  Impact assessments are an important tool to identify  and mitigate any potential risks of adverse impacts  of AI. These impact assessments can be carried out  voluntarily under an ethics-based approach, but  they can also be incorporated under a binding legal  framework. EU law already requires Impact Assessments in specific  sectors, such as Data Protection Impact Assessments  (DPIAs) under the GDPR. The Assessment List for  Trustworthy AI (ALTAI), specifically refers to the need  to perform a fundamental rights impact assessment  for AI systems and provides examples of relevant  questions for this purpose.25  The Council of Europe also  recommends that Governments should conduct human  rights impact assessments in the area of AI.26   Deploying AI in certain public service areas - for  example policing - will require particular attention from  an ethical and human rights perspective. In driving  public service adoption of AI, the GovT ech Delivery  Board will consider appropriate safeguards – including  the potential use of impact assessments - to ensure that  the use of AI within the Public Service is consistent with  ethical principles and with human rights obligations. PROMOTING RESEARCH ON ETHICAL AND  SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS OF AI AI applications and implications are multidisciplinary  and can raise complex new ethical and societal issues.  T o respond appropriately, an interdisciplinary approach  should be taken, incorporating a broad range of  perspectives, including engineering, natural and social  sciences, law, arts and the humanities. It is important  that interdisciplinary perspectives on AI be integrated  into technology education and training to build the  capacities of developers, policymakers and regulators to  understand the multi-faceted impacts of AI systems.Global Partnership on AI (GPAI) GPAI is an international, multi-party initiative  bringing global experts together to foster  collaboration and coordination on applied AI  issues. It is supported by a secretariat hosted  at the OECD, along with Centres of Expertise  in Montréal and Paris.  Four working groups have been formed to  focus on the following themes:  -  responsible use of AI  (including a subgroup on  AI in the Pandemic Response)  - data governance;  - the future of work;  - innovation and commercialization  23.  Notable applications of the international human rights framework to issues of AI governance can be found in reports published by several UN  Special Rapporteurs, e.g. A/73/348, report on Artificial Intelligence technologies and im plications for freedom of expression and the information  environment; A/74/493, report on the use of digital technologies in the welfare state; A/HRC/41/41, report on the rights to freedom of peaceful  assembly and of association: The Digital Age; A_HRC_44_57, report on Racial discrimination and emerging digital technologies: a human rights  analysis.  24.

26 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandResearch on Ethical and Societal Impacts of AI Recognising the need to ensure an ethical and evidence-informed approach to the development of AI in  Ireland and to build research capacity to address the key societal challenges posed, research in these areas  is ongoing at numerous research institutions in Ireland, including tho se supported by SFI.  For example, University College Dublin (UCD) hosts a Machine Ethics Research Group27  and Dublin City  University (DCU) hosts an Institute of Ethics28 , with projects on inclusive robotics, as well as on privacy  and big data. Trinity College Dublin offers an ‘Ethics Lab’ elective and an ‘Ethics Canvas’ , including  consideration of questions around the future use of AI systems.29  Ireland also participates in numerous European research initiativ es in this area: T echnological University  Dublin is one of eight partners in a pilot initiative of the “European University of T echnology – Eut+”  Alliance to prepare technologically responsible citizens through Euro pean Universities of the future.30   Supported by the European Commission, Trinity has established the international and interdisciplinary  HUMAN+ fellowship program, led by the Long Room Hub Arts and Humanities Research Institute  and the SFI ADAPT Centre. It includes a project on the Ethics of AI and connects researchers from the  arts and humanities with researchers from computer sciences and engineering, with the aim of driving  technological innovations from the human perspective. 31 In 2021, the ADAPT Centre, Science Gallery Dublin and other partners engaged in an innovative  multidisciplinary collaboration between artists and technologists on the theme of bias, exploring AI, Ethics,  Trust and Justice.32 In a Europe-wide first, a cutting-edge law and technology module has been rolled out  for undergraduate students at Maynooth University. 27. https://aristotle.ucd.ie/#about 28. https://www.dcu.ie/ethics 29. https://www.tcd.ie/trinity-electives/electives/The-ethics-lab/  and www.ethicscanvas.org 30. https://www.univ-tech.eu/ 31. https://humanplus.ie/ 32. https://dublin.sciencegallery.com/bias 33. ISO/IEC JTC 1 SC 42.2.5 Standards and Certification  for Trustworthy AI STANDARDS Standardisation is key to delivering the accountability  and trust needed to ensure commercial and societal  acceptance of AI. Standards provide an important  means to give technical effect to a principle or  regulation in a way that can be evaluated, compared  and certified, thereby offering a compliance pathway.  T o support the role of standards, assurance tools and  services are also needed. Existing models of assurance  – audits, certification schemes, accreditation processes  and impact assessments – can all form part of an AI  assurance ecosystem.Ireland, through the National Standards Authority  of Ireland (NSAI), participates in the International  Standards Organisation (ISO), which is undertaking  standardisation work relating to AI.33  There is already  a well-developed expertise in AI Standardisation here  in Ireland and the ADAPT Centre, in collaboration with  NSAI, has secured over €1 million in EU funding to  recruit and train the next generation of international  standards experts. Ireland established a T op T eam on Standards for  AI in 2020, with the ambition to expand Ireland’s  international leadership in AI Standards development.  Led by the NSAI, the T op T eam is working with  academia, industry and regulators to develop a roadmap  for AI Standards and Assurance. It will also explore  what guidance and assistance is needed for Irish  enterprises and organisations to embrace AI safely and  ethically, utilising standards that are published and in  development. 
27 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandCERTIFICATION Certification schemes or codes of conduct (whether  voluntary or mandatory) are another way of building  trust in AI systems and providing a pathway to  compliance. Certification can provide independent and  effective assurance that the protection and security  of personal data involved in the training, testing, and  application of AI algorithms, models and systems  accords with international and Irish standards. This can  be used to drive efficient, responsible, accountable and  ethical AI data processing of personal data. For example,  the Code of Conduct and Certification mechanisms  under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  are a means by which compliance with that Regulation  can be verified. This can be especially helpful and advantageous  where the outcomes of AI usage in data processing  operations may lead to decisions that have impact or  a risk to individuals. It is possible these risks can be significant in some cases and that this could lead to bias,  discrimination or a limitation of rights.  The T op T eam on Standards will examine ways to  support the development of certification schemes and  codes of conduct to address particular aspects of AI  processing or different stages of AI development and  operations in areas such as:     explainability and transparency   determination or demonstration of fairness   estimations of bias in training data   mechanisms to effectively audit AI systems   securing AI datastores and training sets   data minimisation and anonymisation techniques  that provide for effective outputs or AI “decisions”   effective support for GDPR rights in AI systems   design principles for AI systems that ensure  effective data protection Objective An agile and appropriate governance and regulatory environment for AI Strategic Actions i.

28 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland Strand 3:   Driving Adoption of AI in Irish  Enterprise Ireland is the location for the European headquarters  of many of the largest global Information and  Communications T echnology (ICT) businesses, and our  technology-oriented businesses already form a solid  base for the successful development, commercialisation  and use of AI. In the 2020 Government AI Readiness  Index, Ireland ranks second in the world in terms of  the technology sector metrics (based on per capita  measures).  However, AI is not just for leading edge  businesses. The greatest economic benefit of AI will be  generated by widespread adoption of AI technologies  by enterprises of all sizes – from small SMEs through to  MNEs - to enhance their productivity. Under the AI Strategy, Government will drive  widespread adoption of AI across the Irish enterprise  base through a phased approach of awareness-building,  opportunities to experiment and pilot, assistance with  planning and capacity building for AI, and assistance  for implementation. Government will also encourage  and facilitate the continued and growing interaction  between research and industry on AI, as well as  encouraging collaboration and spillovers between  SMEs and global businesses located in Ireland. We  will promote the use of AI to transform our economy,  fundamentally rethinking business models to reap  productivity gains and create new areas of growth. Objective Increased productivity through a step change in AI adoption by Irish enterprise 34.  See Purdy, M. & Daughery, D.

Globally, it is estimated that the application of AI could double economic  growth by 2035.34  PWC has forecasted that AI will boost Ireland’s GDP by 11.6 %  or €48 billion in 2030.35  Businesses can use AI to improve existing products, develop  new products, and increase their understanding of customer needs. AI adoption can  also deliver efficiencies, process improvements and increased production quality  for businesses. AI can help to foster a workforce culture of problem solving and selflearning, and improve the diffusion of innovation. 
29 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland3.2 Readiness of Irish Enterprise to Adopt AI There is a growing number of businesses in Ireland that are moving towards digitalisation and integration of AI into  their business models. From a small base of companies in the early 2000s, Enterprise Ireland has seen a steady  growth in the number of AI entrepreneurs and start-ups assisted b y the agency - from companies that have used  AI algorithms to provide data analytical services, to a range of applications including customised voice-driven  customer experiences; global procurement tendering services; and educational course assessment. AI has become  an important productivity driver for a wide range of sectors, including technology, financial services, agriculture,  mobility, engineering and life sciences. In addition, there has been a growing number of SMEs adopting AI into  their existing business models and operations to improve competitiveness and product development. Typical uses  of AI by Irish businesses include optimising manufacturing practices, improving customer services, supply chain  optimisation and risk management.  What Does AI Offer to SMEs? For most Irish SMEs, the best way to benefit from AI will be by purchasing an off-the shelf AI package.   There is a wide range of AI applications that businesses can use to understand their customers better, to  transform their business processes, and to improve their products: Understanding customers AI is already helping businesses around the world gain a better unde rstanding of their customers’  behaviours and their needs. Businesses generate a lot of data as part of their daily operations, for example  sales data or website data. AI can help to translate that data into simple insights that allow businesses  make better decisions about where and how to invest their time and money. For example, helping to  identify and predict which customers are most likely to buy a product or service. Businesses can then focus  their efforts on these customers – improving productivity and efficiency.   Transforming processes AI can transform a business’s way of working by taking making its processes more efficient. Offering  personalised recommendations to customers, tailored advertising, and chatbots are all examples of  artificial intelligence being used by businesses to improve their processes to make them more efficient  and more cost-effective, and to free up staff to perform more unstructured and unpredictable tasks.  Businesses can also use AI-powered tools to perform routine tasks s uch as processing orders, issuing  refunds, or verifying customer data. Allowing AI to look after the simpler tasks means that staff are free to  allocate their time to activities that will improve overall business productivity. Using AI to automate these  simple ‘back-office’ tasks offers a quick return on the investments made in AI.  Improving products AI can be used to improve the products that businesses offer. AI can be used to improve decision making  by harnessing the large amounts of information that all businesses generate more effectively. It can offer  insights that help reduce human error or biases that might be present when creating budgets, predicting  cost, and planning project timelines for developing new products. In addition to improvements in product development, AI can also bring about improvements in the  quality control of products. AI can be trained to learn the aspects or characteristics of a product that are  important and create rules that define quality parameters. This is particularly of use where the quality of  a product is subjective, subtle, or not necessarily fixed. AI powered quality control can subsequently learn  where the risks to quality control are likely to come from more broadly and provide solutions. This means  AI can make quality control faster, cheaper, and more precise.  
30 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandIreland also ranks favourably amongst EU countries  in terms of enterprise AI adoption, recording the  highest share of enterprises using one of four key AI  applications in 2020.36  In the same year, a European  Commission enterprise survey indicated 35% of Irish  businesses have adopted at least one AI technology.37   However, more than half of the businesses surveyed  (52%) have neither adopted AI, nor plan to do so. This  mirrors the results of earlier surveys of Irish enterprise  leaders in 2019, which revealed a lack of expertise,  appetite and clarity about how to introduce AI and  related technological solutions.38 From an AI capability development perspective, the  Irish enterprise base falls into four main categories:  1. A small number of leading-edge AI businesses 2.  A small number of enterprises who are ‘born native’  AI players or established clients who started AInative offerings 3.  A small but growing number of enterprises that are  developing and/or integrating AI into their business.  4.  Majority of enterprises that are not yet engaged in  the development of AI capabilities. T o fully realise the economic benefits of AI, businesses need to be aware of the opportunities that AI represents,  and be open to adopting AI technologies to increase their productivi ty and competitiveness. For many businesses,  the decision to embed AI into their processes is a major one which requir es an investment of time, resources and  trust. There are multiple factors around technology, business model, value proposition, people and skills, technology  development, funding and change impact that must be considered by enterprises in order to plan and implement  successful AI adoption. Therefore, in advance of making the commitment  to AI transformation, businesses need to  undertake an AI development journey which addresses their needs, from the initial awareness stage to eventual  implementation. The State will put in place strong and appropriate sup port systems to assist businesses in  progressing through the AI development ladder. 2 3 4 BUSINESS BASE Businesses born   with AI Capability Businesses who adopt AI to   improve Capabilities and Offers Not Yet AI Active Businesses with Advanced   AI Capability & Offers AI CapabilityFigure 3.1: Business AI Capability - Four Main Types 36.  https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/products-eurostat-news/-/ddn-20210413-1 37.

31 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland3.3 Driving Adoption of AI by Irish Enterprises Many global ICT businesses with significant AI strengths have their European  headquarters in Ireland, and there is also much potential for learning from SMEs that  have completed the AI journey. Government sees an opportunity to benefit from this  expertise and experience by partnering with Industry to drive AI adoption across  the enterprise base. We will establish an Enterprise Digital Advisory Board, with  membership drawn from Industry, to work with and advise Government in achieving  the objective of a step change in AI adoption by Irish enterprise.  Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland will both play a lead  role. These agencies are already supporting enterprises  in working with AI, through R&I Funding and assistance,  and through targeted initiatives such as the “Earth  Observation” programme of the European Space  agency which provides valuable data sets for AI and  data analytics projects. Enterprise transformation (for  which AI will be a significant lever) is a strategic pillar for  both agencies in their respective strategies launched at  the beginning of 2021.Working with its enterprise development agencies  and the Local Enterprise Offices, and advised by the  Enterprise Digital Advisory Board, Government will use  the AI development ladder framework set out in figure  3.2 above to drive a phased approach to AI adoption  - from awareness-raising through opportunities to  connect, explore and experiment with AI, to assistance  for implementation - which can be rolled out to  enterprises, with a focus on SMEs and small businesses  across the country.

32 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandOpportunities for Businesses to Experiment with AI Solutions In recognition of the challenges that must be addressed  to help SMEs in adopting AI and digitalisation, the  European Commission, together with Member  States, is establishing a network of European Digital  Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) to play a central role in  stimulating the broad uptake of AI, High Performance  Computing (HPC) and Cybersecurity as well as other  digital technologies by industry (in particular SMEs and  midcaps), as well as by the public sector. Government is committed to establishing a number of  European Digital Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) in Ireland  under this initiative, and a competitive process has  been launched to identify candidates for national EDIH  designation.  The EDIHs will serve as “one stop shops” to provide  upskilling, innovation and advisory services (including in the area of standards, data protection, ethics and  regulatory compliance) to enterprises and public  authorities in areas aligned to AI, as well as offering  access to technical expertise, research facilities and  experimentation. The Hubs will act as SME incubators,  providing access to infrastructure, technologies and  test beds. At the core of each EDIH will be a Research  and T echnology Organisation or Higher Education  Institution lab. While all of the national EDIHs will provide valuable  resources for SMEs on the AI adoption ladder, one of  the successful candidates will be specifically designated  as a National AI Digital Innovation Hub. This Hub will  take on the role of the National First Stop for AI, acting  as the point of contact for businesses in engaging with  AI adoption and the AI innovation ecosystem.

33 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandAccess to AI T echnology Demonstrators and Applied  Research EI and IDA have established a network of T echnology  Centres which provide a valuable resource for  enterprises in experimenting with AI and accessing  applied and Industry-focused AI research. The  centres provide facilities for SMEs, MNEs and  research institutions to collaborate on market focused  innovation. Of particular relevance is CeADAR,  Ireland’s National Centre for Applied Artificial  Intelligence, which makes AI demonstrators and  prototypes available to businesses, so that they can  trial AI technologies before committing to adoption.  CeADAR has linked up and connected with over 1,000  businesses in Ireland to strengthen their AI competence  and accelerate their adoption of AI. Also of interest in terms of applied AI is IMR – the Irish  Manufacturing Research Centre. IMR works with the  manufacturing industry to demystify, derisk and deliver  emerging technologies and new knowledge, such as  AI, enabling industry to succeed at the cutting edge of  advanced manufacturing.  EI also runs a T echnology Gateway Network, in  partnership with Institutes of T echnology and  T echnical  Universities, which provides local access points for  businesses to the Irish research infrastructure, and  delivers technology solutions for enterprise. Another  important resource for businesses that want to engage  with the Irish research base is  Knowledge Transfer  Ireland, funded by EI, which helps businesses to access  State-funded technology, ideas and expertise. 
34 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandCeADAR: Ireland’s National Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence CeADAR is a market-focused technology centre, funded by EI, that drives the accelerated research,  development, and deployment of AI and data analytics technology and innovation into business. In  consultation with industry, CeADAR has developed an extensive catalogue of technology demonstrator  projects in the broad areas of AI, data analytics and machine learning,  which can be used to trial potential  AI models and solutions.  The intellectual property behind the indust ry-focused technology development  is then available for integration into businesses either directly or via licence to industry. Recently over 65%  of licences have been for Irish-based SMEs, for adoption into their business. CeADAR’s work focuses on developing tools, techniques and technologies that enable more people,  organisations and industries to use AI and analytics for better decision m aking, unlocking of hidden  insights in data and strengthening competitive advantage. The Centre acts as a bridge between the worlds  of applied research and commercial deployment. Industry membership of CeADAR now totals 90 industry  partners, ranging from multi-nationals to indigenous SMEs. CeADAR’s areas of strength include:    predictive analytics   machine and deep learning   artificial intelligence   real-time analytics  text analytics and natural language processing   data visualisation   blockchain and smart contracts   computer vision and image analytics   Above: This project with InvertRobotics and CeADAR uses a verticallyclimbing robot and Artificial Intelligence to automatically inspect  containers, tanks, piping and any confined or hazardous space.

35 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandFINANCIAL SUPPORTS FOR AI DEVELOPMENT  AND IMPLEMENTATION EI assists a growing number of enterprises and research  organisations that have engaged in AI projects, through  a range of existing R&I funding schemes (Exploring  Innovation, Agile Innovation, and R&I funds). Other  funding measures that are suitable for AI R&I projects  include the Commercialisation Fund, Regional  Enterprise Development Fund and Small Business  Innovation Research programme. AI technology development is one of the many deep  technology sectors that has been financed by the EI  Seed and Venture Capital Scheme for many years. EI  also works with co-funders in providing linkages to the  industry base that is  actively engaged in building AI  products and services. A €500 million Disruptive T echnologies Innovation  Fund (DTIF) led by the Department of Enterprise, Trade  and Employment, is designed to drive collaboration  between Ireland’s research base and industry to  develop novel technologies capable of transforming  business. Starting in 2021, the third call of the DTIF  will see 29 projects receive €95 million in funding over  the next three years. This round of the Fund covers  areas such as life sciences, medical devices, ICT, AI,  manufacturing and environmental sustainability.  Funding has been directed at AI solutions across a  number of industry sectors, including video production;  criminal justice and security; patient empowerment; and  decision support systems in medical care. Government will expand the existing funding offering  with targeted funding supports that are suitable  for the implementation needs of businesses on the  AI development ladder - for whom the best route  to AI adoption will often be to acquire off-the-shelf  AI solutions. This funding will be augmented with  diagnostic tools and other advisory assistance that  can be used to inform decision-making around  implementation of AI solutions. The European Commission has made digital  transformation (including through AI technologies)  one of the pillars of its €672.5 billion Recovery and  Resilience facility, which has been developed to mitigate  the economic and social impact of the coronavirus  pandemic.  Ireland’s National Recovery and Resilience  Plan includes an €85 million programme to drive  the adoption of digital technologies (including AI) by  businesses. DEVELOPMENT OF A NATIONAL AI CLUSTER  The high representation of global leading AI firms in  Ireland provides an opportunity to develop a national  AI cluster or platform which will drive collaboration  between multinational enterprises and SMEs, with the  objective of stimulating knowledge and technology  spillovers and building scale in AI. The Department of  Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies, EI  and IDA Ireland, will work together with the Enterprise  Digital Advisory Board to develop this AI Cluster. TECHNOLOGY AND INFRASTRUCTURE  REQUIREMENT FOR WIDESPREAD AI ADOPTION  Strand 7 of this Strategy sets out the existing and  planned infrastructure to position Ireland as a leading  location for cutting edge development and use of  AI. There is also a need to ensure easy technical and  administrative access to AI infrastructure by SMEs  and larger businesses, and to remove barriers to  collaboration between public bodies, academia and  businesses on AI innovation. Government will consider  options for an open and consistent mechanism that  supports access to cloud based solutions for businesses  adopting AI, and addresses inconsistencies and  inefficiencies that are a barrier to AI innovation and  use. This will inform the development of a national data  and AI infrastructure platform to promote appropriate  access to data and technology for AI across sectors.   
36 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland3.4 AI Sectoral Opportunities While AI offers opportunities for most enterprises, its  deployment may take different forms across sectors,  depending on the levels of their technological maturity,  the availability and relevance of industry-specific  applications and the desired business, operational and  societal objectives for the sector.  AI offers opportunities in sectors where Ireland  has comparative advantages or opportunities, and  in technology fields with the highest acceleration  potential, for example ICT; biopharmaceuticals,  healthcare and medical technologies; agri-foods;  energy; financial and business services; the creative  sector; and potential GovT ech offerings.  A number of sectors have also been suggested for  prioritisation of AI development and adoption at EU  level. The EU White Paper on AI  places emphasis on  using AI in areas where Europe is particularly strong  (machinery, transport, cybersecurity, farming, the green  and circular economy, healthcare and high value-added  sectors like fashion and tourism); and for services of  public interest, for example, by reducing the costs of  providing services (transport, education, energy and  waste management). AI initiatives are already being implemented by  enterprises in Ireland in areas such as AgriT ech,  sustainable food supply chain, livestock health  and safety, building construction waste reduction,  sustainable farming, marine science and aquaculture,  health, and in creative and design industries. This  demonstrates that Ireland already has solid foundations  for introducing AI innovations at the enterprise level.  Government will build on this, focusing on the spread  and application of AI across the wider economy, as well  as in sectors of strategic interest, aiming to incentivise  uptake. 3.5 Opportunities for  Enterprise Collaboration on AI ENGAGEMENT BY IRISH ENTERPRISES IN EU  COLLABORATION FOR AI  Promoting investment, innovation and implementation  of AI is a priority for the European Commission, and  this means that there are many EU programmes which  can provide additional funding and collaboration  opportunities in the area of AI. Government will  encourage Irish enterprises to participate in EU  opportunities, for example, Important Projects of  Common European Interest (IPCEIs) in areas such  as cloud technology and cybersecurity, the AI4EU  platform39 , and European Investment Bank funding for  AI projects. ENCOURAGING IRISH ENTERPRISE-LED  COLLABORATION FOR AI There are promising examples of enterprise-led efforts  to increase collaboration on AI. For example, Ibec (the  Irish Business and Employers Confederation) has  launched an Artificial Intelligence Advisory Forum to  help coordinate engagement on AI across enterprise  policy areas and sectors. This Forum is also working  to promote the opportunities presented by effective  deployment of AI for enterprises, public services and  wider society. Local initiatives for collaboration on AI are also  emerging around the country. There is funding in place  to support this, for example through the Regional  Enterprise Development Fund, administered by  EI.   There is also a competitive multi-annual fund of  €2.75 million for Regional T echnology Clustering  available to Institutes of T echnology (and T echnological  Universities).  39.  The AI4EU platform acts as a broker, developer and one-stop shop providing and showcasing services, expertise, algorithms, software  frameworks, development tools, components, modules, data, computing resources, prototyping functions and access to funding.
37 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandENCOURAGEMENT OF CROSS-BORDER  ENTERPRISE COLLABORATION ON AI A Border Enterprise Development Fund administered  by EI supports the international competitiveness  of enterprises in the Border Region in the context  of Brexit and other market challenges including  COVID-19. Current projects focus on AI, robotics,  machine learning, and big data. On a cross-border basis,  InterTradeIreland (ITI) is exploring a range of internal  digitalisation and data analytics projects to assist SMEs  seeking to take their first steps with AI. ITI’s Synergy  Initiative can also provide seed funding for collaborative  cross-border projects that leverage the use of AI and  data-sharing in the development of all-island sectoral  innovation ecosystems. ENGAGEMENT WITH IRELAND’S GLOBAL  TECHNOLOGY DIASPORA ON AI There is potential to strengthen linkages with  AI entrepreneurs and experts in Ireland’s global  technology diaspora, in order to facilitate collaboration,  as well as transfer of knowledge and competence.  Our diaspora holds invaluable expertise and insights  into global trade, industry, innovation and investment  opportunities and has long played a pivotal role in  creating and deepening economic connections with  Ireland. As part of Global Ireland: Ireland’s Diaspora  Strategy 2020-2025 , Government will provide support  for sector-specific Irish diaspora networks among  research and innovation-related communities. 40    40.

38 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland Strand 4: AI Serving the Public Objective Better public service outcomes through a step change in AI adoption by the Irish  public sector 4.1 Introduction Government will leverage the potential of AI to assist  in achieving excellence, innovation, and improved  productivity in the delivery of public services and in  other key activities. For example, AI applications can  contribute to better public services by improving  citizen-Government interaction, enabling smarter  analytical capabilities and increasing efficiency. The  OECD has estimated that in just a few years, the  increasing use of AI in the public sector will offer the  potential to free up nearly one-third of public servants’  time, allowing them to focus on higher-value work.41   The GovT ech Delivery Board, which is being established  to drive digital transition in the public service, will lead  on AI adoption in the public service. The Board will  ensure a coordinated public service-wide, strategic  approach to the implementation of AI, including the  establishment of common methodologies and criteria  and the creation of channels to facilitate collaboration  and shared learning between public service  organisations. Government will also aim to facilitate  and stimulate AI innovation through the regulatory and  policy environment and by using public procurement  as a catalyst for ethical and innovative AI. Furthermore,  the Public Service will aim to act as an exemplar of  responsible AI innovation, building trust through the  delivery of quality public services. 4.2 Enablers for AI in Public  Services DATA AND DIGITALISATION AS A FOUNDATION  FOR AI IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE AI is one part of a larger project to integrate digital  services within Government, overseen by an ICT  Advisory Board (chaired by the Government  Chief Information Officer) and a Digital Leaders  Group, which includes representatives from each  Government Department. Significant work has already  been undertaken by Government to advance the  digitalisation of public services – from developing  overarching strategies42  to investing in enabling  infrastructures and technologies (e.g., National  Broadband Plan, Public Services Card, MyGovID,  Revenue Online Service, Digital Postbox). This means  that many essential enablers for the AI Strategy are  already in place. AI is dependent on good quality, interoperable,  and standardised data. The legislative framework  to underpin this is in place - the Data Sharing and  Governance Act (2019) and the Public Service Data  Strategy (2019-2023 ) set out how we can use  data lawfully to empower and accelerate digital  transformation within the public sector, while ensuring  that data protection and people’s right to privacy are  protected. 41.   OECD Working Papers on Public Governance No. 36, Hello, World! Artificial Intelligence and its Use in the Public Sector, November 2019. 42.  For example, the Public Service ICT Strategy (2015) and eGovernment Strategy 2017-20
39 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandConnectivity, cloud computing43  and data security are  other prerequisites. These aspects, together with datarelated considerations, are addressed in further detail in  Strand 7. Government is also pursuing a proactive and  progressive approach to embracing cloud computing,  in recognition that cloud services represent an  important method of obtaining the speed, transparency and collaboration required to deliver a successful AI  project.44   All this foundational work places us in a good position  to ensure a consistent and principled approach to the  adoption of AI within the Public Service.    AI improves cycling infrastructure in Smart Dublin Dublin City Council and Smart Dublin, through the SynchroniCity init iative (an EU project designed to  accelerate adoption of new smart technologies), invited cyclists to take part in an innovative smart cycling  project that connected 200 cyclists across Dublin City. The project ran simultaneously in two other cities,  Antwerp and Manchester. The project provided an opportunity for the Council to be more informed in its approach to planning  and developing appropriate cycling infrastructure. Currently this requires physical observation, selfreporting, and anecdotal responses from members of the public to guide potential cycle infrastructure  improvements. The project participants received a See.Sense bicycle light and opted to share the data collected by these  sensors with the project. The See.Sense bike light identifies over 800 sensor recordings per second and  the data collected includes a mixture of sensor data (speed, road sur face quality, swerving, heavy braking)  as well as geolocated survey feedback shared via an in-app survey. Over ten weeks from June to August 2019, the results highlighted the roads with the most challenging  road surface quality for cyclists to ride through, while also allowing Dublin City Council’s engineers to  adjust plans for new cycle corridors based on the insights.  43.  Cloud computing consists of a set of technologies and service models that focus on network-based on-demand use and delivery of IT  applications, processing capability, storage and memory space. 44.  The Cloud Computing Advice Note 2019 provides high-level guidance to assist public service organisations in making informed, risk-based  decisions in relation to the adoption of cloud services. See Department of Public Expend iture and Reform, Cloud Computing Advice Note,  October 2019. Available at: https://assets.gov.ie/37039/4468be59812f40dda7003116cf05f196.pdf 
40 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland4.3 A Coordinated Approach to AI Adoption by the   Public Service  AI is already being used across the public service, but to date its adoption has been  somewhat fragmented. There are opportunities to scale the impact of AI in the  public service through a coordinated approach to adoption, including the adoption  of common methodologies and criteria and the creation of channels to promote  collaboration and shared learning between public service organisations.   Government plans to establish a GovT ech Delivery  Board, which will lead the digital transformation of  the public service. The GovT ech Delivery Board will  consider AI adoption in the public service as part of  its work, providing strategic leadership and ensuring a  coherent and cohesive approach by the public service in  adopting AI as part of its toolkit for addressing societal  issues. This work will be strongly aligned with the  implementation of the Public Service Innovation Strategy ,  which has Transformative Innovation as one of its four  Priorities.  Important issues which must be addressed by the Board  include:   STRONG SECURITY TO UNDERPIN USE OF AI   IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE A vigilant approach to cybersecurity will be essential to  successful adoption of AI and other digital technologies  by the public service. With input, as appropriate,  from the National Cyber Security Centre, the  GovT ech Delivery Board will consider what controls  are appropriate to ensure a secure system for AI  development and use in the public service. ETHICAL AND COMPLIANCE CONSIDERATIONS Use of AI within the public service must be actively  informed by an assessment of the potential human  rights and equality implications and should also be  carefully managed in accordance with privacy and  broader ethical and legal frameworks. As outlined in  Strand 2, it is essential that safeguards are put in place  to address the risk of discrimination and bias in AI.   AI-enabled Government services should also  incorporate adequate arrangements in terms of  accountability and traceability, enabling ex-post  verification. The public service can demonstrate a lead  in adopting and operationalising principles for the responsible and ethical use and governance of data  and AI in the public sector. This can be achieved by  promulgating standards and guidelines for ethical data  sharing within the Public Service (Data Governance  Board) and by adopting the AI Ethics Guidelines  developed by the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI.   Government will also consider options for conducting  human rights and ethical impact assessments for AI in  the public sector (covered in more detail in Strand 2). The Board will develop, agree and publish principles  for the responsible and ethical use and governance of  AI, which will apply to all AI developed for and used by  the Public Service. In collaboration with UCC, which is  hosting an online tool to facilitate operationalisation  of The Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial  Intelligence (ALTAI), developed by the EU AI HLEG, the  Board will develop case studies as an example of how to  operationalise Ethical AI Guidelines. The design, development and procurement of AI-based  technologies used for public services must also adhere  to the statutory requirements on accessibility contained  in the Disability Act 2005, the Web Accessibility  Directive 2018 and the Public Procurement Directives  2016, as well as complying with universal design  principles.45  BUILDING AI SKILLS AND CAPACITY  The Board will consider the needs of the public service  in terms of the development of AI talent. In order to  build the skills, capacity and awareness needed for the  successful adoption of AI in the public service, including  an ability to assess the benefits and risks involved, it will  also be essential to consider investment in programmes  for the training and upskilling of existing public sector  workers.    45.

Furthermore, it  can help stimulate demand and offer of ethical and  trustworthy AI technologies. In its Coordinated Plan on  AI, the European Commission has recommended that  the public sector should lead the way in purchasing  ethical and trustworthy AI applications by utilising  public procurement policies as a strategic lever. T o drive  this, the Commission plans to initiate a programme  called Adopt AI  to support the public procurement of AI  systems through collective purchasing power and open  sectoral dialogues stimulating industry involvement.46    Guidance is also available from the UK, which, together  with the World Economic Forum, has developed a  workbook of best practice and case studies addressing  the specific challenges of acquiring AI technologies in  government.47   The GovT ech Delivery Board will work with the Office  of Government Procurement (OGP) to consider  mechanisms for public procurement of AI which enable  public purchasing power to act as a catalyst for the  development and use of trustworthy AI. For example,  in the area of cloud technologies, the OGP has recently  published a Cloud Services Procurement Guidance Note. Instruments such as dialogues, hackathons and  pre-commercial procurement of innovative solutions  will enable suppliers to respond better to public  procurement requests, and also assist public authorities  to understand the market better and formulate  targeted procurements. ENCOURAGING AI EXPERIMENTATION IN   THE PUBLIC SERVICE AND WIDER ECOSYSTEM   COLLABORATION We will encourage collaboration between the Public  Service and the wider economy and society to innovate  in using AI to address societal problems. Shared  solutions can be co-developed through mechanisms like  innovation sprints, Challenge Funds and hackathons. A  challenge-based approach to Open Data for AI will also  be explored to understand how access to public sector  data might help deliver positive and practical outcomes  for AI use cases in different sectoral areas of focus.  Another way to develop AI solutions for the Public  Service is through external partnerships. The GovT ech  Delivery Board will consider new models for working  with AI experts from the private sector, as well as  from academia/research communities. As an example,  the SFI Public Sector Fellowship  provides a vehicle for  partnership between highly skilled academics and the  public sector on AI-related projects. Case Study: SFI Public Sector Fellowship Programme - Fostering Innovation  within the Public Sector The SFI Public Service Fellowship Programme was launched as a pilot in 2020, recognising the importance  of connecting the Irish research community with public sector organisations to help inform new policy and  improve the services that they deliver. With total grant funding in excess of €700,000, the Programme  offers researchers a unique opportunity to be seconded to Government Departments, agencies and the  Oireachtas Library and Research Services, to work on specific research projects.  The Fellowships awarded are specifically designed to foster innovation within the Public Sector by  supporting the development and implementation of data-driven and evidence-based approaches.  Fellowships can last between three and twelve months and projects offered by the hosts include a wide  range of topics – including the economic, social and ethical implications of technological innovation; data  analytics for signals of emerging food safety risks; the economic cost of discr imination and the benefits of  diversity in the workplace. There is a strong emphasis on the use of AI to address the projects that will be  carried out by the Fellows. In this context, a Fellowship has been awarded to a researcher from the ADAPT  Centre, who will be hosted by the Houses of the Oireachtas Library and Research Service to conduct  research on the economic, social and ethical implications of AI and B ig Data.48   46.

42 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandLANGUAGE TECHNOLOGY RESOURCES FOR AI   IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  T echnologies such as Natural Language Processing  (the ability to interpret human language, including  translation) and speech recognition represent an  important component of AI-based systems, for example,  in the development of intelligent virtual assistants  (e.g., Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant) and in analysis of unstructured data. Many of the language datasets  currently used for training AI systems originate from  US-based sources and may not contain common  everyday terms used by people in Ireland. T o render AI  systems accessible to a wider range of our population,  as well as to develop services in Irish based on AI for  Irish language-speakers, good language technology  resources need to be developed.  Case Study: Developing Irish Language Technology T ools and Resources   for AI Department of T ourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media (DTCAGSM) is currently funding a  number of projects to promote the development of language technology tools and resources in Irish.  For example, DCU has developed Irish language computer translation systems and a research project at  Trinity College Dublin is developing an Irish language synthesiser - a system that can translate written  text into language spoken in the different dialects (www.Abair.ie).  A Digital Plan for the Irish Language is  currently being prepared by these universities to underpin future technological opportunities.  There are also several machine translation projects ongoing with EU funding, including Irish participation  in the European Language Resources Consortium and in the Europea n Language Resource Infrastructure.  One of the challenges in this area is obtaining sufficient amounts of la nguage data within different  domains, such as health, ICT and transport. Where possible, Government will promote awareness of Irish  language data and resources in the public sector and co-operate on strategies to ensure that public sector  language resources can be used for language technology purposes, where appropriate..   
43 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland4.4 High Impact Sectors for AI  in the Public Service  Deployment of AI systems within the Public Service is  still in the early stages. Under this Strategy Government  will drive the use of AI by the Public Service, aiming for  targeted and transformative interventions. However,  this will be dependent on the availability of good quality  data. There are already numerous AI pilots and projects  underway across the Public Service in areas ranging  from health to agriculture, environment, revenue,  customer service, smart cities and regions. Some examples of high impact sectors for AI are  outlined in this section, which is by no means exhaustive.  The EU AI High Level Expert Group (AI HLEG) identifies  several areas of opportunity within the public sector  where it considers the adoption of AI to be of utmost  importance for the well-being of society, as well as  for enhancing sustainable growth - these are: the  e-Government domain; Justice and law enforcement;  and the Healthcare sector.49  The European Commission  is prioritising public sector dialogues on AI in  healthcare, rural administrations and among public  service operators,50  and it has outlined the creation of  data spaces in health, agriculture and transport.51   Irish Revenue AI voicebot helps citizens handle tax clearance In early 2018, the Irish Revenue Commissioners initiated a pilot project to examine if AI-based Natural  Language Processing (NLP) technologies could be used to deliver an improved customer service, reduce  costs and increase efficiencies. This resulted in the implementation of a Virtual Digital Agent (VD A), or voicebot, designed to focus on  a subset of calls from the Irish taxpayer relating to tax clearance. A high proportion of these calls are  reasonably repetitive and the knowledge required to provide suitable responses and positive experiences  for customers is well understood.  A suite of integrated technologies was used to convert customer speech to text, understand the text  using NLP so that a response could be formulated, and then convert this response back to speech so the  customer could hear the answer. The Revenue demonstrated that voicebot technology can offer a fully  automated service, providing an efficient, effective experience for customers. Below is a summary of some  of the results:   Up to 50% of calls were handled from start to finish by the voicebot   70% of first-time applicants engaged with the voicebot when submitting their application   75% of tax clearance holders were able to retrieve their tax clearance access number (TCAN)   Only 10% of calls were transferred due to failure to understand. The project won the award for the Best Use of Artificial Intelligence in Government at the 2019 CogX  awards in London. However, one of the main challenges in extending beyond a pilot project is the  requirement to implement a secure authentication model, suitable for these new technologies. The  success of the project has encouraged the Revenue Commissioners to deploy this technology in future  service offerings. 49.

44 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandHEALTH SECTOR Health is an area in which substantial potential  benefits can be realised through the application of AI,  for example in imaging procedures, decision-making,  self-monitoring by patients and early detection of  diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated  this trend. AI presents a particular opportunity to drive  improvements in productivity and service within this  sector in the context of constrained healthcare budgets  and resources. Industry and academia (and increasingly  frontline professionals) have already begun to recognise  the potential benefits that AI can offer the health  service in Ireland and there is significant R&I investment  in the area. However, Ireland’s Competitiveness  Challenge 2019  report identified medical sector  digitalisation as particularly low in Ireland, compared to  the EU average.52   T o underpin successful AI adoption in the health sector,  elements to be considered include the availability of  quality data (the health service remains predominantly  paper-based), privacy and data security, risk, ownership  of data, appropriate skills and resources, and health  economics. Delivering a modern and responsive  infrastructure is a core component of the ten-year  Sláintecare programme and will involve consolidating  and investing in data and R&I, rolling out the Individual  Health Identifier  and the Electronic Health Record, and  developing a health information policy framework.53   Patient information, medical records, diagnostic results,  and clinical studies are just a few of the data sources  available in this area. The Health Research Regulations  (2018) provide for the processing of identifiable data  for the purposes of health research, to ensure that  patients maintain confidence and trust that their  information is used in a sound, ethical and secure  manner. The Department of Health is also advancing  a National Research Ethics Committees Bill which will  set out a framework for establishing National Research  Ethics Committees (RECs) in certain areas, which may  include genomics and AI.  JUSTICE SECTOR The EU e-Justice Strategy and Action Plan 2019-2023   identifies the use of AI as a priority area in the justice  field. Administrations around the world are exploring  how AI can be used to support the work of legal  professionals, courts and law enforcement officials.  Automated decision-support tools can yield increased  fairness and efficiency for judicial systems. For example,  algorithmic risk assessment tools can be used to inform  decisions about pretrial detention, sentencing, and  bail, with the potential to improve consistency and  predictability.  However, the use of AI within the justice sector also has  considerable implications for ethics, human rights and  the rule of law. The Council of Europe has developed  an Ethical Charter on the use of AI in judicial systems and  their environment . This charter identifies the following  areas as lower risk and best suited to the early adoption  of AI technologies: the development of case law by  linking doctrine, case law, laws and regulations; the  determination of compensation awards; and on-line  dispute resolution.54 AI can provide new tools and insights for policing and  law enforcement,. The principal areas of AI application  in this field include predictive policing, and the gathering  and analysis of evidence. Under An Garda Síochána’s  Digital Strategy 2019-2023 , digital policing is evolving  rapidly with innovations emerging around AI and  robotics. The EU has highlighted human rights and  ethical considerations as paramount when considering  the use of AI in the context of law enforcement and  Ireland is actively involved in discussions regarding the  future EU framework in this area.55   52.

45 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandAGRICULTURE SECTOR Agri-Digitalisation policy in Ireland is led by the  Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. The  T eagasc T echnology Foresight 2035  report highlights  several key technologies, including AI and robotics,  as priorities for research and innovation to ensure a  sustainable agriculture sector. In 2019, Ireland signed  a joint EU declaration on A smart and sustainable digital  future for European agriculture and rural areas,  promoting  a comprehensive approach towards digitalisation in this  sector, including an important role for AI.56  AI-powered solutions and robots can support farmers,  for example, in livestock production and ensuring animal  welfare, breeding, harvesting crops, and significantly  reducing the use of inputs such as fertilisers, pesticides  or irrigation water, thus leading to significant economic  and environmental benefits. The availability of data,  both generated by the increasing digitalisation of  agriculture, as well as data from earth observation  or climate data, is an important enabler for the  acceleration and development of AI-based solutions in  this domain. The use of AI technologies will also play  an important role in modernising the EU Common  Agricultural Policy (CAP).  Case Study: Common Agricultural Policy Modernisation through use of AI The Area Monitoring System (AMS) is an example of how the use of new innovative technologies can aid  in modernising the agricultural sector. AMS is defined as the regular and systematic observation, tracking  and assessment of agricultural activities and practices on agricultural areas by Copernicus Sentinel  Satellite data, or other data with at least equivalent value. To facilitate the implementation of the AMS,  which will be compulsory in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) post-2020, a phased introduction is  being implemented by Ireland for various schemes over the interim period.  The first phase will see Checks by Monitoring (CbM) being used for the Protein Aid Scheme in 2021.  Checks by Monitoring is an automated and continuous process which will use data from Copernicus  Sentinel satellites, along with other data sources, to determine the agr icultural activity on all land parcels  declared by farmers under the Protein Aid Scheme in 2021. CbM allows the monitoring of the whole  population of aid recipients, rather than focusing on checks of a sample of farmers. Currently, in order to  verify farmers’ declarations and adherence to eligibility rules, paying agencies have had to carry out field  inspections for a sample of around 5% of farmers. Under this approach, all agricultural parcels are subject  to the same monitoring process. The use of Copernicus Sentinel data and other technologies for mon itoring area aid can have significant  potential benefits for farmers and administrations. The CbM approach can take new information into  account at any time during the growing season (such as newly acquired, more recent Sentinel data, geotagged photos, or other documents sent by the farmer), and it therefore provides more opportunities  for farmers to rectify their claims. Warning notifications can also be issued to farmers, giving them the  opportunity to amend their claim accordingly. The monitoring approach can help to reduce the number of  non-compliances. 56.  https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/news/eu-member-states-join-forces-digitalisation-european-agriculture-and-rural-areas

47 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland Strand 5:   A Strong AI Innovation Ecosystem Objective A strong Irish ecosystem for high-quality and responsible AI research and Innovation 5.1 Introduction Ireland has a strong innovation landscape of entrepreneurs and agile innovation  businesses. Many of our academic researchers are internationally renowned for their  excellence in AI and sit on influential international committees and working groups  relating to AI research, development and governance.  In addition, we have built a strong ecosystem for  industry-academic research through purpose-built  programmes such as the SFI Research Centres, SFI  Industry Fellowships and SFI Strategic Partnership  Programmes. Ireland ranks highly in a number of global  AI indices and is also recognised as an important centre  of activity and talent in the analysis and use of data,  which is a key factor in the development of AI.57  Ireland  was ranked sixth in the EU Digital Economy and Society  Index (DESI) in 2020, reflecting our high level of digital  competitiveness.58  In terms of per capita expenditure  on investments in AI, Ireland ranks in second place  within the EU.59Under this Strategy, these strategic advantages will  be leveraged to build a leadership position in AI.  Government will develop a supportive ecosystem  along the entire AI value chain, promoting strong links  between industry, research, and academia, so that  innovative researchers, enterprises and entrepreneurs  that are involved in developing and using AI are  connected both to each other and to appropriate  support systems. Government will aim to create the  optimum conditions and incentives to accelerate the  adoption of AI-based solutions, including by start-ups  and SMEs. International cooperation and embracing  all-island opportunities will also be fundamental for  bringing Irish AI research and innovation (R&I) to the  forefront. 57. In 2020, Ireland ranked twelfth in the Global AI Index. See The Global AI Index - T ortoise (tortoisemedia.com) 58.

48 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland5.2 A Strong R&I Ecosystem for AI Ireland has made successful strategic investments in AI R&I, as well as related  technology areas over the past fifteen to twenty years, leading to global recognition  for a number of our AI researchers and centres. With the aim of enhancing Ireland’s  reputation as a leader in AI innovation, Government will continue to develop actions to  build on our current strengths in these areas and foster a strong ecosystem. INTEGRATING AI ACROSS R&I POLICIES The new National Strategy for Research and Innovation  which is being developed in 2021 will include objectives  for AI-related R&I, as one of Ireland’s research priorities  within the area of ICT.60  It will also recognise the  importance of embedding AI, and digitalisation more  broadly, within other sectoral research areas and  strategies.  SUPPORTING AI R&I ACTIVITIES SFI currently supports AI R&I across its network of  SFI Research Centres, as well as in its SFI Centres for  Research Training, several of which are dedicated to  areas directly related to AI.  Through its Strategic Partnerships Programme with  industry, SFI also supports CONSUS, a €17.6 million  five-year strategic research programme in the area of  digital agriculture which includes the use of machine  learning to generate actionable insights for the market.  Pioneering research in AI is also ongoing at other  institutions. For example, the T echnological University  Dublin (TU Dublin) was awarded €4.1 million Marie  Curie funding to conduct research on health and safety  in AI. A SUPPORTIVE FUNDING ENVIRONMENT The competitiveness of the Irish AI R&I ecosystem  will be secured with appropriate funding for research  activities. Importantly, there will be an emphasis  on basic research which will underpin our future  competitiveness in AI, as well as on applied research.  Research funding schemes, and associated metrics  and targets will be reviewed to ensure that the balance  between basic and applied research is correct.  One example is the Disruptive T echnologies Innovation  Fund (DTIF) - a €500 million fund established under  Project Ireland 2040. T o date, through the DTIF, twelve AI-related projects have been funded to a value of  almost €45 million. Projects range from health-related  applications of AI to technology, gaming and creative  industries. Government will encourage further AIrelated applications in future DTIF funding calls. European Funding Opportunities The European Commission has already invested €1.5  billion in AI research and innovation under the Horizon  2020 programme . AI maintains a prominent place in  the EU’s new framework programme for research and  innovation, Horizon Europe , running from 2021-2027,  as well as in the Digital Europe Programme 2021-27 ,  which is intended to generate €20 billion per annum in  combined public and private funding.  The EU Coordinated Plan on AI envisages a number  of actions to promote research transfer from the lab  to the market. These will provide funding possibilities  and opportunities for Irish researchers to deploy the  results of their research directly in the market, including  through:   Building networks of European AI Research  Excellence Centres   Establishing world-class reference testing facilities  for AI   Accelerating AI take-up through a network of  European Digital Innovation Hubs  (EDIHs) which  may be attached to research facilities and are  intended to drive SME uptake of AI The Government will aim to develop synergies with  the European AI Research Excellence Centres and  differentiate our expertise according to specific sectors  of national strategic interest. Ireland is also keen for  its research facilities to play a part in the network of  future EDIHs, which will help facilitate AI diffusion by  providing access to technologies and other resources to  SMEs to understand and adopt AI.   60.

49 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandCONNECTING WITH INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS  AND PROMOTING IRELAND AS A CENTRE FOR  GLOBAL TALENT IN AI R&I  The Irish AI innovation ecosystem must be able to  actively connect with international AI expertise and  networks. Ireland currently has five European AI (EurAI)  fellows61  (the highest number per capita in the EU) and  Irish researchers are active in both international and  European AI R&I consortia.  Building on this success, the  ADAPT Centre, together with Dublin City University  (DCU), has taken the initiative to lead a national multistakeholder AI research, technology and innovation  hub with the aim of expanding Ireland’s international  influence in these areas. Irish third-level institutions will  continue to develop programmes and cooperation with  leading international AI research hubs and institutes,  as well as exploring partnerships in the training of AI  experts, e.g., via PhD and fellowship programmes. The  State will also promote Ireland as a global centre for AI  R&I talent. CROSS-BORDER COLLABORATION ON AI R&I There is potential to explore opportunities for crossBorder cooperation in the area of AI R&I. For example,  through the Shared Island Fund, the Government is  making €500 million in new capital funding available  out to 2025, in order to foster new investment and  development opportunities on a North/South basis.  Potential projects relevant to AI include “a North-South  programme of research and innovation, including an  all-island research hub, through Universities Ireland”;  North-South health links and an “all-island strategy to  tackle climate breakdown and the biodiversity crisis. ”62   61.

50 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland5.3 Strengthening AI Ecosystem Collaboration  Continued and increased interaction and collaboration between research and industry will be key to achieving  Ireland’s ambition to build a leadership position in AI innovation. Government will build on existing incentives  targeted at promoting and financing collaborations on AI innovation between large enterprises, SMEs, and research  institutions to diffuse the spread of innovation and create new business opportunities. Key enablers include  mechanisms for the mobility of researchers, e.g., SFI fellowships to p romote industry-academia collaboration, as  well as the availability of datasets for collaborative projects and for development and testing of new use cases.  Some of the current mechanisms and platforms for encouraging collaboration on AI between industry and research,  as well as with the public sector are outlined in Box 1. Box 1. Mechanisms and platforms for encouraging collaboration between  researchers and enterprise   The T echnology Centre programme , a joint initiative between EI and IDA Ireland (IDA), allowing  indigenous businesses and multinational enterprises (MNEs) to work  together on market-focused  strategic R&I projects in collaboration with research institutions. Of particular importance for AI is  CeADAR, the National Centre for Applied Artificial Intelligence.     IMR – the Irish Manufacturing Research Centre - works with the manufacturing industry to demystify,  derisk and deliver emerging technologies and new knowledge, such as AI, enabling industry to  succeed at the cutting edge of advanced manufacturing.     The Irish Research Council’s Enterprise Partnership Schemes , which link researchers to businesses.    The SFI Industry Fellowship (IF) Programme , which enhances industry-academia collaborations by  funding collaborative research projects and stimulates excellence through knowledge exchange and  training of engineers and scientists (“researchers”). SFI also launched a Public Service Fellowship  Programme as a pilot initiative in 2020, awarding an AI Fellowship to researching the economic, social  and ethical implications of AI and Big Data.     The SFI Frontiers for the Future Programme , which provides opportunities for independent  investigators to conduct highly innovative, collaborative research with the potential to deliver impact,  whilst also providing discrete opportunities for high-risk, high-reward research projects.    The T echnology Gateway Network , run by EI in partnership with nine Institutes of T echnology around  the country and TU Dublin, which delivers technology solutions for industry close to their market  needs and acts as local access points to the wider resources in the Irish research infrastructure.    Knowledge Transfer Ireland, funded by EI, with co-financing from the Irish Universities Association and  participation by IDA and SFI, is a national office that helps enterprises benefit from access to Statefunded technology, ideas and expertise by making it easy to connect and engage with the research  base.
51 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandA SUPPORTIVE PILOTING ENVIRONMENT Government will promote policies to assist an agile  transition from the AI R&I stage to deployment  and implementation. Bringing state-of-the-art AI  applications to the market requires experimenting and  testing in real-world environments.   A testing and experimentation platform - or  development environment - for conducting rigorous,  transparent, and replicable testing is a critical enabler  for AI innovation because of the need to demonstrate  trustworthiness and to deploy in complex digital and  physical environments.  Another related enabler is ‘regulatory sandboxes’ , a  framework set up by a regulator that allows researchers  and innovators to conduct live experiments in a  controlled environment under a regulator’s supervision.  Ireland offers an ideal testing and experimentation  platform or ‘testbed’63  for AI due to our indigenous  technology base and the density of connections  afforded by our size and infrastructure. Three examples  of existing testbeds are:  • CONNECT, the SFI Research Centre for Future  Networks and Communications operates a number  of testbeds - for example an Internet of Things  (IOT) testbed • CONFIRM, the SFI Research Centre for Future  Manufacturing, provides testbed facilities for  future manufacturing.  • The Blended Autonomous Vehicles programme,  led by the Lero, SFI Research Centre for Software,  provides an opportunity for academic researchers,  and global and indigenous automotive firms,  to collaborate on key challenges facing the  development of driverless vehicles, including the  provision of testbed facilities.  Building on existing facilities, relevant agencies will  identify particular sectors of opportunity for AI  testbeds, considering the specific needs of SMEs, as  well as particular geographic areas, and ensuring that  testing resources remain responsive to commercial and  public interests.  The European Commission has proposed a dedicated  budget for world-class Reference T esting and  Experimentation Facilities  (RTEF), with sectoral priorities  in the areas of Health, Agri-food, Manufacturing, Smart  mobility / Smart cities & communities, including IoT  and Data Ethics. Opportunities to draw down on this  funding as well as to assist researchers to engage with  RTEF facilities established in other Member States will  be examined. Making open-source software for AI development by Irish researchers   and enterprise Open-source software is a term for software released under a license that allows users to access, study,  change, and distribute the software to anyone and for any purpose, allowing for development of AI in a  collaborative public way. Open-source platforms for AI (e.g., T ensorFlow and Keras) offer a wide range of  free building-tools, machine-learning libraries, and resources that simplify, streamline and standardise  AI development in designing algorithms and intelligent applications. Such platforms offer transparency  and security, thereby improving trust through greater visibility of data management and the predictive  modelling processes.  SFI funded Research Centres - LERO, CONNECT, INSIGHT and VistaMilk Research Centres – are driving a  number of Irish Open-source software projects with tens-of-thousands of international downloads.. 63.  The term ‘testbed’ is used across many disciplines to describe experimental research and new product development platforms and  environments.

53 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland Strand 6:  AI Education, Skills And T alent  Objective A workforce prepared for and adopting AI  6.1 Introduction AI and other digital technologies are transforming the world of work. By some  estimates, one in three jobs in Ireland is at risk of being disrupted by the adoption of  digital technologies and automation.  This has raised concerns about the possibility of  technological unemployment, as well as a possible downwards impact on the wages  of workers most at risk of being displaced. However, it is anticipated that much of the  disruption caused by AI will result in changes to job roles, tasks and distribution, rather  than actual job losses.64  AI can also augment and enable the work we do, creating new  job opportunities that require the skills and willingness to work alongside AI-based  systems.   Our workforce must be prepared for this technological  change, and Ireland must be in a position to fully  leverage the opportunities offered by AI for innovation,  productivity and societal value. Having the appropriate  policies in place to develop, attract and retain AI talent  will be crucial to the success of AI in Ireland. Equally,  Government will prioritise policies that ensure workers  can access opportunities to upskill or re-skill in order to  adapt to the changes in the labour market.  This Strategy sets out a roadmap to ensuring  that Ireland has a future-oriented workforce and  population with the skills to drive the development,  deployment and use of AI to increase productivity and  benefit society. This will be done by teaching digital  and technical skills in the primary and post primary  education system, by delivering further and higher  education programmes tailored to address AI skills  needs, by creating the conditions to attract and retain  International talent, and by promoting gender balance  and diversity in the AI workforce.  64.

This is not a debate that is new;  going right back to the invention of the steam engine,  there have been concerns that machines would replace  people. In principle, the effect of new technologies  such as AI on employment reflects the outcome of two  forces; one, a negative substitution effect where jobs  or component tasks are displaced through automation;  and a second positive complementing force that raises  the demand for work elsewhere. In the past, the second  effect has won out; automation has generated new work  through making existing workers more productive, by  raising productivity and overall incomes in the economy  (often referred to as the “bigger-pie” effect) and by  creating new kinds of work. As regards the latter effect,  one analysis based on US data shows that in 2018,  63% of jobs in new occupational titles had not been  “invented” as of 1940. 65  On balance, the lessons of history suggest that AI, like  earlier general-purpose technologies, will not mean  the end of work or anything like it; the recent MIT  T ask Force on the Work of the Future concludes that  “no compelling historical or contemporary evidence  suggests that technological advances are driving us  towards a jobless future” . That said, as with other  technologies, the adoption of AI will create winners and  losers and the challenge for policy will be to ensure that  the benefits from the jobs of the future are shared by all  workers.    Recent studies have shown a rapid increase in the  deployment of AI technologies throughout the economy  and some early indications reflect a potential for AI to  substitute for humans in certain tasks.66 One effect of  the COVID-19 pandemic may be the faster adoption  of AI and other automation technologies including in  work areas marked by high physical proximity.67  More  generally, unlike previous technological advances, which  often led to the automation of jobs that involved routine  tasks, AI is increasingly being applied to non-routine  tasks in areas such as legal writing, medical diagnostics  and driving of vehicles.68  Much of the additional job  growth is likely to be in areas that require humantechnology collaboration and domain expertise, such  as managing data, working effectively with technology  tools and applications, and identifying efficiency  improvements.69  The development of non-technical  skillsets will be equally important to ensure we can  effectively apply, manage and regulate AI.  Skills policies will need to be combined with other  interventions, including social protection and social  dialogue, in order to protect workers’ interests and  ensure that increasing use of AI in the workplace does  not serve to deepen inequalities.  Given the scope of its impact, predicting the exact  labour market impacts of AI in Ireland is not possible  at present. However, we can expect to see a range  of consequences across skill demands, hiring rates,  employment and earnings. The Expert Group on  Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) is conducting a review  of the skills implications of AI over the next five to ten  years, focusing on the deployment, management and  regulation of AI, and the skills-related actions needed to  realise the opportunities and potential of AI. The EGFSN  will deliver a report on this work by the end of 2021. 65. Cited in MIT T ask Force on the Work of the Future, 2020. 66.  Acemoglu, D., Autor, D., Hazell, J., and Restrepo, P .

55 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland6.3 Building Digital Skills for  AI as part of the Education  Curriculum  The EU Digital Education and Action Plan 2021-7  integrates specific actions for the improvement of AIrelated skills into the larger context of promoting digital  skills. In Ireland, our policy on embedding digital skills  and technologies within school teaching, learning and  assessment is outlined in the Digital Strategy for Schools  2015-2020 Enhancing T eaching, Learning and Assessment ,  with a follow-on to this digital strategy currently under  development.  Ireland also has a STEM Education Policy Statement  2017-2026 which aims, inter alia , to achieve and  improve the STEM education experience and outcomes  for all learners at Early years, Primary and Post-Primary  level. A computer coding module has been introduced  at Junior Cycle level, and national rollout of a new  specification for Leaving Certificate Computer Science  commenced in September 2020. Key complementary  skills such as communication, creativity and working  with others are also embedded throughout the primary  and post primary curricula. AI is a developing area  so curricula must continue to evolve to ensure that  children are being taught the skills they will need to  engage confidently and effectively with AI in the future. It is also important that teachers understand the  strengths and limitations of AI as part of teaching  methods - how AI can augment learning, but also the  ethical considerations and risks involved. AI-based  educational tools may bring benefits such as the ability  to provide customised learning and personalised  feedback, as well as enabling distance education for  children in remote regions and specialised products  that can assist non-traditional learners and children  with diverse needs. Importantly, since our children  will experience the greatest impact of AI, their use in  schools can build familiarity and ease with AI solutions  from an early age. The Department of Education already assists schools  to embed the effective use of digital technologies in  teaching and learning practices and to develop digital  literacy through the provision of a broad range of  Continuous Professional Development initiatives. The  School Excellence Funds for Digital and STEM provide  some €1m funding to schools working in clusters  on innovative projects using digital technologies in  teaching and learning, some of which include the  use of robotics and coding. The Irish Universities  Association is also engaged in a three-year project  called ‘ Enhancing Digital T eaching and Learning ’ , funded by  the Higher Education Authority’s (HEA) Innovation and  Transformation programme.70  Case Study: AI-based Dementia App Memory Haven Developed by three Irish secondary school students, the Memory Haven app won the top prize in the  senior girls’ division at the 2020 virtual T echnovation World Summit (an annual global AI and mobile app  competition that encourages girls to tackle community issues through technology).  Memory Haven is designed to help the more than 500,000 people in Ireland whose families have  been impacted by dementia, by helping them with memory loss challenges such as recognising friends  and relatives, as well as with communicating their needs through speaking. Influenced by research  demonstrating that musical memories can comfort people with dementia, the app incorporates AI-driven  music playlists based on user emotions, along with healthcare features such as alerts, face and voice  recognition, and health checks. The patient’s doctor, once given access, can also easily view patient details,  chat with the patient and schedule appointments. The app incorpor ates a ‘Memory Game’ , allowing the  patient to test and improve their cognitive abilities, as well as a remote monitoring feature for relatives or  caregivers. The winning students, Rachael and Margaret Akano (Sacred Heart D rogheda) and Joy Njekwe from  (Our Lady’s College in Greenhills, Drogheda), developed the app under the mentorship of tech expert  Evelyn Nomayo, a PhD research fellow in Trinity College and founder of Phase Innovate, a not-for-profit  organisation dedicated to bridging the gender and race gap in STEM fields in Ireland. The app is expected  to launch in Ireland, Europe, the US and Africa, with Evelyn as main developer and Microsoft for Startups  Europe as the technical support team. 70.

56 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland6.4 Building AI Skills     The future of high-quality research and innovation in AI,  both in academic and industry settings, depends on the  availability of people with the right skills and abilities  to understand and innovate in this field. Ireland’s  responsive skills architecture, which includes a strong  emphasis on building technology skills, will play a key  role in this regard.  The National Skills Strategy 2025 – Ireland’s Future   includes actions to build technology skills such as  increasing participation in STEM (Science, T echnology,  Engineering and Maths) education; teaching ICT skills  to students at all stages; and the development and  rollout of ICT related strategies for Higher Education  (HE) and Further Education and Training (FET). The  Strategy also outlines a focus on ‘21st century skills’ ,  referring to skills such as communications, resilience,  creativity and problem-solving as examples. T echnology  Skills 2022: Ireland’s Third ICT Skills Action Plan  sets out  priority actions to meet the demands for high-level ICT  skillsets in the Irish economy.  Various education and training measures are also  helping to ensure that providers can collaborate with,  and respond quickly to, industry needs in the area of  AI. Higher Education Institutions, through initiatives  under Springboard+ and working with Skillnet Ireland,  have partnered together with industry to develop  programmes in AI including:   MSc in Artificial Intelligence - University of  Limerick (with T echnology Ireland Skillnet)   MSc in Computing - Artificial Intelligence (online)  - Dublin City University and National University of  Ireland Galway (NUIG) (with T echnology Ireland  Skillnet)   Certificate in Artificial Intelligence (NFQ L8) –  Institute of T echnology Tralee (Springboard+)   MSc in Software Design with Artificial Intelligence  (NFQ L9) – Athlone Institute of T echnology  (Springboard+2020)    Postgraduate Certificate in Software Design with  Artificial Intelligence (NFQ L9) – Athlone Institute  of T echnology (Springboard+2020)    Higher Diploma in Artificial Intelligence (Concepts  and Applications) (NFQ L8) – CCT College Dublin (Springboard+2020)    Graduate Certificate in Artificial Intelligence (NFQ  L9) – Dublin City University (Springboard+2020)   Certificate in Automotive Artificial Intelligence  (NFQ L9) – IT Sligo (Springboard+2020)   Furthermore, one of the objectives of the Human Capital  Initiative, launched by the Department of Education  in 2019, is to increase higher education capacity in  skills-focused programmes designed to meet priority  skills needs, including the future-proofing of graduates  with industry-relevant skills for emerging technologies,  including AI.71  New undergraduate places and graduate  conversion courses have been developed to meet areas  of identified skills needs. A Higher Diploma in Science  in Computing (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning)  at the National College of Ireland and a Higher Diploma  in Artificial Intelligence at CCT College Dublin have  received funding under this initiative. Interdisciplinary skills are also important to build  awareness of AI as a useful tool across disciplines - basic  AI knowledge and AI-related education modules should  therefore form a part of third-level curricula across  disciplines. Not just in computer science, but also in the  other sciences, as well as in the arts and humanities,  where appropriate. SOLAS, Ireland’s Further Education and Training  Authority, is embedding core digital skills throughout  its training provision.72  Examples include the Skills to  Advance and the Skills to Compete  schemes. Delivered  through the Education and Training Boards, these  schemes aim to assist employees and SMEs in adapting  to changes in work practices and technologies,  especially vulnerable groups and those with lower skills  levels. Skillnet Ireland’s Digital Skills Initiative also seeks  to equip managers, especially within SMEs, with the  know-how to manage digitalisation.  There are also a number of initiatives aimed at  addressing deficiencies in digital skills in the older  workforce. One example is the EXPLORE programme,  designed to address the need for enhanced transversal  and digital skills among persons over 35 years of age  in the manufacturing, logistics and supply chain and  hospitality sectors.   71. https://hea.ie/skills-engagement/human-capital-initiative/ 72.

57 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandFurthermore, Government will aim to raise the level  of digital skills amongst the general public. A new  ten-year strategy for Adult Literacy, Numeracy and  Digital Literacy is currently in development by SOLAS,  with input by relevant Government Departments and  agencies and in consultation with key stakeholders.  This is in addition to the existing strategy for Literacy,  and Numeracy (including Digital Literacy) to 2020  for Early Years and schools. Development of a new  Literacy, Numeracy and Digital Literacy strategy for  Early Years and schools is underway.  The aim of both new strategies is to ensure that everyone has adequate  literacy, numeracy and digital literacy skills to meet their  needs and participate fully in society.  A significant gap continues to exist in terms of  producing industry-ready AI graduates, with the ability  to apply their skills directly to real-world AI research  and to business problems in various domains. T o  address this, SFI has developed a Centres for Research  Training programme, which is supporting the training of  post-graduate students in several areas related to AI.  Case Study: SFI Centres for Research Training   SFI Centres for Research Training (CRT) – a training programme for postgraduate students in “Data and  ICT skills for the future” The SFI CRTs represent a €104 million investment from SFI and use a cost-share model where, at  minimum, one out of every five students is funded from leveraged non-SFI sources. Collaborations include  eleven different HEIs from across Ireland, and over 90 industry partners which include MNEs, SMEs  and private foundations.  SFI’s vision for this programme is to train and develop future leaders, who will  have interdisciplinary and intersectoral skills which will benefit Ireland’s economy and society, through  digitalisation, data science, machine learning and the application of A I. The SFI CRTs programme aims to provide students with world-class, cohort-based, interdisciplinary  training within environments of research excellence. This significant investment will expose students  to the wider scientific relevance of their research, encourage peer-to-peer learning and facilitate the  establishment of networks that will enhance their research, employability and leadership potential.  Students will be equipped with transversal skills including entrepreneurship and innovation to enable  them to adapt and react to rapidly evolving workplaces. Career support available to postgraduate students  includes research skills, transversal and cross-sectoral skills, discipline-specific skills, as well as placements  in industry and overseas academic labs. The six SFI CRTs is providing training for postgraduate students in the areas of Machine Learning, Digitally  Enhanced Reality, Foundations of Data Science, Genomics Data Science, Artificial Intelligence and  Advanced Network for Sustainable Societies. 46% of students under  this programme are women, showing  the significant impact that this investment will have on the number of AI-trained professional women in the  future. Sector specific initiatives include a PhD internship programme in AI and data science run by Met Éireann to address  problems of interest to the meteorological community.
58 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland6.5 Attracting and Retaining  International AI T alent Government wants to leverage Ireland’s reputation as  a ‘tech hub’ to become an attractive destination for AIrelated employment and innovation. Ireland succeeds  in attracting more AI talent than the rest of Europe,  proportionate to population size, and is one of four EU  member states with a higher percentage of AI workers  with undergraduate degrees than the US. 73   National policy is to drive skills availability through the  education and skills system. However,  where a shortage  of critical skills has been agreed, the employment  permits systems plays a supporting role in ensuring the  Irish economy can adequately service its skills needs –  including those skills in AI.  Implementation of the recommendations of the  September 2018 Review of Economic Migration Policy ,  conducted by the Department of Enterprise, Trade  and Employment, will also be important in generating a  more accommodating environment for inward migrants  under the employment permits system. In particular,  the liberalisation of restrictions around spousal working  rights should help boost initial attraction and retention. This can be a virtuous cycle, with world-leading AI  researchers in Ireland acting as magnets for enterprises  and other academic researchers. SFI has already  successfully attracted leaders in the AI field to Ireland  through its SFI Research Professorship Programme. 6.6 Women’s Participation in  AI As careers in AI tend to be well-remunerated, they  represent an area of opportunity and rapid growth  potential. However, three quarters of workers in AI and  data science (in Ireland and Internationally) are men. 74   The EU AI HLEG has emphasised the need to increase  the proportion of women in science and technology  to improve the relevance and quality of research and  innovation in AI systems, as well as to fully leverage the  talent pool. 75   There are positive signs with respect to the pipeline of  future AI workers in Ireland - 21% of ICT students are  female in Ireland, placing us above the EU average of  17.7%. 76 T echIreland data also indicates that 21% of  the indigenous (self-described) AI businesses they track  in Ireland are female-founded. 77  However, these are  still very low proportions. In addition, the retention rate  of women in the STEM sector is lower than that of men. Ireland is committed to achieving improved gender  balance in AI. There are already initiatives in place to  encourage women into AI careers. Skillnet Ireland has  developed the Women ReBOOT programme which assists  women with technology sector skills and experience  to return to work after a career break. Industry-led  initiatives include Connecting Women in T echnology .78   T echnology Ireland ICT Skillnet has also launched a  Foundations Certificate in AI, which has a particular  focus on attracting women and migrants.79 73.

59 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandAn important enabler for long term success is increasing the proport ion of girls and women studying STEM  subjects. A Gender Balance in STEM group has been set up under th e STEM Education Policy Statement to  progress this. Government will also develop policies aimed at encouraging women to work in AI, and at identifying  and addressing the factors that may be acting as barriers for women in progressing careers in AI.  Case Study: Women in AI Ireland   Women in AI (WAI) is a non-profit initiative with a mission to increase female representation and  participation in AI. It has developed into a global community of members from over 90 countries with 28  ambassadors working towards gender-inclusive AI for the benefit of global society.  WAI in Ireland was launched in September 2019 as a community-driven initiative. Embracing diversity  and forming an inclusive environment for future talent in AI with a focus on women and minorities, it aims  to bring empowerment, knowledge and active collaboration via education, research, events, and media  content. Branches are currently active in Dublin and Cork.  Objective A workforce prepared for and adopting AI Strategic Actions i.

60 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland Strand 7:  A Supportive and Secure  Infrastructure for AI  7.1 Introduction A digital infrastructure serving citizens, SMEs,  the public sector and large businesses requires  high performance computing, connectivity and  infrastructures which facilitate the use of, and access to,  high quality and trustworthy data. A strong approach  to cybersecurity will be key to maximising trust in AI,  particularly where it is deployed in the delivery of  essential services such as healthcare and transport.  Robust data governance and privacy frameworks  are also prerequisites. Consistent application of EU  and Council of Europe data protection principles  can contribute to the success of AI applications, by  generating trust and preventing risks. Finally, the development and use of AI requires access to secure,  high-speed and well-functioning telecommunication  networks, as well as sufficient computing power and  storage capabilities.  Ireland already has a number of strengths in this  area, including a strong track record in open data, a  commitment to rigorous data protection standards, and  strong investment in recent years in technological and  connective infrastructure. Government will build on  these strengths to create world-class infrastructure in  Ireland for driving the safe and trusted use of data for  AI and to solidify its role as a trustworthy location for AI  and data governance. Objective A data, digital and connectivity infrastructure which provides a secure foundation  for AI development and use in Ireland

The Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence, developed by the EU AI HLEG7.2 Trustworthy Data  Infrastructure and  Governance for AI AI-based systems are highly data-dependent, so a  supportive and trustworthy data infrastructure is  paramount to unlock AI’s full economic and societal  potential. Secure, good quality and robust datasets need  to be available and accessible in order for AI application  to be successfully developed across sectors. Beneficial  AI innovation also relies on strong data governance,  which ensures privacy, equity, transparency, and  inclusivity. The proposal for an EU Data Governance Act   is an important initiative in this respect.80  As a leading digital nation, Ireland has been proactive  in regulating the data economy and in promoting data  protection. Now there is an opportunity to serve as a  leader in ethical and trustworthy data governance for AI, leveraging our reputation for safeguarding data  protection and our position as an international data hub  in order to pioneer new models of responsible data use  and access for AI and ensure the foundations for ethical  data sharing.  The three key requirements of strong data governance  for AI are:81     the quality and integrity of the data used;   its access protocols and the capability to process  data in a manner that protects privacy   its relevance in light of the domain in which the AI  based systems will be deployed.  SFI is co-funding the development of an advisory  programme on data governance called EMPOWER,  with industry and academia. EMPOWER will create  a framework for responsible data governance across  non-public service sectors and will develop tools and  methodologies to assist businesses in applying that  framework.

62 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandA new Data Governance Board is being established  through the Data Sharing and Governance Act (2019),  to provide oversight of data sharing and governance  within the public service. The Data Governance Board  could choose to commission EMPOWER to advise on  matters of data usage and data sharing within public  service, for example relating to ethical use of data in AI;  and on related matters such as the transposition of the  forthcoming Data Governance Act.  DATA PROTECTION, ETHICS AND PRIVACY IN THE  CONTEXT OF AI  AI is becoming a key technology in automated decisionsupport systems based on personal data, which may  potentially have significant impacts on the fundamental  rights of individuals. Strong data protection can serve to  build public trust in AI and act as a lever for innovation,  while preventing risks to privacy and other rights, and  ensuring the foundations for ethical and responsible  data sharing.  The EU  General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR) is a  risk-based framework, providing a comprehensive set  of data protection rules and principles (Article 5) that  are relevant and applicable in the context of AI-based  systems. It also establishes recourse for algorithmic  decisions, offering individuals the right to a human  review of a decision made by an automated AI-based  system.   Several rights and provisions of the GDPR are of  particular relevance for AI-based profiling and  decision making (Recital 71; Articles 5, 12-15, 22, 25  and 35).  However, current technical limitations and  characteristics of AI models, including the opacity of some AI systems, can cause difficulties in the practical  implementation of relevant GDPR provisions and the  related data subject rights.  Two crucial concepts enshrined in law under the GDPR  (Article 25), which should be an integral part of planning  and implementing any AI project, are data protection by  design and data protection by default. Data protection  by design means embedding data privacy directly into  the design of projects at an early stage. Data protection  by default means that user service settings must be  automatically data protection friendly, and that only  data which is necessary for each specific purpose of the  processing should be gathered.  An evaluation of the GDPR by the EU in 2020  recognised it as a flexible, technology-neutral and  future-proof tool. However, it acknowledged some  challenges lie ahead in clarifying how to interpret  and apply the principles to specific technologies such  as AI.  Data ethics should also be factored into any  consideration of GDPR obligations, particularly in  complex situations where AI and automated decisions  (which may be based on sensitive or inferred data) could  impact on peoples’ lives in a significant way. Uptake of  new AI-based technologies within the public sector will  also be subject to risk assessment under the GDPR.  Ireland is committed to upholding rigorous data  protection standards for AI, and will collaborate with  international partners on this agenda, drawing upon  the expertise and recommendations of the Responsible  AI and the Data Governance Working Group in the  recently established Global Partnership on AI. 82.

63 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandACCESS TO QUALITY DATA FOR AI AI-based systems are totally data dependent, and lack  of access to quality data and datasets is a potential  barrier to enterprise adoption of AI, especially for  SMEs.  Ireland has established Insight, the SFI Research  Centre for Data Analytics, one of Europe’s largest data  analytics research organisations. Insight undertakes  high-impact research, seeking to derive value from Big Data and providing innovative technology solutions for  industry and society.  Where possible, Government will make more public  sector data openly, safely and securely available for  AI research and innovation and will facilitate the  development of trusted environments enabling access  to data and collaboration across different organisations.  DATA GOVERNANCE FOR AI – THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY Ireland has already evolved a successful local ecosystem of services around data protection and  the development of suitable privacy-enhancing technologies. Irish start-ups and spinouts, such as  DataChemist and Truata, are applying cutting-edge knowledge to develop data management and  governance platforms. Building on this success, there is strong potential for industry-academic  collaboration in Ireland to spawn similar start-ups in the area of data governance for Trustworthy AI. For  example, new professional services may be required to assist businesses in:    Conducting data protection and ethical impact assessments for AI   T esting for undue bias or quality issues in data sets to be used in training AI   Understanding the potential value, as well as business risks of adopt ing specific datasets   Developing transparent data governance processes across complex data/AI value chains   Training and upskilling staff to handle data governance and trustworthiness AI issues  Case Study: ‘T errain-AI’: Data Platform for Sustainable Land Use The objective of this research, co-funded by Microsoft under SFI’s Strategic Partnership Programme,  is to develop a digital data platform capable of integrating, analysing and visualising large volumes of  Earth observation data, including from satellites, drones and on-site m easurements. The platform will  increase understanding of how land management practices can influence carbon emissions arising from  the landscape, thus enabling more sustainable land management within environmental and regulatory  constraints.  ACCESS TO OPEN GOVERNMENT DATA FOR AI  Ireland is currently one of the leading exponents of  Open Government Data (i.e., making administrative  datasets available to be freely re-used and redistributed  by anyone). It has a successful Open Data programme  (data.gov.ie) and has been ranked first in Europe for the  past three consecutive years (2017, 2018 and 2019).  Ireland also achieved fourth place in the EU Open Data  Portal Maturity Report in 202085  and was placed third in  the OECD for Open Government Data in 2019.86  Ireland’s national Open Data Strategy 2017-2022  sets  out two core objectives:    ensuring the publication of high value Government  data in open format, making it publicly available  and freely reusable; and    engaging with a broad community of stakeholders  to promote its social and economic benefits.  85. https://www.europeandataportal.eu/sites/default/files/edp_landscaping_insight_report_n6_2020.pdf 86.

The Directive provides for the  publication by public bodies of ‘High Value Datasets’ ,87   defined as datasets that have the potential to generate  significant socio-economic or environmental benefits  and innovative services.  Open data is a valuable AI resource for academics,  researchers and enterprises. Government can play a  key role in stimulating AI innovation by ensuring that  the open data infrastructure is AI-friendly and designed  for clean, codified, real-time data. T o assist in building a  shared understanding of the nature and characteristics  of datasets needed for AI, Government will hold an  Open Data Challenge Fund for AI.   DATA SHARING Drawing on international experience, Ireland will also  promote work to explore mechanisms for responsible  data sharing and stewardship within the business  and commercial sector, such as data trusts, data  cooperatives and data contracts, in order to allow  data to flow across sectors in line with clear, practical  and fair rules for access.  One possible model for  increasing access to data for AI is ‘data trusts’ . These  are legal structures providing for independent, thirdparty stewardship of data and designed to permit  sharing of data in a fair, safe and equitable manner. As  frameworks around data-sharing are developed, it is  important to ensure a balanced approach that takes into  consideration competing interests. This may require  new licensing approaches, privacy protections, security  considerations, technology platforms, standards and  tools, as well as intellectual property policies. EUROPEAN DATA SPACES  The European Commission views the development  of common European data spaces as a key measure  to facilitate access to data and boost data sharing,  including for AI.88  It proposes to establish domainspecific common European data spaces in the  areas of industrial manufacturing, the Green Deal,  mobility, health, finance, energy, agriculture, public  administration, and skills. It is anticipated these data  spaces will lead to the availability of large pools of data  in the relevant domains, combined with the technical tools and infrastructures necessary to use and exchange  data, as well as appropriate governance mechanisms.  The EU has also published guidance principles on  private sector data sharing and has launched several  R&I actions in this area. More dedicated EU proposals  on data spaces are expected to follow in 2021.89  DATA FOR AI IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR  Public sector data can help generate insights for public  policy and research, enabling Government to better  understand the impact of its policy interventions in  rapidly evolving circumstances. Responsible data  sharing across Government is also one of the key  enablers of modern public services, facilitating efficient  and cost-effective service delivery. Its benefits include  data linking, when two sets of records allow to derive  previously unavailable insights, in addition to more  tailored interventions, better allocation of public  resources, and monitoring of service outcomes. However, public data is often collected by different  administrations and, in many cases, it is fragmented,  limited and not easily accessible. The Public Service  Data Strategy 2019-2023  sets out a roadmap to a  public sector data ecosystem, including associated  governance, for the optimisation of data management  across Public Service Body boundaries. The  strategy addresses the need for data privacy and  security, effective data governance and control, and  transparency.  Enabling legislation - The Data Sharing and Governance  Act (2019) – is currently being implemented, which will  allow public bodies to share personal data for certain  purposes and set out appropriate safeguards under  which such sharing must take place. The Department of  Public Expenditure and Reform is finalising the process  of establishing a Data Governance Board to oversee  data sharing arrangements under the Act. A data  catalogue was established at the beginning of 2021  and standards and guidelines for data sharing by public  sector bodies will be issued over the course of 2021. Full implementation of relevant sectoral legislation (e.g.,  the INSPIRE Directive on spatial data) will also help  provide the domain-specific data needed to support AI  applications for the public sector. 87.

66 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for Ireland7.3 Digital and Connectivity  Infrastructure for AI Development and use of AI requires a sound and  sustainable digital and technological infrastructure in  terms of access to computing power, digital connectivity  and network capacity. Many of the key technological  infrastructures and public policies that are important  prerequisites for the successful exploitation of  AI, such as broadband and 5G, High Performance  Computing (HPC), and Cybersecurity, are longstanding Government priorities, on which substantial  progress has been made in recent years.90 For example,  a National 5G T est Centre, RadioSpace, opened in  Maynooth University in 2019. It is the country’s first  large-scale facility for the research and testing of radio  and wireless technologies needed for 5G and the future  Internet of Things. Next-generation AI-based solutions will also  demand more computational power and will need  to be more cost and energy efficient to meet the  needs of increasingly sophisticated training models.  Computation will also increasingly move to ‘the edge’ ,  on devices that are closer to the users of real-time AI  applications. Furthermore, the tight interconnection  of data infrastructure with a HPC infrastructure is  vital to the successful development and deployment  of AI systems and the European Commission is taking  important steps to enable the next generation of data  processing infrastructures. Access to sufficient computing power for AI in Ireland  will be secured through the use of both national and  international resources. T o develop and strengthen  the national data and HPC platforms, pan-European  initiatives such as EuroHPC should be leveraged since  they offer amplification of national investments with  matched EU funding, as well as allowing Ireland to  participate in and contribute to European expertise in  AI. Developing national data and HPC platforms also  opens up highly valuable opportunities for nationallevel strategic partnerships to establish AI and HPC  technology centres of excellence with enterprise and  research partners. Ireland currently participates in EuroHPC, and is  committed to the Digital Europe Programme , through  which the European Commission has proposed  appropriate funding for HPC and quantum computing,  as well as edge computing. The Department of  Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation  and Science has established an Advisory Group on  High Performance Computing to exchange views and advise on how best to position Ireland and exploit  opportunities in HPC relevant areas (including AI). Another enabler for AI is Cloud-based infrastructure  that provides virtualised computing resources and  storage of data (for example servers, software,  databases, data analytics) that can be accessed  remotely. At EU level, there is a focus on developing  pan-European cloud-services, with the launch of  GAIA-X (the European Cloud Infrastructure initiative)  in June 2020, as well as the Member States’ Joint  declaration on building the next generation cloud for  businesses and the public sector in the EU  in October  2020,91  which has been signed by Ireland, and  establishment of a European Alliance on Industrial Data  and Cloud in December 2020.     7.4 AI and Cybersecurity  AI-based systems should be safe (performing as  intended) and secure (resistant to being compromised  by unauthorised parties). A strong approach to security  for digital infrastructure will be key to maximising trust  in AI, particularly where it is deployed in the delivery of  essential services such as healthcare and transport.  Challenges posed by AI in this respect include an  increased cyber security attack surface, as well as the  potential for adversarial AI and for manipulation of  AI for criminal or terrorist purposes. Illicit AI-related  activities are likely to increase as the technology is  diffused. The National Security Analysis Centre is  considering potential threats that AI technologies could  pose to State security as part of its ongoing work on the  development of a new National Security Strategy Government has taken an evolving series of measures  to mitigate cyber security risks and develop the policy  framework in this area, fostering relevant innovation,  capacity-building, awareness-raising and R&I initiatives.  Ireland’s National Cyber Security Strategy, published  in December 2019, outlines how the Government  will continue to protect the security of the country’s  computer networks and associated infrastructure. The  Strategy is built around three platforms for action:   ‘Protect’ – a set of measures designed to further  improve the security of IT systems in the State,  including critical infrastructure protection;   ‘Develop’ – measures to develop capacity and  employment in Cyber Security in the State, and   ‘Engage’ – measures to improve how the State  engages nationally and internationally on cyber  security matters, including in diplomatic and law  enforcement terms. 90.    In November 2019, Government signed a contract to implement a public investment in future-proof broadband networks in rural Ireland, with  an indicative budget of €2.6 billion. 91.

67 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandUnder this Strategy, the National Cyber Security  Centre (NCSC) has been formally established  within the Department of Environment, Climate and  Communications. The NCSC has three main roles:    National Incident Response - this means leading  a strategic national incident response process,  including co-ordinating across Government and  internationally.    Information Sharing - the NCSC acts a source of  expert advice and guidance, but also as a ‘clearing  house’ for relevant information (including cyberintelligence and threat information) and it makes  sure that people who need that data get it.   Building Resilience - providing guidance, support  and interventions across Government and the  Private sector. As the 2021 ransomware attack on the HSE has  demonstrated, there is no room for complacency with  respect to Cyber Security, and the development of the  NCSC will evolve continuously, to reflect its important  mandate. AI technologies can play a part in strengthening  organisations’ cyber security. AI can be used as a tool  to automate or augment aspects of cyber security, for  example, through the deployment of active firewalls or smart antivirus protection. AI technologies can also  be used to facilitate the efforts of the law enforcement  and other public authorities to better respond to  cybercrime, including the analysis of the exponential  growth of Big Data in the context of investigations, as  well as potential criminal misuse of AI. The Government recognises the importance of  building future skills for cyber security. Since October  2018, Skillnet Ireland has been implementing the  Cyber Security Skills Initiative in partnership with the  NCSC, Garda National Cyber Crime Bureau, together  with other agencies and third level institutions. The  core aims of the initiative are to develop awareness,  bridge the skills gap and to set standards for skills  and competencies for cyber security roles. The third  level sector in Ireland is also now offering a significant  number of courses in cyber security, with a number of  Masters level courses now on offer. In addition, a 2 year  Associate Professional in Cyber Security apprenticeship  at QQI level 6 has been approved by Apprenticeship  Council and funded under the National Training Fund,  while a number of cybersecurity courses are also being  funded under the Springboard+ programme to facilitate  those already in employment to reskill into alternative  roles or occupations.  Objective A data, digital and connectivity infrastructure which provides a secure foundation  for AI development and use in Ireland Strategic Actions   i.  Building on initiatives such as the EMPOWER program, provide a framework for trustworthy  data governance across the private sector and develop tools and methodologies to apply the  framework.

68 AI – HERE FOR GOOD A National Artificial Intelligence Strategy for IrelandStrand 8:   Implementation of the Strategy   Introduction This Strategy has set out a comprehensive agenda  and suite of strategic actions to help Government  achieve its vision of Ireland as an international leader  in using AI to the benefit of our population, through a  people-centered, ethical approach to AI development,  adoption and use. It is a whole of Government strategy,  which will require coordinated action from a number of  Government Departments, agencies and bodies, as set  out in the relevant Strands.    The AI Strategy also forms an important part of  overall digital strategy for Ireland; the drivers and  enablers for AI are very similar to those for other  digital technologies. Therefore, the AI Strategy will be  implemented through the framework that Government  is establishing to drive and oversee Ireland’s digital  transition, with specific strategic actions led by  nominated Government Departments, State agencies  or other bodies, as set out in the relevant Strands.   Oversight of Strategy  Implementation An Enterprise Digital Advisory Board will be  established to advise and work with Government  to drive enterprise adoption of digital technologies,  including AI. The Board members will include relevant  Government Departments, representatives from MNEs  and SMEs, AI experts, the IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  The Board will be chaired by the Minister of State for  Trade Promotion, Digital and Company Regulation.  The Board will oversee the implementation of the  enterprise elements of the AI Strategy. It will also  advise and work with Government to drive enterprise  adoption of AI including through: 1. Assessing the current spectrum of AI resources  available to industry from technology centres  and relevant agencies to inform actions needed  to maximise the potential of the existing  infrastructure  2. Developing an AI programme for enterprise  of targeted funding measures, together with  diagnostic tools and other advisory supports  around AI adoption 3. Raising awareness among businesses of all  sizes – from small SMEs through to MNEs – of  the resources available from European Digital  Innovation Hubs/centres of excellence  4. Developing a National AI cluster or platform to  drive collaboration between MNCs and SMEs.  AI Innovation Hub An AI Innovation Hub will also be established, to act  as a National First Stop for AI, providing expertise and  guidance to enterprises on their AI adoption journey.  It will be one of four national-level European Digital  Innovation Hubs (EDIHs) which will be established  in Ireland as part of the EU-wide network to be  launched in May 2021. The AI Innovation Hub will  provide upskilling, innovation and advisory services  (including in the area of standards, data protection  and regulatory compliance) to enterprises and public  authorities in areas aligned to AI, as well as offering  access to technical expertise, research facilities  and experimentation. It will also offer access to  SME incubators, providing access to infrastructure,  technologies and test beds. Driving Public Trust in AI Building public trust in and engagement with AI will  be essential to the overall success of the AI Strategy.  Government will appoint an AI ambassador to promote  awareness among the public and businesses of the  potential that AI offers, serving as a champion of AI as  a positive force for the economy and society. The AI  ambassador will be a member of the Enterprise Digital  Advisory Board, and will be supported in their work by  the Board and by the Department of Enterprise, Trade  and Employment. Driving AI Adoption by the  Public Service Government plans to establish a GovT ech Delivery  Board, which will lead the digital transformation of the  public service. The Board will consider AI adoption in  the public service as part of its work.
