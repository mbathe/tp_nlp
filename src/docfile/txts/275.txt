        Digital automation and  the future of work                              Modern capitalist economies are witnessing a period o f rapid  technological progress. Developments in digital technologies,  inclusive of artificial intelligence (AI), are predicted by some at least  to create the potential for a great reduction in the volume of work.  Others see scope for digital technologies to transform the quality of  work.    This report addresses the nature, scope and possible effects of  digital automation. It reviews relevant literature and situate s  modern debates on technological change in historical context.   It identifies threats to job quality and an unequal distribution  of the   risks and benefits associated with digital automation. It also offers  some policy options that, if implemented, would help to harness  technology for positi ve economic and social ends.   The policy options range from industry and sectoral skills allia nces  that focus on facilitating transitions for workers in ' at risk ' jobs, to  proposals for the reduction in work time. The suggested policies  derive from the view that digital automation must be managed on  the basis of principles of industrial democracy a nd social  partnership. The report argues for a new Digital Social Contract.   At a time of crisis, the policy options set out in the report aim to  offer hope for a digital future that works for all.

Digital automation and the future of work     III Executive summary     Digital t echnologies are accelerating at a rapid rate and are enabling the reduction as well as  transformation  of work . Developments in artificial intelligence  (AI), for some authors at least, offer  the  possibility of a 'world without work '. Robots are seen to be the future workers, not humans. Other   writers , from a different standpoint, suggest that technolog ical change  will occur  – as in the past –  without a major loss of paid work . Rather, it is claimed that the effect of digital technolog ies will be felt  more in the content of work, rather than in its volume.     This report  address es the nature, scope and possible effects of digital automation. It  review s relevant  literature and situate s modern debates on technological change in historical context. It  also sets out a  number of polic y options  that, if implemented, would help to harness technology for positive  economic and social ends.  The policy options  aim to create a future of work where technology works  for all.     The report  recognise s that the impacts of technolog ical change  on work  and emp loyment  are  multifaceted. On the one hand, technology impacts on the level of employment . Here  it is   acknowledge d that  technolog y can both create and d isplace  jobs and that the net effects of  technolog y on employment will depend on the relative strength of  any job d isplacement  effect. The  demise of paid work is not the inevitable product of technological progress  – rather , there is scope for  paid work to grow with the advance of technolog y. Indeed, technology itself enables new job creation,  particularly in jobs that are hard to automate. On the other hand, technology affects the nature and  quality  of work  itself . How work is done and the allocation of tasks within jobs depends on the kind  of  technology  that is develo ped and adopted in the economy . Just as technology may help to improve  skills and raise the quality of work, so it can produce processes of deskilling and create and embed low  paid, low autonomy work. Importantly, while technology can help to preserve work , it can also  generate shifts in the qualitative  experience of work.     For the purposes of this report, attention is given to  digital technolog ies associated with what has been  variously described as the Second Machine Age, the  Fourth Industrial Revolution and Industry 4.0 . AI  together with  advanced robotics are  key features of the new or emerging digital world . There is a  widespread view that digital technolog ies will gather pace in coming years and that technologic al  breakthroughs in the future will lead to seismic change s in the way that  work is conducted in society.   The report  review s the evidence supporting this view  and outline s the basis for predictions of work’s  future demise.  It also examine s the scope f or digital technologies to transform how work  might be  conducted in the future .    Throughout the report , it is recognise d that technolog ical progress  can present both opportunitie s as  well as risks. On the positive side, digital technolog ies can create  the basis for  high er living standards ,  with less work. They can also potentially lead to up -skilling and improvement in the quality of jobs. On  the negative side, digital technolog ies can lead to skill gaps, greater inequality and a more polari sed  society. They can also erode job quality by e liminating  valuable skills, intensifying monitoring at work,  and extending atypical (or 'gig') work. Recent policy debates centre on ways to maximise the benefits  and minimise the costs of digital technolog ies. This report  adds  to these debates by suggesting policy  options  that would help society to exploit the bounty afforded by digital technolog ies.    A purpose of the report is to suggest that technolog ical change , far from being deterministic in its  nature and effects, is open  to reform. There is no guarantee that digital technologies  will destroy jobs,  nor any certainty that these technologies  will lead to  more and better jobs. Rather, it is  em ph a s is ed  that s ociety faces vital choices over what technology  it develops and how i t is used . Ultimately, society  must aim for a digital future where the greatest number of people thrive within work and beyond it .   
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   IV The suggested policy options  range across different levels and scales. They include:   •S kills an d training provision oindustry and sectoral skills alliances that focus on facilitating transitions for workers in 'at risk ' jobs oreskilling for workers in transformed jobs odigital upskilling for working in AI -enhanced environments onew protections for workers in hard -to-automat e jobs •D igital work-life balance othe establishment of a European -level 'right to disconnect '  oa reduction of the EU Working -Time Directive to 38 -hours per week and removal of  the opt -out claus e •G overnance ogreater worker representation, and more democratic workplace organisation   •Du ty to Report Directive oa new directive for the regulation of technology at work •M ission -oriented industr y policy odirect EU involvement in the design and diffusion of digital tec hnologies to ensure  decent work objectives are achieved  T he policy options set out in the report  complement some existing policies, but they also break new  ground in seeking a new Digital Social Contract. The report  argue s that , beyond the existing skills focused agenda , there is a need for wider reforms, inclusive of work time reduction, to enable the  benefits of digital automation to be realised and more widely shared.   T his report is written in the context of a new crisis, nam ely one induced by the Covid -19 pandemic. The  latter has itself accelerated processes of digital automation (for example, through the use of digital  technologies for remote working). It has also revealed the stark inequalities in society. The poorest and  young est in society have suffered the most from the economic effects of the crisis. This report does not  directly address the Covid -19 crisis, but the policy ideas set out in it have relevance for thinking about  ways to rebuild the economy after the crisis.   This  wid e-ranging  report  offers an extensive review of relevant literature and a set of new  policy  options . In all aspect s, it seeks to offer a way forward in the debate on the future of work. I t show s how  digital automation , if properly managed,  could b e a route to economic and social progress. It is  hope d  that policy -makers will take n ote of the policy  options  and that the report will help to spark wider  critical reflection on the possibilities for rethinking technology and work in the future .

Digital automation and the future of work     1 1. Introduction     Modern c apitalist economies  are witnessi ng a period of rapid technological progress. Developments  in new digital technologies, inclusive of  artificial intelligence (AI), are giving rise to significant  disruption including in the world of work  (Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2014; Ford, 2015; Frey, 2019) . For  several  commentators , the Second Machine Age or Fourth Industrial Revolution that societies have  now entered will bring about a significantly different world – indeed, it may create the potential for a  'world without work ' (Susskind, 2020) . More sceptical voices, however, point to the potential for  paid  work to withstand any technolo gical revolution.  These voices, instead, highlight the scope for  technology to transform how we work, including in ways that are regressive  in nature  (Spencer, 2018;  Fleming, 2019).     This report  address es the nature, scope and possible effects of digital automation. It  review s relevant  literature and situate s modern debates on technological change in historical context. It is  r eco gnise d  that modern debates on automation are not in any sense new, but rather  follow a long tradition of  thought. A purpose of the report is to show the continuities as well as possibilities for change in the  use and application of digital technologies.      As the report will show, the impacts of digital technologies are complex and varied. Just as digital  technologies threaten some jobs, so they can help to facilitate new job creation.  They can also lead to  changes in the type and composition of tasks within jobs. Here jobs may be preserved, but in ways that  require different skills from workers. D igital technologies , in turn,  can lead to qualitative changes i n  work – while they can help to create more interesting work and potentially reduced work hours, they  can also be used to increase monitoring at work and to undermine pa y and job security . The report   discusses  in detail how digital automation will impact on the employment sector of modern capital i st  economies , showing how digital technolog ies can alter both the volume and content of work .    The report engage s directly with issues o f policy. It is  argue d that the nature and evolution of  technology in society is not pre -determined, but rather is influenced by wider economic and social  factors . Importantly, there is scope for reform in the way that digital technologies are developed an d  implemented. The report review s current policies to deal with the impacts of digital automation. It  also   offers various policy options  that could be used to ensure that digital technologies realise net benefits  to all in society .    The key policy options  include: industry and sectoral skills alliances that focus on facilitat ing transitions  for workers in ' at risk ' jobs and reskilling for workers in transformed jobs; digital up -skilling for working  in AI -enhanced environments; new protections for workers in hard to automate jobs; the establishment  of a European -level 'right to disconnect '; a reduction of the EU Working -Time Directive to 38 -hours per  week and removal of the opt -out clause; greater worker representation and more democratic  workplace governance; a new directive for the regulation of technology at work; and direct EU  involvement in the design and diffusion of digital technologies to ensure decent work objectives are  achieved .     The policy options identified in the report complement some existing policies, but they also break new  ground in seeking a new Digital Social Contract. It is argued that beyond the existing skills -fo cused  agenda , there is a need for wider reform s, inclusive of work time reduction, to enable the net benefits  of digital automation to be realised and  more  widely shared.     This report is written in the context of a new crisis, namely one induced by the Covid -19 pandemic. The  latter has itself accelera ted processes of digital automation (for example, through the use of digital  technologies for remote working). It has also revealed the stark inequalities in society. The poorest and  young est in society have suffered the most from the economic effects of t he crisis. This report does not 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   2 directly address the Covid -19 crisis, but the policy ideas set out in it have relevance for thinking about   ways to rebuild the economy after the crisis.   T he report is offered as a way forward in the debate on the future of work. The hope is that it will inform  current policy debates and help produce the reforms required to exploit the bounty  of digital  automation , while minimising its costs . A goal of the report is to show the possibilities for change in  society, including the creation of a digital future that maximises societal well- being.   
Digital automation and the future of work     3 2. Methodology      The research contained in this report adopted a mixed -method approach to reviewing previous  literature, combining systematic review techniques with more traditional stra tegies. This section  discusses why these methods were adopted  and how  they were utilised . The principl e methodologi c al  challenges facing this study were how to identify high quality research among a huge quantity of  literature. The literature covering issu es around AI, automation, employment, skills, tasks, and  occupations runs to many thousands of articles in scientific journals alone, not to mention a huge  quantity of secondary, tertiary, and grey literature, as well as trade journals, specialist media co verage,  and popular journalism. A considerable proportion of this literature, however, simply comments on, or  speculates about, the impact of digital automation. Consequently, it was necessary to develop a clearly  defined methodology in order to compile a firm scientific basis for the identification of key issues,  analysis,  and the development of policy options.      Three principal methodologies are available f or literature reviewing:  systematic review, scoping review,  and traditional methods. A systematic re view  offers a way of overcoming bias in both the selecti on of  literature and the criteria of assessment applied to that literature ( Petti crew and Roberts , 2008). In a  field as crowded and contested  as digital automation, th is approach presents clear benefi ts. However,  true systematic reviewing also brings significant difficulties. As a method first developed in medicine  and healthcare, systematic reviewing is best suited to research that aims to answer a clear and speci fic  question; most commonly, assessing  evidence supporting a particular therapeutic intervention or  treatment ( Mulrow,  1994). By contrast, systematic reviews are much less suited to answering more  general questions, such as: identifying themes within a wider body of literature (Pettigrew and Roberts ,  2006); where research requires the bringing together of literatures from different fields, which may use  different definitions, methodologies, or standards of research and evidence ( Curran et al. , 2007); and in  the social sciences in general, wher e research is more often designed to develop causal explanations  than to assess specific interventions ( Jesson et al. , 2011; Tranfield et al. , 2003). Furthermore, systematic  reviewing is very time -consuming ( Arksey and O’Malley , 2005) . Clearly, these consi derations all applied  to the present research , which aimed both to cover a very great range and variety of literature, and to  do so within a relatively compressed timeframe. C onsequently,  it was not feasible to rely exclusively on  systematic review methods  for this report .    A second approach, developed to address some of these difficulties, is the scoping review . Scoping  reviews aim to maintain the standards of rigour provided by  systematic reviews, but apply them  to  questions that a re broader and more general, including where published studies  use a variety of  differing research designs and methods (Arksey and O’Malley , 2005; Levac et al. , 2010; Pham et al. ,  2014). The appeal of this approach for the present research , with its wide focus,  is obvious. Howeve r,  scoping reviews are best suited to giving an overview of the whole literature on a particular topic. As  quickly became apparent, however, the literature dealing with digital automation is already far too  large to be comprehensively mapped in a single st udy.     The third main approach to reviewing literature is commonly termed traditional  (Victor , 2008)  and  usually entails expert s reviewing their own collections  of literature, compiled during the course of  previous research, with additional sea rches based on current journals,  and the reference lists of notable  publications  and previous literature reviews  (sometimes termed ' snowballing '). The main advantage of  this method is speed: literature is already collected and has often been read and discussed previou sly.  The obvious disadvantage, especially where research is intended to inform policy -making, is that   literature selection  is likely to be skewed by previous research interests and specialism . Within the  timeframe availab le for this study, traditional reviewing was justified  because of the speed advantage ,  provided that the problem of bias could be adequately addressed. Consequently, the report co m bine s  traditional and systematic methods – to guard against bias – as follows.    
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   4 Traditional reviewing methods comprised the principl e approach adopted for the  literature search and  review strategy. As a team of five experienced researchers,  the authors of the report had  already  assembled a considerable quantity of literature rela ting to issues ar ound digital automation. Th is   literature included publications from a variety of perspectives, and a range of disciplines and fields of  research, including law, economics , management studies , employment relations, public  policy,  sociotechn ical and technology studies. As stipulated in the project specification, the report  paid car eful  attention to the inclusion of primary and secondary sources, which it was  felt had  been under represented within the broader literature; a view subsequently confirmed by the results of the  systematic review (see below). Nevertheless, there was also  aware ness  that, given the current rapi d  development of research in this area, tertiary and grey literatures would also be important for the report. S ources su ch as co nference proceedings,  working papers , and commercial consultancy reports   are central to current debates and, therefore, crucial for maintaining  the scope of the report and the  breadth of evidence under consideration. These literatures were already well -represented in the  collected literature, and the available selection was further strengthened by snowballing from references of leading publications, previous literature reviews and additional online searches at the  margins and on specific topics. In the fina l list of references for this report, over half were supplied by  these traditional methods (see discussion below).   T he second component of the  mixed -method approach was a systematic literature review. This was  important for two reasons. First ly, it was important  to ensure that any potential biases in the preexisting collections of literature were strictly minimised. Second ly, there was a need to  test the overall  comprehensiveness of the traditional searches. In particular, it was  identified that there w as an   apparent shortage of high quality primary research in the  main area of interest. Therefore, in order to  assess and, where necessary, to strengthen the primary research basis of this report, as per the project specification, a systematic review  was designed and conducted, as follows.   F irstly, drawing on the methods discussed above , a search protocol was devised using relevant searc h  terms in Boolea n combinations . Selecting the most appropriate terms and combinations for this search  was far fro m straightforward. Initial searches  confirmed  the huge volume of literature relating to digital  automation and employment. For instance, an initial search  trialled the following protocol:   ('a rtificial intelligence ' OR AI OR blockchain  OR 'machine learning' OR 'deep learning ' OR  automation ) AND ( employ ment  OR unemploy ment OR ' labo ?r market ' OR job).    T his search produced more than 270,000 hits on only one database ( ABI/Inform – ProQuest) . Since the  project specification required us to identify the most r igorous scientific research, the search was  narrowed by including additional selections for academic journal articles and peer review ed research ,  and also specified English language (in practice, the latter had little effect). Re- running the search wi th  these new terms included still resulted in a count of more than 151,000 articles. A v a r iet y  o f s m a ller   combinations of these and similar terms  was  then tested , which produced smaller numbers of hits for  each individual search, but also produced many duplicates. Nevertheless, several search combinations produced more than 15,000 hits  each . One problem that became apparent was that search terms such  as 'digital ' and 'automation ' have recently become research buzzwords. As a result, many articles were  found that included these terms despite those substantive issues not forming part of the research focus  of the article s. For instance, many articles on sk ills or training mentioned the terms more or less in  passing in the introduction or conclusion, while speculating about possible future developments. By  contrast, the research of interest to this report  tended to use additional, slightly more specialist te rms,  such as 'artificial intelligence ' or 'machine learning '. Consequently, it was possible to  exclude terms  such as ' automation ' and 'digital ' without excluding the scientific literature that was being investigated .  Furthermore, by retaining some more gen eral terms, such as ' skills ' and 'occupation ', it was possibl e to  locate research from a range of literatures that did not share discipline- specific terminologies. A non exhaustive list of disciplines covered by the studies i dentified in the report include s la w, eco n o m ics,  psychology, management studies, public administration, and medicine. Thus, a combination of some 
Digital automation and the future of work     5 more general and some more specific terms, arrived at by progressive trialling, provided the best  overall framework for the systematic search .     After trialling  combinations of search terms  as described  above , the search  settled on the following  protocol:     ('artificial intelligence ' OR blockchain OR 'machine learning ') AND (employment OR  unemployment OR ' labo?r market ' OR skills OR occupation OR profession).     This search was run on four business databases: ABI -Inform (ProQuest), EBSCO, JSTOR, and Web of  Science. As with previous studies (e.g. Arksey and O’Malley , 2005), different databases produced widely  divergent resu lts. For instance, JSTOR produced 230 hits, whereas ABI -Inform (ProQuest) produced  more than 5,600. It is unclear whether such divergences were due to different availability of sources or  differences in the search algorithms on each database.     In order to  check that no significant results had been missed by excluding search terms such as ' digital '  and 'automation ', searches using these terms  were run , in the following combinations:     digital AND (employment OR unemployment OR ' labo?r market ' OR skil ls OR o ccupation OR  profession)   and:   automation AND (employment OR unemployment OR 'labo?r market ' OR skills OR occupati on  OR profession).     Again, the ABI-Inform (Pro Quest) database was used (which persistently returned the highest number  of hits). Here the 'digital ' test returned 28,751 hits: among the first 100 returns, only two were  potentially relevant to the study, and one of those had already been found in the main searc h  combination. The first 100 returns for this search included many examples of the appl ication of wellknown modelling techniques (discussed below) to particular countries or regions, but with no  substantive addition to theoretical knowledge or overall analysis. The ' automation ' test returned 8,560  hits: again the first 100 returns included only two potentially relevant articles, one of which had already  been identified. Once more, the first 100 results of this search were dominated by the application of  modelling techniques to countries or regions. Finally, the below  combination  was tested :     digital AND automation.      This search produced 8,572 hits. Of the first 100 returns, three were relevant to the  research  covered by  the report , and all of these had been identified by the main search protocol. The remainder of the first  100 hits were do minated by a mix of technical articles about the application of digital automation in  particular fields of production, speculative discussions about the possible effects of future  technological developments , or local applications of model ing. Overall, the result of these tests  indicated that the  selected search protocol, using a tested combination of search terms, had achieved  a more than satisfactory coverage of the existing research; had focused significantly on the scientifi c  literature (as per the project specification); had increased the relevancy rate of the  findings (reduced  the proportion of irrelevant hits); and had not unduly excluded research from a range of disciplines and  fields of research.     Next, the study  applied further inclusion and exclus ion criteria to the initial search results. To begin  with, search results dating from January 2010 to the present  were included ; that is, research dating  from the beginning of the recovery from the global financial crisis – the period also coinciding with the  post -recession growth in tech companies and markets. Attention was given to  findings that were peer reviewed, that appeared in scholarly  journals , and that were published  in English ( again, in practice,  this language stipulation had little effect). The  large number of results produced by the ABI -Inform 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   6 (ProQuest ) database was reduced by sorting by relevance, and then by exhaustion; specifically,  database findings were listed by relevance and then sorted manually, and manual sorting was halted  after 3,200 items, by which point no new items of interest had been identified in more than 200 hi ts,  suggesting that very few further relevant findings would be discovered by continuing. Finally, the  results of the  four database searches were combined and duplicates eliminated.   T he combined d atabase fin dings were then filtered by  title -abstract scr eening, abstract screening, full text screening where necessary, and online checks of journal reviewing practices. A rticles based on  interviews, book reviews, invited commentary, and editorials  were excluded . Articles  that were not  based on empirical research, and empirical studies with a narrow focus on particular markets that di d not add to wider analysis , were also excluded . Despite the stipulated search criteria, the database s  returned many  articles or working pape rs that were not peer reviewed . Thus, the study  identified only  64 articles that met all the  criteria of rigour for primary sources. This confirmed the  initial expectations  about the limited base of high quality, empirical research  (see above), among the huge volume of  commentary on issues around digital automation, most of which comprises secondary,  tertiary and  grey literature. Nevertheless, the systematic search identified a large number of articles tha t, while they  did not meet all criteria for primary sources,  appeared to be of a high standard, and could be selected  for inclusion  in the literature review. As a result, the systematic part of the  literature search produc ed a  final total of 236 sources. T o put these findings in perspective, this represents fewer than half of the  publications listed in the references at the end of this report. Nevertheless, the systematic part of the   literature review appears to be strongly justified.    O verall, the mixed -method approach to literature reviewing worked well. The systematic review,  despite contributing only a minority of the literature used in this report, achieved two important goals.  First ly, it filled out previous findings and brought assurance as to the r eliability of the selection of   literature , by ensuring that the  traditional literature collection methods used in the report had not led  to significant blind -spots or omissions. Second ly, it contributed sources from disciplines and fields  outside the speci alisms of the research team; in particular, brin ging to  the attention of the team  research in specialist and technical literatures from sectors of the economy that are most likely to be  affected by digital automation. The traditional component of the  appro ach taken in the report started  with a considerable, previously assembled collection of literature, which was  further strengthened by  additional searches  and  snowballing, which boosted coverage across a range of  areas , especially at the  margins . As noted previously, traditional methods of literature reviewing produced more than half of  the literature used in the preparation of this report. Consequently, an unexpected but perhaps  welcome conclusion of this report  is a qualified reaffirmation  of th e methods of traditional literature  reviewing. Indeed, the t raditional methods provided by a group of experienced researchers with expert  knowledge of the field proved essential. Without these methods, compiling this report would not have  been possible.  As a result , the choice and implementation of this mixed -method approach to literature  searching and reviewing appears vindicated.   A  further outcome of the literature review was a framework for addressing the topic of digital  automation. The review helped to identify key contributions as well as a structure for analysing digital  automation. In particular, it offered a way to see how digital automation might alter the volume and  nature of work. It also provided a basis for developing possible policy options . In choosing policies, the  report was  guided by the critical assessment of literature. The  above  aspects of the literature review  and the links to policy are developed b elow. But first consideration is given to so me issues of  terminology.   
Digital automation and the future of work     7 3. What is dig ital automation ?    The present wave of technological change has been variously described as the Second Machine Age ,  Fourth Industrial Revolution , or Industry 4.0 . It is distinguished from what has been termed as the Third  Industrial Revolution, which entailed the rise of information and communications technologies  (ICT) ,  including computerisation and the internet . The various technological innovations that have enabl ed  the current technolog ical wave  have been made possible by the exponential expansion of computi ng  power and  data storage, and the decreasing cost of software and hardware .    Digital information, or data, ha ve become a strategic resource. D ata capture  and storage  are now a  central activity for many firms and organi sations . Artificial Intelligence (AI)  relies on these elements and  is fundamental to the power of technology to extend and deepen the process of digital automati on .  The key aspect with digital automation is that it  allows the human input into production to be  r educed ,  while leveraging the power of networks and data to expand the role of machines . That is , it enables the  move to more automated processes where the work undertaken by humans is less extensive.     Historically , technologi cal change  has served  to replace humans – either wholly or partly – in the  performance of particular tasks. Industrial a utomation was  originally limited to manual tasks – for  example, in manufacturing, the expansion of machinery has  displaced many millions of manual  workers. Capitalist economies have developed processes of deindustrialisation, in part , due to the  greater use of automated forms of production.     In the present, advances in computation offer the basis for the automation  of routine intellectual tasks ,  threatening  many jobs in the service sector that make up the majority of employment in  modern  capitalist economies . With AI-driven digital automation, the re is now the capacity to automate or  augment human activity that requires adaptation  and learning . 'Smart ' machines have the potential to   mimic and even supersede the intelligence of humans in certain tasks.  New digital technologies , in  this   case,  promise  to reduce the labour input into production and allow for the elim ination of jobs   previously thought to be immune to automation . These same technologies also promise to change  how work is done.     There are a number of key terms that relate to , and underpin , the notion of digital automation . It  is   important to define these  terms to maintain a consistent analysis throughout the rest of the report. The   key terms focused on below are: automation, robotics, digitalisation,  the Internet of Things,  datafication, blockchain and AI .      Automation : The term automation  was coined in 1947 by Ford Motor Co mpany  Vice President  Delmar   S. Harder  (Noble, 1984) . Harder was referring to the increased use of electromechanical, hydraulic, and  pneumatic machinery. As Noble (1984) points out, the development of 'self-acting ' pr o du ct ion   machines a nd automatic transfer machines were what made possible the integrated control of factory  operations  that enabled the reduc tion of labour in the manufacturing sector.  Today, the National  Academy of Sciences (2017)  defines automation as ' the technique, metho d, or system of operating or  controlling a process by highly automatic means, as by electronic devices, reducing human  intervention to a minimum '. Here the definition of automation is expanded to include ' electronic  devices ', which have been a key element of the automaton process since the 1970s .    Robotics : There is no single agreed definition  of what constitutes a robot. All definitions include the  criteria that the task performed by a robot must be completed without human intervention.  Some  definitions require the task to be completed by a physical machine that responds to its environment,  while others also include tasks completed by virtual machines such as software (this would also include  AI: see below ). The International Federation of Robotics [IFR] adopts the International Organi sation for  Standardisation (ISO) definition 8373 of a n industrial  robot:  'An automatically controlled, 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   8 reprogrammable, multipurpose manipulator programmable in three or more axes, which may be  either fixed i n place or mobile for use in industrial automation applications ' (IFR, 2017).  A service robot  is defined according to the same criteria ; however, its application corresponds to the performance of  useful tasks for humans or equipment excluding industrial automation application . In this case,  the  application of robots is extended to personal and professional services, expanding the potential  range  of automation .  D igitalisation : Digitalisation , in the most basic sense , refer s to digitation , or the process of converting  analogue information into a numerical format readable by a computer . Digitation 'allows information  of all kinds in all formats to be carried with the same efficiency and also intermingled ' (McQuail , 2000 :  34). Digitalisation marks the shift from analogue to digital information in  work and society more  generally through the adoption of ICT. ICT encompasses  hardware such as computers, telephones,  servers as well as software such as computer program mes and mobile applications. The term ICT is  typically used in the literature from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, while the terms digital and  digitalisation are more frequent ly used  in recent publications. Digitalisation paved the way for  the  adoption of smartphone technologies, data analytics, encryption services, the use of algorithms to  regulate production, networks, the ' internet of things ' (see below) , and the use of AI , amo ng others. In   industry, these are referred to as 'I ndustrial Digitalisation Technologies ' (IDTs ) (Maier, 2017: 18). Such  technologies tend to push companies toward customer -centric business models and personali sed  products. IDTs enable physical and virtual worlds to merge and are driving what has been called the  Fourth Industrial Revolution ( Schwab, 2017).  I nternet o f Things:  The Internet of Things ( IoT) is essentially a global network infrastructure that rel i es  on sensor, network, data processing, and communication technologies to connect a wide varie ty of  devices allowing for remote and digitally automated control. The concept of a  IoT was first introduced  in the 1980s at Carnegie Mellon University and then gained popularity in 1999 with the Auto -ID centre  at MIT when it was combined with Radio -frequency identification (RFID) ( Liu and Chen, 2009; Martinelli  et al. , 2019). RFID is a foundational technology for IoT because it allows microchips to automatical l y  identify, track and monitor a particular device through wireless communication ( Xu et al. , 2014). It is  widely used in logistics, supply chain management, pharm aceutic als and retail. Wireless sensor  networks (WSN ) are another foundational part of IoT and are now used in the monitoring of  environmental conditions, health , and traffic. With the normalisation of smartphone usage and sensor  network technologies in e veryday appliances, IoT has proliferated . IoT has now evolved into the  'Internet of Things and Services ' (IoTS ), expanding its reach and span of control  (Kagermann et al. ,  2013).   D atafication : Datafication refers to the acceleration of data collection, transfer and storage ( Hazas et  al., 2016; Sadowski , 2019). Discussions of data typically focus on user data from apps and social medi a ;  however , the industrial use of data from machinery, transportation, commerce and other activities has  become the norm. T he proliferation of data sets has come to be known as ' big data ' and the analysi s of  such large data sets, typically through the use of AI , can reveal hidden patterns, correlations and other  trends that inform organisational strategy. The term ' big data ' was first used in the context of the  growing volume of data in the mid -1990s and continues to be used to refer to the changes in volume,  velocity and variety of data received because of the different analytical approaches required to process  it. Growth in d ata normally follows what is known as Cooper’s law, in which traffic roughly doubles  every 2.5 years ( Björnson and Larsson , 2018). Most companies now rely on ' cloud computing ', wh ich   refers to the use of third -party, off- site networked and distributed  facilities , rather than their own  servers for data storage and processing . This data infrastructure allows companies to be more dynamic  and flexible, responding to changes in demand by renting additional capacity from cloud platform  providers ( Holtgrewe, 2014). At the same time, direct and triangulated data on worker and consumer  behaviour is becoming a fo rm of capital  (Crain , 2018). Such data is transform ed into an intangible asset  and is used to develop and reproduce  virtual machinery via machine -learning AI (Ciarli et al. , 2018). The  data broker industry alone is estimated to generate $200bn in annual revenue (Crain , 2018) and is 
Digital automation and the future of work     9 expanding rapidly since the margin between the monetary value of data and the compensati on  provided to those producing it is subst antial ( Roderick , 2014).     Blockchain : There is not one blockchain technology, but rather several, and almost all of the  components originated in academic research from the 1980s and 1990s ( Narayanan and Clark, 2017 ).  Blockchains were first described by their pseudonymous inventor(s) Satoshi Nakamoto as  Distributed  Ledger Technology ( DLT ) in 2009. DLT s are best understood as an innovative combination of existi ng  mechanisms forming ' a class of technologies ' (Beck et al., 2018) . Blockchain can be described as a  synchronised and shared database stored across multiple nodes (computers that store a local version  of the DLT) and maintained by a consensus algorithm. The main purpose of a blockchain is to share  information across all nodes that access it in such a way as to ensure that the shared informati on i s  protected against modification. There is no singular point of failure or attack at the hardware level  (Finck, 2019) . DLT s serve as an accounting system that can be used by many actors to standardise and  link data to ' enable credible accounting of digital events ' (Bartoletti et al., 2019) . The first widespread  commercial implementation of DLT was the Bitcoin crypto currency, though its use and applicati on has  broadened out into se ctors such as retail , transportation  and accounting .    Artificial Intelligence [AI]: AI refers to what is essentially a  virtual machine or an ' information processing system that the programmer has in mind when writing a program, and that people have i n  mind  when using it ' (Boden, 2016:  4). In the nineteenth  century, Ada Lovelace theorised virtual  machines that formed the foundations of modern computing, including stored program mes, feedback  loops and bugs , among other things. Alan Turing is credited with mak ing the theoretical break through   in 1947 that led to modern computation and A I. There are many competing definitions of AI. Margaret  Boden (2016:  1) defines AI as the attempt ' to make computers do the sorts of things that [human] mi nds  can do '. For purpose s of this report, we use the OECD (2019)  AI Group of Experts (AIGO) definition of an  AI system as  a:     machine -based system that can, for a given set of human -defined objectives, make predictions,   recommendations or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. It uses machine and/or  human -based inputs to perceive real and/or virtual environments; abs tract such perceptions into  models (in an automated manner e.g. with machine learning  or manually); and use model inferenc e  to formulate options for information or action. AI systems are designed to operate w ith varying  levels of autonomy.     Today, even  the most advanced AI is of a narrow type (often called ' Artificial Narrow Intelligence or  ANI), in that its intelligence is generally limited to the frame in which it is programmed. Some AI systems   can evolve autonomously through machine  learning, but these are still a weak form of AI relative to  human cognition. In an influential essay from the 1980s, John Searle makes the distinction betw een  'weak ' and 'strong ' AI. This distinction is useful in understanding the current capacities of AI versus  human intelli gence . For weak AI, ' the principl e value of the computer in the study of the mind is that i t  gives us a very powerful tool '; while for strong AI ' the appropriately programmed computer really i s a  mind, in the sense that computers given the right programs can be literally said to understand and  have other cognitive states ' (Searle, 1980:  417) . For strong AI, the program mes are not merely tools that  enable humans to develop explanations of cognition; rather  the program mes themselves are  essentially the same as human cognition.  Clearly, with the  potential  development of strong AI, the  scope for humans to be replaced in production and service delivery is increased significantly .    Digital Automation:  Digital automation has been occurring in industry since the in troduction of mass  computing. Computerisation initially digitised automatic machinery and back office processes   (Campbell -Kelly, 2015) . The digital automation of production eventually developed into the digital  automation of aspects of consumption with the  massification of internet and mobile technologies. I n  the early twenty -first century, advances in compute r power, sensor technologies ( IoT) and human  behaviour (from online mobile activity) have produced an avalanche of new data (Zuboff, 2019) . This  
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   10  ongoi ng connectivity and data capture has catalysed a historic rise of AI  applications in industry and  society more generally. The significance of the current wave of technological advancement is that  digital automation is now enabled and driven by AI. Vertically integrated digital platforms are  expanding across the globe and are poised to dominate many sectors of the economy  (Srnicek, 2016 ).  The expansion of these platforms is based on tech companies’ monopolistic control  over data and data  infrastructu re (Kitchin, 2014; Montalban et al., 2019) . AI-enabled and driven digital automation is   grow ing to such a degree that  data -based  intelligent systems are re- organising and coordinati ng   whole sectors  of the economy .  T he concepts and technologies outlined a bove are the drivers of  the so -called Fourth  In du s t rial  Revolution  (also referred to as the Second Machine Age). They tend to be interdependent and together  capture a wider infrastructural shift in the economy and social life, largely based around the  conv ergence of physical and virtual machines  enabled by data, networks, and AI. This broader socio economic shift is what the popular colloquialism of the Fourth Industrial Revolution refers to. Another, more focused concept , is Industry 4.0, which refers to a primarily  German endeavour to take advantage  of new technologies in manufacturing and services in order to maintain competitiveness ( Ho lt grewe ,  2014).  Whatever terminology is used, however, there is the view that developments in digital  technologies will have enormous impacts not just on how we interact with one another, but al so on  the qua ntity and quality of our daily work.  The notion that we are experiencing a fundamental change  feeds a view of a society in which everything in life ( including work and e mployment) is  set to be  upended. Yet, as will be shown  in the next section, discourse on technological disruption has endured  and the present round of debate on the future of technology and work cover s some old ground.  
Digital automation and the future of work     11 4. Technological change  in context     Historically, industrial revolutions have involved technological innovations that have disrupted wh ole  sectors of industry such that they either under gone  major transformations  or disappeared altogether .  Such disruptions have tend ed to be one primary factor driving structural transformations in economy  and society.  Commentators from Karl Marx to Joseph Schumpeter have referred to cycles of change  linked to technology . These cycles  have not been smooth n or automatic , but instead have been  associated with  social conflict and resistance.       In Britain, for example, t he First Industrial Revolution during the period from roughly 1771 to 1830  featured opposition from the so- called Luddites . The latter resisted the loss of their skills and  livelihoods through the introduction of new machines. T hey were not alone. In 1814, printers at T he  Times  of London took strike action in  protest at the arrival of steam -powered presses , which threatened  their  jobs . This protest  was quelled only after the paper’s owners promised to retain  printers ( Eisenstein,  1979).  Agricultural workers participating in the 'Swing Riots' of 1830 successfully revolted against  steam -powered threshing machines in Southern and Eastern England ( Stevenson, 1979:  243) . While  employment remained high during the nineteen th and early twentieth century confoundi ng  predictions made by the Luddites and others that employment would fall, the use of machinery di d  little to ease the burden and oppression of factory work ( Mokyr et al. , 2015).  In this case, technol ogy  remained a contested issue.     In the late nineteenth  century, the ' machinery question ' (i.e. the effects of technology on employment)   receded from view in  the discourse of classical, non -Marxist po litical economy ( Berg, 1980:  130) . As  Mokyr et al. (2015)  point out, the question returned in the early twentieth century in the writings of  Knut Wicksell who argued that technological progress could either lower or raise the marginal product  of labour and wages depending on whether technology substituted for lab our or augmented it   (Wicksell, 1901) . During the Great Depression,  interest in the job -destroying effects of technology again  rose in prominence, not least because of concern about the collapse in labour demand .    In his famous essay 'Economic Possibilities  for our Grandchildren ' published in 1930, the great  economist, J.M. Keynes viewed th e possibility for labour -saving technological progress as real. Keynes  (1933) used the term  'technological unemployment ' to describe a situation in which innovation that  economi sed on the use of labour outstripped the pace at which new jobs could be created. Keynes  predicted that technological unemployment would grow in the future, as capital accumulati on  accelerated. Capit alism would end up creating fewer jobs, through the great use of labour -s a ving  technology . But Keynes was sanguine about the effects of a move to a jobless world. While there would  be costs of adjustment, the reduction of paid work in society was to be welcomed – indeed, it was to  be embraced as a means  to improve the quality of live . If technology could be harnessed to reduce  work time, while maintaining living standards, then society could liv e better than now. For Keynes,  technological progress promised liberation from work and a leisured existence.     Keynes’ dream  of a future leisure society failed to materialise. Instead of diminishing with technological  progress, e mployment remained high, while work hours failed to fall in the way Keynes predicted   (Keyn es famously predicted that the working week would fall to fifteen hours per week by 2030 –  current trends in work hours suggest this prediction will not be realised).  The loss of employment in  agriculture and manufacturing h as been more than offset by the rapid expansion of service -based  industries ( Stewart et al., 2015).  Consumerism , in general, has  put paid to a leisured future, while the  loss of power of unions and rising inequality after the 1970s has helped to slow (and indeed reverse)  the secular decl ine in work hours  (Spencer, 2018) .    More recently,  as ha s been  discussed above,  commentators  have predicted a new wave of automati on.  These commentators suggest that society is entering a technological phase where many existing jobs 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   12  will cease to exist . Brynjolfsson and McAfee’s The  Second Machine Age  (2014)  is a major reference in  t his   respect . They historicise technological change according to the F irst and S econd Machine Ages. The  First Machine Age is what some economic historians refer to as the S econd Industrial Revolution. I t w as  driven by the invention of the steam engine: a form  of technology that enabled  machines to replace  human and animal muscle -power. The Second Machine Age is an age catalysed by exponential  advances in computer technology in which intelligent machines substitute for human brain power. It   describes the present and future of capitalism , where machine race ahead of humans, creating the basi s  for a profoundly different (and possibly workless) society .  B rynjolfsson and McAfee outline  the main features of the S econd Machine Age as: ' sustai ned  exponential improvement in most aspects of computing, extraordinarily large amounts of digitized  information, and recombinant innovation' ( Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 201 4: 90). Their argument relies  on the work of anthropologist Ian Morris, whose research  attempts to quantify human social  development ( 'a group’s ability to master its physical and intellectual environment to get things done ')  from 14,000 BCE to the present. His metrics consist of four attributes : energy capture, organi sation, war making capacity, and information technology, each converted into a number from zero to 250 that  varies over time. Based on Morris’ metrics , Brynjolfsson and McAfee divide  human history i nto tw o  distinct machine ages. In doing so , they cut the history of industrial capitalism in two, with the first  period covering nearly two centuries and the second, unsurprisingly , beginning now  and extending  into the future .  T his approach is problemati c for a number of reasons. For example, it ignores the economic history  literature that generally periodises technological change according to the infrastructural and social effects of industrial revolutions (see Perez , 2002; 2010) . Location and i nfrastruc ture, together with  organisational and social factors , play an important role in technology adoption  and diffusion   (MacKenzie and Wajcman , 1999).  In this case, technology does not have its own logic and momentum,  but instead is shaped by context and place. Another issue with the account of Brynjolfsson and McAfee is that it places the US at the centre of technological transformation, a role that it did not hold for the  first 150 years of industrialisation and a role that is challenged now by developments in Europe and China. Further, even if we agree with the authors that we face a historically unprecedented  transformation, their approach to analysi ng technology is marred by a form of technologic al  determinism that misses the historical and social context in which technology is developed and used. In particular, Brynjolfsson and McAfee miss how digital technologies may be stymied and limited i n  their  effects by the politics of production (see Spencer, 2017). Any assessment of the degree to which  technological change influences the labour market must also consider workers’ agency and broader  social factors influencing the diffusion and application of t echnology.   A nother major contribution to the recent literature on technological change is Frey’s (2019)  The  Technology Trap . Frey provides a history of technological development in the UK and US from  preindustrial times, through the rise of mass industria l production and the middle classes, and final l y  to the present wave of AI -driven digital automation. Central to this account is the idea that  technological change benefits societies in the long -run. Frey’s argument hinges on a distincti on  between labour -enabling technologies that complement workers, increase productivity and create  new areas of employment, and labour -replacing technologies, which substitute machines for jobs,  push workers out of the labour market and force them to re -skill. He re he draws o n the influential w ork  of Daron Acemoglu and Pascal Restrepo as well as David Autor. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018a ) argue  that the wage trends over the past several decades are best understood as a race between enabling and replacing technologies. Frey uses  this schema to periodise history into eras  in which technol ogy  benefitted  workers and those  in which it harmed them. He illustrates the disruptive 's hort run ' costs to  workers with the famous example of ' Engels’ Pause ' – the period 1780- 1840 during the Fi rst Industri al  Revolution, when output per worker grew by 46 percent, yet weekly wages only grew by 12 percent (Allen, 2009).  
Digital automation and the future of work     13 In what Frey (2019:  190)  refers to as the Second Industrial Revolution , by contrast, workers largel y  benefited from technological developments in their own lifetime: 'factory electrification allowed  workers to produce more and thus earn more' . He draws on Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018b : 1489)  who   note that the  technological cha nges that occurred during the period from 1875 to the early twen t ieth   century  led to  the creation of new labo ur-intensive tasks, creating  jobs for a ' new class of engineers,  machinists, repairmen, conductors, back -office workers and managers ' (Acemoglu and  Restrepo,  2018b : 1489) . Frey characterises the first three quarters of the twentieth century as ' the great levelling ',  which he claims was a result of labour -enabling technologies situated within an era of welfare  capitalism driven by the New Deal ( Frey, 2019: 200). Workers voted for policies that matched with  t heir   interests and thus benefitted from labour -enabling social welfare policies. In contrast to the fo r egoing  era, a ' great reversal ' has occurred during the long ue durée  of neoliberalism from  the 1970s to the  present. Working conditions today are in comparable to those of the first industrial revolution, but ' the  trajectories of per capita output and people’s wages look exceedingly similar ' (Frey, 2019:  244) . In the  US, labour productivity sinc e 1979 has grown eight times faster than hourly compensation.  Frey does  not dwell much on the political and institutional changes that have driven these outcomes, but instead  favours an argument that gives emphasis to technological shifts as drivers of cha nge in the wider  economy.     A final approach to the historicisation of technological change focuses more specifically on the  relationship between general purpose technologies ( GPT ), the social transformation of infrastructure ,  and productivity effects. Th is approach recognises how technologies and society mutually shape one  another and offers a more specific historical perspective on the occurrence of technological disruption .  GPT's are characteri sed by  three criteria:  their pervasive effect on society, their inherent potential for  technical development, and ' innovational complementarities ' that  facilitat e increasing returns -to-s cale  (Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995 ). Productivity typically refers to a measure of how mu ch output (or  income) is generated for a fixed amount of input, usually an average hour of work.  Perez (2002)  provides a very useful framework in this regard. She argues that economic growth since the end of the  eighteenth century has gone through five dis tinct stages characterised by successive technological  revolutions , the last of which has been  marked by computerisation and the development of  ICT.     In the context of Perez’s (2002 , 2010) periodisation of technological revolutions, the diffusion of AI driven digital automation technology under the so -called Fourth Industrial Revolution can be  understood as a sixth industrial revolution . This 'revolution ' is defined by  the capacities of intelligent  machines to capture and transform data, and to exponentially scale new forms of digital technology   through network effects (Haskel and Westlake, 2017; Hendler and Golbeck, 2008) . It relies on the  technologies outlined in the previous section, which have facilitated the automation of tasks that  previously were not able to be performed by machines.     The increase in datatification and the use of AI has enabled the rise of the so -called 'intangible  economy ', which refers to the steady move to intangible investment: a type of investment that is  fundamentally different from tangible investment (Haskel and Westlake, 2017) . The intangibl e  components of capital include intellectual property rights, branding, repu tation, and data netw orks.  Thanks to previous industrial revolutions and the progress in digital technologies , the marginal cost of  the production of many goods and services is approaching zero. Guellec and Paunov (2017) , for  example,  note that the capital  requirement for developing software, which is at the foundation of  digital innovation and transformation, is significantly lower than that for other types of technologic al  innovation (e.g. pharmaceutical laboratories, chemical experiments and mechanical p rototyping).     The low marginal cost of such intangible innovation and the capacity for exponential scaling up  through consumer connectivity facilitates the creative destruction that is at the core of the latest  industrial revolution. Entry barriers to the  AI-driven intangible economy are significantly lower than  with previous industrial revolutions, which catalyses the process of creative destruction through  perpetual updating of applications and software ( Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995 ). Zysman and 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   14  Kenn ey (2017: 55) argue that a growing ' ecosystem of organisations and networks now exists to  provide funding for entrepreneurial experiments made possible by the technological changes,  reducing the cost of starting an ICT firm' . These investors are concerned w ith secur ing market power   and large short -term returns, often at the expense of workers . The global reach of digital products al so  allows for new opportunities for service delivery and rent capture.   S tudies of technological change , as sketched out above,  provide an important historical lens through  which to understand the effects of the present wave of digital automation on work and employment. Major technological disruptions have led to industrial revolutions that have fundamentally changed  society, elim inating entire sectors and the occupations within them , while augmenting others or  creating entirely new ones. Such changes, in turn,  have been met with resistance and led to social  upheaval , but they have also provided huge productivity gains and, at time s, wage increases , that have  increased living standards  and brought fewer hours of work  for many millions of people.   Y et, at the same, there have been continuities. The persistence of paid work has been one key feature  of the evolution of technology. Each  new technological revolution has changed the type and often the  content of work on offer (as well as wages and work hours), but it has not led to any lessening i n the work we are required to do. Rather, most of us have continued to work, despite (and indeed often because) of technological change. This reflects the fact that technology can create work, as well as  displace it, and that changes in technology can be labour -augmenting. History proves this fact. Still , w e  are now faced with predictions that work  will – finally – disappear, in the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  Such predictions are assessed in the following section s. 
Digital automation and the future of work     15 5. Effects of digital automation     There are multiple ways in which digital automation can impact on work and employment. In thi s  section, t he effects of digita l automation are viewed from three different angles. Firstly, there are the  dire ct effect s on employment. Here the discussion  engage s with arguments and predictions  concerning job destruction through digital automation.  Second ly, there are the effect s on wages.  Again there are different arguments about the impacts of digital automation on wages, some positive,  other s negative. Thirdly, there are the effect s on the nature and content of work  itself . In this case,  attention is gi ven to  the different ways in which digital technologies could transform work, as opposed  to vary its volume. Will digital technologies, for example, lead to higher skilled work and reduce d work   hours ? Or will they deskill work and increase the intensity and possibly duration of work ?    A comment can be added at the outset. The effects outlined below do not exist in isolation, but rather  interconnect. Job destruction, for example, can coincide with erosions in wages and falls in job quali ty.  Furt her, these effects are not guaranteed, nor predetermined. Rather they are highly mediated and  subject to change. In practice, they may also lead to active resistance and prompt the need for reform.  It will be  argue d that technological change will need to b e managed, if it is to yield net benefits to  workers . The kinds  of reform needed to secure a better digital future are outlined  in a later section.     5.1 Job destruction     The most immediate effect of digital automation is to displace jobs. Technological unempl o ym ent  can   be seen as the effect of rapid expansion of digital technologies. But here questions are raised about the  extent and nature of job displacement. How many jobs could be lost th rough digital automation? In   which sectors and locations will jobs mos t likely disappear? And, crucially, how quickly will jobs  disappear? The answers to these questions clearly carry major implications for the types of policies that  will be needed to manage digital automation. As will be discussed below, however, the answer s to  these questions are, to date at least, far from clear, and in a number of cases, contested.     By far the most influential of the recent wave of predictions about the impact of digital automati on on  employment has been that of Frey and Osborne (2013, 2017). First published as an Oxford University  working paper in 2013, its impact was immediat e. The reason is not hard to discern. Frey and Osborne  (2017: 265) conclude  that '47 percent of total US employment is [at] high risk ' of automation  withi n the  next  twenty years. If accurate, t his sta rk prediction , from a US perspective,  implies huge challenges for  workers, policy -makers, and society in general . Although Frey and Osborne’s study has  been subject to  a number of criticisms ( discussed below ), it identifies important issues that have become recurri ng  themes i n the literature, and which represent still  unres olved problems for predicting the impact of  digital automation on employment .     First ly, there is the question of methodology. A particular  feature of Frey and Osborne’s own esti mate   and many other similar estimates is that they derive from economic models built around the  expectations of experts about what computers may be capable of in years to come. The greater the  expectations, the higher the estimate  of predicted job losses . The fact that expectations are based on  opinion (and hence subject to potential biases) makes the above approach far from  ideal. At the same  time, other researchers have developed alternative approaches, designed to ov ercome the  methodological problem of reliance on expert opinion. Some studies work from data about the impac t  on employment of previous waves of technology, while others are grounded in surveys of senior  managers concerning their plans for technological investment. Examples of both types are discussed  below. However, these approaches bring their own difficulties, which, in part, explain the continui ng  influence of studies based on expert opinion.    
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     16 Second ly, there are complex issues in understanding how any  given technical capacity for digital  automation is linked to levels of employment.  Automation operates at the level of tasks, not jobs, so  estimates of impacts on employment depend on how expectations of task -shifts are translated into  numbers of actual j obs. Furthermore, most research expects that digital automation will have  differential effects on different sectors of the economy, with some sectors likely to lose more jobs than  others. At the same time, there is a common expectation that digital automat ion will also create jobs  (discussed below). Thus, the problem is not simply to estimate how many jobs will be destroyed, but  overall net job losses , when those impacts are balanced against jobs created elsewhere. Any robust  estimate of net job losses must  accurately capture complex interactions between sectors where jobs  are lost and other parts of the economy  where jobs may be created .     Third ly, the question of timescale: over what period of time will the predicted changes take place? For  policy -makers , in particular, this is a crucial issue. In practice, technolog ies such  as driverless cars have   proved much more elusive than  enthusiasts have repeatedly assume d. Moreover, as discussed further  below, the diffusion of digital technolog ies depends on a rang e of social, economic, and political  factors, in addition to any purely technological developments.     It can also be noted that attempts to estimate the impact of digital automation  on employment   produce  significantly varied results. Findings from a select ion of the most influential studies are  summarised in Table 1 . Difference s are apparent  in the extent and also timing of the estimated  employment effects of digital automation.  Headline differences often reflect differing approaches to  the problem of how to link task -level analysis to job -level employment numbers, or how to articulate  the relationship between sectors most impacted by digital automation and other parts of the eco nomy.  Different estimates also reflect attempts to overcome the problematic reliance on expert opinion, by  developing alternative methodologies.  Overall, it is clear from the table that there is no consensus over  the extent of job destruction through digital automation – rather, there is a range of estimates, each  pointing to different outcomes for the volume of employment.  Further discussion o f the  alternative  methodological approaches taken to arrive at these estimates is taken up below.

(2018)  USA 'Forthcoming 10  years '  Job loss 'limite d '; job creation  'substantial '; overal l, ' usual  structural change '.     5.1.1 Tasks, occupations and jobs     One important source of variation in estimates of the job -destruction potential of digital automation   concerns the accurate identification of exactly what it is that might be automated. Again, a s Frey and  Osborne ( 2013, 2017) recognise, automation takes place at the level of tasks ; that is, spec ific, concrete  actions that are grouped together to make up jobs. Because jobs – or, alternatively, occupations – are  made up of a more or less varied mix of  tasks, digital automation will have differing impacts according  to the type and combination of tasks involved in diffe rent types of work. Jobs with a high proporti on  of tasks that can be automated are mor e at risk than jobs comprised of  more varied or less automatabl e  tasks. Frey a nd Osborne tackle this issue  by assessing  tasks that are typical of different categories of  occupations , based on US data. In this way, they are able to link the automation of tasks to impacts on  labour markets, via the mediating notion of occupation s, to arrive at t he high figure of 47  percent of  US jobs  being at risk of automation. This  estima te is  grounded in the judgement of machine learning  experts about whether it is possible to automate – now or in the future – the main task of each of  seventy  occupations, according to the task -level characteristics of each  occupation as detailed in the  US O*NET database of occupational task composition.1 Furthermore, i nformation from this exercise is  then used to estimate the probability that occupation s not j udg ed directly by the experts are  automatable . Importantly, though, in presenting their analysis at the level of risk  of automation, Frey  and Osborne are explicit in not answering question s about the scale of actual job -destruction : 'We  make no attempt to estimate how many jobs will actua lly be automated ' (2017:  268).  Moreover, Frey  and Osborne also assume that workers whose jobs are lost to automation will seek work elsewhere, as  has happened with previous waves of disruptive technology – providing, that is, that these workers are  able to gain appropriate new skills , especially 'creative and social skills ' (ibid.: 269) that are thought to  be less susceptible to future w aves of computerisation .                                                                  1 The O*NET database can be found here: https://www.onetonline.org/   
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     18 Frey and Osborne's  way of linking tasks to jobs – via occupatio ns – has been subject to considerable  criticism. In particular, Arntz et al. (2016, 2017) argue convincingly that this approach fails to take into  account the extent to which jobs are different from one another, even when these jobs are in the same  occupat ion. That is, the job of a nurse, printer, or university lecturer, for example, can be very different  in different employing institutions, in different departments, in different economic conditions, or at  different stages of a career. As a result, more rec ent studies have used additional data from the  workplace level to take into account variation in the combination of tasks in actual jobs (as opposed to  ideal type occupations). In taking this approach, Arntz et al. (2017) have arrived at much lower  estimat es for job destruction in the USA:  9 percent of jobs at high risk of automation  (see Table 1  above) .  Taking a similar approach but applying their modelling technique to data from a range of OECD  countries , Nedelkoska and Quintini (2018) estimate 14 percent of jobs to be at high risk of automati on  (see also Autor 2015, and Table 1  above ). Thus, different ways of linking task -level analysis to  occupation - and job -level data  give quite different results for estimated impacts of digital automati on  on ov erall employment levels.      Despite significant differences in the headline figures o f these various studies , the overall findings of  these studies are perhaps less different than they first appear . As shown in Chart 1 , differences in the  estimates for automatability given by Frey and Osborne (2017) and Nedelkoska and Quintini (2018) are  concentrated in the higher range of expectations. For jobs considered at high risk of automation (over  70 percent ), Frey and Osborne give the estimate of 47  percent  wher eas Nedelkoska and Quintini (2018)  estimate 14  percent . For jobs considered at medium risk (30 -70 percent ), however, the position is  reversed: Frey and Osborne estimate only 20  percent  of jobs to be at medium risk, while Nedelkoska  and Quintini give the figure of 60 percent (including percent  in the 50 -70 percent  risk range).  In other  words, Frey and Osborne (2017) estimate 67 percent  of occupations to be at medium or high risk of  automation, whereas Nedelkoska and Quintini (2018) put the figure at 74  perce nt. This suggests that  only a relatively modest shift between medium and high -risk categories could make a significant  difference to estimated outcomes in terms of job losses. Moreover, as Frontier Economics (2018) note,  these differing estimates for the risk of automation are based on the same 'expert ' technical  assessments of automatability, which indicates that estimates are  highly sensitive to bo th modelling  methods and  choices between different datasets of job -characteristics  (for instance, differences   between US and European data on job composition) .

Digital automation and the future of work     19   Other studies, meanwhile, are based on predictions of even  faster rate s of technological change , wh ich   ipso facto lead to  higher estimates for the impact of digital automation. Research for the McKinsey  Global Institute ( Manyika et al. , 2017) adopts considerably more ambitious assumptions about the  likely dev elopment of AI and related digital technology and, not surprisingly, estimates the  employment impacts of digital automation to be significantly higher. Using a range of alternative  estimates for the speed of technological change,  Manyika et al. (ibid.) est imate that, over the period up  to 2030, a middling pace would displace 15 percent  of the global workforce, while 30  percent  would  be displaced by the highest predicted pace. It is left unclear, though, on what basis Manyika et al . (ibid)  arrive at higher e stimates of technical change than other researchers. Research for  PWC (2018) also  arrives at  figures in the higher range, estimating some  22–44 percent of jobs across thirty -two  OECD  countries to be  at high risk of automation by the mid -2030s , despite adop ting the task -job approach  associated with the lower estimates of Arntz et al. (2017) and Nedelkoska an d Quintini (2018). The  reason for the se higher estimate s appear  to derive from a faster assumed rate of technologic al  development. The PWC authors distinguish three  waves of digital automation: first, an  'a lgo rit h m wave  … focused on automation of simple computational tasks and analysis of structured data' , which is  'already well underway '; second, an 'augmentation wave … focused on automation of repe atable tasks  … and statistical analysis of unstructured data' , which is ' likely to come to full maturity in the 2020s ';  and , third, an 'autonomy wave  … focused on automation of physical labour and manual dexterity, and  problem solving in dynamic real -world  situations that require responsive actions ', which ' may onl y  come to full maturity on an economy -wide scale in the 2030s ' (ibid.: 1). In other words, this research  incorporates estimates for two (out of three) phases of technological development which hav e not yet  taken place. These estimates for digital development are then incorporated into an algorithm and  applied to task and job datasets (for details on me thodology, see PWC, 2017). Once more , then, very  significant variations in the findings of differe nt studies for the number of jobs at risk of automati on  appear to be based on little more than differing assumptions and 'modelling choices ' (Fronti er  Economics , 2018: 43).     Estimates of job losses also imply shifts in employment – in particular, they sug gest certain types of  jobs that are at high risk of destruction. The following section discuss es which jobs  have been identified  as most vulnerable to automation .    5.1.2 Which jobs are at risk?     The occupations that Frey and Osborne see as most susceptible to computerisation are at the lower  end of the labour market in terms of skills and earnings. In this regard, their analysis departs from the  familiar model of 'hollowing -out' of employment thro ugh the destruction of jobs in the middle of the  labour market. Occupations seen as most at risk include ' a substantial share of employment in servic es,  sales and construction ' (Frey and Osborne , 2017: 265), through the continued elimination of routi ne  man ual and non- manual tasks. Risk is associated with those occupations within sales which exhibit the  least need for social intelligence, for example, cashiers, counter and rental clerks and telemarketers  (ibid. ). They attribute susceptibility in construction  occupations, as likely to be driven by trends towards  prefabrication in factories, which enables tasks to be more readily routinised.     Occupational characteristics are assessed in relation to nine ' bottleneck ' factors; that is, variables whi c h  are thought  to present barriers to automation. Frey and Osborne ( 2017:  261) identify three significant  'inhibiting engineering bottlenecks ' that have so far limited the spread of computerisation into  important sectors of employment: ' perception and manipulation tasks ', 'creative intelligence tasks ',  and 'social intelligence tasks '. Their prediction that 47  percent  of US jobs are at ' high risk ' of automation  depends on technical solutions being found that enable automation to penetrate these areas of  employment, within their ' decade or two ' timescale. As they put it, ' our predictions are based on  expanding the premises about the tasks that compu ter-controlled equipment can be expected to  perform ' (ibid.: 268); 'premises ' provided by the expectations of experts in the field of computing. For 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   20  Frey and Osborne, this putative shift towards the computerisation of low skill and low pay jobs  represents a positive outcome of digital automation, since it will offer a way for workers to find work i n  more meaningful employment. While much of the literature assumes that the destruction of jobs will have negative impacts  (see discussion below) , Frey and Osborn e are unusual in seeing a positive  outcome (ibid.: 267).   M odelling of the risk of automation in OECD countries by Nedelkoska and Qunitini (2018) suggests that  the tasks most exposed to automation are likely to be concentrated in primary and secondary sect or  occupations which are intensive in those tasks; predominantly in manufacturing and agriculture. These will tend to be jobs with few skill requirements such as food preparation assistants, labourers, refuse  workers, cleaners and helpers. In jobs that req uire some training, risk is higher where interacting with  machines is a large component of the job; these jobs encompass  machine operators, drivers and  mobile plant operators in manufacturing.  A cross -sectoral modelling of US occupational data by  Vermeulen  et al. (2018)  concluded that activities with the highest job losses as a result of automati on  are in 'old' occupations – jobs in production, such as machine assembly, operators and setters – whic h  have routine tasks that are easily standardized. The  study  by McKinsey Global Institute, similarly found  that, in manufacturing, automation is replacing manual and physical skills at twice the rate as in other  sectors, affecting jobs such as machine feeders and operators ( Bughin et al ., 2018).   J ob displacement,  according to these studies, tends to align with the automation of low -skill, routinised  manual labour. McKinsey Global Institute undertook modelling to project net job changes due to  automation and projected an 11  percent  decline in total work hours dedicated to physical and manual  skills between 2016 and 2030 (Bughin et al ., 2018) . They found that s kills such as general equipment  operation and navigation and inspecting and monitoring are likely to be replaced by machines fastest. Though it is worth noting that physical and manual tasks are not, in themselves, an indicator of  susceptibility to automation – even with this predicted 11  percent  decline, these tasks are still likely to  be the largest category across all jobs, a ccounting for 26  percent of all hours worked. This reflects a  continued need for human labour for tasks that require dexterity or must be carried out in cramped or irregular spaces. Here it is possible to  see limits to automation linked to the specificity and adaptabil i ty  of human labour  (see also discussion on changes in the nature of work , below).  W hile most automation will be concentrated in manufacturing and agriculture, studies indicate there  will be a continued decline in routine cognitive tasks, suc h as those requiring basic data and processing  skills (Bughin et al. , 2018;  Colombo et al. , 2019); jobs such as computer and telephone operators, typists,  and data entr y worker . Vermeulen et al . (2018) predict some limited  job growth in middle -skill routine  jobs such as receptionists, information clerks, stock clerks and order fillers . They speculate this growth   may be due to higher demand in these areas combined with a preference for human labour over  machines and poor per formance by technology in these roles . But, overall,  they find that  office and  administration jobs comprise a large proportion of those  with a high susceptibility to automation .    A  number of studies have surveyed business leaders to determine their short -term plans for  technological investment and how they expect technology will change jobs and skill demand. A survey  of UK business leaders by Royal Society of A rts (RSA) (Dellot and Wallace -Stephens, 2017) found that  executives in the logistics (transport and distribution) and retail sectors have the highest expectation of automation – both employers of low -skill, manual  work. Finance and accounting sector leaders i n  this study also expected job losses , suggesting that some high -skill, non -manual work may also be   vulnerable  to automation . This accords with a McKinsey Global Institute  stud y where one quarter of  employers in finance and accounting (25  percent ) also expect that there will be a high level of  automation in their sector over the next ten  years (Bu ghin et al ., 2018).    O verall, while there is evidence that digital automation will have wide -ranging effects  on the level of  employment, there is  a common view that digital technologies will have the greatest impact on the 
Digital automation and the future of work     21 most routine and low skill work.  Predictions of net job losses, in this case, derive from the view that  technology will be labour -saving at the lower end of the labour.       5.1.3 Timescale     As detailed in Table 1 , estimates for the impact of digital automation tend to be somewhat vague about  how long the process will take, and some give no timescale at all. For policy -makers and other  stakeholders, this is clearly problematic. To some extent, uncertainty over timescale is inherent in the  question under consideration: it is inescapably difficult to predict how fast digital technologies will  develop. As noted above, Frey and Osborne’s (2017) estimate for the impact of digital automation  depends upon the expectation t hat technology will soon overcome 'engineering bottlenecks '  associated with automating non -routine tasks involving ' perception and manipulation ', 'creative  intelligence ', and ' social intelligence ', none of which are trivial technical challenges. Their esti m a te also   implies that other barriers to automation – e.g. social and legal – can be overcome. Of course, if  technical advances fail to keep up with expectations, then the estimated impact on employment will  similarly be reduced.      Frey and O sborne (ibid.:  265) suggest  that their estimate of future job losses could be realised in   'perhaps a de cade or two '. For economic historians , this time -frame is quite  limited ; for policy -makers,  however, the difference between ten and twenty years is  considerable. What is more, this timescale  assumes that digital automation will be overwhelming and replace jobs at a rapid rate . Frey an d  Osborne’s analysis dates from 2013 – so, we are already almost  halfway through their expected  timescale, with little sign to date of the  expected wave of automation.      In practice, as Frey and Osborne (ibid.: 268) recognise , 'the actual extent and pace of computerisation  will depend on severa l additional factors ' omitted from their analysis. These include the availability (or  otherwise) of  cheap labour, the price of capital, the price of labour more generally ( 'long -run wage  levels '), as well as the regulatory environment. Thus, estimates of the likely impact of digital automation  on employment must include an understanding of the key influ ence of economic, social, and political  conditions, and must see the state and other regulatory bodies  as active  participants in the process of  automation, not passive bystanders to inexora ble technological development.     Research that examines  the impact on employment of previous waves of technological change  comes  to fairly clear conclusions about timescale  (see discussion above) . Moreover, historical understandings  of technological change also have important conclusions about how change comes  about . Histori ans  of technology commonly cite five previous waves: the introduction of steam power in the 1780s –1790s;  iron in the 1840s –1850s; steel and electricity in the 1890s –1900s; electromechanical and chemical  technologies in the 1950s –1960s; and i nformation and communication technologies in the present era  (Atkinson, 2018). Typically, these waves have evolved over a period of around thirty -years, starting in  particular sectors of the economy before later expanding into others, leading to overall in cr ea ses  in   productivity of around 75 percent. Clearly, as a headline figure, this represents a very significant impact.  Spread over the thirty -year period, however, it translates into a 3 percent increase in productivity eac h  year (Atkinson , 2018), which w ould comprise a  significant  change,  but not the huge dislocati on  foreseen by some recent accounts.     This raises a further question about timescale that appears often in the recent literature: w ill it be  different this time? For writers such as Ford (2013,  2015, 2018), AI and robotic technologies represent  a break with the past so radical that ' the historical record may not be predictive ' any  lo nger  (Fo rd 2013:  38). By contrast, for Atkinson (2018: 81), ' there is no reason to believe that this coming techno lo gy wave  will be any different in pace and magnitude than past waves '. In one sense, of course, things are   different this time: the technological innovations of digital automation certainly are novel. But that has  also been the case with each previous wav e of new technology. On each occasion, some jobs have  been eliminated, others transformed radically, and yet others created anew. Digital automation, as 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   22  discussed further below, will affect particular tasks and jobs in specific ways, and these impacts will be  different from those of previous waves. Considered in this qualitative way, then, digital automation will  clearly be different. In quantitative terms, though, in relation to extent and – especially – in terms of  timescale, there remains no clear consen sus in the literature to date.   5.1.4 Non -technological factors  S everal authors note that the scale of impact of digital technologies on employment  will be influenced  significantly by non -technological factors. As noted previously, Frey and Osborne (2017) identify  the  importance of the price of labour and of capital, and the regulatory environment, for  the likely pace of  computerisation. Research by Frontier Economics (2018: 32) argues that the pace of digital uptake by businesses will be influenced by ' econom ic considerations, regulatory concerns, individual preferences  and social norms, and by the need to reorganise production processes to take advantage of AI '.  Manyika et al. (2017: 2) extend the list to include:   't he cost of developing and deploying autom ation solutions for specific uses in the workplace,  the labor market dynamics (including quality and quantity of labor and associated wages), the benefits of automation beyond labor substitution, and regulatory and social acceptance. '   T o date, however, there is very little evidence about the extent or effects of these factors on the actual  pace of digital automation. Some studies attempt to make allowances for non -technological factors by  including estimates for speed of take- up of the technologies of dig ital automation. For instance, both  PWC (2018) and Manyika et al. (2017) give estimates for early, middle and late adopters, as show n i n  Chart 2 . Unfortunately, there is little discussion of the basis for these differential take -up rates, and i n  both studi es, discussion is based on end -point figures, both for penetration of the technology and  timescale.

Digital automation and the future of work     23 estimates tend to be driven s trongly by technological feasibility. In practice, then, despite warnings of  the importance of non- technological factors, models tend to assume that what can be automated wil l  be automated. Clearly, the influence of non -technological factors in the dissemi nation of digital  automation is an important area that urgently needs further research.     The rapid advancement in the capacity of AI relative to human intelligence has spurred investment as  companies believe AI is the next digital frontier for value extraction (Bughin et al., 2018) . However, even  among AI -aware companies, only roughly 20 perce nt are actually using AI in a core business process or  at scale (Chui et al., 2018) . One fifth of business leaders  surveyed by the RSA in the UK ( Dellot and  Wallace -Stephens, 2017) want to invest in AI technologies, but only 14  percent  had invested in, or were  about to invest in any AI technology, with 20  percent  saying they wanted to adopt but it woul d take  several years , and the rest claiming it was too expensive (14  percent ) or not yet properly tested (15   percent ).     The social, lega l and political hurdles to the diffusion of AI technology are not insignificant. For  example, while the AI which enables self -driving cars has advanced so quickly in recent years that the  cars have become symbolic of the advances in AI generally, the great est barriers to their widespread  implementation are considered not to be technical, but legal. Legislators and legal experts are  grappling with how to deal with liability for collisions, injuries and fatalities and there is no clear end to  the debates on t he issues in sight.     There are equally strong social barriers to the use of AI relating to individual preferences and social  norms. In services, there remain customer preferences for human service and a lack of user  engagement with automated systems (Montalban et al., 2019) . With analytic and algorithmic systems ,  there are ethical concerns, particularly around algorithmic bias (Davidson et al., 2019; Noble, 2018) . The  introduction of AI into some areas of prediction and to support decision -making in areas such as  policing and the judiciary, human resources , and public services, has prompted considerable  discussion about the relationship between humans and machines from a social and ethical perspective  (Eubanks, 2018; Noble, 2018; O’Neil, 2016) .     The public perception of AI and digital automation is mixed. An Oxford study on the attitudes of  Americans toward AI found that a substantial minority (41  percent ) somewhat support or strongl y  support the development of AI, while a smaller minority (22  percent)  somewhat or strongly oppose i t  (Zhang and Dafoe, 2019 ). A large majority (82  percent ) believe that robots and/or AI should be carefully  regulated and managed; a figure comparable to survey results from EU respondents ( ibid. ). These  results, together with  the legal and social barriers highlighted above, suggest that digital automation  will be likely uneven, delayed, and in places, non -existent.      5.1.5 EU employment: recent trends     Finally, there are recent trends in EU employment data . Given that studies such as Frey and Osborne  (2017) predict significant employment impacts of digital automation starting from a baseline in 2010  data, it might be expected that employment statistics would by now capture some effects. As shown  in Charts 3 , 4 and 5, however, EU employment data show little, if any, effect. Taking an overview of EU  employment by broad occupational groups and by gender, over the last ten years for which data are  available (2008- 2018), by far the biggest impact over this period  was from the recession following the  global financial crash of 2007 -2008.

For some occupational groups, deep recession led to a step -change in trends, marking significant  reductions or increases in employment. For instance, the number of managers declined sharply in  2010- 11, with smaller declines in the numbers of technicians and associate professions, and clerical  support workers. Over the same period, by contrast, there were marked increases in the numbers of  service and sales workers and, especially, of professionals. During the post -recession r ecovery period,  the number of professionals continued to increase relatively rapidly, outstripping the average seen  across the rest of employment. At the same time, numbers employed as technicians and associate  professionals recovered to earlier levels. As  shown in Chart 6 , total employment in the EU 28 now stands  well above the immediate post -recession level, indicating no significant impact of 'technological  unemployment ' to date.     Trends for recession -driven reductions in the number of managers and increases in service and sales  workers, as well as technical and associate professionals, are replicated when the figures are  disaggregated according to gender : hence, the same overall shifts in employment are reflected in the  data for women and men – alth ough, gender differences in overall patterns of employment between  men and women remain marked. Thus, for instance, the long -term declines in manual work are  especially clear in the reduction over the last decade in male employment in craft and related tra des,  and in plant and machine operators and assemblers. Nevertheless, the rate of decline of employment  in these sectors of the labour market has slowed noticeably in the post -recession recovery, and the  data even show modest increases as economic growth h as revived.

There has been some debate about the extent to which the long -term decline in manufacturing  employment in the global North has been overlaid in recent years by factors rooted in the era of  neoliberal globalisation, with disagreements among US commentators over the relative impacts of  new technology and work organisation, versus a shift of jobs to emerging economies, on US  employment (for a critical overview of these debates, see Moody, 2017). These disputes 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     28 notwithstanding, the European figures suggest that while it might be expected that the impact of  digital automation would become increasingly visible as the decade progressed – especially in manual  work – in fact, the trend has, if anything, been the rever se, as employment in parts of manufacturing  have  actually increased.     Overall, then, outside of significant shifts that seem clearly linked to the last recession, there has been  little change in overall employment levels in the EU28 countries over the last  decade. As shown in C hart  6, though, changes in the balance of occupational groups within the total appear to indicate the  replacement of jobs lost during the recession (such as managers) with jobs created in other sectors –  especially of professionals an d, to a lesser extent, technicians and associate professionals.     Table 2  shows how relatively routine work remains common in the EU, with over half of jobs in the EU15  accounted for by clerical, sales, craft, operative and elementary roles (e.g. cleaners and labourers).  Again , while there has been recovery in employment since the 2007 -08 crisis, with some growth in  professional and techni cal roles, there has remained a prep onderance of routine work, undermining  any idea of a sudden shift to automation in t his area.     It is evident that, in general, while employment levels  have been influenced by change s in technol ogy,  job destruction on a grand sca le is some  way off. While it is t oo early to tell what will be the effect of  digital technologies, it is clear t hat these technologies will have to ev olve to a significant degree  before  we can declare the demise of  paid wor k.       5.2 Wage effects of digital automation      In addition to the effects on job destruction , digital automation is also likely to impact on extrinsic  aspects of jobs; in particular, on levels of pay and remuneration. A presumed link between (rising)  automation and (falling) pay is a recurring theme in  the literature, reappearing with each wave o f  techno -pessimism about the prospects for employment in general, on the straightforward assumption  that falling demand for labour w ill produce falling wages alongside rising technological  unemployment  (see earlier discussion) ; a fear first voiced by Keynes in the 1930s and regularly repeated  since then ( DeCanio, 2016). During the 1980s and 1990s, the first wave of computerisation in white  collar work and the large -scale introduction of robots into manufacturing saw these fears repeated (see  discussion in M okyr et al. , 2015). More recently, digital technolog ies have also been linked to the  'hollowing -out' of labour markets in wealthy economies over recent decades, a process which has seen  the decline of middle- skilled, middle -paid employment, and the polaris ation of jobs at the top and  bottom of the labour market (see Goos and Manning, 2007 ) – notwithstanding disagreements over the  extent to which off -shoring and declining union power ha ve also played a part in this process (Moody,  2017). It should not come a s any surprise, then, that the recent literature on digital automati on  recapitulates many of these arguments.      In particular, there is a widespread expectation that digital automation will lead to ' labour  immiseration ' (Autor and Salomon s, 2018: 9), invo lving both technological unemployment and falling  wages (see discussion and references in DeCanio , 2016). Many authors expect digital automati on to  contribute to a continued hollowing -out of labour markets, with further decline of middle -skilled,  middle -pay jobs as technology automates the established but routine jobs that have often attracted  dependable wages and stable employment, leading to further polarisation – with employment moving  to either highly skilled and high- paid technical jobs, or low skilled , low- paid ones. Indeed, as discussed  above, for authors such as Autor (2015), many low -skilled jobs cannot be automated, since they require  human cognitive skills and task -flexibility. For Autor (2015), however, this does not imply that low- s k ill  jobs tha t are resistant to automation will become better paid, since labour oversupply from sectors hi t  hardest by automation, together with the lack of technological pay -premiums associated with work at  the lower end of the labour market, will combine to keep pay  low (Autor , 2015). By contrast, Frey and 
Digital automation and the future of work     29 Osborne (2017) predict the reversal of the trend towards the hollowing -out of the labour market, as  employment shifts out of low -skill jobs as the latter succumb most rapidly to digital automation.     Taking a diffe rent approach, based on recent shifts in US productivity and employment data, A cemoglu   and Restrepo (2017: 217- 218) nevertheless agree that the introduction of robots in the US will produce  both job -losses and falling wages, at the following rate: ' one mor e robot reduces aggregate  employment by about 5.6 workers … and one more robot per thousand workers reduces wages in the  aggregate by about 0.5 percent '. Despite adopting different approaches, then, these and other studies  represent a broad continuity with  previous tendencies to draw a simple analytical linkage between  falling demand for labour (in one or more parts of the labour market) due to automation, and a  consequent reduction in rates of pay for those remaining in work in other parts of the economy.      As is the case in other areas of the recent literature, however, other authors present a far more  optimistic picture, in which technologically driven increases in productivity lead not to unemployment  but to higher wages ( Autor 2014). These accounts sta rt from the observation of Kaldor (1961) that,  despite a century of technological advances and radically increased productivity in the US economy,  the labour share of GDP had remained remarkably constant. The central argument of this approac h i s  that new t echnology leads to increased productivity, which in turn leads to increases in GDP, includi ng  increased demand for the now cheaper goods and services produced in sectors which adopt new  technology, leading to overall economic expansion and the creation of new jobs. As new sources of  employment absorb workers shed from automating sectors, demand for labour is maintained, and  pressure to reduce wages alleviated: in consequence, the labour share of GDP is maintained (for a  critical overview of this approach, s ee Autor and Salomons, 2018; Berg et al. , 2018) Thus, while new  technology leads to labour -shedding in some sectors of employment, it also triggers important  offsetting effects that maintain a degree of stability in employment and wages over the long term.  The  problem with this approach, of course, is that, although the empirical trend identified by Kaldor was  maintained into the 1980s and 1990s (despite some weakening), since the 2000s, the labour share of  GDP has declined significantly in many countries. The key question, therefore, is why are the offsetting  mechanisms no longer working as they did previously?      In order to reconcile the long -term  stability of the ' labour share ' with its recent decline, and to link thi s  shift to the emergence of the techn ologies of digital automation, a number of studies have attempted  to build more complex econometric models that take account of both the labour -shedding and GDP increasing effects of increased productivity, as well as the time- lag between the two processes  and any  distributive effects on wages. Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018b) reached relatively optimistic  conclusions about the impact of automation on employment and wages, based on a model that sees  automation affecting employment at the level of tasks. In thi s model, automation , 'squeezes out tasks  previously performed by low -skill labour ' (ibid.: 1526) and puts a premium on high -skill technical labour  performing complex tasks, thereby increasing wage and employment inequality over the short term.  Over the longer term, however, complex tasks become standardised and move to low -skill labour,  thus  restoring employment and wages at the lower end of the labour market and cancelling out any  tendency for increased wage inequality. Consequently, for Acemoglu and Restrepo, the introduction  of digital automation technologies 'generates a self -correct ing force towards stability ' (ibid.: 1526).  What is more, this balanced growth path emerges under a range of ' reasonable assumptions ' about  economic conditions (ibid.: 1526). In other words, for Acemoglu and Restrepo, a virtuous circle of  automation, risin g GDP, increased demand for labour, and higher wages would not be difficult to  achieve.     Taking a different approach, Autor and Salomon s (2018) base their model on industry -level  productivity data from the last four decades. According to this model, automation displaces labour in  the industries where it is adopted, but the gains in productivity increase demand for labour in  'downstream ' industries, which make use of the automated products and services. As a result, workers  displaced from one industry are subsequently reabsorbed elsewhere; indeed, GDP gains from 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   30  automation increase overall demand for labour in this model. However, Autor and Salomons find that  wages in the newly -created jobs are less than those in the jobs displaced by automation. As a result,  'automation ... has been employment -augmenting yet labour -share displacing over the last four  decades ' (ibid.: 11, original emphasis); that is, employment has increased with automation but the  labour share of GDP has declined over the same period, leading to greater inequality. Compared with the model of Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018b) discussed above, then, Autor and Salomon s (2018) reach  less optimistic conclusions about the prospect for wages, even though employment levels are maintained.   T o complete the picture, a third approach reaches far more pessimistic conclusions. In research first  published as an IMF working paper, Berg et al. ( 2018) adopt a modelling approach broadly similar to  that of Acemoglu and Restrepo (2018b), but are critical of what they see as a problematically over simplified model in the latters' research. Most significantly, whereas Acemoglu and Restrepo  (2018b)  assu me that automation technologies will be applied across the economy, Berg et al. (2018) introduce  a distinction between sectors that introduce automating technology and those that continue with traditional labour -intensive technologies. Berg et al. (ibid: 120) are thus able to look at the effects on  employment and wages for a range of scenarios for the introduction of digital automation:   •M odel 1: 'robots compete against labour in all tasks ' •Model 2: robots ' compete only for some tasks ' •Model 3: robots ' substitute only for unskilled labour while complementing skilled labour '  •Model 4: robots ' contribute to production only in one sector '. T his approach enables Berg et al. to assess a range of potential outcomes, thereby taking into account  divergent pred ictions about how far and how fast digital automation will impact on employment, and  about which sectors and workers will be affected most significantly.   D espite the wide range of scenarios investigated, however, Berg et al. (2018: 120) find remarkably  consistent results: ' automation is very good for growth and very bad for equality in all variants '. In the  long run, Berg et al. (ibid.) estimate that automation will boost GDP by between 30 –240 percent . When  it comes to the impact on jobs and wages, howeve r, the most optimistic scenario puts the time -lag  between labour displacement (falling wages) and rising real wages at twelve  years. In other cases, ' the  low- wage phase lasts 20 –50+ years ' (ibid.); that is, longer than a working lifetime. In Model 3, where   robots substitute only for unskilled labour, Berg et al (ibid.) describe the impact on inequality as 'horrific' : 'In our base case calibration, the skilled wage increases 56 –117% in the long run, while the  wage paid to low skill labour drops 26 –56% and th e group's share in national income decreases from  31% to 8–18% '. What is more, Berg et al. identify a persistent trade- off such that the biggest increases  in GDP and real wages come in the scenarios where inequality increases the most; that is, rising GDP,   rising real wages, but declining labour share. In short, the conclusions of Berg et al. could scarcely be more different – or more pessimistic – than those of Acemoglu and Restrepo; with Autor and Sal omons  occupying something of a middle ground.   So , wha t are we to make of this huge divergence in estimates of the likely effect of automation on  wages? Perhaps the most important point to appreciate is that none of the studies discussed above are  actually studies of automation, digital or otherwise. Both Ace molgu and Restrepo (2018b) and Berg et  al. (2018) start by making assumptions about which sectors of the economy will be affected by digital automation, which workers will be squeezed, and how fast these processes will develop. Moreover,  these assumptions are based on estimates for the rate of automation provided by AI ' experts ' and  technologists. The problems with this approach are obvious: if these assumptions are mistaken, then the predictions generated will also be wrong, no matter how sophisticated the modelling  (see also  discussion above) . To their credit, the authors are fully aware of these problems. For instance,  Acemoglu and Restrepo ( 2018b : 1527) note a number of assumptions that could be wrong, includi ng  the following: their model assumes ' that it is always the tasks at the bottom that are automated; [but] 
Digital automation and the future of work     31 in reality, it may be those in the middle '; 'there may be technological barriers to the automation of  certain tasks and the creation of new tasks ' which are not taken into account; and, ' our analysis of the  creation of new tasks and standardisation [ignores] the need for workers to acquire new skills to work  in such tasks '. Not surprisingly, Acemoglu and Restrepo (ibid.) conclude with a call for further research:     'Finally, and perhaps mos t important, our model highlights the need for additional empirical  evidence on how automation impacts employment and wages ... and how the   incentives for  automation and the creation of new tasks respond to policies, factor prices, and supplies '.     Simil arly, Berg et al. (2018: 140) acknowledge the limits within which their model is constructed. Once  more, their model assumes a rapid and significant impact of digital automation:                  'Of course, it is not impossible to overturn our main results.  If robots do only a very smal l  fraction of tasks, contribute to output in only a very small fraction of the economy, or are poor  substitutes for human workers, then they will not increase inequality. But this is another w ay of  restating the premise of the paper: if there is no technological revolution underway of the sort  we have been discussing, then there will only be small effects. '     As was the case with our previous discussion of estimates for the impact of digital automati on,  predictions for its like ly effect on wages are built not around empirical research into the actual digital  automation process, but on narrowly technical accounts of what the technology is capable of – or,  more often, of what it might be capable of in ten or twenty years' time. An d, as Berg et al. (ibid.: 120)  state, 'The basic problem is that nobody knows what the world will look like in say 2035 '.     Rather than rely entirely on ' expert ' opinions about automation, Autor and Salomons (2018) attempt  to give a more secure empirical b asis to their estimates, by incorporating data on industry level  productivity for the last forty years. However, as Haltiwanger (2018) points out, it is questionable  whether industry -level increases in productivity actually represent the introduction of new t ech no logy.  There is a large literature addressing the complex set of drivers known to influence productivity, which  cannot be reduced to the introduction of new technology. For many authors, a key driver of  productivity growth during recent decades has been a simple intensification of work, in a context of  weakened trade unions and emboldened management ( Baccaro and Howell , 2017; Moody , 2017). The  weakening of trade unions has also been a key contributor behind the declining labour share in rec ent  decade s (Vidal , 2013); something that Autor and Salomons recognise their model cannot fully explai n  (2018: 53). Moreover, as Haltiwanger (2018) reminds us, for the period under consideration, many  industries have experienced stagnant or declining productivity. U ntil research has developed a more  detailed understanding of the dynamics, timescales, and effects of the introduction of digital  automation at firm level, the interpretation of industry -level data will remain highly problematic. In the  absence of such res earch, studies such as Autor and Salomons (2018) can only ' document conditional  correlations ' (Rogerson 2018: 72) rather than presenting causal explanations.     In summary, then, research into the likely effects of digital automation on wages present many o f the  same problems encountered previously in studies attempting to estimate its impact on employment  levels. In particular, studies to date rely very heavily on estimates for the scale, extent, and speed of  digital automation that are provided by technolo gy experts. These estimates tend strongly to assume  that what can be automated will be automated and, in many cases, that what currently cannot be  automated will be automated at some point in the not- too- distant future. As discussed previously,  these assum ptions are highly problematic bases on which to formulate policy. Once more, policy makers and other stakeholders would benefit greatly from considerable further research on actual  processes of digital automation, in order to gain greater insights into the  complexities of the processes  involved.    
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   32  5.3 Changes to  the nature of work and job quality   T he previous two sections have discussed the effects of digital automation on the volume of jobs and  wages , respectively . This section  focus es on the effects of digital automation on the nature of work  and  job quality . It focus es on several dimensions, from the effects on work organisation and the  composition of jobs, through to challenges to the  employment relationship  from  new forms of work  such as platform work. It discusses  how transformations in work and new configurations of human and  machine work have the potential to affect the skill composition and quality of jobs,  together with   working time. As it will be shown  below, it seems likely th at digital automation will have a more  complex and gradual effect on occupations than simply wholesale job destruction, with the potenti al  to both help improve and  impair  the nature of work  and job quality .   5.3.1 Changes in o ccupations   W hile there is agreemen t within the academic literature that some jobs – notably those with routi ne  tasks – will be at high risk of automation in the future  (see above discussion) , there is also a consensus  that many jobs – existing and new ones – will outlast the onset of any future technological revolution.  In this case, for very many workers, the principle effect of  digital automation will be felt through  changes in how work is performed. Work will not disappear, but rather will be done differently and  within a transformed work environment. In this case, the concern will be more about how workers will  interact with technology in their work lives than about whether they will be made redundant by  technology.    To  help illustrate this  fact, Case Study 1  below provides a summary o f changes happening in radiol ogy  as AI is increasingly used in diagnostics. Here we are able to  see how digital technologies, while job  preserving, are capable of shaping and reshaping the nature of work. In this particular  case , the r esults   for medical wo rkers can be seen as broadly positive, with the use of digital technologies extending the  scope for task variety in work.   CASE STUDY 1:  RADIOLOGY AND MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS   Radiology , as a high -skilled occupation in medicine,  is undergoing a transformation assisted by  advancements in computer vision AI2 which can improve the accuracy of diagnoses through advanc ed  image analysis . Radiology provides a good example of the way in which skill complementarity between  humans and machine s result s in improved outcomes, in this case, in diagnostics. AI is able to det ect   detail in images which is  not perceptible  to the human eye and can use pattern recognition to interpret  complex relationships  in new ways  (Hosny et al.,  2018) . The use of AI allows for  faster, more accurate   diagnoses than trained medical specialists . Human involvement is retained, however. For example,  medical expertise is required to  engage with the complexities of human biology  beyond specific  diagnoses . Because it can analyse images very quickly, radiologists expect that AI  can be used to   prioritise their workflow – with potential life -saving effects – and allow them to redirect their efforts  towards  direct patient care and research  (Royal College of Radi ologists, 2018). In this way, their time at  work could be spent in more rewarding tasks .   Improved workflows and prioritisation of work  due to the greater use of AI  may also address the  increase in demand for cross -sectional imaging (CT and MRI)  in medica l diagnoses. The use of AI may  also help to alleviate  the current shortage of trained radiologists (Frey and Osborne, 2017) .   2 Computer vision AI allows intelligent machines to be able to detect, analyse, and generate images by coding  such images with numerical or symbolic information (Craig et al., 2017; Idrees et al., 2018). 
Digital automation and the future of work     33 Studies show that  medical professionals expect the advancement of AI into areas such  as diagnosis and  prognosis will lead to an emphasis on th e communicative, emotional and decision -making aspects of  their work . General Practitioner s, for example, believe there are important human skills in their work  which machines are unlikely to replace, including  the ability to communicate and empathise, to collect  accurate and relevant data from patients , and to make judgements about treatment s which take into  account patient values and preferences  (Blease  et al., 2019) . In addition, p atient s tend to respond better  to humans than to  machine s (Nadarzynski et al., 2019) .      AI is also being applied to a variety of medical contexts including pharmaceutical research ( Varnek and  Baskin, 2012) , patient monitoring, diagnostics, prognostics (Blease et al., 2019) , surgery ( Zahedi et al.,  2019)  and , as has been shown above,  radiology (Richardson et al., 2020) . As a re sult, m edical students   increasingly want training in AI as part of their degree, though currently a minority actually receive it  (Sit et al., 2020) . This suggests challenges for training provision in the medical sector, as the use of AI i s  extended.       To illustrate further the effects of digital techn ologies on the nature of work, it is useful to draw on the  research of Fossen and Sorgner (2019) . They decompose the impact of   digital technologies into  two   effects : i) job destruction – where digital technologies substitute for human labour; ii) transformation  – where digital technologies are complementary to human labour. They argue that jobs can be s u bject   to both of these effects  to differing levels and their fin dings suggest that most occupations face either   a high or a low risk of the destructive effects  of digital technologies and some level of transformation .  They categorise occupations  into four categories along the above two axes:     • Rising star occupations (37 percent )3 – digitalisation has a highly transformative effect but low  levels of job destruction because these occupations require above- average levels of almost all  tasks that currently constitute automation  bottlenecks, namely social perceptiveness, assisting  and caring for others, persuasion, and originality. Workers in these occupations are likel y to  work with new AI technologies under transformed conditions of work.   • Collapsing occupations  (38 percent ) – these are the occupations discussed in the earlier  section which face a high risk of digital job destruction because tasks within them require  routine and manual skills and  the level of bottleneck tasks is below average, so there is little  barrier to automation.   • Machine terrain occupations  (11 percen t) – these occupations face both a high level of digital  job destruction alongside above -average levels of non -routine tasks where AI has recently  made advances and leaves few tasks for human labour. These occupations are likely to fac e  radical transformat ion.  • Human terrain occupations  (12 percent ) – these occupations have a low exposure to digital  job destruction technologies and above average levels of bottleneck tasks such as caring for  others and working in a cramped space, so tend to be unaffected by d igital technologies  (except through effects on  demand and labour supply) .                                                                   3 Figures based on total employment in the US.

For some ' rising star ' occupations, the changes are profound, but these changes are  linked to the maintenance and growth of mostly high- paid work (e.g. pilots and dentists). For ' human  terrain ' occupations, there is little change in what remains low -paid work (e.g. cleaners and  s t ock   clerks), other than possible wage compression through higher labour supply. Workers in ' collapsing '  occupations (e.g. retail assistants and cashiers) face redundancy, while those in 'machine terrain '  occupations (e.g. drivers and accountants) face continued employment but in workplaces with a  greater use of technology .    What the research of Fossen and Sorgner confirms is the uneven effects of digital automation, with j ob  destruction coexisting with work transformation. This research also highlights t he potential strong  impacts that digital technologies can have on the content of work within jobs – a theme that is  pursue d  in the sections that follow.      5.3.2 Changing skill demand and the effect on job quality     The automation debate – where it addresses th e transformation of work – focu ses on how new  technologies will change the skills composition of particular jobs and occupations ( Autor et al., 2003;  Autor and Dorn, 2013; Bughin et al., 2018; Colombo et al., 2019;  Felten et al., 2019; Nedelkoska and  Quintini, 2018) . Most of the research and policy discussion is concerned with which skills are in demand;  where there are perceived gaps or potential skills shortages ; and the extent to which there are notable  gaps in the skills of particular groups of workers. The changing skill composition of the labour forc e c an High  Transformative Effects   Destructive  Effects    Low  High  
Digital automation and the future of work     35 also have implications for the quality of work and the debates on technology -driven change and ski l l  provi de evidence that different groups of workers are likely to be affected in different ways.     There are essentially two view s on the effects of digital technologies on skills  (and by extension, the  quality of work) . One view is that digital technologies will replace tasks requiring manual, routine skills.  By contrast, these technologies will leave tasks that require analytical thinking and innovati on,  emotional intelligence, as well as what are often termed ' soft' skills – creativity, originality and initiativ e,  critical thinking, persuasion and negotiation . This  view  accords with discussions on AI and work whi c h  suggest that  digital technologies  are still poor at incorporating context, such as making decisions that  incorporate customer or patient preferences, needs or values – which could be considered a core  element of professional practice (Pasquale, 2019) . The above v iew implies that digital technologies will  free up  people to undertake the creative, communicative and analytical tasks which make the most of  their  skills. The result, then, will be a trend towards up -skilling, with workers enjoying more  high -skilled,  high -quality jobs (e.g. Bughin et al., 2018; Manyika et al., 2017) .     For example, some companies in  the German auto industry are making increasing use of collaborative  robots ( 'cobots ') to improve ergonomics , lighten the physical burden of work, and augment the w ork  of an ageing workforce ( McGee , 2019). In general, cobots take over physically demanding assembl y  tasks, shifting the  emphasis of workers towards supervisory and decision -making roles.  Workers w ho  have been surveyed about how AI will change their jobs expect it will lessen administrative or clerical  burdens and repetitive tasks (e.g. Blease et al., 2019; Brougham and Haar, 2017 ). In this case, there is a  perception that digital  technologies have the potential to be  skills -biased – i.e. they  can increase  demand for high -skilled labour – especially where h igh-skilled jobs are more likely to be comprised of  the creative and analytical tasks which protect them from threats of automation.      As a further example, presented as Case Study 2 below, we di scuss the effects of AI and blockchain on  the accounting profession. Here the use of digital technologies has spurred the demand for more high skilled workers . Yet, as with other areas where digital technologies could be used , the scale and extent  of the a doption of new digital technologies (including blockchain) remains uncertain.        CAS E STUDY  2: ACCOUNTING, AI AND BLOCKCHAIN     Accounting is often cited as a profession which stands to be automated, or at least radicall y  transforme d, by AI and blockchain. The use of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) has remov ed  repetitive tasks within  auditing such as internal control testing ( Moffitt et al., 2018) and  AI can use large  datasets to analyse patterns in transactions to predict how tax evasion schemes are likely to devel op  over time and which schemes are more likely to evade detection (Hem berg et al., 2015) . Big data  analytics (BDA) and AI are combining to free workers from  labour -intensive tasks, allowing them more  time to apply the ir skills to critical evaluation ‐type tasks or key audit judgements  (Kend and Nguyen,  2020) . As a result, accounting firms are increasingly looking to hire graduates who have analytical and  coding skills in addition to accounting and auditing knowledge ( Cooper et al., 2019) .    Blockchain , as discussed above , is a form of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) that acts as a database  for storing or linking data  (Beck et al., 2018) . It is a form of synchronised and shared database stored  across multiple nodes, maintained by a consensus algorithm ( Walport, 2016)  with applicati ons  principally in the areas of  accountability, auditing, monitoring. Accounting firms are in the very early  stages of blockchain adoption, often using it in conjunction with AI for tasks such as continuous audi ts ,  manual data extraction  and audit preparat ion tasks  (Schmitz and Leoni, 2019), with the hope that i t c an  improve transparency and access to data for accountants ( Yermack, 2017)  and  reduce human error and  fraud ( Faccia and Mosteanu, 2019 ).    
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     36 Yet, d espite proclamations of its far -reaching effects, p articularly in the business press (see Ta pscott   and Tapscott, 2017), blockchain seems to have made  somewhat limited  inroads into the way that  accounting is practiced. Accounting business leaders in the so -called 'Big-four ' accountancy firms along  with those in smaller accountancy firms were interviewed in an Australian study ( Kend and Nguyen,  2020) . They reported that they  were still unsure or confused about the applications of blockchai n  technologies in accounting, and unc onvinced  that the y are likely to change the work of accountants .  This  suggest s the diffusion of blockchain is not wide spread , even in an industry where it is considered  to have the greatest potential for application and potential disruption , which means th at how it will be  applied to accountancy and audit ing and how it will affect those working in the profession remai ns  highly speculative.       The second view of the effects of digital technologies on skills is less optimistic. It suggests that,  alongside pro viding more high -skilled work, these technologies will also coincide with the grow th of  more low -skilled work, in which the opportunities for progress into high -skilled work is limited. T here  is an emphasis in the automation literature and policy discussio ns on the need for up -skilling and  reskilling, but not all technology -driven job creation is expected to be high -skilled . The growth of low  paid, low -skilled work, particularly of ' in-person services ' jobs , is set to continue (Autor and Dorn, 2013) .  These are jobs that require  low levels of education, but which are  less susceptible to automation , such   as caring and cleaning work, food preparation and services (e.g. in restaurants), hairdressing and  gardening  (Dellot and Wallace -Stevens, 2017) . These jobs fit with the ' human- terrain ' occu pa t ions   highlighted by Fossen and Sorgner.     The view taken here is that, at least some of the jobs of the future, will not offer workers high -qu ality   work, but to th e contrary, will continue to offer them menial tasks that carry low pay as well as low  recognition. In this case, there is not a welcoming of the process of digital automation, but a regret that  this is process is not helping to up -skill workers  and remove low- skilled, low paid wok . The below  discussion will use the example of the rise of platform work – a development facilitated by digital  technologies – to further illustrate the potential growth of low- quality work.     5.3.3 Deskilling and skill depreciation     Where work is reorganised and jobs redesigned as a result of new digital technologies, it has the  potential to result in  deskilling  or skill depreciation . While this effect is rarely discussed in the  automation literature, s ociologists of work have long recognised that technological change can r esult   in the standardisation and simplification of work tasks and the elimination of worker creativity and  initiative in their jobs ( Gallie, 2012) . Deskilling occurs where jobs are redesigned to accommodate  new  technology  and generally requires the fragmentation and standardisation of complex work into simple  tasks that can be undertaken by a combination of machinery and unskilled or less -skilled labour . This   often resul ts in an intensification of work and increased managerial control over labour . The m icrotasks found on crowdsour cing platforms provide an extreme example of how work processes can be  restructured to deskill work  (Bergvall ‐Kåreborn and Howcroft, 2014) . Lehdonvirta  (2016: 58)  describes   how conventional work has been converted into outsourced microwork through codification:  'breaking tasks into small parts and formalising them, making interdependencies so simple as to no  longer require workers to have stro ng ties to each other, to the employer, or to the end -client '. These  online work interfaces have been designed in such a way that labour must behave like computer  software: available at any time and any place and able to scale up rapidly; for the humans un der taking  these tasks, work becomes commodified and robot -like.     The displacement of middle- skill workers into lower skilled jobs could be considered a form of  deskilling at an aggregate level, but deskilling can also occur within  the digitally enabled   transformation of a particular labour process. For example, high -skilled jobs with AI -complementarity  could be reorganised in such a way that humans are inserted into work processes not to design, 
Digital automation and the future of work     37 interpret or develop creative solutions based on the product of AI computations, but simply to act upon  decisions or predictions manufactured by AI, or choose between machine -derived solutions. For  example, case workers in the civil service may be reduced from assessing cases, to communicating the  outcomes of AI -driven assessments to service users , or call centre workers reduced to undertaking the  scripted, deskilled work of communicating automated decisions ( see Bader and Kaiser, 2019) .     In Case Study 3 below, we address the effects of AI on police work. In particular, we show how AI is  speeding up the collection and prepar ation  of some data tasks  undertaken by the police , but at the  cost of the reduction in the skill content of police work. Predictiv e AI technology , in this example,  can  be seen as a specific  threat  to professional knowledge and judgement.       CASE STUDY  3: AI AND PREDICTIVE POLICING     In policing , AI is already being used in license plate recognition, social media threat analysis, predictive  policing software and facial recognition. Laborious repetitive tasks such as recording suspicious  movements, 'searching through observational records for known offenders ' or 'producing factual  reports and preparing evidence for court ' are now in many police departments being done by virtual  machines using AI  (Bowling and Iyer, 2019) . This is shifting the necessary sk ill sets of front -lin e po lice  and security officers toward more ' knowledge work ' requiring data management, computer operation  and analytical skills. Predictive policing – anticipating future criminality based on past and current  behaviour (Ferguson, 2017)  – has been introduced in Germany (Egbert, 2018) , Spain (Camacho Collados and Libera tore, 2015) , the UK (Bowling and Iyer, 2019) , and the Netherlands ( Waardenburg et  al., 2018) .     Legal experts have suggested that the greater use of AI – particularly where it is driven by cost -cutting  – could deskill police  work ( Joh, 2019). While AI performs some policing tasks better than humans, suc h  as rapid scanning and ID -ing of license plates, the use of predictive algorithms to identify hig h  crime  areas or suspicious behaviour amounts to the transfer of key professional policing skills involving  problem solving from workers to AI and, in doing so, removes police discretion. O t her  t ech no lo gical  change, such as the introduction of body -worn vi deo (BWV) over the past two decades , has created a  video -data pipeline for AI -driven policing technologies to be introduced in many countries. The use of  BWV has undermined certain aspects of police work , particularly the craft skills of close observation,   note -taking, investigative analysis, report -writing and preparation of evidence for the courts . In effect ,  BMV has automated significant aspects of policing and surveillance ( Bowling and Iyer, 2019) . The  combination of BMV with predictive AI, in general , can be seen as regressive, to the extent it has  r esult   in lower discretion, variety of work and skill  in policing .      To summaris e, digital technologies  bring with them  the real possibility of upgrading work to remove  the repetitive, mundane and burdensome aspects of jobs so that people can focus on more creative,  analytical and communicative aspects of work. Yet, they also bring the threat of deskilling . As the above  discussion of policing suggests, workers may undergo losses in valuable skills, as digital technologies  take on more of their tasks. What matters here is how workers can shape technology in ways that  protect their skill s. Other dimensions of work where digital technologies can be expected to have an  impact  are discussed below , beginning with work time .     5.3.4 Working time      Technological change was  accompanied by a gradual reduction in average working time over the  greater part of the twentieth century ; however , this trajectory has stalled over the period since the  1970s  (De Spiegelaere and Piasna, 2017 ). While both labour and multifactor productivity have  increased since the late 1970s in OECD countries, average working hours have only f allen s ligh t ly  
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   38  (OECD, 2020) . Further, these headline figures of  declining average hours  of work  mask a situation where  an increas ing number of mostly high -skilled workers in Europe are working very long hours ; 50 hours  per week or more ( Burger, 2018) . They also miss the  growing  problem of  underemployment  among  younger  workers, particularly in the service sector , as a result of the growth in 'non- standard  employment ' (Benanav , 2019) .   T he recent mass adoption of mobile devices has, for many workers, enabled a ' constant connectivity '  with  work , including outside of standard hours of work  (Wajcman  and Rose, 2011) . Mobile technologies  have been shown in some cases  to improve worker well- being by increasing  work/life balance,  flexibility and effective communication ( ter Hoeven  and van Zoonen, 2015) . Yet, such technologies also  create the possibility for a lengthening of work time, via the creation of  an 'always on ' work culture  (Gold  and Mustafa, 2013) . They also present the possibility for the extension of  surveillance and mobile  remote manag ement  – this has become a particular problem for  low- skilled service workers  (Lehdonvirta , 2018; Moore  and Hayes, 2017; Moore  and Newsome, 2018; Wood  et al., 2018) . Among  professionals, t he increase in connectivity and the use of mobile devices has led to an  'autonomy  paradox ', with the blurring of the divide between work and non- work life and the increase of work related stress ( Mazmanian  et al., 2013) . Different groups of workers have very differing capacities to  negotiate this connectivity, with male professionals overall benefiting more than other groups  (Wajcman , 2015) .   T he use of mobile devices has also impacted on the scheduling of work. For some workers, work has  become more regimented, with time allocated for work more strictly defined  – time for travel and  breaks, for example, can be excluded in the calculation of work time and hence wages, leading to  greater work intensity and lower overall pay  (Bell and Tuckman, 2002; Rubery  et al., 2015) . The use of  these devices  has made work more unpredictable for many service workers ( Schneider  and Harknett,  2019)  and for others, especially those in piecework or gig -work platforms, imposed a time -discipline,  with customers and clients dictating work -time despite workers operating as independent contractors  (Gold and Mustafa, 2013; Lehdonvirta, 2018) . Freelancer s and service workers have increasingly faced  working irregular hours in response to employer or client demands, often creating work/life conflicts   and  making it difficult to switch off from work ( Barber and Jenkins, 2014; Butts  et al., 2015; Gold and  Mustafa, 2013)   O verall, while offering some benefits in terms of flexibility over managing work, digital technologies  pose a challenge to the time that workers devote to work. Indeed, at worse, they can be seen to  facilitate a lengthening of time spent at work, with negative effects on the quality of work and life.   5.3.5 Surveillance  D igital automation has the potential to create an unprecedented extension of worker surveillance,  gathering an d utilising greater volumes of employee data to measure and evaluate the effects of  workforce practices and behaviours on individual performance  (Moore  et al, 2018).  There has been an  exponential  rise in the use of smart phones and tracking technologies , including Fitbits and other  wearable trackers , digital personal assistants  (e.g. Siri, Alexa), and social media  network analytics  at  work . The saturation of working life with such technologies has subjected some workers to constant  extraction and processing of data for analytic or AI training purposes with minimal options to opt out (Crain , 2018; Sadowski , 2019) .   D igital  technologies h ave extended employer surveillance of employees’ actions, communication  behaviours and even inner state s. Sensor technology, such as RFID and GPS, allow employers to track  workers’ physical location continuously, while an increasing variety of wearable tec hnologies can  monitor factors  such as  employee heart rate and sleep, and AI -powered 'sentiment analysis ' o f t ext,   voice or facial expressions is used in some workplaces to identify worker fatigue or mood (Moore  et  a l. , 
Digital automation and the future of work     39 2018). Such data collection has been justified on the basis that it can improve productivity, o pt imise  systems, and more accurately target consumers or management efforts.     Two  of the main issues raised in relation to these extensions of employee monitoring is that they lead  to excessive monitoring and , in turn , higher levels of stress and anxiety. The use of AI technology has  also raised concerns as it is advancing faster than public understanding and is increasingly used to  control social behaviour ( Karen  and Lodge, 2019) .    Employee data which is collected through surveillance are now being used in data -driven HR  applications  (Tambe  et al ., 2019) and have raised issues about  profiling and discrimination.  Predictive  AI systems have the capacity to  infer personal information including emotional state s, habits and  politics from a small number of data points (Moore et al., 2018 ; Zuboff, 2019) . These systems have  frequently  been found to  perpetuat e existing inequalities , principally through replicating past bias es  and drawing on partial or incomplete data (Benjamin , 2019; Eubanks , 2018; Noble , 2018) . F o r  exa m ple,  facial recognition AI has attracted controversy for two interrelated reasons; first ly, many systems are  less effective at accurately identifying people of colour, because th ey were designed by white men  (Buolamwini  and Gebru, 2018)  and developed to have greater sensitivity to whiter faces (Benjamin,  2019) ; and second, because they have been used to disproportionately monitor and pol ice black  communities and people of colour ( Whittaker  et al. , 2018).     Additionally, there are issues of employee privacy and the legitimate boundaries of the employment  relationship, where the collection and manipulation of employee data is seen to blur these boundaries.  The weakness of organi sed labour has made it more diff icult and less likely that workers can limit  employer surveillance and new technologies and methods challenge the ability of the law to protect  worker privacy in the US ( Ajunwa  et al., 2017) and Europe ( Aloisi  and Grammano, 2019). For workers  and their rep resentatives, the collection of worker data for use in AI -driven HR decision -making has  presented urgent issues, including that employees be made aware of what data is being collected and  how it is being used  and  whether workers, or the collective parties to the employment relationship,  can negotiate the collection and use of data and ownership issues around the data itself.     Again we are faced with the potential for digital technologies to be used with negative effects on  worker well- being. In this case, t he particular concern is the negative effect on the a utonomy and  freedom of workers. Here this concern adds to other worries regarding the effects of the same  technologies on skills and the length of work time.     5.3.6 Platform work     Technology may change the co ntent of work, but in some cases its greatest effect is on labour relations,  particularly where it is used to reframe the employment relationship, which may or may not affect the  content of work. One such area of AI -enabled work that has attracted much rec ent attention is platform  work  – by which is  mean t, paid work mediated via an online platform or app. Companies offering  platform work  provide  a wide range of services (discussed below) but share a common pattern of what  has been termed a 'triangular ' work  relations, between platform, worker and customer ( Bergvall Kåreborn  and Howcroft, 2014; Joyce , 2020). Algorithms embedded in the platform or app link worker  and customer, mediate their relationship, facilitate payment, and sometimes monitor and direct the  conduct of work, including its price. Commonly, a platform also include s a facility for custom ers to give  a rating to the worker carrying out the task(s), and platforms use these ratings as part of monitori ng  and control procedures. Platform companies seek to profit from these arrangements (in reality, many  operate at a loss) by taking a commission  on each transaction, usually between  10–30 percent of its  value.     Research has identified two main  types of platform work ; online and offline ( Forde  et al., 2017) . Online   platform work is carried out entirely online and has two main variants ; simple and repetitive tasks, suc h 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     40 as labelling photographs, cleaning datasets, commonly termed clickwork  or microtasking , where   workers earn a small amount of money on completion of each task – sometimes as little as two cents  (USD) – meaning that workers must comple te very many tasks to earn a worthwhile income ( Berg , 2016 ;  Berg  et al. , 2018). Alternatively, online platform work may involve more complex tasks, such as graphic  design, translation work, or other creative or technical work ( Wood  et al., 2018, 2019) , organised on a  project -by-project basis  and somewhat akin to traditional freelancing but with online platforms taki ng  the role of traditional freelance agents ( Huws , 2017). Offline platform work , by contra st, requires the  presence of the worker at the time an d place where the service is required : the well- known example is  Uber  but offline platform work also incorporates household cleaning services, food and grocery  delivery, domestic chores, home maintenance, skilled trades, laundry services, and even dog -wa lking  (Forde et al., 2017).     Platforms have direct impacts on the way work is organised, and on the pay and conditions of workers  thus engaged. As a result of the experience of many workers, platform work has become associated  with low pay, poor con ditions, and precarious work. Most platform workers are not legally classified as  employees, but as self -employed or independent contractors. As a result of this classification, platform  workers often miss out on a range of employment and social protection s (Forde et al. , 2017). Pay for  platform work is typically based on piecework systems rather than hourly or salary payment and i s  generally much lower than for similar work carried out in conventional employment, often below legal  minimum wage levels ( Berg , 2016). In the case of online platform work, many platforms have effectively  created genuinely global labour markets, with workers in Europe and North America competing for  work with workers in low wage economies. Thus, one of the paradoxes of online plat form work is that,  in developing economies, online platform work often represents a significant increase above average  hourly earnings, while in the global North, this type of work is often at the lowest end of the earnings  range (Berg et al. , 2018; CIPD, 2017; Wood et al. , 2018).     In addition, many platform workers argue  that the algorithms mediating their work and pay are non transparent, and lack any means of recourse in the event of decisions that are felt to be unfair; for  instance, in cases of non- payment for work done, unexpectedly low ratings, or difficulties accessing  higher -paid tasks . Some workers also face being locked out from the platform altogether , meaning that  their right to recourse is denied . Instances of lock -out are referred to  as 'deac tivation ' and entail a form  of dismissal. Deactivation is often linked to customer ratings, with platforms usually requiring an  average score of more than four -out-of-five to access further work. Reasons for reduced scores are  often obscure or unfair, and there are many examples of platform workers experiencing abusive,  discriminatory or even criminal behaviour from platform service -users, but feeling unable to contest or  escape such situations for fear of receiving a low score or deactivation ( Calo  and Ros enblat, 2017; Huws   et al. 2017; Ravenelle , 2017; Rosenblat  et al., 2017).     Given this range of problems, it is unsurprising that many platform workers have raised grievances and  protests, through legal challenges, online campaigns, public demonstrations, and even militant trade  union actions ( Cant , 2019; Woodcock  and Graham , 2019). As a result, regulatory authorities in many  places are currently engaged in policy reviews and efforts to re- regulate this area of paid work  (Neufeind  et al. , 2018); as seen, for instance, in California’s statutory re -definition of employment status  (Conger  and Scheiber , 2019), and rulings in European courts over the employment status of Uber  drivers ( for instance, Khan  and Ram , 2017; Butler , 2018). In response, many platforms continue to claim  that the ' flexibility ' of the work they offer is  an improvement on traditional forms of employment. M any  workers say they value this aspect of platform work ; however, in reality this flexibility is often severely  constrained by other aspe cts, such as low pay and lack of available work, which leads to many unpai d  hours looking for work, and work patterns that entail unsoci able  hours (Berg, 2016; Forde et al., 2017;  Schor  and Attwood -Charles, 2017; Wood et al., 2018).     In relation to our di scussion of the spread of digital automation technologies, it should be noted that,  apart from the technology of platforms and apps, many of the distinctive features of platform work are 
Digital automation and the future of work     41 not technological at all. These essential but non- technological aspec ts of platform work include the  'triangular ' sub-contracting arrangements and piecework payment system mentioned previously, as  well as practices such as workers providing their own work equipment, and work being carried out on  an as -needed basis. Not only  are these features not technological, they are also not new, dating instead  from the earliest days of industrial capitalism ( Stanford , 2017).     This mix of new, technologically -enabled practices , together with older forms of work organisati on ,  gives platf orm work some characteristic features. Platform work is often likened to  a form of ' digital  Taylorism ' or even ' virtual Taylorism ' (Valenduc  and Vendramin, 2017) o r 'computer -assisted Taylorism '  (Laviolette , 2016). However, this characterisation oversimplifies a more complex reality. Although a  case can be made that clickwork and micro -tasking represent a form of Taylorism – co m pr is ing  fragmented tasks outsourced to an online ' crowd ' of low -skilled workers, f or completion at low wages  via piecework payment – other forms of platform work do not fit this pattern. Thus, online creative and  freelancing work via platforms such as Upwork are quite different, with workers retaining ' high level s  of autonomy, task vari ety and complexity, as well as potential spatial and temporal flexibility ' (Wood  et  al., 2019: 15).     Similar caution is needed regarding offline platform work, such as taxi- driving, food delivery, domestic  cleaning, or dog -walking. In these examples, work  that was previously done independently and often  organised entirely informally by word -of-mouth or local advertising, has been brought under the  partial control of a large company running an online platform. Far from being outsourced, these tasks  are more  formalised, and carried out more under the direction of a large, centralised company. Thus,  platform work entails a number of simultaneous but differentiated processes: some types of work are  being outsourced and made more insecure and precarious; other t ypes of work are becoming more  formalised.     The important point to grasp here concerns the non- determining role of technology. In platform w ork,  essentially similar algorithmic applications are embedded in quite different forms of work and work  organisation. In relation to employment, many of the di sruptive effects of platform work are not due  to technology but to other aspects of the business model; specifically, what has been termed ' legal and  regulatory arbitrage ' (Kaminska , 2016), including the circumventing of employment and other  regulations. F or instance, Uber and other taxi -apps have sought to avoid regulation as transport  companies – and the additional costs involved – by defining themselves as tech firms ( Khan and Ram ,  2017). The widespread practice of (mis)classifying a workforce as self -employed, rather than as  employees, results in considerable payroll savings for the companies concerned. In the UK, social  insurance contributions and holiday pay constitute some 25 percent of the wages bill for a company  with a workforce of employees. But t hese payments are not required for self -employed workers. In this  sense, while new technology facilitates platform work, it does not determine its overall form, and  neither is it the main driver of its growth (Forde et al. , 2017).     Official statistics hav e struggled to capture the number of workers involved in platform work, but  although numbers still appear to be rising (BLS, 2018; Collins  et al. , 2019; Farrell et al. , 2018), growth is  slow as a proportion of the total working population . Furthermore, mos t participants in platform work  use it as a source of supplementary income, in addition to income from elsewhere. Often, the other  source of income is a full -time job; although that job may well be insecure and low- paid ( Joyce  et  al. ,  2019).  There is also variation in levels of platform work between and across countries and e v idence  from qualitative research suggests that key drivers  of platform  include broader economic and  institutional factors, including tax policies, wider labour market conditions, and e ven the prior extent  of the grey economy (Forde et al. , 2017). Although platform work has established a presence in the  labour market and continues to grow, it is not in the process of transforming employment, contrary to  numerous predictions that it would . More than ten years after the founding of Uber (in 2009), there is  still little evidence that workers actually face 'the end of the job ' (Kessler , 2018) as a result of the 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     42 platformisation of work. In other words, the proven technological potential of pla tforms has not led to  a rapid and general transformation of work and employment.     In summary, then, platform work provides several important lessons for understanding the impac t of  new digital technologies on employment. Most significantly, it is clear th at digital technology has been  an enabler of platform work but not its main determinant or driver. This is demonstrated by the fac t  that, although platform technologies are essentially similar, they are embedded in a very wide range  of different types of w ork and work organisation. Undoubtedly, digital technology created  the  possibility of platform -based paid work, but the main drivers of its growth were a combination of the  huge influx of venture capital that continues to fund the expansion of platform com panies that have  not, so far, made any profits, together with business strategies based on the avoidance of employment  and other regulatory requirements, and the cost -savings that follow. By the same token, the limits to  the growth of platform companies ha ve not, for the most part, been technological. Rather, platforms  have more often run into difficulties retaining workers – at least, as post -recession labour markets have  tightened – and have increasingly faced renewed regulatory pressures and growing work er  organisation and contestation. Thus, to date , it is far from clear that the platform companies whic h have  become household names have a business model that is viable in the long -term. It is also clear, though,  that these companies have pioneered a new w ay of organising and managing paid work, based around  a novel digital technology, which may turn out to be their most lasting legacy. However, unless or until  this way of working  is brought within the remit of wider employment regulation , it will continue to be  unconducive to workers enjoying a higher standard of living and strong employment protection – to  the contrary, it represents a race -to-the-bottom as far as wages and labour standards are concerned.     5.3.7 Summary     The digital automation debate has been fr amed largely in terms of how new technology will affect the  volume of jobs, with varying estimates of potential job losses . What is clear, however, is that digital  automation will have wider effects beyond the level of employment. Digital automation is als o likel y to  impact on wages and the quality of jobs. In the latter case, there is scope for many jobs  to be  transformed in regressive ways , as digital technologies  are used to reduce the autonomy of workers   and add to work time . AI-enabled workplaces in so me organisations (e.g. Amazon), for example, have  been linked to harsh and health- limiting work conditions. The rise of platform work offers another  example of where digital technologies have, in some cases at least,  undermined job quality. Workers,  in short, may not be replaced by robots, but may face having to work as if they are robots . Based on the  differential effec ts of digital automation, the following section s explore polic y options  that could  h elp  to ensure the above highlighted negative impacts  are minimised .     
Digital automation and the future of work     43 6. Policy context     This section sets out the policy context for  addressing the potential impacts of digital automation on  employment. In particular, it summaries the key policy proposals identified in the literature and existing  EU policies  of note.     6.1 EU policy on d igitalisation, work and skills    Policy makers at national and supranational levels have been grappling with how to respond to the  potential challenges posed by digital automation for work and skills. Developing such policy is far from  easy for the simple reason that the future is uncertain, while the evidence base often lags hyperbolic  prediction. Nonetheless, a review of the literature suggests some common points of departure for how  to understand the context within which policy s hould be formulated, along with a relatively common  set of proposals for the type of policies that are needed to address the challenges of digital automation  for the future of work.     The general academic consensus, as presented above, is that apocalyptic predictions of mass job loss  or the end of work are largely unfounded, although the likely impact of digital automation on the  restructuring of work is likely to be profound and multifaceted. In other words, the challenges for policy  makers around digital automation is not just about the automation of jobs, but how technology ' will  also define the kinds of new jobs that we will end up with in the future, and how jobs that we currentl y  have may change ' (Neufeind et al ., 2018: 542; Bernhardt , 2017). In unders tanding these challenges,  debates on digital automation tend to be heavily influenced by concepts such as skill -biased  technological change, routine -biased technological change and capital -biased technological change  (see Dachs , 2018; Neufeind et al., 2018), with each giving rise to potentially different policy  prescriptions.     Against this backdrop, Goos  et al . (2019), in an EU Joint Research Council Technical Report, set out a  'general framework ' for how to understand the potential effect of technology on  the labour market.  Influenced by the work of Autor et al . (2003), Acemoglu and Restrepo (2017, 2018b ) and Goos et al .  (2014), the  authors of the report  present a framework that considers the possibility that digital  automation can have displacement  and compensating  effects , an approach that is commensurate wi th  the focus of this report on the destructive and transformative effects of technology. Displacement  effects occur where firms simply use technology to substitute labour, thereby reducing labour dem and.  In contrast, adjustment mechanisms can run in the other direction and potentially lead to  compensatory increases in labour demand, through productivity effects , capital accumulation effects   and reinstatement effects  (where technology leads to the crea tion of new tasks). These compensatory  effects can mean that net displacement is relatively small, but set within a wider context of significant  restructuring, which could have major implications for the polarisation of workforce skills. For Goos et  al. (2019) , this general framework suggests that policy interventions are needed across a broad range  of areas, including: education and training policies; labour market policies; income support and tax  policies; and technology and regulation policies. Similar p olicy domains are identified in much of the  literature.     Drawing from the above discussion, the wider literature covered in this report and ongoing  deliberations within EU policy circles, the key policy options typically elaborated include:     Education and training policies:  There is a general consensus that new policies on education and  training will be needed to address the impact of digital automation. A key argument is that a premi um  accrues to those with higher skills, who are likely to re ceive higher wages and have greater security  from the threat of automation. Workers with lower and medium level skills, in contrast, are seen as  more susceptible to the threat of automation. Investing more in the supply of skills, to a generally 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   44  higher lev el across the labour market, is thus seen as a necessary, though not in itself sufficient,  response to digital automation. The fact that employers’ demands for skills are likely to change, along  with the suggestion that workers will need to change their sk ills and jobs during their working lives,  means that investments in education and training will need to be structured over the life course and working lives. Thus, commentators such as Neufeind et al . (2018) stress the importance of early  childhood educati on, tertiary education, initial vocational education and training, and continuous  lifelong learning to ensure the employability of workers  in a world of fast -moving technology .   A  key point of consideration relates to the type of skills likely to be needed in the future, namely digital  skills. According to the OECD (2016), the rise of digital automation is raising the demand for four broad areas of skills (taken from Neufeind et al ., 2018): generic ICT skills; specific ICT skills; complementary ICT  skills;  and general cognitive skills. The need to respond to increased demand for digital skills has been  recognised across a number of EU policy domains. Notably, the Council Recommendation on Key  Competences for Lifelong Learning was updated in 2018 (from the 2006 declaration) to include a greater emphasis on digital skills. The European Commi ssion’s  (2018a ) Digital Education Action Plan  notes that  90 percent of jobs require some level of digital skills, yet some 44 percent of EU citizens have low or no  basic digital skills. In this context, the acquisition of digital skills is seen as an essential protective  measure, for both skilled and unskilled workers, against the threat of digital automation (Goos et al .,  2019).   I n a practical sense, many of the policy op tions proposed by commentators connect with well established or currently debated EU policies on skills:   •T he European ' Pillar of Social Rights ' states that ' everyone has the right to quality and inclusive  education, training and lifelong learning in order  to maintain and acquire skills that enabl e them to participate fully in society and manage successful transition in the labour market '. A rguments for policies aimed at enhancing digital skills fit with this right. In funding terms, EU  Social Funds offer a  means to support training in digital skills.  •T he New Skills Agenda for Europe was adopted by the European Commission on 10 June 2016.  It launched ten actions to enhance training and skills provision in the EU. The ten actions include, amongst others, th e 'Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition ' (European Commission , 2020a ), and the 'Blueprint for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills ' (European Commission , 2017), both of which offer potential responses to the challenges of digital automation. A further review in 2006, 'Recommendations on Key Competences for Lifelong Learning ', included a greater focus  on digital skills. As part of the New Skills Agenda all EU Members States were directed to establish national digital skills strategies by mid -2017, with the implementa tion of national strategies supported by national coalitions. Most recently, the European Commission adopted  a new communication on adopting a new vision of a ' European Skills Agenda for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience ' (Europea n Commission,  2020b ), as a respons e t o Covid -19. This includes a renewed commitment to address gaps in digital skills. A key target  is that , by 2025, 70 percent of adults aged 16- 74 will have at least basic digital skills, a significant  increase from a 2019 baseline of 56 percent. •T he stress on employability connects with a longstanding commitment of the EU to the concept of flexicurity, where it is recognised that the flexibility of labour markets is supportedby active labour market measures to get peopl e back into work. A key focus is on how displaced workers can be retrained. Though a contested concept, flexicurity is part of a broader policymove to ensure that workers remain employable in the labour market , including in the contex t where the technolog ical and skill requirements of jobs are shifting . •T here is increasing interest in ' activity accounts ', 'lifelong learning accounts ' and educational leave as policy mechanisms to foster continuing education and training. These mechani sms
Digital automation and the future of work     45 help to ease wor ker transitions, both from unemployment to work and between jobs . The  recent communication on a European Skills Agenda commits the Commission to assessing the  possibility of a European initiative on individual learning accounts and how such accounts may  facilitate individuals to successfully navigate labour market transitions. Such accounts have  previously been trialled in a number of EU Members States, such as the UK, and currently exist  in France financed through a levy on employers.     • The Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition (European Commission , 2020a ) brings together EU  Member States, companies, social partners, non -profit organisations and education providers,  in order to tackle the lack of digital skills in Europe. The Coalition was established as part o f the  EU Digital Single Market Strategy, and builds on the Grand Coalition for Digital Skills (2013 2016). Under the Coalition, organisations can sign up for membership, with a commitment to  take a specific action around the development of digital skills. The digital skills needs of four  broad groups are given attention: digital skills for all; digital skills for the labour force; digital  skills for ICT professionals; and digital skills in education. The Coalition has set a number of goals  (to be achieved b y 2020), including: training one million young unemployed people for vac ant  digital jobs; internships/ traineeships, apprenticeships and short -term training programmes;  the up -skilling and retraining of the workforce; and the modernisation of education and   training systems, so that digital capacities are embedded in curricula.     • The Blueprint for S ectoral Cooperation on S kills is one of the key initiatives of the New Skills  Agenda for Europe, and can be seen as responding to commitments enshrined in the EU S o cial  Model. Under the B lueprint, stakeholders work together in sector -specific partnerships (also  called sectoral skills alliances) to develop and implement strategies to address skills gaps in  particular sectors. Partnerships can bring together stakehold ers from business, unions,  research institutions, education and training institutions, and public authorities. The first  blueprint partnerships started in January 2018 and covered some specific sectors : automoti ve;  maritime; space; textile, clothing, leath er and footwear;  and  tourism. Four further partnerships  started in January 2019, with six more scheduled at the end of 2019/ start of 2020.  From  November 2020,  the Blueprint will combine  with a new Pact for Skills, to be launched as a new  cooperative actio n in response to the Covid -19 pandemic. The Pact for Skills will give initial  priority to the health, construction, automotive and transport, and tourism sectors.     Most EU Member States have put increased emphasis on raising levels of digital skills, typi cally as part  of wider programmes designed to increase the uptake by industry of digital technologies. National  initiatives for the digitalisation of industry are covered at the EU level by the Digitising European  Industry Strategy, launched in April 2016,  which aims to reinforce EU competitiveness through industry  level investment in digital technologies. An evaluation by the European Commission (2018e ) suggests  that two -thirds  of EU Member States have made the digitalisation of industry a national priorit y, with  a   focus on raising competitiveness and improving workforce digital skills. Specific national level  initiatives includes Smart Industry  (Netherlands); Prod uktion 2030 (Sweden); Industrie 4.0  (Germany); and  Catapult  (UK). However, while all national initiatives include a focus on skills, only 16  percent give  priority to skills ahead of infrastructure and technology (European Commission, 2018 e), with  n o t able  initiatives reported for France, Germany and Portugal. For example, the French ' Grand Plan  d’Investissement ' commits to invest €15 billion across 2018- 2020 to help support those with lower level  qualifications gain routes in employment.     Labour market policies and social protection:  Recommendations on labour market policies t y pically   focus on adjustment costs and responses and the potential role of employment agencies and labour  market intermediation, to help job seekers find jobs. These policies encompass activation measures  and jobs matching. Activation measures are well -developed in  most EU Members States, and are  particularly advanced in Nordic countries, with advanced policies to help assist displaced workers and  the unemployed back into work, such as labour market activation measures in Denmark and Job 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     46 Security Councils in Sweden.  The role of Public Employment Services in facilitating activation measures  is under scrutiny in the context of the challenges of digital automation, with commentators stressi ng  the need for more embedded collaboration between Public Employment Services, c ompanies, trade  unions and the third sector.     The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) is a notable instrument at the EU level designed to  rapidly assist dismissed workers back into the work. While the EGF is focused primarily on large scale  incide nts of redundancy or company closure, the threshold has recently reduced to 250 workers, wi th  an increasing focus on the ' dissemination of skills required for the digital age ' (European  Com mis sion,   2018e : 16).  There is also a proposal to update the provisi ons of the EGF so that it can assist workers that  lose their jobs as a result of digital automation. For the European Economic and Social Committee  (2018) , this proposal is a 'step towards the establishment of a fully -fledged European Transition Fund  which  would help manage the digital transformation in a responsible way '.    A second area of concern under labour market policies and social protection relates to non -standard  work that may arise through new business models, such as the type of gig employment that i s  associated with on -demand platforms (see discussion above). Digital automation is seen to  encourag e  business models that deny workers key so cial protections. Accordingly, there is discussion about  extending social protections to those on gig -type contracts, including minimum wage regulations,  minimum hours of work, social security measures, tax incentives (see below) and potentially union  repr esentation. This ty pe of employment also raises much broader questions about the regulation and  definitional status of what it means to be employed. Jobs created through online platforms are often  defined as self -employed, although in a number of high prof ile cases (such as the Uber business model) ,  this status  is being questioned. There is an ongoing debate about a ' third category ' of employment that  sits between a standard employment relationship and self -employed status. This category already  exists in a  number of EU Member States, such as ' auto -entrepreneur ' status in France, ' worker ' s t a tus in   the UK, and ' quasi -subordinate worker ' in Italy, and its existence affords individual s in this kind of work  some  degree of employment protection. However, there is no consistent EU policy on employment  status in the gig economy . Likewise, while the Directive 2019/1152 on Transparent and Predictable  Working Conditions offers protections for workers in more precarious  contractual arrangements , it   does not address ambiguities in employment status. The status of and protections for platform workers  thus remains a live policy issue, with the European Commission announcing, as part of the Covid -19  response, that they will put forward new proposals for those working via technology platforms in 2021.     Income support and t ax policies: Income support policies can also be covered through welfare  arrangements, tax credits and minimum income measures, together with social protect ion policies.  There is ongoing debate about the unequal distribution of rents from processes of digital  transformation and the unequal balance of taxation on capital and labour income, with a need to  rebalance in favour of the latter. A frequently mentioned policy option is the expansion of earned  income tax credits, a policy favoured by commentators such as Brynjolfsson and McAfee (2014).  Another option is a basic income scheme, which has been trialled in a number of national and regional  contexts. Academi c support for such a scheme is mixed, however. Goos et al . (2019: 25), for example,  argue that a basic income would erode work incentives particularly for low skilled workers (Goos et al .,  2019: 25), though no evidence is presented to suggest this would be the case. The idea of a basic  income has again risen in prominence in the context of the Covid -19 crisis and is seen by some as an  important mechanism for addressing existing (and deepening) inequalities in society.     Technology regulation policies:  Here the focus of policy is on the regulation of the nature and use of  technology itself. There has been some debate, for example, on the taxation of robots, though such  taxation has received little support , in part, because of the predicted negative effect of a 'robot tax ' on  investment and innovation levels . An alternative approach offered by Goos et al . (2019: 27) entails  regulation of the ' design and implementation of digital technologies ', so that ' investments in new  technologies should focus on those technologies that minimis e the direct threat of automation for 
Digital automation and the future of work   47  workers and that maximize the positive countervailing effects that increase labour demand '. Th is   approach is supported by the ILO's Global Commission on the Future of Work ( ILO, 2019).   N ew labour relations:  The High -Level Expert Group on the Impact of Digital Transformation on EU Labour  Markets recommended that existing structures of labour relations be adapted to fit contemporary  labour market realities. Concrete actions proposed include: new employee assistance programmes to  mitigate increased occupational health and safety risks, particularly those relating to mental health; the  equal treatment of those on standard and non- standard work arrangements, particularly in terms of  access to government services and wider social benefits; and the ' reinvigoration ' of social dialogue.  Again, this can be seen to connect to the EU’s commitment to the social model; however, there is  increasing interest not only in expanding the more traditional scope of collec tive bargaining, for  example, through new technology agreements, but also in new forms of dialogue more suited to the environment of those working in the platform economy (such as online forums).   A new  social contract: A new social contract is presented by the High -Level expert Group on the Impact  of Digital Transformation on EU Labour markets  as a mechanism for ' upgrading the social fabric of our  labour markets '. Policy considerations include equal social protection no matter what the terms of  employment  (similar to the discussion above on social protections for non -standard workers); a ' digital  single window' for those working on online platforms to make contributions and taxes; and a  commitment to ' redistributing the value of digital ownership '. The bro ader idea of a new social contrac t  also connects to the work of Kochan (2015) in the American context.   I n support of the perceived need for policy responses to digital automation, in April 2018, EU Member  States signed a Declaration of cooperation on AI (European Council , 2018). During the same month,  the EU issued a Communication on AI for Europe (European Commission , 2018d ) with three mai n  objectives:   •B oosting the EU’s technological and industrial capacity, through investments in research and innovati on and better access to data; •P reparing for socio -economic changes brought about by AI by encouraging the  modernisation of education and training systems, nurturing talent, anticipating changes in  the labour market, supporting labour market transitions and adaptation of social protection systems; •E nsuring an appropriate ethical and legal framework. T hese objectives set a broader policy framework for addressing the challenges posed by digital  technologies in economy and society.   6.1.1 Summary   T here has been  extensive debate on the types of policies needed to address the impacts of digital  automation on work and employment. For the most part, however, debate has not translated into  concrete actions. High level commissions and reviews on the future of work have taken place in many advanced countries, such as the Taylor Review of Modern Working Practices in the UK , or Industr y 4.0  in Germany, but this  work  has rarely led to the development of specific initiatives designed to address  the impacts of digital automation. Far more common have been attempts to respond to the challenges  of digital automation through existing policy instruments. This is particularly evident at the EU level.   A t a basic level, EU policy is primarily focused around two key goals. First, a commitment to acceleratin g  digital automation as a means to enhance EU competitiveness. Second, in recognition of the fact that 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     48 digital automation poses challenges for employment, both for transitions into work and those in work,  an emphasis on raising the demand for and supply of skills. It is recognised that addressing the  challenges of digital automation demands policy response s that are wider tha n the skills agenda. For  example, the Council of the European Union encourages Member States to develop comprehensive  measures that offer a ' life cycle ' approach to addressing the challenges of the changing world of work.  A lifecycle approach should includ e the development of integrated and inclusive policies co v er ing  issues such as  work -life balance, diversity, health and safety, social protections, decent work, careers,  skills and lifelong learning. EU policy provisions are also typically located within  the Pillar of Social  Rights and the working mechanism of the social model. This orientation is reflected in  all policy.  Nonetheless, in a practical sense, for all the debate on the need for a wider policy focus , EU initiatives  designed to address the potent ial impacts of digital automation o n work and employment seek to  encompass  established EU instruments and levers and remain largely centred on  issues of  skill s  development, education, training and lifelong learning.     A primary focus on skills , however,  has been questioned by the European Economic and Social  Committee (2018)  in its report, Artificial Intelligence: Anticipating its Impact on Jobs to Ensure Fair  Transition. As the EESC (2018: 25- 26) notes, ' A focus on education, reskilling and training in the  co n text   of transformation that AI brings to jobs as presented by the European Commission is not enough. There  needs to be a debate on taxation, the financing of public budgets and social protection that shoul d  also touch on the redistribution of the benef its of digitalisation '. Such concerns guide the po licy   options outlined in  this report, which, while recognising the importance of education, reskilling and  training, aim to pursue  a more radical agenda for reform designed to enhance the quality of work,  workplace representation and the distribution of the benefits of digital automation.         
Digital automation and the future of work     49 7. Policy options     The policy options outlined in th is report  link to existing policies and are guided by the European  Commission’s recommendation to develop a new social contract for the digital era ( European  Commission, 2019). The options  seek to establish a Digital Social Contract  around the development,  manageme nt and use of digital technologies. Guiding the Digital Social Contract should be the  establishment of a social protection floor at a European level, for all workers, regardless of their  contractual status.     The policy options  also complement the Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe ( European  Commission, 2018b, 2018c ). They are designed to improve skills and training – for example, they   support industry and sectoral skills alliances and investment in digital skills for AI -enhanced  environments . But they also  move beyond skills and training by seeking wider change including  a  more democratic industrial strategy and reforms to the governance of work and the reduction  of working time .    The report does not  propose options  for specific occupations . Rather , it advance s polic y options that  can be applied to all groups of workers. The general focus of the policy discussion fits with  EU t r aditions   of so cial dialogue and reflects the system -wide effects of digital automation. Overall, the  policy o ptions   aim to anticipate and manage the impact  of digital automation in a way  that benefits all in society .       7.1 Aims     The main aims of the policy options  are to:    1. Reskill and upskill present workforces facing  job displacement or transformation through  improving sector level intelligence about the way digital technologies are changing jobs and  adapting skills provision to meet emerging needs;     2. Facilitate sustainable organisational strategies that adapt to the economic and social effects  of digital automation in ways that  benefit workers and ensure greater diversity, equality and  accessibility to decent jobs for all generations of workers;     3. Update  labour  market policy and regulatory frameworks  to create employer accountability on  the employment impacts of AI investment decisions at a national level and to ensure  meaningful social dialogue on technology -driven changes to work organi sation and job  design  at the enterprise level;     4. Achieve reform in the governance of work and a reduction in work time that enables digital  tech nologies to be used for the purposes of greater human freedom and well -being.     The key policy options  that seek to meet the above aims  are set out below . These policy options   encompass different dimensions and entail change both at the workp lace and the economy as a whol e.  Connections to existing policy instruments and the feasibility of the options  are noted. The policy  options  are ordered from those that are relatively uncontroversial (around skills) to those that are  potentially more radic al and challenging to implement  (around changes in the distribution of rewards) .  Despite the challenges, however, all the policy options can be regarded  as important and in need of  implementation.     
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     50 7.2 Skills and training provision     Skills and training polic ies will need to account for the degree of exposure of different sectors and jobs  to digital automation, as well as to whether the effects of digital technologies on different sectors are  destructive and/or transformative. P olicy interventions will involve  identifying where jobs are ' at  risk '  of destruction in order to direct timely and targeted measures to workers in those jobs – here the  discussion  build s on the earlier framing  in terms of 'collapsing ' occupations and 'machine terrain '  occupations. There also needs to be reskilling available for workers in jobs which are likely to be  transformed by digital technologies; these jobs will include 'rising star ' occupations and jobs that  remain in 'machine terrain ' occupations. Ensuring that  technological adoption results in well- paid  employment may also require creating protective measures for those ' human terrain'  occupations  which are unlikely to be changed by new technologies – here protections would include wage floors  to combat the down ward pressure on wages as displaced workers seek new forms of employment. The  following policy options  address these concerns by building better intelligence about the effect of  digital technologies on jobs through sectoral cooperation and new forms of dat a collection, thus  allowing for targeted interventions in the area of skills and training provision.     7.2.1 Option  1: Industry and sectoral skills alliances that focus on facilitating  transitions for workers in ‘at risk’ jobs and reskilling for workers in  trans formed jobs     One of the biggest challenges for states and employers responding to structural change in the labour  market and changes in occupations is the uncertainty and lack of empirical evidence about the effects  of new technologies on work and employme nt. Given this uncertainty and lack of evidence, the report   recommend s drawing on the perspectives and experiences of stakeholders – including industry  representatives, trade unions and education and training providers – to form new alliances that c an  cont ribute to a shared knowledge of the nature and likely implications of technological change for  work and employment. The creation of these alliances, in turn, can be used to inform policy action.     The EU’s Blueprint for Sectoral Cooperation on Skills [COM/ 2016/381] ( European Commission , 2016 )  already provides essential strategic evidence about skill needs in industries and sectors where there is  projected growth. The report  propose s to extend the remit of the alliances forged under this Blueprint  – specific ally, it recommend s that intelligence is gathered on the anticipated effects of digital  technologies on the volume and skill content of jobs. Specifically, the alliances would create  intelligence on:     • areas of job decline and jobs ' at-risk' of automation;     • the scale and dimensions of emerging skill needs;     • the scale, nature and pace, at sectoral, regional and occupational levels, of labour market  transformation;     • the scope for new training and educational reforms.     By identifying the sectors, industries a nd occupations that  are likely to experience the greatest change  as a result of new technology and determining the timeframe within which this change is likely to take  place, it will be possible to target policy interventions which limit maladjustment and provide the best  outcomes for employment growth and skills utilisation.  The new strategic alliances envisaged here   would take a proactive approach to labour market intervention and the provision of education and 
Digital automation and the future of work     51 training, developing policies and programmes  that can best manage  the effects of job destruction and  transformation.     7.2.2 Option  2: Digital skills for working in AI -enhanced environments     Based on the analysis presented earlier in the report, research has identified key knowledge, skills and  competencies that businesses and workers will need to work with and alongside digital technologies.  Work is already underway as part of the New Skills Agenda for Europe [COM/2016/381] to ensure  Europeans have basic digital skills and to address existing digital skills gaps. Basic IT literacy will become  an essential skill for all workers for their participation in work and society, but Europe also needs to  address technical skills shortages and generalist skills required for high -skill roles in order to build the  specific AI capacit ies within E U Member S tates . In light of this, the following options  aim to augment  skills for working in AI -enhanced working  environments. Reforms here would relate to education, from  secondary through to graduate level:     • Modernisation of education must ensure that teaching and training is weighted towards those  complementary skills which are likely to be in high demand and unl ikely to face the threat of  automation, as identified in the research reviewed for this report. These skills encompass  problem -solving capabilities, intuition, creativity, and persuasion. The details of modules and  metrics for inserting the above skills in to existing education provision should be designed in  consultation between key stakeholders, namely education and training providers, industry  representatives, and trade unions.     • Digital skills initiatives must include programmes for AI literacy, in particular, specialist training  courses for managers and professionals in data analytics, as well as in legal and ethical issues  pertaining to data. These could be developed and delivered through higher education  institutions and Digital Innovation Hubs ( Europea n Commission 2020c ).    • AI design, engineering and maintenance capability could be developed through investment in  specialist centres for education and training of computer science, data science, machine  learning engineering and robotics, fostering collabora tions between universities and industry  and including opportunities for industry work placements for advanced students and rec ent  graduates.     The above reforms could be supplemented with provision for life- long learning and training, as lai d  out in the Eur opean Pillar of Social Rights, enabling people at different stages in the life- course to  access education and to be in a position to engage productively in AI -enhanced environments .      7.2.3 Option  3: Revaluation of work and new protections for workers in hard t o  automate jobs     Many jobs will survive digital automation – indeed many new jobs may be created, as technology is  adopted and used in the economy. Jobs that are likely to persist include those that fall into the category  of 'human terrain'  occupations, which are comprised of manual tasks requiring situational adaptability,  visual and language recognition, and in- person interactions with a strong emotional labour  component. These jobs include care jobs. They are often low paid as well as und ervalued, despite being  necessary for social reproduction.    
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology   52  The proposal  here would be that 'human terrain ' occupations – notably care work – be revalued. The  emphasis on  care work as valuable and essential should be part of a broader social dialogue about  the  value of work and would be an important part of the Digital Social Contract recommended in thi s  report. The aim would be to revalue care work in ways that help to foster higher pay and improved  conditions of work. Technology may play a part in lightening work for care workers, but the goal shoul d  be to recognise the value of care work in itself and remunerate it more generously given its essential  human elements. Here there is a recognition of the limits to digital automation and the need for a  reappra isal of the roles and contributions of particular kinds of work and workers.  The Covid -19 cr isis   has brought into focus the value of care workers (along with other ' key' workers) and proposal here  would be ensure that these workers are  properly recognised and rewarded for their efforts.    I n addition, it is recommended that, where jobs persist, workers are adequately protected including  from the depressive effects of wage reductions due to a potential oversupply of labour seeking low paid work. Here polici es would include new legal protections for gig -workers. The recognition of  occupants of gig work as ' workers ' would be a first step. Such an approach would be in line with recent  developments in California, where legal classifications have been revised to redefine many gig workers  as employees, following a Supreme Court ruling in 2018 ( California Supreme Court , 2018) and  subsequent passage of new statute law in 2019 ( Thomasson et al. , 2019). Beyond this, the aim would  be to ensure a levelling up of employment rights and protections so that workers in jobs that outl ast digital automation are able to meet their needs through paid work.   7.3 Digital work-life balance   7.3.1 Option  4: Establish a European ' right to disconnect'  A s highlighted in an earlier section, digital technologies threaten to lengthen the t ime people  work, by  creating an ' always -on' work culture . A particular concern is the use of email and smart phones that  connect  people  to work, even during hours when they are  not physically at work and being  paid to do  work. The risk here is a form of ' digital burnout ', as technologies tie people to work and prevent them   from switching off from work.   Re search has shown  that people who responded to work communications after 9pm had a worse  quality of sleep a nd were less engaged in work the next day ( Barber and Jenkins, 2014) . Workers can   also suffer from anxiety about work expectations even if they do not check emails dur ing out-of-hours  since the mere expectation of being in contact 24/7 is enough to increase strain for employees and their families ( Butts et al., 2015).   B ased on this evidence and the concerns outlined above , the report  recommend s an EU -wide 'right to  disconnect '. The latter would ensure that all employees feel free to not engage in any work -related  electronic communications, including email and messages, outside of normal work hours. Given  developments in a number of EU Member States , such a policy would seem feas ible and realistic. The  Irish government is currently considering legislation that would improve work -life balance by allowing  workers to not answer emails or messages outside of office hours.  In France, the El Khomri Law  introduced the ' right to disconnec t' from August 2016. In Italy, a weaker version of the 'right to  disconnect ' was established through a Senate Act  in 2017. More recently, Spain also included a ' right   to disconnect ' in the 2018 Data Protection and Digital Rights Act. The  recommendation is that the EU  introduce a law that guarantees similar rights. Article 24 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts the right to rest and leisure, placing explicit limitations on work time. The ' right to disconnec t '  recommended here would update this declaration for the digital age, enabling workers to reconnect with their families, friends, and communities , while obliging companies to respect the personal time of  their workers during non -working hours.   
Digital automation and the future of work     53 7.3.2 Option  5: Lower the EU Wo rking -Time Directive to 38 -hours per week and  remove the opt -out clause     Digital automation creates the opportunity to redistribute working time more evenly across the  workforce, allowing the unemployed and underemployed to gain the work they need, while r edu cing  the negative impact of overwork on those who work long hours of work. There is no automati c  mechanism linking digital automation with shorter average work hours  – to the contrary,  as  highlighted above, an outcome of some digital technologies may b e an increase in the intensity and  duration of work time . In this case, policy interventions are needed to ensure that digital technologies  feed through to shorter work hours.  The need for such interventions is magnified by the stark  differences in average work  hours that persist between EU Member S tates – this despite existing  policies such as the EU Working -Time Directive (WTD).     Specifically , the report  recommend s two policies. Firstly, it is suggest ed that the EU WTD be lowered to  a maximum of 38 -hours per week. It is  realise d that, in the short -term, this move would cause disruption   for some states and companies.  In this sense, a phasing in (by negotiation) may be agreed by Member  States. More radically, and potentially less feasibly , the reports sugges t removal of the opt -out clause  and the  move to collective  agreement on a cut in work time.  Here the goal would be to funnel the  benefits of technological progress into shorter working hours.  Reform of the EU WTD is long overdue  and the proposal here would be to update it for the digital age.     Secondly, in the long er-term, the report  recommend s a broader commitment to an average 30 hour  working week by 2050 across the EU. This commitment repr esents the ideal of realising in society the  basis for expanded free time, with technology adding to  the ability of people to live better lives beyond  work. It is recognise d that this is a radical and ambitious proposal, but it can be  note d that there i s a   large body of empirical evidence which  supports the benefits of shorter working hours in terms of  individual health and well- being a s well as  organisational performance  (Stronge et al., 2019) . Th is   evidence strengthens the case for work time reduction at the EU level.       7.4 Governance policy     7.4.1 Option  6: Worker representation, company reward schemes and  workplace governance     Part of the concern about digital automation is that technological changes are imposed on workers as  opposed to these changes being decided upon through democratic institutions. Workers, it can be  argued, have more to fear from digital automation where they are subordinate in the design and  implementation of technology. Here fear relates both to potential job losses and to the use of  technol ogy in a manner that erodes the quality of work.     This leads to five polic y options . Firstly, there is the option of strengthening the input of unions in the  collective decision -making processes around technology. Unions offer a voice for workers and a w ay  to ensure democratic accountability in the innovation process. Secondly, where union presence is  limited, suitable provision can be made for direct worker involvement in the way that technology is  organised and implemented. Two concrete options  recently suggested would be that employees  should have 50 percent of the seats on company boards and that the voting power of e ven the largest  shareholders should be capped at 10 percent (Piketty, 2020) . Such policies , if implemented at the EU  level,  could help to share the proceeds of technological progress while mitigating its costs inclusive of  lower quality employment. Thirdly , there is  the expansion of share ownership schemes that enabl e  workers to gain a direct stake in the firms in which they work. Widening share ownership would hel p  to create a direct mechanism to equalise the distribution of the rewards of digital automati on. Here the 
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     54 EU could consider tax incentives for technology -driven firms that extend share ownership schemes to  workers.     Fourthly, there is  the application of what the ILO calls a ' human -in-command ' principle to the use of AI.  This principle responds to the concern that AI reduces human decision- making and instead cedes  power to algorithms in the recruitment, management and evaluation of workers. Adopting a ' human in-command ' principle would establis h accountability and allow for organisations to counterac t the  automatic encoding of bias into algorithms that perpetuate inequality and discrimination (Eubanks,  2018). It would also open up space for greater democracy over the uses and application of AI.     Fifthly, there is the encouragement of worker ownership. The concentration of power in the hands of  large corporations challenges both national sovereignty and democratic accountability at the  workplace level. If society is to be organised in ways that en able technology to enhance human  freedom and flourishing, then present governance arrangements need to be shifted d ecisively towards  workers. Here policies could be designed to incentivise worker ownership (from loans for cooperati ves  to the development of  funds that enable workers to become co -owners of platforms).     Again there are issues over the feasibility of the above policies, not least because the policy themselves  will be resisted by corporate interests who wish to retain their power over technolog y as well as firm  ownership. But while not underestimating the barriers to reform, it can be argued  that such policies  are vital, if the rewards of digital automation are to be fairly distributed.     7.5 Duty to Report Directive     7.5.1 Option  7: A new directive for the regulation of technology at work     Data limitations coupled with a lack of regulatory oversight creates uncertainty as well as potenti al  inequities in the evolution and effects of digital technologies. To address these issues,  the report   propose s a new directive that requires firms to report on the impacts of digital technologies on jobs,  wages and the quality of work.       The directive would accomplish four things:     1. Establish a duty whereby firms (employing over 50 employees) are required to report on a ny  technological change that will affect the work and employment of their employees;     2. Require EU Member States to identify or establish a regulatory body to oversee reporting by  firms on the use of digital technologies in the workplace;     3. Require worker rep resentation in the regulatory body concerned with the impact of new  technology on economy and society;     4. Enable new technology agreements in collective bargaining arrangements at sectoral and  firm -level.     A mandatory duty to report technological change would provide new data on the effects of digital  technologies on workers as well as a mechanism to make employers accountable for choices around  technology, work organisation and job design. Reporting could i nclude measures of the quantitative  effect of technology on jobs , such as projected job losses and changes in work hours, as well as  measures of decent work  at the firm level, drawing on the extensive work undertaken by the ILO  (Kucera, 2007) .    
Digital automation and the future of work     55 The direct ive would also introduce a technology information and consultation duty  whereby  workplaces undergoing significant reorganisation or restructuring as a result of technologic al  innovation would be obliged to make technological changes an item for information  and consultati on  with employees with legal enforceability. This would involve updating Article 27 (ICE) of the EU Charter  of Fundamental Rights to create an explicit duty on employers to ensure employee involvement in  decisions about technology that affect their work and employment.  While clearly a radical move, a new  duty to report directive would help to create more transparency and democratic accountability around  digital automation.  This recommendation would support the goals of equitable governan ce o u t lined  above.     7.6 Mission -oriented industrial policy     7.6.1 Option  8: Direct EU involvement in the design and diffusion of digital  technologies to ensure decent work objectives are achieved     The effects of digital technologies are not fully determined – rath er, they are open to change. Indeed,  as stressed in this report, there is a need to manage digital technologies in ways that maximise societal  well- being. Reflecting on this point, the report  recommend s that the EU adopt a strategic approac h to  digital aut omation that aims to achieve clear goals. Following the work of Mazzucato (2013, 2016), the  report  argue s for a mission -oriented approach to industrial policy. In this case, it is  propose d that EU  Member States define and lead the innovation process, rather than only incentivise or stabilise it.     The report  recommend s the adoption of a mission that aims for an automated future that works for  all – offering high quality jobs, the reward of higher living standards and fewer hours of work.   This mission would place the creation of decent work at the centre of the Digital Single Market and the  Coordinated Plan on AI, embedding it as an objective in all existing and proposed policy and legal  mechanisms directed at the development of AI and AI c apacity. Specifically, this would mean  developing provisions which ensure that, where AI is introduced into production and business  processes, it contributes towards well -being through the creation of better jobs and, where AI  technologies improve producti vity and competitiveness of European business and industry, the  rewards are distributed equitably – including via shorter work hours (see above ).    These objectives could be achieved through EU -funded and democratically governed research which  draws on the strength of social partnerships to inform the direction of technological progress. Thei r  achievement  would also involve developing – through tripartite social dialogue and the work of the  European Platform of National Initiatives on Digitising European Ind ustry [COM/2017/479 final] –  thresholds for job quality, which could be monitored and applied utilising impact assessments and  auditing at three critical stages of the AI cycle, defined as: i) development  and generation of   technology; ii) diffusion and dep loyment; and iii) distribution of gains.     Here the mission -oriented approach to  industrial policy  would be consistent with  an inclusive -growth   agenda , with the focus on creating an environment where digital automation meets standards of  decent work, while extending free time.  In the sum, the approach to policy would be to ensure that  digital technologies deliver for the many, not just the few.        
STOA | Panel for the Future of Science and Technology     56 8. Conclusion      This report has systematically and critically reviewed key literature on digital technologies and the  impacts that these technologies have (or may  have) on work and employment. As has been  stressed  at  different points , the scale and scope of digital automation is likely to be variegated and contingent  upon a number of factors including the level capital investment, the level of wages and the nature of  prevailing regulatory frameworks. T echnological change, as in the past, remains uncertain and open to  refor m.    In the course of the report , answers  have been  sought to some key questions . These included the  effects of digital technologies on the volume of work . They also included the effects of these  technologies on the quality of work . Using available empirica l evidence and academic literature, the  report has  shown how digital automation could transform key aspects of our lives, from the type of  work we do, to the amount of leisure time we have available to us .      The report began with a historical overview of different waves of automation. One thing that was  stressed here was the persistence of work, despite rapid technological progress. It has been  show n  how, like in the past, present and future developments in digital technologies are likely to preserve  work. Predictions of the death  of work miss  the limits to automation and the capacity for technologi c al  progress to change tasks within jobs, as opposed to eliminate  them. It has been stressed how  digital  technologies can transform the nature of work – for example, the use of forms of digital surveillance  can reduce the autonomy of workers and impair the quality of work. It has  also been emphasised how  the evolution and outcomes of digital automati on depend on the broader economic and social  context, including how  technology is owned and controlled .     In light of the present and future impact of digital automation on the labour market and workplac e,  the report has set out a number of policy options . These fall into five  categories: 1) skills and training  provision , including  industry and sectoral skills alliances that focus on facilitating transitions for  workers in ' at risk ' jobs and reskilling for workers in transformed jobs; digital upskilling for  wo r king in   AI-enhanced environments; and new protections for workers in hard to automate jobs; 2) digital wor k life balance – the establishment of a European -level 'right to disconnect ' and a reduction of the EU  Working -Time Directive to 38 -hours per week  and removal of the opt -out clause ; 3) greater worker  representation and more democratic workplace governance; 4) a new directive for the  regulation of technology at work ; 5) a mission -oriented industrial policy  that seeks to promote  direct EU involvement in the design and diffusion of digital technologies to ensure decen t work  objectives are achieved .     Taken together, the policy options aim to establish a new Digital Social Contract  around the  development, management and use of digital technologies. A social protection floor at a European  level for all workers, regardless of their contractual status, is an essential part of this contract. The social  protection floor is guided by the Human -Centred Agenda (HCA) set out by the ILO, which recommends  that EU Member States guarantee universal entitlement to life- long learning, support individuals  subject to technological transitions at work, implement a programme for gender equality, streng then  social protections at work, and expand time sovereignty ( Pastore et al., 2019) . Complementing these  recommendations, the report seeks to build a digital future where technology works for all in society,  not just a privileged few.  While it is realised that  some of the policy options  are radical, it can be  argue d  that their implementation is needed if digital automation is to yield benefits to all.        A final word can be added here on the Covid -19 crisis. The report has been written at a time when  nati onal economies are contracting under the effects of a lockdown  induced by a pandemic . Th e Co v id 19 crisis represents the worst economic crisis since the 1930s. Policies have been implement ed to deal  with the crisis, but it is yet to be seen how effective t hese policies will be, in the event of rising 
Digital automation and the future of work     57 unemployment. It is clear that the crisis has exposed deep divisions in society and that rebuilding the  economy will require broader reforms, inclusive of measures to tackle sources of economic in equ a lity   and t he urgent threat of climate change.     From the perspective of digital automation , the Covid -19 crisis speeds up digital automation, by  creating incentives for firms to automate in order to maintain production under social distancing. Yet,  by creating large pools of cheap labour, it also creates the potential for firms to hoard  labour, and to  forgo costly investments in technology. Where remote working occurs, technology may also be used  to monitor workers, changing (in potentially negative ways) the quality of work. It is too early to say  how these forces will play  out, but it is clear that the present crisis will have impacts on what technology  is developed and how it is used.      This report  has set out the challenges and possibilities for digital automation. It has proposed policies  to ensure that the benefits of digital automation are reaped and more equally shared. The Covid -19  crisis will cause significant disruption, including to the processes of digital automation , and will require  new policies , from higher  public  spending to income protection schemes (including potentially a basic  income for all ). The arguments and policies advanced in this report complement any wider effort to  rebuild the economy after the crisis. In the end, it can be argue d that a post -crisis economy must  embrace technology to enhance the  freedom, health and well -being  of people .

This  report  addresses  the nature, scope and  possi ble  effects  of digital automation.  It reviews  relevant  literature and  situates  modern debates on  tech nological change in historical context. It  also off ers  some policy options th at, if impleme nted, would h elp to  harness technolog y for positive economic and  soci al  ends.     The report recognises that technological change can  affect not just the volume of  work but also its quality. It  iden tifies threats  to job quality and an uneq ual  distribution of the risks and  benefits associated w ith  digital  automation. In  response, it  recommends  a  number of policy options – ones that aim to go be yond  the provision  of skills  and training and which  seek a  human- centred approac h to digital transf ormati ons of  work based on industrial democracy and social  partnership. Overall, the report  pushes for a new Digital  Social Contract and a future of work that works for all.
