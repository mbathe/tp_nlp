4  HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    Executive summary   In 1950, Alan Turing first asked  whether machines can think. Since then, innovation in computational  capabilities, connectivity  and data availability have led to breakthroughs in which machines learn from large  amounts of data to generate predictions and other types of outputs.   People now live alongside digital technologies in the physical and virtual worlds. These include machines  pre-programmed to follow a precise set of rules, or that are fully autonomous and can operate without  human intervention. They include immersive environments that combine features of the physical and virtual  worlds to create  realistic experiences , such as s urgical training , that would be difficult to reproduce in real world settings. Behind these and other innovations in the early phases of implementation are complex  mathematical models trained on large computers with vast amounts of data to emulate human -like  cognitive functions, i.e. Artificial Intelligence (AI).   AI and emerging technologies are reshaping societies with opportunities , but also risks. Most countries  identi fy these technologies as priorities and levers for economic growth, while noting the ne ed to adapt  governance frameworks. There are many types of AI systems, from voice recognition,  to chatbots, product  and content recommendations  and driverless cars, many of which also rais e risks. These  include bias and  discrimination, the polarisation of opinions at scale, upheaval in job markets due to  the automation of tasks,  privacy infringement, widespread surveillance, threats to security and safety  and increasing inequalities  from concentration of power. Immersive environments also pose risks, from o nline addiction to virtual  assault , to the challenge of assigning liabilities in a world of avatars.   Public policy frameworks must adapt to meet the governance imperatives of AI and emerging technologies   and protect established rights. Policies in these ar eas are key to building a strong digital ecosystem in  which  governments, businesses  and individuals can reap the benefits .  
HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   5  OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    AI and emerging technologies  offer tremendous opportunities for well being, productivity, growth and solving pressing societal challenges.  However, they also pose risks to human rights, fairness and human  agency, among others. Many countries recognise the need to develop  forward -looking policies and adapt governance frameworks to keep pace  with these developments and to leverage technological benefits while  mitigating risks. This paper builds on OECD’s extensive work on AI, data  governance and connectivity to support policy makers in this process. It  highlights the importance of co -operating internationally to ensure that  emerging technologies are trustworthy and calls for building a common  understanding of AI and emerging technologies, sharing good practices  and  creating the evidence base to inform policy design, implementation and  evaluation.

6  HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    The promise and peril of AI and emerging technologies   AI permeates economies and societies   Products and services powered  by AI are already a crucial part of most people’s routines, whether they  realise it or not  (Box 1) . Consider  AI systems that recommend articles, friends and products; recognise  faces, speech and objects; and power chatbots or optimise traffic routes . Other examples include AI  supporting climate  action, disa ster prevention  and public service delivery, with data gathered by Internet of-Things (IoT) devices and connected sensors  (OECD, 2020 [1]). Predictive models can anticipate service  demand by combining historical and context -sensitive data from multiple sources ( e.g. weather , mobile ,  big data ) to allow for a strategic deployment of vehicles or other productive assets (OECD, 2019 [2]).    Box 1. AI in r oad safety   Road -safety is one example of AI’s potential to solve complex challenges  when it is developed and  used in a trustworthy way. Each year, about 1.35 million people are killed in car crashes and 50 million  are seriously injured  (World Health Organisation, 2018 [3]). Speeding, distractions, impaired driving  and  not wearing a seatbelt are the top causes of automotive deaths. High -visibility traffic enforcement –  such as officers in marked cars  – can improve behaviour on the road . Drivers often put away their  phones, pu t on their seatbelts  and drive slower in their presence (Mohn, 2022 [4]). But it is not possible   for officers to patrol every road all the time.   Technological advancements in  AI, including machine learning, are being harnessed to enhance road  safety around the world. For example, intelligent speed -assistance technology, which uses AI to  manage a car’s speed via in -vehicle cameras and maps, became mandatory in all new vehicles in the  EU as of July 2022.   In Barcelona, Spain, a tr ial used computer vision technology on city buses to map hotspots where  accident risks were highest (International Transport Forum, 2021 [5]). AI scan s raw video feeds for road  layouts, positions of pedestrians and vehicles, stre etlights  and speeds. Where precise, long -term and  relevant data exist, AI systems identify dangerous locations to reduce the risk of future accidents. In  Australia, companies are coupling high-resolution imaging with machine learning to identify dangerous  driving behaviours. In addition to monitoring vehicle speed, algorithms can determine with high  probability whether a particular driver is engaged in risky behaviour ; for example, assess ing if the driver  is looking down to text someone or is holding someth ing besides the wheel. In the first two years of the  pilot, fatalities decreased 22%  and handheld phone use while driving decreased 80% (Mohn, 2022 [4]).  Looking forward, the potential of self -driving vehicles to enhance road sa fety is being studied and tested  in several countries. In the US, 94% of traffic crashes were attributed to human error (National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration, 2015 [6]). By reducing the risk of human error, self-driving vehicles could  significantly reduce the risk of automotive crashes .   In manu facturing, AI is being leveraged to create digital twins , i.e. digital representation s of a physical  object s or systems, which simulate different scenarios and predic t outcomes to inform decisions. Digital  twins can optimise the quality of manual production tasks, provide real-time training  and perform predictive  maintenance and repairs with min imum downtime . AI   However, the benefits of AI -enabled technologies are acc ompanied by real risks.  For example, what will  happen to truck, ride -hailing  and delivery drivers  if we switch to self -driving vehicles at scale? What are  the implications of facial -recognition systems that detect the attention  and emotion  of drivers ?  How can  we safeguard privacy when vehicles with self -driving capabilities  generate and transmit flood s of data ? 
HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   7  OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    How can we avoid discrimination against protected groups  in services like car insurance  and ensure  transparency and explainability ? How can we g uarantee the robustness, security  and safety  of vehicles  with self -driving capabilities ?   AI brings opportunities and risks in all sectors, including those with traditionally high women participation  such as education, healthcare and customer service .1 Unchecked AI can create dangers and misalignment  with human and democratic values: discrimination  through the automation or amplification of biases ;  polarisation of opinions ; upheaval in job markets with the automation of tasks ; privacy infringement ;  widespre ad surveillance ; and  the concentration of power. We must leverage AI opportunities and address  AI risks in a timely manner to ensure AI is beneficial for people and planet. In addition, because AI is global  and impacts everyone  and because AI developments outpace policy , the development and use of AI call  for a coordinated policy response based on international, multi -disciplinary  and multi -stakeholder co operation.   Virtual worlds offer real benefits and costs   As a general -purpose  technology, AI enable s and support s other emerging technologies, such as   immersive virtual environments , referred to as “virtual worlds”  and the  “metaverse ”, a concept popularised  by Neal  Stephenson ’s science fiction novel Snow Crash  (Stephenson, 1992 [7]). Today, these i mmersive  environments  are based on a ugmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR ), mixed reality (MR)  and other  extended realit y (XR) technologies that enhance  the realism of virtual experiences , blurring the lines  between the physical and digital worlds. They  also increasingly rely on AI-enabled  prediction and  personalisation, interaction support, speech recognition  and language  translation  and low-latency  connectivity to augment the immersive experience .   Immersive environments combine features of the physical and virtual world : they provide realistic  experiences  important for communication ( e.g. in education) and experimentation ( e.g. in medicine) with  the comfort, safety  and the cost- and time -saving  value of not having to travel . They are viewed as  promising to support advances in education, healthcare, manufacturing, banking, marketing  and  entertainment (Verizon, 2022 [8]; Healthcare Insights, 2022 [9]). In education, they can help develop dynamic,  safe and remote learning environments for students and professionals and deliver realistic environments  to support learning and distance education  (Melchor -Couto, 2019 [10]). These virtual worlds can be  consumer -oriented , entertainment -oriented , corporate , industrial , or private  and likely to inter -connect.   However, immersive environments create challenges.  By providing hyper -realistic experiences, where  virtual sensations can seem real (including using  tactile or haptic devices), immersive technologies could  further exacerbate issues like online addiction , discrimination , cyber -bullying , assaults and abuse s and  inappropriate or illegal content . These concerns and broader challenges raise q uestions about the  applicability of prior experience in  accountability and user -protection from the governance of the Internet  and emerging technologies  in general .   In addition, immersive environments promise to generate significant economic activity as marketplac es  where people  use virtual avatars  to buy virtual real estate, services, cloth ing, or artwork that have real world value. This raises issues pertaining to intellectual property rights, taxation  and money laundering.  With physical reality transposed to the  virtual world, developers, deployers , regulators  and users must  understand and address  existing and  emerging challenges , recalling that human motivations are being  replicated in a virtual world – and with them , their biases and aggressive behaviours. Thes e must be  prevented  and mitigated  and actors in  physical and immersive spaces should be held accountable  according to their roles . Ongoing  efforts to establish governance frameworks for immersive environments  includ e the Defining and Building the Metaverse  multistakeholder initiative by the World Economic Forum   (WEF)  and efforts by the (“eXtended Reality ”) XR Association  and the Metaverse Standards Forum .

Policies in these areas are key to building  an enabling ecosystem where governments  and citizens can enjoy the ir benefits .  Data access , sharin g and governance   Access to and sharing of data are critical to enabl e AI’s benefits across sectors . Policies must  encourage  data access  and sharing while addressing associated risks , for countries to harness the full potential . There  are concerns about the concentration  of technology and financial resources in the hands of few companies  and nations , reflected in the control of large data sets and computational power to process them. This has  follow -on costs to societies in “winner -takes -most” market s, including slowing productivity and growing  gaps in AI adoption between large companies and SMEs  and between large companies and the public  sector . At the same time, there are tangible reasons for companies’ reluctance to share data. In addition,  some large firms proactively contribut e to large public datasets and to improv ing AI data quality  for public  use.   In many countries , more efforts are needed to reduce siloes in data  governance , despite growing efforts  to govern data across policy domains , like competition and trade  and across sectors, like science,  healthcare and public administration. As data fuel AI across a range of economic and social activities in  the private and public sector s, data governance is becoming pervasive across policy domains  and requires  coordinated, whole -of-government approaches, while remaining sensitive to specific contexts.  
HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   9  OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    Yet in many countries , policymakers and regulators face difficulties finding common definitions and  common ground in discussions, co -operation and c oordination on data governance , at national and  international level s. They  focus on aspects relevant to their polic y domains and jurisdiction . Agreeing upon  common approaches and aligning efforts across borders will play a role in the responsible use of da ta and  AI across sectors and borders (OECD, forthcoming [18])  Therefore, data should  be governed to maximise its benefits while addressing risks and challenges,  including protecting the rights of individuals and organisations . This requires comprehensive policy to  address c ross-cutting  challenges , while account ing for  the specificities of data governance in domains  like  trade or competition  (OECD, forthcoming [19]). These include:    Balancing the trade -offs between data openness and control . The more openly data is  accessed, shared and re -used (for example , with open data ), the higher its potential social and  economic benefits, but also the greater the associated risks.    Addressing potentially conf licting interests and regulations . Data collected and used to inform  AI systems are often (co -)created by the interaction of many  stakeholders in the global data  ecosystem , in some cases without the m being  aware.  Facilitating data access and sharing for AI   requires disentangling and reconciling these interests and data -governance frameworks.    Aligning incentives for investment in data and its re-use. While the marginal costs of  transmitting, copying  and processing data can be close to zero, substantial inve stment is often  required to generate and collect data  and enable data sharing and re -use for AI. Fair distribution  of the benefits from data can help address incentive challenges.   Machine learning models and techniques   AI and emerging technolog ies use machine learning models and techniques  to learn in an automated  manner through patterns and inferences rather than explicit instructions from a human. Machine learning  approaches teach machines to reach an outcome by showing them many examples of correct out comes.  However, they can also define a set of rules and let the system  learn by trial and error. Machine learning  contains techniques that have been used by economists, researchers  and technologists for decades   (ranging from linear and logistic regressions  to decision trees and princip al component analysis ), but also  more recent technological developments including  deep neural networks  (OECD, 2019 [13]).  Machine learning models and techniques are  key to the expansion of AI and emerging technologie s. They  have  led to significant  progress in research areas such as natural language processing, computer vision   and robotics.   Connectivity  extension and enhancement   Connectivity allows the transfer of large volu mes of data in real or quasi -real time, while computing  infrastructure (hardware and software) executes the mathematical operations needed to calibrate or "train"  an A I system  and infer its results (OECD, forthcoming [20]). The combination of high-quality  connectivity,  data, computing infrastructure  and AI technologies  continues to enable  innovative and disruptive new  services.   High-quality  connectivity is characterised by  features such as high speed and responsiveness ( i.e. low  latency, or delay introduced by the network ) and reliability. High -speed connectivity enables richer and  more interactive applications with ultra -high-definition  video, holograms  and augmented and virtual reality  applications. People are expected to s oon be able to gather for live events such as sports and concerts  virtually, with 360-degree views from anywhere they wish.   In addition, responsive  and reliable connectivity play  a role in enabling tactile  digital environments , where   people interact virtually with each other and the environment. This is critical to allow autonomous or semi -
10  HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    autonomous systems like vehicles, drones  and robots to respond immediately to c hanges in their  environment. Responsive and reliable connectivity  supports extremely delay -sensitive  applications such  as tele -surgery that , combined with AI image recognition, can maximise the efficien cy of medical resources  and allow the best medical services to be provided in rural areas.   This enhanced  connectivity is m ade possible by next -generation mobile networks like 5G (and eventually  6G) and fixed networks like fibre, capable of speeds of gigabits per second, latencies as low as 1  millisecond  and “hyper -connectivity ” by a massive myriad of devices . Evidence shows  that operators are  increasingly investing in these high-quality  connectivity technologies  and AI to manage cutting -edge  networks more efficiently and offer end -user services . OECD broadband data (Figure  1) shows that  the  share of gigabit fixed broadband offers ( i.e. broadband with speeds above 1 gigabit per second ) across  the OECD grew  by more than half,  from 2.6% at the end of 2019 to 4% by December 2020  (OECD, 2022 [11])  Figure  1. Fixed broadband subscriptions by speed tiers , 2019 -2020  The average share of fixed broadband subscriptions with speeds above 1 Gbps   increased by more than 53% across the OECD.     Note: Simple average of countries where data was available ( i.e. 35 out of 38 OECD countries).   Source:  (OECD, 2022 [21]).   Despite these developments , high-quality  networks require continued investment to face increasing  demand and p rovide ubiquitous coverage. In Europe, the funding gap to meet the 2025 Digital Agenda  and Gigabit Strategy  objectives  is projected at EUR 384 billion (USD 453 billion), of which 66% would  require public policy intervention (European Investment Bank, 2018 [22]; OECD, 2021 [23]).  The 2021 OECD Recommendation on Broadband Connectivity  (OECD, 2021 [15]) is a policy and regulatory  roadmap  that puts forward principles to extend connectivity and enhance the quality of broadband  networks. It complements  G20 Guidelines for Financing and Fostering High -Quality Broadband  Connectivity for a Digital World  (G20/OECD, 2021 [24]), developed with  OECD  support . These instruments  highlight the importan ce of policies that favour the deployment of resilient networks  that can ensure  highquality communication services in cases of power outages, natural disasters , or other disrupti ons.   Expansion  of computation al power   Computation is critical to the development of AI and emerging technologies . Policymakers  have begun to  realise the strategic importance of specialised AI compute . Since 2010, the prominence of a type of AI  known as deep neural network d ramatically increased the size of machine learning systems and  consequently their compute demands. Satisfying this demand was partially enabled by transitioning from  
HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   11  OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    general -purpose processors, such as Central Processing Units (CPUs), to specialised proces sors that  support more efficient compute execution,  i.e. require less energy and time per computation. Today,  machine learning systems predominantly train on specialised processors optimised for operations  commonly used in, but not limited to, machine lear ning. These processors include Graphics Processing  Units (GPUs), Tensor Processing Units (TPUs)  and Neural Processing Units (NPUs). Executing such AI  workloads (e.g. training machine learning systems ) on general -purpose hardware is less efficient.    Access to AI compute is necessary to advance and diffuse AI. Ensuring countries have sufficient AI  compute to meet their needs is critical to captur ing AI’s full economic potential.  Yet the hardware, software   and related compute infrastructure that make AI  advancements possible receive less  attention in policy  circles than other enablers , like data . Policymakers  have begun to pay attention to the risk of an  “AI  compute divide” growing both within countries – for example between the private sector and academ ia  (Ahmed and Wahed, 2020 [25]) – and between countries – for example between developing and developed  nations. A comput e divide  risks creating gaps between those who have the resources to develop and tr ain  the large -scale AI models that lead to competitive advantage, inclusive growth  and productivity gains in a  global digital economy  and those who do not. It requires a measurement framework for national AI  compute .   Investing in infrastructure and hardwa re purpose -built for AI is challenging given complex supply chains,  as illustrated by recent shortages in the semiconductor industry (Khan, Mann and Peterson, 2021 [26]).  Semiconductors, also known as i ntegrated circuits or computer chips are the “brains of modern electronic  equipment, storing information and performing the logic operations that enable devices such as  smartphones, computers  and servers to operate”, which are critical for the development and use of AI  systems (OECD, 2019 [27]). In any electronic device, there can be multiple semiconductors fulfilling specific  functions, such as CPUs or chips sp ecifically designed for power management, memory, graphics  and  more.   Demands on semiconductor supply chains have grown, especially as digital and AI -enabled technologies  have become more commonplace, including in  Internet -of-Things (IoT) devices, smart en ergy grids  and  self-driving and electric vehicles. The semiconductor supply chain is also concentrated , with the top five  companies representing half of global revenue in 2018 (OECD, 2019 [27]), making it vulnerable to s upply side market shocks . Leaders have associated semi -conductor  supply shortages to reduced activity in some  industries  and result ing cost and inflationary pressures  (OECD, 2021 [28]).   The growing computational needs of AI systems are  also raising sustainability concerns. At the same time,  higher computational power could result in efficiency gains and reduced energy consumption in some  sectors. The environmental impacts of AI compute and applications should be further measu red and  understood  (OECD, 2022 [29]).   Building trustworthy AI and emerging technologies   Rapid developments in AI make it difficult for policymakers, regulators  and other governance bodies to  keep pace and implement forward -looking policies and governance frameworks that enhance  potential and  mitigate risks. General -purpose technologies of global application  like AI cannot be realised and governed  by a single country  or economic actor. The computational infrastructure, skills and data needed to develop   and deploy a single AI system often cross jurisdictional borders. Therefore, i nternational, multi -disciplinary  and multi -stakeholder co -operation and coordination are n eeded to ensure  that AI innovations improve the  well-being of people in areas such as  education, public safety, health and work -life balance . Restrictive  policies affecting cross -border data, skills  and technology flows might  limit the development and upta ke of  AI systems. Taking a balanced approach to promoting AI and the benefits of emerging technology for  innovation and well -being gains while managing  risks is key. The opportunity costs of not using  technologies like AI where they can provide benefits an d insights  must also be considered . In this regard, 
12  HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    risk-based approaches are being proposed by players like the US National Institute of Standards and  Technology (NIST)  and regulatory initiatives like the EU AI Act.   Shaping  a common understanding  of trust worthy AI  and emerging technologies   The OECD AI Principles provide a common denominator for AI governance  (OECD, 2019 [16]). They define  AI as:  a machine -based system that is capable of influencing the environment by producing an output (predictions,  recommendations or decisions) for a given set of objectives. It uses machine and/or human -based data and  inputs to (i) perceive real and/or virtual environments; (ii) abstract these perceptions into models t hrough  analysis in an automated manner ( e.g. with machine learning), or manually; and (iii) use model inference to  formulate options for outcomes. AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy  (OECD,  2019 [30]).   By adopting the OECD AI Principles , countries  agree d to a common set of priorities to promote and harness  the power of trustworthy AI, namely that AI systems: (1)  benefit people and the planet ; (2) respect  democratic values and human rights, includin g privacy and fairness; (3) be transparent and explainable;  (4) be robust, secure  and safe; and (5) hold AI actors accountable for their proper functioning .   Subscribing countries  also agreed to use  risk-based approaches to govern AI, with policies and standards  that treat different AI applications differently depending on the risks they pose. The OECD’s classification  framework  (Figure  2) allows users to focus  on the specific risks of an AI application  based on its technical  characteristics ( e.g. risks to safety and privacy in the case of autonomous vehicles ). This user -friendly  framework – based on an AI system’s characteristics and policy implications – facilitat es a more nuanced  and precise policy debate .  Figure  2. OECD Framework for the Classification of AI Systems     Source: (OECD, 2022 [12]).  The framework can help develop policies and regulations by providing a baseline to advance  understanding of AI based on system characteristics. This, in turn, informs registries or inventories of AI  systems; nuanced, sector -specific approaches to implement the AI Principles, such as  in transportation,  healthcare , or finance; and the development of risk assessments and incident reporting mechanisms that  are interoperable across jurisdictions.  As AI knows no bor ders and many actors operate internationally,  the OECD is  using this classification to facilitate interoperability across co untries in assessing risk  alongside national and international experts and stakeholders , including standards bodies.   
HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   13  OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    Building and e xchanging knowledge about national AI and emerging technology  strategies and initiatives   National strategies and policies that focus specifically on AI are a relatively new phenomenon that Canada   began  in 2017. Today, AI strategies and policies are found in over 60 countries . National strategies should  build on lessons around a shared understanding of AI, building data -protection frameworks and investing  in connectivity.  The OECD.AI  Policy Observatory’s database of national AI policies and strategies  from the  countries  can provide information and inspiration to design, implement and consult on countries’ AI policies  and strategies , as underlined in the sections below . The OECD also collects case studies  and conducts  analysis on how governments can use AI to design and deliver better policies and services, which feed  into the efforts of the Policy Observatory. National AI strategies and policies can help implement the OECD  AI Principles and harness the power of AI. National strategies reflect a country’s vision, context and  priorities in AI. The national priorities of  most countries with an AI strategy can be mapped broadly to five  recommendations to governments inc luded in the OECD AI Principles. Examples  of how countries are  implementing these recommendations to harness the power of AI  are listed belo w.2  Invest ment  in research and development    Countries are funding national AI -related research institutes and projects through grants; consolidating AI  research networks and collaborative platforms; prioritising AI investments in specific sectors; pursuing AI related mission -oriented innovation policies; and procuring AI systems for the public sector. Budgets for AI  R&D vary across countries.  Since 2020 , the United States dedicates USD 1 billion or more annually to  non-defence AI R&D  and created national AI research institutes. The EU Horizon 2020 programme  committed EUR 1.5 billion to AI research over two years an d expected an additional  EUR 20 billion in 2020  from the private sector and member states , with the Horizon Europe programme continuing these efforts.   Digital ecosystem s  As measured by the OECD Open, Useful and Re -usable data (OURdata) Index (OECD, 2020 [31]), open  access to public -sector data continues to be a priority as national data strategies focus on AI to foster a  robust digital ecosystem. Policies to promote acce ss to public data (including open g overnment data) and  initiatives that enable private -sector data  sharing include data trusts, data dams  and data spaces. Several  countries have centralised , open -government data platforms , such as anonymised government hea lth  records and satellite data (e.g. Chile, Norway, Portugal, Spain  and the US) (OECD, 2021 [32]). Others , like  the UK and the EU are looking for ways to incentivise data  sharing by the private sector . Korea plans to  incentivise data s haring by the private sector by estimating and pricing data value and rewarding its  sharing . Most  national AI strategies also recognise the importance of trustworthy AI in the public sector  and the need to build upon and inform smart city strategies  (OECD, 2020 [1]).  Alongside data , machine learning models  and connectivity , AI computing capacity has emerged as a n  enabler for AI and economic growth and competitiveness. National policies (e.g. EU, UK) prioritise  investments i n high -performance computing and cloud computing to increase AI development and use ,  alongside the development of domestic semiconductor manufacturing capacity .   At the same time, countries are becoming  aware of the high energy consumed by large computatio nal  infrastructure. Alternatives , such as the use of clean energies and more efficient algorithm s, are be ing  explored. Conversely, the role of AI in clean and secure energy systems has been highlighted in  international discussions. As noted above, connecti vity is a key element of the AI ecosystem , with high capacity, broad -coverage networking being critical to AI innovation , deployment  and operation .  
14  HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    Enabling  policy environment s  AI-related legislative proposals are gaining traction in many countries, with particularly strong momentum  in heavyweights like the EU, the US, the People’s Republic of China  and Brazil. Policymakers  are  developing governance and accountability frameworks such as the proposed US Algorithmic Accountability  Act and the EU AI Act.  Existing laws are also being re -interpreted in an AI context, like workplace rule  regarding  hiring , performance management , training  and lay-offs, with rulings in the US and other co untries   (Salvi, Wyckoff and Vourc’h, 2022 [33]).  The focus is not only on legislation, which requires thoughtful preparation to stand the test of time against   a rapidly evolving technology like AI. Governments and other stakeholders are using various  policy  instruments  – particularly  standards . The NIST was directed by the US Congress to develop a risk  management framework and issued a second draft framework for comment in August 2022  (NIST,  2022 [34]). The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) and the European Committee for  Electrotechnical Standardization (CENELEC) received a draft request by the European Commission  in  May 2022 to create AI standardisation initiativ es with a view to harmoni sing standards by the time the  proposed EU AI Act regulation is applicable (planned late  2024/ early  2025 ).3   Policymakers  and market actors are establishing regulatory -experimentation ecosystems to test AI in  controlled environment s, such as sunset provisions, innovation test beds,  policy prototyping, innovation  hubs, regulatory  beaches  and sandboxes . These initiatives aim to improve conditions for AI to strive and   scale up, remov e market barriers  to AI adoption by businesses  and enabl e a feedback loop for  the fine tuning of regulation . AI regulatory sandboxes  are a way to generate much -needed evidence to inform  public policies , with firms benefiting from a waiver from liability to test projects in a controlled environment  under r egulatory supervision  or to co-create, prototype  and test specific policies . AI regulatory sandboxes   can also be established by private or m ultistakeholder initiatives .   Other policy initiatives include  designing participatory processes and public consultations on AI strategies  (e.g. Chile); connecting emerging companies with business opportunities through networking and  collaborative  platforms  (e.g. Canada, Colombia, Germany, Slovenia ); providing tailored advice to support  businesses as they scale up (e.g. Germany, Finland, AI4EU ); and improving companies’ access to funding ,  including for SMEs (e.g. UK, Türkiye , Brazil ) (OECD, 2021 [35]). The development and uptake of trustworthy  AI need s to encompass companies of all siz es and most governments recognise that  SMEs m ight require  additional support and guidance.   Human capacity and labour market transformation   Policymakers  are establishing education p rogrammes related to AI , including:  developing  vocational  training and lifelong learning  programmes  in AI-related fields  to help citizens keep up with tech nological  and societal changes ; providing financial and non -financial support to retrain and attract top AI talent ,  including migration quotas and new visa routes ; fostering academic partnerships between public and  private AI research institutions ; using AI to match people to jobs based  on skills ; and monitoring the impact  of AI on the labour market for policy intervention .   Regulating the use of AI in recruitment and hiring , which could reinforce or augment existing biases , is  being considered  in some jurisdictions , such as in the proposed EU AI Act .  International co -operation   Many countries are engaged in international co -operation for AI , which is  taking place in fora including the   Trade and Technology Council (TTC), the  Council of Europe  (CoE) , the EU, the G7  and G20, the Global  Partnership on AI (GPAI), the Global Privacy Assembly  (GPA), the Ibero -American Data Protection  Network  (RIPD) , the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the International Telecommunications  Union (ITU ), the UN, UNESCO  and the World Bank. Co-operation on AI research is also a priority.  
HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   15  OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    Creating a n evidence base to understand AI and emerging technologies   Timelier and b etter evidence  is needed on AI-related trends and developments to understand the impact  of technologies  and design  policies across domains, industries  and Sustainable Development Goals  (SDGs ). Evidence should be reliable and representative  and allow  benchmarking. For example , gauging  the diffusion and use of AI in a particular industry can help understand its impact on the quantity and quality  of jobs  and skill gaps in its workforce.  Policymakers  need timely data to stay apace of rapid developments  in AI and ground policy in evidence. I nteractive visualisations on OECD.AI  show trends and developments  by country and over time from different vantage points, from research , to jobs , skills,  investment, open source  software development  and education. The d ata confir m that AI development is booming , with 900%  growth  in open -source  software development in only five years.4 Social and gender gaps should also be  considered . For example, the share of women authoring or co -authoring AI publications is below 20%  in  most countries .5   Better evidence -gathering tools6 are needed to make informed decisions about how to g overn AI, including  what types or use cases to regulate, but also why, when  and how to incentivise certain behaviours.  Policymakers would benefit from evidence  on the types , applications  and characteristics  of AI system s that  have caused – or nearly caused  – harm to people , societies , or the environment , such as risks that  materialised into “AI incidents”. Relevant  characteristics include specifics about the data, model, task  and  context  of AI systems involved.  The OECD  and partner organisations  are developing a global AI Incidents  Tracker  to collect information from around  the world. T racking AI incidents would  facilitate identif ying AI  applications  that have caused harm , understanding their impacts and the causes of failure , to prevent  harms  from recurring and inform AI risk assessments and regulatory choices .  Developing and sharing tools for trustworthiness   In addition to evidence, AI practitioners and policymakers  need tools and educational approaches to  develop technologies consistent with OECD AI  Principles . While  tools are available , it is often difficult to  find them and even more difficult to know which are most effective in each  context . This could be resolved  with a  one-stop, open, interactive shop to compare tools that detect and remove biases from an AI system,  or standards to promote AI accountability in a sector.   Implementing trustworthy AI and emerging technologies  requires strong, structure d and continuous  engagement between companies and policymakers , given the rapid pace and technical  complexity of AI  developments.  Corporate governance standards and sector -specific codes of conduct can be useful  guidance . Private sector -led initiatives to embed trustworthy AI principles across business sectors and  verticals  are also valuable .  In additi on, because AI knows no borders and many actors operate internationally, companies could  benefit from government -endorsed international due diligence guidance  to identify and address possible  negative impacts that their operations and products could  have . This includes engag ing stakeholders from  government, labour , affected communities  and civil society. This guidance and related research can be  part of a larger suite of tools for policymakers  to support accountability for AI.  The OECD is working  to  leverag e the OECD Multinational Enterprise (MNE) G uidelines and accompanying Due Diligence  Guidance for responsible business conduct for AI systems.   Leveraging the policy cycle to enable governance of emerging technologies    The policy cycle provides a starting p oint for the governance of emerging technologies.  Building on the  experience of more mature digital technologies  such as AI , the policy cycle for emerging tech nologies   includes four components  (Figure  3): 
16  HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS     Policy design , including developing a national roadmap or strategy for the use and governance of  a specific technology; conducting public consultations to raise awareness and promote social   dialogue; designing a governance approach to co -ordinate policy implementation and oversight  (e.g. assigning oversight to an existing ministry or creating an independent body); and exploring  regulatory and non -regulatory approaches, going from voluntary f rameworks, to soft law, regulatory  experimentation  and hard law or outright bans.    Policy implementation , including identifying challenges and good practices in areas commonly  outlined in internationally agreed principles7, such as promoting inclusive growt h and sustainable  development; investing in R&D; fostering a digital ecosystem through competition and innovation;  shaping an enabling policy environment, including via regulatory experimentation; and building  human capacity to prepare for labour market tr ansformation.    Policy evaluation , including issuing regular reports highlighting milestones, accomplishments  and  lessons learned; establishing national observatories to monitor policy implementation; and  establishing key performance indicators to measure p rogress with respect to specific targets ( e.g.  budget, skills, jobs, scholarships, research publications and patents, etc.)    International and multi -stakeholder co -operation , including participating in and sharing good  practices and lessons through fora lik e the OECD, the UN, the G7 and G20  and other international  and intergovernmental organisations and multistakeholder groups. Cross -border co -operation in  research is especially important for the governance of emerging technology, as is the involvement  of na tional and international standardisation bodies to foster interoperability.   Figure  3. The emerging tech policy cycle     Source: Adapted from (OECD, 2021 [35])  Conclusion : Multilateral co -operation to evolve with a changing context   AI is permeating economies, societies , governments  and the environment, bringing tremendous  opportunities but also risks.  If appropriate safe guards are not in place, AI -enabled technologies , immersive  tech and other next -generation computing technologies could inherit and widen the risks.   To harness the power of AI, policymakers  can leverage and build upon the consensus -based OECD AI  Principles, their definition of AI, the OECD f ramework for classifying AI systems  and the Cat alogue of Tools  for Trustworthy AI .  
HARNESSING THE POWER  OF AI AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES   17  OECD DIGITAL ECONOMY PAPE RS    Emerging  technologies pose new challenges, but lessons can be learned from policy development  processes  designed for other technologies , including new approaches to regulatory experimentation .  Technological innovations – such as immersive technologies  – will continue to arise and impact our  economies and societies, in both positive and not so positive ways. Research, sharing good practice s and  develop ing effective  tools for accountability are crucial.   Several frameworks developed by the OECD can help policymakers evaluate risks and pilot policy and  governance approaches before implementing them  at scale. The OECD ’s longstanding expertise on digital  technologies and its multi -stakeholder approa ch are well-placed to support countries building on the  lessons to date in technology governance and applying them to emerging technologies . AI and emerging  technologies are moving fast  and so should governments. Policymakers  must act now to ensure people  and planet benefit from the opportunities at hand .
