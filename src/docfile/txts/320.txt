FOC Joint Statement on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights     1           November 2020         FOC Joint Statement on  Artificial    Intelligence and Human Rights        
FOC Joint Statement on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights     2    November 2020  FOC Joint Statement on  Artificial     Intelligence and Human Rights      The issue      The Freedom Online Coalition (FOC) is a group of 32 countries deeply committed to the promotion  and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms both offline and online. We are committed  to working together to support Internet freedom and human rights for individuals worldwide –  including  the freedoms of expression, association, peaceful assembly, and privacy rights.   The FOC acknowledges that artificial intelligence (AI) systems1 offer unprecedented opportunities for  human development and innovation, with the potential to generate social and economic benefits and  help protect and promote human rights and fundamental freedoms. When developed and used in full  respect of human rights, AI systems can complement human endeavours across fields such as public  and precision health and environmenta l science to improve people’s lives and support the UN  Sustainable Development Goals. States play a critical role in promoting these benefits for all.   As is considered with other digital technologies, AI systems can also be developed or used in ways  that p ose significant risks to human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The FOC is particularly  concerned by the documented and ongoing use of AI systems for repressive and authoritarian  purposes, including through remote biometric identification (RBI) such  as facial recognition  technology,2 as well as automated content moderation. Some states use these AI systems, often by  leveraging private sector tools, to facilitate and/or mandate arbitrary or unlawful surveillance  practices, and censorship practices, t hat are in violation of international human rights law. The  application of AI systems towards repressive and authoritarian purposes can further enable and scale  human rights violations and abuses.    The use of RBI and automated content moderation, especiall y when used by states in an unlawful or  arbitrary manner, can threaten the enjoyment of human rights, including the right to equal protection  of the law without discrimination and privacy rights. In particular, the use of RBI for repressive and  authoritari an purposes threatens the enjoyment of the rights to freedom of religion or belief,     1 The OECD defines an AI system as “a machine -based system that can, for a given set of human -defined objectives, make  predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments. AI systems are designed to operate with  varying levels  of autonomy.” OECD Legal Instruments, Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence , May 21, 2019.  https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD -LEGAL -0449     2 Remote biometric identification (RBI) relies on biometric information (e.g.  facial images, iris scans, gait analysis) and can give  governments the ability “to ascertain the  identity (1) of multiple people, (2) at a distance, (3) in public space, (4) absent notice  and consent, and (5) in a continuous and on -going manner. ” Laura K.

Likewise, the use of automated  content  moderation for repressive and authoritarian purposes further threatens the enjoyment of the  right to freedom of expression, including the freedom to seek, receive and impart information of all  kinds, and the freedom to hold opinions without interference. This may result in a chilling effect on  the right of p eaceful assembly and on freedom of expression in online spaces, as well as undermine  the integrity of democratic electoral processes.   The use and deployment of AI systems in ways that violate human rights, and particularly for  repressive and authoritarian purposes, threatens online and offline democratic and civic spaces,  including political dissent and the important work of journalists and other media workers, human  rights defenders, and members of civil society worldwide. This may also furth er marginalize and   oppress persons or groups, such as women and members of ethnic, religious and other minority  communities that already face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.    As a first step towards the promotion and protection of human rights, states and the private sector  should endeavour to promote and increase transparency, traceability, and accountability in the design,  development, procurement, and use of AI systems, with appropriate protections for intellectual  property. This can h elp reduce the opacity, inscrutability, and unpredictability of some AI systems and  help stakeholders better understand how semi -autonomous AI systems make decisions. The  governance, development, and application of AI systems that are grounded in respect f or human  rights will promote public trust to the benefit of humanity in the long -term.   The FOC reaffirms that states must abide by their obligations under international human rights law to  ensure that human rights are fully respected and protected. As also  noted in the UN Guiding Principles  on Business and Human Rights , “States must protect against human rights abuse within their territory  and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including business enterprises.”3 We welcome multi -stakeholder  attention to this  issue in international fora.                               3 United Nations, Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights , 2011.  https://www.ohchr.org/documents/publications/guidingprinciplesbusinesshr_en.pdf    
FOC Joint Statement on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights     4 Call to action      To promote respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law in the design, development,  procurement, and use of AI systems, the FOC calls on states to work towards the following actions in  collaboration with the private sector, civil society, academia, and all other relevant stakeholders:   • States should take action to oppose and refrain from the use of AI systems for repressive and  authoritarian purposes, including the targeting of or discrimination against persons and  communities in vulnerable and marginalized positions and human rights defenders, in  violation of international human rights law.     • States should refrain from arbitrary or unlawful interference in the operat ions of online  platforms, including those using AI systems. States have a responsibility to ensure that any  measures affecting online platforms, including counter -terrorism and national security  legislation, are consistent with international law, including  international human rights law.  States should refrain from restrictions on the right to freedom of opinion and expression,  including in relation to political dissent and the work of journalists, civil society, and human  rights defenders, except when such restrictions are in accordance with international law,  particularly international human rights law.      • States should promote international multi -stakeholder engagement in the development of  relevant norms, rules, and standards for the development, procureme nt, use, certification, and  governance of AI systems that, at a minimum, are consistent with international human rights  law. States should welcome input from a broad and geographically representative group of  states and stakeholders.       • States need to ensu re the design, development and use of AI systems in the public sector is  conducted in accordance with their international human rights obligations. States should  respect their commitments and ensure that any interference with human rights is consistent  with international law.      • States, and any private sector or civil society actors working with them or on their behalf,  should protect human rights when procuring, developing and using AI systems in the public  sector, through the adoption of processes such as due diligence and impact assessments, that  are made transparent wherever possible. These processes should provide an opportunity for  all stakeholders, particularly those who face disproportionate negative impacts, to provide  input. AI impact assessments sh ould, at a minimum, consider the risks to human rights posed  by the use of AI systems, and be continuously evaluated before deployment and throughout  the system’s lifecycle to account for unintended and/or unforeseen outcomes with respect to  human rights. States need to provide an effective remedy against alleged human rights  violations.     • States should encourage the private sector to observe principles and practices of responsible  business conduct (RBC) in the use of AI systems throughout their operations and supply and  value chains, in a consistent manner and across all contexts. By incorp orating RBC, companies  are better equipped to manage risks, identify and resolve issues proactively, and adapt  operations accordingly for long -term success. RBC activities of both states and the private

These may include national AI and data strategies, human  rights codes, privacy laws, data protection measures, responsible business practices, and other  measures that may protect the interests of persons or groups facing multiple and intersecting  forms of discrimination. National measures should take into consideration such guidance  provided by human rights treaty bodies and international initiatives, such as human -centered  values identified in the OECD Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence ,5 which  was also endorsed by the G20 AI Principles.6 States should promote the meaningful inclusion  of persons or groups who can be disproportionately and negativ ely impacted, as well as civil  society and academia, in determining if and how AI systems should be used in different  contexts (weighing potential benefits against potential human rights impacts and developing  adequate safeguards).     • States should promote, and where appropriate, support efforts by the private sector, civil  society, and all other relevant stakeholders to increase transparency and accountability related  to the use of AI systems, including through approaches that strongly encourage the sharing of  information between stakeholders, on topics such as the following:    o user privacy, including the use of user data to refine AI systems, the sharing of data  collected through AI systems with third parties, and if reasonable, how to opt -out of  the collecti on, sharing, or use of user -generated data   o the automated moderation of user generated content including, but not limited to,  the removal, downranking, flagging, and demonetization of content   o recourse or appeal mechanisms, when content is removed as the res ult of an  automated decision   o oversight mechanisms, such as human monitoring for potential human rights impacts   • States, as well as the private sector, should work towards increased transparency, which could  include providing access to appropriate data and i nformation for the benefit of civil society  and academia, while safeguarding privacy and intellectual property, in order to facilitate  collaborative and independent research into AI systems and their potential impacts on human  rights, such as identifying, preventing, and mitigating bias in the development and use of AI  systems.     • States should foster education about AI systems and possible impacts on human rights  among the public and stakeholders, including product developers and policy -makers. States  should work to promote access to basic knowledge of AI systems for all.       4 OECD, Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises,  2011.   http://mneguidelines.oecd.org/guidelines/     5 OECD, Recommendation of the Council on Artificial Intelligence , May 21, 2019.  https://legalinstruments.oecd.org/en/instruments/OECD -LEGAL -0449     6 “G20 Ministerial Statement on Trade and Digital Economy - Annex, G20 AI Principles,” June 9, 2019.  https://www.mofa.go.jp/files/000486596.pdf    
FOC Joint Statement on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights     6                                                                                                   www.freedomonlinecoalition.com         twitter.com/FO_Coalition      Freedom Online Coalition Background     The FOC is a multilateral coalition of 3 2 governments that collaborate to advance Internet freedom  worldwide. The Coalition provides a forum for like -minded governments to coordinate efforts and  work with civil society , the private sector, and other Internet stakeholders to support the ability of  individuals to exercise their human rights and fundamental freedoms online. The FOC invites all  states that support an open and interoperable Internet to apply to join the FOC.      The mission and vision of the FOC are founded upon the notion that the same rights that people  have offline must also be protected online; a pioneering notion originally outlined in the founding  FOC Hague Declaration, reaffirmed in the Nairobi Terms of Reference , Tallinn Agenda and San José  Statement, and further confirmed in UN Human Rights Council resolutions 20/8, 26/13, 28/16 and  32/13, adopted July 5, 2012, June 26, 2014, March 26, 2015, and July 1, 2016, respectively, as well as  resolutions 68/167 , 69/166 and 71/199 adopted by consensus by the UN General Assembly  respectively on December 18, 2013, December 18, 2014, and December 19, 2016.     The FOC seeks to identify best practices regarding the application of human rights obligations and  commitment s in the evolving online landscape, as well as to call attention to conditions that  undermine those rights.     The FOC, through the Digital Defenders Partnership, also provides rapid response to a range of  threats to Internet freedom; from supporting blogge rs and cyber activists who find themselves under  digital attack, to helping them exercise their human rights online in Internet repressive  environments.
