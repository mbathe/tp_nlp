      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   3 1. Introduc tion  Artificial intelligence (AI) is advanced digital technology that enables machines to reproduce or exceed  some of the skills that require intelligence when  performed by humans. This includes tec hnologies that  give machines the ability to learn and ad apt, hear and interact, reason and plan, optimise procedures  and par ameters in order to extract knowledge from huge amounts of data and operate autonomously.   Artific ial intelligence  is a reality that is already influencing people’s decisions, safet y, marketing and  communication strategies and even medical treatments . Although m achines do not have generalist  intelligence  yet and neither has it been possible to give them common sense, they possess intelligence  for very specific tasks that surpass the efficiency of  human intelligence . This is creating an enthusiastic  surge in the adoption of this discipline in many areas of our lives , although th e ethical and legal impacts  have not been evaluated in depth, a fact that  poses a risk.   In recent years, artificial intelligence has become one of the most significant technological trends with  a cross -cutting capacity t o change many areas: society, economy, industry, culture, ecology, mobility,  public administration a nd ethics and its  cross -cutting nature  implies having to consider  all the possible  stakeholders . The contribution and convergence of different views is both enriching and necessary for  the sustainable and comprehensive  development of artificial intelligence .  The artificial intelligence sector is expected to grow considerably between 2020 and 2030. According  to estimations , by 2021 80% of online interactions between smart bots ,1 powered by artificial  intelligence , and humans, by way of chats or applications that operate with the voice, will be  automated, thus offering a unique and personalised experience. The same year, over 90% of  companies around the world are expected to have adopt ed some kind of solution or AI application.   Some of the most notable applications  will be in the field of cybersec urity, business intelligence,  market analysis, among others.    In this regard, several countries have already implemented an AI strategy, under which they  orchestrate strategic investments to boost their artificial intelligence capa bilities . These countries  include the United States, Israel, Canada, China, Singapore, South Korea, India, New Zealand, and in  Europe, the United Kingdom, France and Finland . They all have similar strategies that coincide with the  ethics of their applicability, th e significant role that has to be played  by public services and the need to  promote  research, training, and academic and entrepreneurial talent .  Along these lines, on 25 April 2018, the European Commission adopted its artificial intelligence strategy  for E urope2 which marked the start of a coordinated plan with Member States to encourage the  development and use of artificial intelligence in Europe . Within this framework, the Commission  requested Member States to approve their respective national AI strategi es and focus them on four  key areas : increase investment , make more data available , foster talent, and ensure trust in AI.                                                              1 A bot (a diminutive of robot) is a program that imitates human behaviour, which performs automated tasks and communicates wit h  users. The level of sophistication of the integrated AI can vary, depending on the nature and number of ta sks it performs.   2 https://ec.europa.eu/spain/barcelona/news/press_releases/180425_ca . 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   4 Coordination needs to be stronger to convert Europe into the world leader of the development and  implementatio n of advanced, ethical and saf e artificial intelligence .  Catal onia has a long history as a leader in technological innovation and talent development, starting  with the first industrial revolution and the first railway, which included achieving numerous social,  industrial and economic milestones, and ending up in this specific field with the creation of the  MareNostrum ,3 one of the most internationally renowned supercomputers. The Barcelona  Supercomputing Center has recen tly received funding from the EC to build the MareNostrum 5, which  will multiply the machine’s current power by 17 and convert it into Europe’s most powerful  supercomputer . Catalonia is also a leader in the field of artificial intelligence, demonstrated by  the  excellent scientific and academic community of international prestige, which places Catalan  universities, research and technology centres at the forefront of this field in Europe .  This document clearly shows that Catal onia has the capa bilities  and pot entialities to place the country  in a privileged position to lead the development and adoption of artifici al intelligence in Southern  Europe and convert it into a global technological pole of attraction in artificial intelligence; for these  reasons, the go vernment of Catalonia has put priority on preparing the Catalan Artificial Intelligence  Strategy and setting it into motion.   The Catalan Artificial Intelligence Strategy is an initiative coordinated by the Catalan ministry of  Business and Knowledge, with the participation of the different ministries  of the government of  Catalonia. The Strategy will deploy a multi -sectoral, cross -cutting people -centred plan that prioritises  sectors such as health , mobility, sustainab ility, productive economy, the agri -food sector and public  services, and it will be established in an action plan that revolves around the pivotal elements listed  below.   • Ecos ystem : promote a governance model that supports the development of a coordinated  ecosystem of artificial intelligence connected to the rest of the world ;  • Research and innovation : boost research and innovation by applying specific instruments and  establishing syne rgies among  public authorities, specialised research and innovation centres and  organisations that use artificial intelligence intensively ;  • Talent : crea te, attract and retain specialised t alent that fosters the development of artificial  intelligence soluti ons and transfer of knowledge to society , while training citizens and  professionals of other sectors to be ready for its impact ;  • Infrastructure  and data : have the necessary infrastructures for the development of artificial  intelligence and provide secure access to public and private data ;   • Adop tion of artificial intelligence : promote the incorporation of artificial intelligence to drive  innovation in public administration and strategic sectors, including agri -food, health care  and well being, the environmen t, mobility, tourism, culture and industry ;  • Ethics and society : promo te the development of ethical artificial intelligence that respects  applicable legislation, is compatible with our social and cultural norms and focuses on people .                                                              3 https://www.bsc.es/ca/marenostrum/marenostrum . 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   5 The Strategy was drawn up by a working group that, besides members of the government, counted on  the participation of some of the country’s most relevant artificial intelligence experts, who gave their  opinion of the current situation and future development of artificial intelli gence in Catalonia. The  experts who formed part of the group were specifically :   - Prof. Dr Ricardo Baeza -Yates, CEO of NTENT, director of Graduate Data Science Programs at  Northeastern University in Silicon Valley ( US) and professor of Information Technology at   Pompeu Fabra University (UPF)  - Prof. Dr María Casado, professor of Philosophy of Law , director  of the Observatory of Bioethics  and Law, UNESCO chair in Bioethics . Facult y of Law at Barcelona Universit y  - Prof. Dr Ulises Cortés, of the Computer S cience Department of the Polytechnic University of  Catalonia  (UPC). Scientific coordinator of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center of the High  Performance Artificial Intelligence Group   - Dr Sergi Figuerola, Chief Technology and Innovation Officer of the i2CAT  Foundation   - Prof. Dr Karina Gibert, professor of Intelligent Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Research  Center  (IDEAI -UPC), Vice  Dean for Big Data and Data Science of the Official Professional Chamber  of Informatics Engineering of Catalonia (COEINF)   - Prof. Dr Elisabet Golobardes Ribé, professor and researcher of Artificial Intelligence and Data  Science. Engineering Department, La Salle - Ramon Llull  University   - Dimosthenis Karatzas, associate director of the Computer Vision Centre   - Dr Josep Lladós, dire ctor Computer Vision Centre   - Prof. Ramon López de Mantaras, director of the Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIACSIC). Assistant  professor at the Western Sydney University and University of Technology Sydney.   - Dr Josep Maria Martorell, associate  director of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center   - Joan Mas, director of the Digital Technologies Division at Eurecat   - Dr Marc Torrent Moreno, director of the Big Data Centre of Excellence in Barcelona . Eurecat   - Prof. Dr Oriol Pujol , Vice -Rector for Digital T ransformation at Barcelona Universit y  The working group’s conclusions formed the basis of Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy, known  as CATALONIA.AI, which considers everything Catalonia contains, offers and makes available to  become an internationally recognised example of successful artificial intelligence  deployment , without  forgetting the policies that the government of Catalonia will set in motion to accomplish the objective .     This document starts by explaining what art ificial intelligence is and describes its impact on society and  the present status of its deployment at an international level. It then provides an analysis of Catalonia’s  current capa bilities  in this field and ends by describing the goals and actions asso ciated to the different  areas of activity of CATALONIA.AI, which foresees the work carried out jointly by public and private  sectors, the academic sector, research and innovation centres, organisations, foundations and  international bodies to ensure an eth ical development of artificial intelligence in Catalonia, which  translates into a social and economic improvement for the country and its citizens . 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   6 2. Artificial intelligence and the impact of its deployment     2.1 Artificial intelligence     Artificial intelligence is a branch of computer science , dedicated to the development of algori thms,  that enables a machine  to make intelligent decisions, o r at least behave with a human -like intelligence.  AI shares concepts and techniques with other acad emic disciplines, such as mathematics. The concept  of artificial intelligence is defined in many ways, although the most common definition was given by  John McCarthy , who in 1956  affirmed that ‘it is making a machine behave in ways that would be called  intelligent if a human were so behaving’. On the other hand, Andreas Kaplan and Michael Haenlein  define artificial intelligence as ‘a system’s ability to correctly interpret external data, to learn from such  data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific  goals and tasks through flexible adaptation’.   Artificial intelligence can be applied in an endless number of fields and sectors; its potential  contributions  –some of which are already in use and are very significant – mean its development and  applicability  involve disciplines such as ethics, law, psychology, philosophy, economy, digital  marketing, engineering, health care , sociology, biology and many others . For this reason,  one of the  most important and consequential values of artificial intelligence is the work of multi -disciplinary  teams, with different views but seeking  the same goal .  The multi -disciplinary nature of artificial intelligence is just one of its characteristic features, as  mentioned above, but there are more: the c apacity to catalyse solutions to different kinds of problems,  the close tie with computational capacities, the need for sufficient and accurate data and, finally,  human talent and creativity to achieve the desired g oals.  Artificial intelligence is one of the disciplines with the greatest  power and influence over the model of  society and economy  in the future and t his transforming power will have a notable effect on economy .  According to studies, in 2030 artificial intelligence will increase the gross world product by an  additional 15.7 billion dollars4 and in Spain, it could increase the GDP by 0.8% . As regards employment,  the conception of jobs, work and industrial processes, the same as in the case of education an d all  public services in general, will have to adopt new models and consequently undergo a transformation .   The change is already underway and governments and public authorities need to exercise the  responsibility that corresponds to them, fostering and adopting an extensive use of artificial  intelligence and putting priority on ethics, so as to improve  people’s well -being, ensure security in  solutions development, protect  natural resources, eliminate gender inequality, provide  access to  technology and i nformation, while guaranteeing transparency and preventing  undue use of data  and/or algori thms .  In this regard, several countries alr eady have an AI strate gy that they use to or chestrate strategic  investments, aimed towards boosting their artificial intelligence capa bilities . These countries include                                                              4 ‘Sizing the prize.

      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   7 Figure 1. National artificial intelligence strategies classified by year of implementation .  Source: ‘An Overview of National AI Strategies’  - Politics + AI  the United States, Israel, Canada, China, Singapore, South Korea, India, New Zealand, and in Europe,  the United Kingdom, France and Finland. They all have similar strategies that coincide with the ethics  of their a pplicability, the significant role of p ublic services and the need to promote research, training,  and academic and talent . These strategies are strongly supported by a budget that mostly comes from  public institutions, but with a notable private c omponent .          Along these lines, on 25 April  2018, the European Commission approved a communication that de tails  the planned actions for a European a rtificial intelligence strategy, through  a coordinated plan with  Member States to foster the development and use of artificial intelligence in Europe. With this  plan ,  which was presented on 7 D ecember 20185, the European Commission set t he objective to mobilise  €20 billion of public and private investment for the 2018 -2020 period .  Within this framework, the Commission has requested Member States to adopt their respective  national artificial intelligence strategies, defined in mid -2019, and that the strategies focus on four key  areas: increase investment, make more data available, fo ster talent and ensure trust in artificial  intelligence .  2.2 Artificial intelligence around the world    The U nited States (US)  is the clear leader of the artificial intelligence market . It evidently has the  strongest artificial intelligence ecosystem in ter ms of funding, number of companies and global reach .  A total of 40% of AI companies are located in America, although the figure would be higher it we took  into account that the most relevant AI companies have a sales office or headquarters in the United  States, while their main technology team s are  based in another place, such as Poland, Israel or France.  America’s leadership is the result of a mature, well -funded and pros perous digital ecosystem, as shown                                                              5 http://europa.eu/rapid /press -release_IP -18-6689_es.htm .  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   8 Figure 2. Global distribution of AI start -ups   Source: Asgard & Roland B erger  by Silicon Valley  and the metropolitan areas of New York and Boston. Over 16 governmental agencies  give financial and political support to AI companies  (incl uding the DARPA, the CIA and the NSA).         The U nited States  also has renowned universities ( Stanford and MIT), in additi on to large corporations  with p owerful research capacity  (Google and DeepMind, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon, Apple and  IBM). The United States  is a model to follow as rega rds how a technological industry can grow strongly  when there is a convergence of governmental stimulation, applied research  carried  out by universities  and corporations, entrepreneurship, private funding and a prosperous market. It is worth mentioning  that the migration policies of the current US government are resulting in a certain human capital flight  in the artificial intellig ence rese arch sector towards other ecosystems . Canada is particularly attractive.   According to the analysis of existing data, China is in second position. Approximately 11% of AI  companies are located in the country , which has publicly announced its intention to become the world  leader in artificial intelligence by 2030 (AliBaba, Baidu, Huawei and ZTE are examples of huge Chinese  corporations ). Artificial intelligence forms part of its ambitious five-year development plan  and t he  government is going to invest billio ns of Chinese yuan in research centres in Beijing and Shenzhen. The  initial market is well -funded,  and valuations are even higher than in Silicon Valley. China shows the  highest growth in the number of scholarly articles published and it has launched numerous AI -related  initiatives , demonstrat ing that with governmental support, adequate funding and a clear strategy, a  country can become a n influential AI player in only a few years .  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   9 Israel is a leader in technology , ranking third in AI solutions. With o nly 8.5 mil lion citizens, it has a  market share of 11% , the same as China  and has 40 times more AI companies per capita than the  market leader, United States , which places Israel in the front line of artificial intelligence at an  international level. One o f the reasons for this leadership is the close connection between the defence  industry and the digital sector , although Israel is well -known for its long history of tech companies, not  only for artificial intelligence . There are excellent universities  (Tec hnion, Bar -Illan, Ben -Gurion  and  Jerusalem) and a strong business ecosystem in Tel-Aviv.   The United Kingdom has a market share of 7%, which places the country at the forefront of artificial  intelligence in Europe.  It is well -positioned at an international level as regards obtaining and attracting  funding, talent and research . Lond on is a global financial hub; therefore, funding of AI companies in  the United Kingdom is significantly higher than in other European cou ntries . Furthermore, for years  the UK government has been creating a powerful entrepreneurship and investment environment  focused on this sector, and it also has excellent universities (such as Oxford and Cambridge).   Canad a is another leader in the field o f artificial intelligence and  is currently number five on the Global  AI country ranking. Although Canada promotes entrepreneurship -friendly pol itics, its market share is  surprisingly similar to that of other countries  (3.8%), Japan  (3.1%), Fran ce (3.1%) and Germany  (3%).  All are strong economies with a large domestic market. However, compared by size of economy, France  and Germany’s efforts to develop AI industry leadership capacity are small in contrast to the United  States, China, and Israel. The same hap pens in many other countries such as India ( 9), Spain (13), Brazil  (17) and Russia (20). Most of these countries have a huge deficiency of AI companies and unless they  invest considerably more effort and capital to reduce their deficiency in artificial int elligence, they will  have to depend on AI solutions from China, the United States and I srael . It is worth noting t hat the  government of Catalonia, through ACCIÓ, provides an opportunity to establish international  relationships with these ecosystems by way of its network of 40 offices aimed towards encouraging  internationalisation, technological cooperation and innovation.   At the end of 2018 Europa presented its AI4EU  project6 in Barcelona. AI4EU is the European Union’s  benchmark AI project and is the Europe an footprint within the global context of artificial intelligence,  which seeks to develop a European AI ecosystem, bringing together the knowledge, algorithms, tools  and resources available and making it a convincing solution for users.  Catalonia’s partici pation in this  project is headed by the BSC-CNC, the UPC and ATOS , which are joined by o ther relevant initiatives  promoted by the European AI community , such as CLAIRE7 and ELLIS ,8 that aim to promote a network  of AI labs in Europe .                                                                    6 https://www.ai4eu.eu    7 https://claire -ai.org    8 https://ellis.eu   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   10 2.3 Sectors impacted  by artificial intelligence      Artificial intelligence is a technology that o ffers great potential and financial prospects  in all markets.  According to a study by PwC ,9 the financial impact of artificial intelligence on the total global GDP will  come from f our sources : increa sed productivity from business  automating processes (including use of  robots and autonomous vehicles) ; increased productivity due to businesses augmenting their existing  work force with AI technologies (assisted and augmented intelligenc e); the previous factors will result  in saving time and cutting production costs; i ncreased consumer demand resulting from  the availability  of personalised and/or  higher -quality AI -enhanced products  and services.             As mentioned above, artificial intelligence is a technology that stands out for  its cross -cutting impact;  therefore, its uptake  will gradually increase in many dif ferent sectors, including the following :    ICT and cybersecurity    Citizen d efen ce and s afety    Health care    Tourism and leisure    Industry  4.0   Automo tive industry    Banking and finance     Retail     The figure below shows some of the ways that artificial intelligence will impact these sectors at short,  medium and long term, according to the tech nology  report ‘Artificial Intelligence in Catalonia’, drawn  up by the government of Catalonia.                                                                9 ‘Sizing the prize.

      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   12 3. Available capa bilities  in Catalonia     Catal onia has the capabilities and potentialities to position the country in a privileged position to lead  the development and adoption of artificial intelligence in Southern Europe and convert it into a global  technological pole of attraction in artificial intelligence. To understand what this position represents  from an international perspective, it is necessary to bear in mind the different capabilities inherent in  Catalonia , such as its knowledge ecosystem, ecosystem of technology companies and its scientific and  technological infrastructure .  The following sections describe each one of the capabilities  that make Catalonia into an ideal place for  developing, testing and deplo ying artificial intelligence .    3.1 Knowledge ecosystem      Catalonia’s top vector in artificial intelligence is related to the promotion of knowledge. The region has  a knowledge ecosystem that would enable it to head the deployment of artificial intelligence  with  guaranteed success . Its universities, research teams and departments, applied research centres,  technology centres and associations demonstrate Catalonia’s existing potential .     3.1.1 Universit ies   The Catalan university system is made up of 12 unive rsities : seven are public, four are private and one  is a virtual university. A total of 26,300 lecturers  give classes to over 237,000 students , who are offered  about 1,300 university degrees, divided into bachelor’s, master’s and docto ral degrees .      Figure 5. Catalan university map   Source: Government of Catalonia  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   13 These bodies offer specia lised training . Indeed,  they have brought together their knowledge , driven  technology creation and worked on research and technology transfer projects related to ar tificial  intelligence.   By way of illustration , the figure below shows the main research centres and groups of the different  Catalan universities that develop artificial intelligence or work with AI intensively .        The annexe of this document contains a detailed explanation of the i nvolvemen t of Catalan universities  in AI  develop ment in the region.     3.1.2 Research and innovation centres    The Catalan research and innovation system is currently made up of internationally renowned research   and technology centres . These centres are structured into two interrelated networks: firstly, the  CERCA10 network , which groups together Catalan research centres and is managed by the CERCA  Institute , using its own means and the technical services of Catalan government bodies and, secondly,  the TECNIO11 network , focused on the transfer of te chnology, which joins research groups, CERCA and                                                              10 http://cerca.cat/    11 http://www.accio.gencat.cat/ca/ serveis/innovacio/tecnologia -per-a-lempresa/tecnio/    Figure 6.

By way of illust ration, the figure below shows the main research and technology centres of the Catalan  knowledge ecosystem that work with artificial intelligence .        Annexe  II of this document contains detailed information about the work carried out by each one of  these centres related to AI development .     3.1.3  Participa tion in the H2020 Framework Programme   Catal onia is the region of Spain that has received the hi ghest number of grants from the European  research and innovation funding programme, Horizon 2020. According to information obtained on 30  April 2019 by the CDTI (Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology) , during the 2014 -2019   period Catalan entities received a total of € 1,013,004,988 to subsidise Horizon 2020 projects . This  figure represents 2.71% of the programme’s implemented budget  and 29.23% of the total subsid y  received by Spanish entities .  As regards information and communications technology  (ICT) , Catalan entities have also played a  significant role and have received a total subsidy of € 85,961,783, which represent s 2.87% of the total  implemented budget and 28.84% of the funds awarded to Spain .  The 10 Catalan entities t hat have received funding for information and communications technologies  are the following (listed in order  according to the size of the grant , starting with the highest amount ):    Barcelona Supercomputing Center (MareNostrum)    Polytechnic University of Catalonia  (UPC)    Pompeu Fabra University (UPF)    Eurecat  Foundation    Figure 7.

Visitors are offered an interactive view  of th e activities of Catalan entities related to science and innovation projects supported  by European  funds and the dynamic evolution of the collaboration networks  between each entity .          3.1.4  Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence    Professor Ramon López de Mántaras brought artificial intelligence to Catalonia in the 1980s . It quickly  propagated  and spread all over the region , resulting in the consolidation of a tight -knit scientific  community that revolved around artificial intelligence. In 1994 , the Catalan Association for Artificial  Intelligence ( ACIA)13 was definitively established .  The ACIA is a non -profit associa tion created with the purpose of promoting artificial intelligence in the  Catalan society . Its main goal is to support communication between the p rofessionals and                                                              12 http://unics.cloud/ris3/mcat   13 https://www.acia.cat    Figure 8. The RIS3 -MCAT Platform   Source: Government of Catalonia  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   16 organisations that participate in artificial intelligence and promote social, cultural, scientific economic  and governmental awareness of artificial intelligence .  The ACIA was created 25 years ago with the aim of being a meeting point for all researchers who were  already working in this new and unknown field . The entity was formed on 28 March 1994 and the  Articles of Association were approved . During the summer of that year, the first edition of the  Association’s magazine was published (the ACIA Bulletin, later called NODES14) and the  entity began to  organise the Young Researc hers’ Meetings that would later become the International Con ference  of  the ACIA .  Nowadays, the ACIA brings together the greater part of this scientific community, as well as former  students and professionals of the sector . At present, the Associa tion has over 220 individual and  institutional memb ers, it has published more  than 60 magazines and books , and has organised 22  international con ferences . Although the association belongs to a small region, since 1995, it has been  a member of the European Association for Artificial Intelligence , now known as E urAI, and since 1998  it has organised its annual international con ference , the CCIA15, yet again acting as a pioneer, with  some of the proceedings published by one of the most prestigious publishing hou ses, IOS Press. The  ACIA organises and participates in dissemination activities including the YoMo, the celebration of the  60th anniversary of artificial intelligence and the Association’s 25th anniversary, among others . On 8  March  2019 , the ACIA created a  working group aimed towards narrowing  the gender gap in the AI  sector  (donesIAcat). It also sponsors conferences, awards prizes to doctoral theses and master’s  dissertations, and grants to attend conferences .  As regards international scientific leadership, the fact that the ACIA has 10 EurAI Fellows is highly  relevant. The EurAI Fellows programme dates back to 1999 and is a very selective programme that has  honoured less than 3% of its members; Spain has 16 EurAI Fellows, of which 10 a re from ACAI, and  only France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy have more fellowships than Catalonia .    3.2 Ecosystem of technology companies     3.2.1 The ICT industry  in Catalonia   ICT is one of Catalonia’s most dynamic sectors. It has one of the most important industrial clusters in  Europe, with a group of highly competitive software developers, which provides the region with a high  capacity to create innovative solutions adapted to  the reality of each vertical of the industry or services,  in addition to the fact that these solutions are validated and even co -created by future users before  they are launched onto the market .  In 2018, the Catalan ICT industry  was made up of a total of 15,757 companies, a figure that had grown  by 4.5% in respect to 2017 and increased by a remarkable 27% since 2013. Between them, they create                                                              14 https://nodes.acia.cat    15 https://agenda.uib.es/29216/detail/ccia2019.html

      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   18 In fact, Barcelona is considered the third -favourite start -up hub by 20% of European founders, who  would choose the city to establish their emerging company, after London and Berlin, as ranked by the  Startup Heatmap Europe 201818.  Therefore, the ecosystem i n the ICT industry is the result of an unprecedented capacity to bring  enterprises together and it stands among Europe’s most competitive and dynamic hubs. By way of  illustration, the following picture shows a map of the main companies and players in the C atalan ICT  industry .        3.2.2 Catal an digital hub, an attractive region for foreign investment    The fDi Magazine  published by the Financial Times has recognised Catalonia as the most attractive  region in southern Europe in terms of foreign investment  for 2018 and 2019 .19 This is one of the most  prestigious  international rankings used by multina tionals to stu dy future business investment projects .  It is worth noting the investments made by multina tionals and start -ups of the ICT industry  (28.6% of  the total in 2017), a sector that creates wealth and qualified jobs with a strong growth potential, which  demonstr ates the pulling effect of the technology sector for the Catalan economy .  As a whole, investors perceive Catalonia and Barcelona as a very attractive place to invest. The region  is rated globally at 3.7, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being ‘very attractive to invest’. Asian companies are                                                              18 https://www.startupheatmap.eu/   19 http://catalonia.com/newsletter_news/news/2018/financial -times -recognises -catalonia.jsp    Figure 11.

A significant number of large multinationals have chosen Catalonia, particularly the Barcelona  metropolitan area, to establish their ICT centres: technology -based centres of excellence and digital  hubs that provide a service at an international level.    In the last three years, the region has attracted centres belonging to Zurich, Axa, Visa, Roche, Allianz,  Asics, Lidl, Media Mark and Nestlé , as well as centres owned by technology companies,  including  Oracle, Cisco, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Satellogic, Siemens, Deloitte, Moodle, Gartner, Igg,  Zoughtworks, GFT  and NTT Data , among others .  These new centres are added to a long list of multinational ICT centres located in Catalonia, which have  already positioned Barcelona and Catal onia as one of the world’s most important digital connection  centres, as shown by this figure:             3.2.3 The AI sector in Catalonia   In June 2019, the government of Catalonia published a techn ology  report , ‘Artificial Intelligence in  Catalonia’, which defines  the ecosystem of companies, universit ies, research and innovation centres  that support the AI sector in Catalonia .  According to the study, there are 179 companies in Catalonia operating in the field of artificial  intelligence. These enterprises currently employ 8,483 people and have a combined turnover of €1.336  billion for activitie s linked to artificial intelligence.   The sector is mostly made up of businesses formed by entrepreneurs, of which 63% are start -ups.  According to their segment of the value chain, they are distributed as follows :    Algorithm developers  (19)   Consult ancy firm s (19)   Software or device developers  (134)    Service providers  (7)  Figure 12.

Below are the most strategic scientific  infrastructures for developing a rtificial intelligence in Catalonia .  - Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC -CNS)   Barcelona Supercomputing Center -Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC -CNS) is a scientific  facility that offers high performance computing (HPC) services and manages MareNostrum, one of  the most powerful supercomputers in Europe, located in the Torre Giron a chapel.   BSC-CNS is at the service of the international scientific community and the industries that require  HPC services. Its multidisciplinary research team and computational facilities –including  MareNostrum – convert  BSC-CNS into an international centre of excellence in e -Science .  Figure 13. Companies and agents of the AI ecosystem in Catalonia (June  2019)   Source: tech nology  report ‘Artificial Intelligence in Catalonia’ – Government of Catalonia  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   21 Since its creation in 2005, BSC -CNS has played an active role in fostering HPC in Catalonia and Spain  as an essential tool for international competitiveness in science and engineering. The centre  manages the Spanish Super computing Network (RES ) and  is a hosting member of the Partnership  for Advanced Computing in Europe (PRACE). The centre actively participates in the main European  HPC initiatives, in close cooperation with other European supercomputing centres and is one o f  the institutions most actively involved  in setting the EuroHPC joint undertakings into motion .  On 7 June  2019 , the European Commission announced that it would invest €100 million in  MareNostrum 520 a pre -exascale machine with peak power 17 times higher th an the current  supercomputer, MareNostrum 4, and 10,000 times higher than the supercomputer that began the  saga in 2004, MareNostrum 1.  The decision guarantees Barcelona a leading position in the future  map of supercomputing in Europe.   - L’Anella Científica  (Scientific Ring)   The Anella Científica  is an academic and research telecom munica tions network that connects   about 80 institutions related to research and innovation , which enabl es users  to exchange and  process big data in a secure environment. Besides connectivity, with different speeds and  modalities , the member  institutions  are offered numerous additional services .  The Anella  has a  core with a link at 100 Gbps between i ts core nodes  (Campus Nord and Itconic)  that finish in 5 ports, of which one is for the CATNIX neutral Internet exchange point . Each node is  connected at 10 Gbps. The Consorci de Serveis Universitaris de Catalunya  – CSUC  (Consortium of  University Services of Catalonia ) directly manages th e optical technology, switches and routers  that enable interconnection between the nodes and connected institutions with a fully dedicated  architecture as regards fibres and systems .  The Anella Científica is connected to the Spanish academic network, RedIRIS , and via this network  it is connected to the other academic networks in Europe and the rest of the world. It is also  connected to the Catalonia Neutral Internet Exchange Point  (CATNIX ), which provides commercial  suppliers with excellent connectivit y.    3.3.2 Technolog y infrastructures   Thanks to the efforts of public and private entities , Catalonia has first -class technology infrastructures   too, which are already operating throughout the entire region . The cross -cutting nature of artificial  intelligence fits in perfectly with the strategy to add functionalities to these infrastructures so they  may act as a whole to support the fields and sectors where this technology  is applied. Described below  are the m ost strategic technology infrastructures for the development of artificial intelligence in  Catalonia.                                                                  20 https://ja.cat/IRpd7   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   22 - Public network of optical fibre throughout the territory   The government of Catalonia is promoting the deployment  of the public network of optical fibre   throughout the entire region, so as to provide its own network for corporate connectivity and  make use of the surplus network to offer services to telecommunications operators with optimum  conditions of competitiveness, thus promoting the development of ad vanced digital technologies.  The network currently encompasses over 4,500 km that can provide an effective point of presence  in 254 Catalan municipalities.   The framework of the National Pact for the Digital Society includes a plan to roll out the public  network of optical fibre to connect all the capitals of administrative divisions by 2020, so as to  provide an effective point of presence in all Catalan municipalities and areas of economic activity  by 2023. The plan is to provide 8,500 km of optical fibre o pen to telecommunications operators.   In this way, the offer of dark fibre wholesale services and active circuits for deploying the services  provided by telecommunications operators in geographical areas, traditionally disadvantaged by  the digital fracture,  seeks to ensure that the new technology is not only born and rolled out in  urban areas concentrated near Barcelona, but to also deploy it in rural environments away from  the metropolitan area.   The main objective is to convert Catalonia into a connected t erritory that makes use of technology  and digital information and uptakes new technological proposals for mobile devices  – such as 5G  technology  – to lead the innovation of public services, accelerate economic growth and promote  a more intelligent, sustain able and integrated  society .

      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   23   - Data Processing Centres   The government of Catalonia is the principal consumer of the country’s computer systems ; as a  result , the tender of the new ICT model put out by the government in 2012, which combined all  the government’s Data Processing Centre (DPC) infrastructure services , meant that the best DPC  infrastructure in the country was deployed in Catalonia.   Furthermore, international DPC infrastructure and cloud -based platforms belonging to companies  such as IBM, HP, T -Systems and Mediacloud were implemented in Catalonia when the companies  that had been awarded the DPC infrastructure services executed their i ndustrial plans . These were  added to the first -rate DPC infrastructures that had previously existed in the country.   Consequently, in Barcelona and surrounding areas there are three main zones with a concentration  of top -notch DPC infrastructure (Parc de l’ Alba, Zona Franca/are@38 and 22@Barcelona) which  positions the region as one of the most important concentrations of Data Processing Centres in  Europe. These are i nfrastructures that are at the service of the public and private sector so it may  develop dig ital transformation projects and programmes that require processing big data, thus  establishing a fundamental asset for developing artificial intelligence in Catalonia.

      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   25 4. CATALONIA.AI: the Catalan artificial intelligence strategy     The government has put priority on promoting artificial intelligence and aims to su pport the  deployment  of AI technology, thus making Catalonia a  renowned pole of attraction for research,  innovation and talent, companies and investors in the field of artificia l intelligence .  Through  this objective, the government is promoting artificial intelligence in Catalonia. Under the  name of CATALONIA.AI , it will deploy a programme of specific actions to strengthen Catalonia’s AI  ecosystem and lead knowledge creation , social and business application and create solutions based on  artificial intelligence aimed towards fostering economic growth and improving people’s lives .  Catal onia’s  Artificial Intelligence Strategy is coordinated by the Secretariat for Digital Polic y of the  Ministry for Digital Policy and Public Administration of the government of Catalonia, with the direct  collaboration of the Secretariat of Business and Competitiveness and the Secretariat of Universities  and Research of the Ministry of Business and K nowledge, and the participation of the remaining  ministries .    4.1 Objecti ves and values     CATALONIA.AI  is fully aligned with the European objectives associated to the deployment of artificial  intelligence and it will consequently promote all the capabilities of the Catalan ecosystem referred to  in the previous section, of public or private origin, cooperation, innovation and internationalisation , so  as to establish its leadership in southern Europe and become a top player in the global environment .  The goals associated to the deployment of the Strategy are listed below :   Boost the AI ecosystem in Cat alonia    Position Catalonia as one of the driving forces of artificial intelligence in Europe    Convert Catal onia, particularly Barce lona , into a global AI hub    Crea te, retain and attract specialised t alent in artificial intelligence in Catalonia    Boost research  and innovation in artificial intelligence in Catalonia    Crea te, ma intain and govern an easily accessible open data repository    Encourage companies and institutions to adopt artificial intelligence    Train professionals and citizens to use artificial intellige nce   Explain to citizens that artificial intelligence will have a positive impact on their well -being    Promo te a sustainable, comprehensive , secure and fair development of artificial intelligence  in Catalonia    
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   26 CATALONIA.AI assumes the values of the Barcelona  Declaration for the Proper Development and Usage  of Artificial Intelligence in Europe21 and fully agrees with the recommendations on artificial intelligence  provided by the High -Level Experts of the European Commission . Said recommendations  are contained  in the Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI22 and the Montreal Declaration for a Responsible  Development of Artificial Intelligence ,23 which place people, whether they are developers or users, in  the centre . Artificial intelligence needs to be able to increa se people’s capabilities, not replace their  intelligence, and has to help increase individual and collective well -being.   In this regard, CATALONIA.AI will promote the development of artificial intelligence in such a way  that   It benefits  people, societies a nd the planet    It is p lural, divers e and comprehensive in its sources of knowledge    It is s ecure and trustworthy throughout its life cycle    It is applied sensibly    It is r espons ible for its actions    It is t ransparent in its decisions    It respects privacy    It complies with civil, legal and democratic systems    It is aligned with human values    It focuses on people    It is controlled by people     4.2 Strategic pivotal elements of the action plan     CATALONIA.AI will deploy a multi -sectoral, cross -cutting plan that focuses  on people ; prioritises sectors  such as healthcare, mobility, sustainability, productive economy, the agri -food sector and public  services ; and will be established in an action plan that revolves around the pivotal elements listed  below :  • Ecos ystem : promote  a cross -cutting governance model that supports the development of a  coordinated ecosystem of artificial intelligence connected to the rest of the world .  • Research and innovation : boost research and innovation by applying specific instruments and  establishi ng synergies between public authorities, specialised research and innovation centres  and organisations that use artificial intelligence intensively .  • Talent : create, attract and retain specialised talent that fosters the development of artificial  intelligen ce solutions and transfer of knowledge to society, while training citizens and  professionals of other sectors to be ready for its impact .  • Infrastructure  and data : have the necessary infrastructures for the development of artificial  intelligence and provide  secure access to public and private data .                                                              21 https://www.bdebate.org/sites/default/files/barcelona -declaration_v7 -1-eng.pdf   22 https://www.huntonprivacyblog.com/?attachment_id=17432    23 https://www.declarationmontreal -iaresponsable.com/   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   27 • Adop tion of artificial intelligence : promote the incorporation of artificial intelligence to drive  innovation in Public Administration and strategic sectors, including agri -food, healthcare and well being, the environment, mobility, tourism, culture and industry .  • Ethics and society : promote the development of ethical artificial intelligence that respects  applicable legislation, is compatible with our social and cultural norms and focuses on people .  The lines of action and initiatives associated to each one of the six pivotal elements are shown below:     4.2.1 Ecos ystem   One of the key elements for AI development is having a strong and coordinated ecosystem where the  different agents are connected  to enable them to create  synergies, complement each other when  tackl ing large projects, promote existing initiatives or create new ones .  This ecos ystem is made up of universities, research and innovation centres, public bodies, companies,  investors and support institutions . Its governance, and the relationship between each other and other  existing ecosystems have to make Catalonia into a renowned pole of attraction in artificial intelligence .  4.2.1.1 Crea tion of a cross -cutting and open govern ance structure   One of the priorities of the Catalan strategy is to create an  organisation whose operations will focus  on heading the promotion of the Catalan AI ecosystem . This structure will be responsible for  governance of the Catalan strategy and, among other matters, this will involve managing the  resources, infrastructure, talent, opportunities, alliances and ensure that the established plan and  strategy is accomplished with transparency, equality and ethics .  CATALONIA.AI  has to be the front door for AI research and innovation projects and initiatives, as well  as associated solutions and developments . CATALONIA.AI  has to be the frame of reference of cutting edge technology and must represent the entire community of people who create and use knowledge,  with the ability to establi sh connect ions. It should also be able to receive local and international  funding , align collaborations between public and private stakeholders and establish cooperation  between leading international entities in this field.   In this regard, an open, plural,  transparent and multidisciplinary community will be created under the  umbrella of the Strategy  in progress , known as CATALONIA.AI ALLIANCE . This alliance will enable  players to share knowledge , create and attract ideas and challenges , carry out research, exchange  experiences in a participative and coordinated manner with other communities involved in advanced  digital technologies, with the capacity to receive funding from Catalonia, Spain and abroad, as well as  generate collaboration and knowledge transfer  projects .  The AI ecosystem is structured around three main areas: the first involves creating knowledge and  research of excellence, the second is associated to transfer ring technology to the market and creating  impact and the third focuses on creating the  ecosystem that will support the creation and growth of  start -ups and new solutions . 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   28 4.2.1.2  Catal onia as an international AI pole of attraction   One of the basic objectives of the CATALONIA.AI  Strategy will be to boost international cooperation by  establishing collaboration agreements with other ecosystems, associations, companies, universities,  and international research and innovation centres of excellence, thus making it possible to create an d  develop projects , create joint programmes  and benefit from international programmes s uch as   Horizon Europe24 or the new programme, Digital Europe ,25 which will drive Europe’s future in the next  few years, among many other existing possibilities.   Barcelona’ s position as a global l eader in digital technologies, particularly because it is the world capital  of mobile technology (Mobile World Capital26) and due to its first -class international con gresses , such  as the Mobile World Congress (MWC Barcelona27), Smart City Expo World Congress28 and IoT Solutions  World Congress ,29 together with the existence of infrastructure and first -class research and innovation  centres (including the Barcelona Supercomputing Center) , are all elements of maximum visibility that  will dra w companies , research and innovation centres that are at the forefront of artificial intelligence ,  so as to establish operational hubs or create joint projects, thus s ignificant ly increas ing the quality of  projects produced by the ecosystem as a whole and collaborations with the innovative,  entrepreneurial and investigational network that previously existed in our country.   Within this context, it would be worthwhile to create a n advanced catalogue of technologies,   CATALONIA.AI TECHNOLOGY, which would include  technology -based companies, research and  innovation centres, knowledge -creati ng companies and success stories of our ecosystem, thus  boosting Catalonia’s presence in international events  and providing leading international  business  decision -makers and investors with a well -structured and attractive critical mass  and showing how  technological development in artificial development impacts our society and people’s well -being.   In a similar way as the other major events related to advanced digital techno logies held in Barcelona  every year, it will be necessary to study the possibility of bringing close  or granting  an international AI  event to Catalonia. In addition, work will be accrued out to promote the development of international  events related to art ificial intelligence in line with those that already exist, such as the AI & Cognitive  Systems Forum30 that forms part of the IoT Solutions World Congress, the International Congress of  the Catalan Association of Artificial Intelligence or the BigData Congr ess,31 organi sed by Eurecat.   As regards the CATALONIA.AI  Strategy and the associated international component, a network of  international ambassadors and AI project hunters  will be created, a s well as an advisory council . Both  will be made up of renowned leaders from the world of research and innovation in artificial  intelligence , researchers, advisors and business managers with proven experience in international                                                              24 https://ec.europa.eu/info/designing -next-research -and-innovation -framework -programme/what -shapes -next-framework programme_en    25 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/commission -welcomes -agreement -digital -europe -programme -2021 -2027   26 https://mo bileworldcapital.com   27 https://www.mwcbarcelona.com    28 http://www.smartcityexpo.com    29 https://www.iotsworldcongres s.com    30 https://www.iotsworldcongress.com/congress/tracks -themes/ai -cognitive -systems -forum -2/   31 https://bigdatacongress.barcelona/   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   29 projects and markets, either from Catalonia or outside, or e ntities, companies or institutions with  which collaboration is already underway or could be of interest .  Likewise, as part of the internationalisation strategy, in addition to the presence of CATALONIA.AI  in  international events, government delegations abr oad and the International Network of Trade and  Investment Offices will collaborate in order to ensure contact with people and entities of the highest  level and promote the creation of opportunities and projects for Catalan entities and companies that  work in this field.   4.2.1.3 An attractive country for national and international AI investment   In recent years the presence of international companies and investors involved in advanced digital  technologies has increased exponentially in our region . In this reg ard, the decision taken by different  multinationals to establish their digital operations in Catalonia must not be ignored by the  international ecosy stem, and it is therefore necessary to make it known and consequently take  advantage of the opportunities it offers . In this regard, both CATALONIA.AI TECHNOLOGY , mentioned  above, and the direct collaboration of the Agency for Business Competitiveness (ACCIÓ), in charge of  the foreign investment programme, Invest in Catalonia ,32 have to be able to boost the kno wledge  transfer processes and improve the connection of technology created in the region with national and  international economic, social and business sectors with the capacity to invest in individual or  cooperation AI-based project s. This capacity must no t only translate into having favo urable locations  or technologies, noteworthy research and innovation centres, or companies with products under  development, but must also imply setting up favourable tax measures and encourage digitisation  between companies  as a fundamental element of present and future competitiveness.   The CATALONIA.AI  Strategy includes promoting different actions geared towards encouraging  cooperative or financial investment, especially  in technology -based companies , research and  innovatio n centres and groups . This will be achieved by setting up tax incentives or loans with  favourable conditions , for example, those linked to connection programmes with the European  Investment Bank or the European Commission’s Investment Plan for Europe. Likewise, following other  experiences in our region, priority will be given to holding Investment Forums or Investment Readiness  Series as part of the activities carried out by the Barcelona & Catalonia Sta rtup Hub , the previously  mentioned congresses or others associated to AI sectoral applications . An application will also be  created , CATALONIA.AI INVESTMENT, which will include  information about investors, professionals  and companies that wish to invest in  digital technologies, especially in relation to artificial intelligence.  This application will enable potential investors or licensees to be in direct contact with technologies  under development and , furthermore , specific actions will be carried out to at tract new investors to  the system and training programmes will be offered with the purpose of structuring an investment  network with interest in the knowledge created in Catalonia in the field of digital technolog ies as a  whole , and particularly in artific ial intelligence .                                                              32 http://catalonia.com  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   30   4.2.2 Re search and innovation    The competitiveness of Catalan companies largely depends on improving the productiv e model and  increasing associated productivity. This change requires firm ly supporting research and innovation,  considering  all the stakeholders in the Catalan system and , instead of seeking excellence, it needs to  tackle real problems, especially in relation to knowledge transfer and the professional management of  the associated activities.   In the present context, the key fac tors of Catalonia’s international competitiveness are excellent basic  knowledge and the capacity for technological development in artificial intelligence . In this regard, the  different agents of research and innovation that work with artificial intelligenc e need to be promoted  and coordinated, so Catalonia may become a pole of attraction in the creation and transfer of  knowledge towards the different productive sectors .  4.2.2.1 Conne ction and strengthening of AI research and innovation entities   The Catalan research and innovation system has a high number of public and private research and  innovation groups, institutes and centres  that specialise in artificial intelligence; however, greater  coordination and joint work is required to create sufficient critical  mass to respond to the social needs  and business challenges of the different areas of action.   In this regard, a centralised or network -based operational structure  will be created or adapted  with  the purpose of promoting s ynergies between groups, institute s, universities, companies, research and  innovation centres specialised in artificial intelligence, thus creating synergies and collaborations to  boost joint activity at home and abroad . The members of the structure will work together to define  the priorit y objectives in this field, in line with social and industrial requirements and encouraged by  the new European research and innovation programmes for oncoming years .  An Advanced Research and Innovation Programme  in the field of artificial intelligence will  also be  promoted in order to give additional support to research groups, institutes and public centres that  carry out AI projects in Catalonia. Challenges will be established aimed towards resolving social or  business issues related to artificial intellig ence with adequate monitoring of the developed activities.  This programme may be linked to the advanced digital technologies programme and will have the clear  purpose of developing innovative solutions for industry that respond to real needs previously  identified by associations and business entities, thus complementing the challenges provided by the  governmental bodies associated to the previously mentioned programme. Like previous projects, they  will be of a collaborative nature and will be exclusively addressed to public research and innovation  centres, as well as technology -based companies that are in the process of technological development .  One of the programme’s priorities will be to combine different digital technologies, for example,  artificial in telligence with the internet of things (IoT) and blockchain technologies, exploring the  distributed intelligence models also related to future 5G networks . 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   31 Final ly, great importance will be placed on supporting business R&D+i in AI, especially when it is carried  out by companies with their own innovation centres or that plan to implement them in Catalonia in  the near future . Support will be given to actions a imed towards setting up industrial pilot projects,  prototypes or proof  of concepts  in real environm ents of advanced technology, seeking funding for  innovations associated to business growth, fostering participation in international projects and making  use of tax incentives. In conclusion, a double task aimed towards promoting and funding business  initiatives that have taken the firm decision to create wealth and create employment in Catalonia.   4.2.2.2 Opening of the Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence   Catalan companies and institutions need an immediate reference to be able to see for t hemselves how  artificial intelligence will impact the different sectors of action and to receive the necessary guidance  when they first adopt artificial intelligence, especially in the case of SMEs .  Within this context,  the Centre of Excellence in Artifici al Intelligence (CoE AI) will enter into operation,  following the model of the Digital Innovation Hubs33 set up by the European Commission. Said centre  will provide companies and institutions with a reference and will work at their service to demonstrate  the benefits of AI and accelerate the adoption of innovative technologies when applying artificial  intelligence and using data created by the system as a whole.   The CoE AI, created as a network -based service centre, will become a key element of CATALONIA.AI in  relation to promoting knowledge transfer and executing joint projects between knowledge -creating  entities and companies and user institutions, which demand innovative AI solutions .  As regards SMEs, the centre will  promote an AI application programme  that will include activities  focused on dissemination and awareness -raising, providing consulting services  and guidance for  digitisation , as well as offering support in the implementation of projects by way of digitisation  vouchers used to implement ICT solutions, especially in the field of artificial intelligence.     4.2.2.3 AI knowledge transfer to boost business innovation   More and more companies are choosing open innovation as part of their business strategies, whether  it is due to long development time s, in the case of the pharmaceutical industry, or because staying at  the forefront requires continuous technological updates , as in the case of the ICT industry. In respect  to advanced technologies, like artificial intelligence, the specific circumstances are related to the latter,  and therefore require a continuous development effort, particularly in the search for new applications  for specialised sectors .  Within this context, it is essential to boost the mutual commitment of companies and public AI  resear ch and innovation entities by creating mixed public -private networks, institut es and units  so as                                                              33 http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/digital -innovation -hubs   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   32 to create strategic alliances , set up innovative joint projects, not just services, take advantage of the  pulling effect of large companies and encourage a rat ional use of existing resources, infrastructure and  technology platforms . Likewise, boosting clusters or the participation of sectoral business associations  in the application of digital technologies will spread their use as a basis of industrial competiti veness ,  while developing new business models with an international outlook . In this regard, beyond the  creation of possible programmes or collaboration projects, it is also important to make use of  previously existing programmes, such as the Industrial Doctorates Plan ,34 CERCA Gínjol35 or the   Knowledge Industry ,36 with a special view that emphasises advanced digital technologies, particularly  artificial intelligence .  A pending challenge related to the system as a whole, a key factor for knowledge transfer, also in  artificial intelligence, is to drive a specialised map of capabilities  to be able to connect technologies,  services and local companies with international  environments, as well as detect existing weaknesses  in the business network and strengthen th e identified fields of action , either as creators or users . This  map applied to artificial intelligence will help make better use of the current capabilities of the Catalan  research and innovation system,  will foster collaboration between companies and pri vate and public  institutions and facilitate talent attraction and retention, domestic and international investment and  technology, thus creating economic and social value.   Another key element in the relationships between knowledge -creating companies and pu blic entities  is trust, in the real technological capability and in terms of development . It is therefore necessary to  position Catalan universities and research and innovation centres as outstanding and trustworthy  suppliers for companies , based on the de velopment of own technology, establishment of public and  private collaborations and service provision . This positioning in the AI field will be accompanied by a  definition of objectives and the establishment of innovation -based indicators that could have e ffects  on the implementation of specific mechanisms that boost these activities, such as the creation of  centres of excellence similar to those mentioned above.   It is worth noting the necessary effort for promoting the incuba tion, ac celeration and  internationalisation of technology -based companies , especial ly those arising from the research and  innovation centres of the public system with AI-based tec hnologies or which are directly applied to the  productive sectors where there is an availability of existing tec hnologies. In this regard, together with  ACCIÓ, assessment programmes will be implemented to validate the business model, validate and  attract the first customers and seek funding to obtain the necessary boost and be recognised as  stakeholders of interest by medium and large -sized companies . Another outstanding feature is the  collaboration that could arise with the previously existing acceleration and incubation programmes in  the country , such as those linked to Programa Catalunya Emprèn  (Embark  Catalonia Programme)37  driven by the ministry of Business and Knowledge or The Collider  programme38 of Mobile World Capital                                                              34 http://doctoratsindustrials.gencat.cat   35 http://ginjol.cerca.cat    36 http://universitatsirecerca.gencat.cat/ca/03_amb its_dactuacio/Transferencia -de-coneixement/programa -industria -delconeixement/    37 http://catempren.gencat.cat    38 https://thecollider.tech   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   33 Barcelona, a s well as others of the private sector, such as Seedrocket, Conector, Ship2B, Wayra and  BStar tup, which include own public and private initiatives that could be highly relevant for the Strategy .  4.2.2.4 Innovative public procurement  as an AI development path   Through the Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme and the initiatives related to the  European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) ,39 especially the EIT Digital Community ,40 in  recent years the European Commission has developed different innovative public procurement  projects, particularly in the healthcare sector , which are added to public initiatives  habitually carried  out in our system through the Public Procurement Platform. Together with pre -commercial public  procurement, still under development, t his action  is constitutes a fundamental element for the future  of artificial intelligence in Catalonia, not only because of the public funds it involves but also due to the  mobilisation of the existing technologies in the productive network, the boost of proofs of concept in  different fields and the participation of the set of stakeholders of the research and innovation system.    With the wish to convert Catalonia into a leading pole of attraction  in artificial intelligence in oncoming  years, the CATALONIA.AI  Strategy and the Advanced Digital Technologies Programme have established  as priority that the services of the government of Catalonia put out to tender by the different ministries   must respond to challenges of Public Administration as a mechanism to attract collaborative projects  and proposals from public and private research and innovation age nts as a whole. In this regard,  priority will be given to entities responsible for the project with equipment, prototypes and/or AI  innovation projects when the request for proposal is issued and, especially if these projects have been  developed within the  framework of European initiatives or have been funded by programmes  associated to RIS3CAT o r similar.   The ultimate goal is to ensure that AI technologies impact the government’s different departments  and respond to both current needs and new services and projects of the different ministries.  Preference will be given to tenderers with their own equipment that can be used in related projects in  different testing environments, such as health, agriculture, mobility, industry, culture and education,   among other s.  4.2.3 Talent   The existing talent in Catalonia is a necessary and indispensable resource for promoting the  development of the AI ecosystem ; it is therefore strategic for the region to provide citizens and  professionals with the required competencies and capabilities to effectively apply artificial intelligence  in Catalonia. Within this context, it is essential to have adequate training that guarantees the  deployment and uptake of the tec hnologies associated to artificial i ntelligence in order to continuously  produce new professionals that fulfil social and business requirements .                                                              39 https://eit.europa.eu/   40 https://www.eitdigital.eu/  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   34 4.2.3.1 Talent management  in AI : creation, attraction and retention   Programmes for research talent in AI   Initiatives for improving the offer of universities will be promoted and supported with courses,  seminars, master’s degree and postgraduate degrees in the technology and non -technology fields  related to artificial intelligence with the purpose of satisfyin g the needs of current and future  professionals . Within this context, university -business collaboration mechanisms will be implemented  with the purpose of better -adjusting the curriculum to social and business requirements that boost  innovation and researc h centred on providing technological solutions .  As regards official postgraduate courses , master’s and doctoral degrees in artificial intelligence, specific  action will be taken to know the situation in the different universities and promote top -quality,  professionalising and participative programmes partly funded by institutions and companies that use  the technologies in different fields of activity , while considering the possibility of establishing one or  more inter -university courses . The action will be  carried out by a working group consisting of  representatives of universities, knowledge -creating entities and entities that use  AI technologies , so as  to exchange knowledge, experiences and establish appropriate content and the most effective  collaboratio n mechanisms.  At the same time, work will be carried out to internationalise the courses,  with the purpose of attracting international students and foster ing relationships with top -level entities  and specific content. This will be achieved by way of the Erasmus+ programmes through the KA241  collaborative actions and Initial Training Network (ITN-Marie Curie42), respectiv ely, as well as others  that could be implemented in our system in the future, with a view to predoctoral researchers  (R1).   In relation to tea ching and research staff involved in advanced  digital technologies, especially artificial  intelligence, who have reached junior postdoctoral (R2) and senior p ostdoctoral (R3)  stages , with the  inclusion of Catalan and interna tional talent that is currently  distributed all over the world in foreign  research centres, specific actions will be carried out with the purpose of creating a proprietary  programme, CATALONIA.AI TALENT,  based on some of our successful models, like the current ICREA  SÈNIOR43 or previous ICREA JÚNIOR , which may benefit from co -funding opportunities offered by  smart specialisation programmes and the European Social Fund , the real co -funding options of  research and innovation centres and the activities associated to the Marie Cu rie programme within  the Horizon programme, especially  the Cofund  scheme .44 This will guarantee more resources and  increased presence of advanced  digital technologies in general, and artificial intelligence in particular,  throughout our research and innovat ion system .  Programmes for innovati ve talent in AI   In recent years, the Catalan university and research system has reached renowned levels of excellence.  Now is the time to deploy suitable actions to transfer the accomplished level to society , especial ly to  the productive and business network , mostly consisting of SMEs , in such a way the knowledge may                                                              41 https://eacea.ec.europa.eu/erasmus -plus/actions/key -action -2-cooperation -for-innovation -and-exchange -good -practices_en   42 https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/   43 https://www.icrea.cat/es/la -seleccion -de-icrea   44 https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/co -funding -programmes_en  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   35 also create wealth, employment and social improvement. Within this context, it is essential to  encourage professionals in universities and research and innov ation centres to work together with  experts from companies, foster permanent contact by forming joint teams and favour knowledge  transfer.   The development of research and innovation in Catalonia is structured into different levels,  universities, centres, n etworks, departments , consolidated groups and, lastly, individual researchers,  which form a complex ecosystem that is not always well coordinated . As regards this point, the  announcement of grants to support the activities of research groups45 (SGR) provide s the opportunity  to have an advanced map of the existing groups and, in the case of artificial intelligence, those that  work in any area of knowledge . To th is end, a ctions will be performed  focused on boosting training  and attracting projects related to these groups, while working on a similar map for private knowledge creating entities, companies and user institutions . Subsequently, work will be carried out to take  maximum advantage of the opportunities offered by the Industrial Doctoral programme implem ented  a few years ago in Catalonia, which has leading names from Spain and Europe. The programme will act  as a preferential path to connect public centres, institutions and companies interested in digital  transformation and the application of AI technologi es. The results obtained and eventual synergies  could b e the embryo of new appro aches to attract talent, for example, by establishing mixed public private AI units or specific consortiums .  In parallel, thanks to European funds associated to initiatives suc h as RIS3CAT, Cofund and own  resources of the private sector , and as part of the CATALONIA.AI TALENT  programme , work will be  carried out on an initiative for attracting digital talent  to enable permanent contact between research  and innovation centres and companies, possibly within the framework of CATALONIA.AI COMMUNITY   or associated sectoral networks , thus providing investigational and innovation mobility, following  models such as Tecniospring, Beatriu de Pinós Empresa, Connect -EU, Marie Curie Incoming and  Outcoming Grants , and Torres Quevedo, in connection with incubators, innovative companies and  national and international research and innovation centres.   A final very significant fact , albeit rather under -developed , is the lack of professionals dedicated  to  connection within the research and innovation system, other than the people working in offices where  research results  are transferred. The majority of these people have hardly any experience in the digital  field and even less in AI technologies . In thi s regard, the support obtained from universities as a result  of the announcement of grants to carry out knowledge -transfer and assessment unit projects is the  first step for strengthening activities centred on connecting the system as a whole, although it is  insufficient if we l imit ourselves to the general field of digital actions, and artificial intelligence in  particular , while excluding the rest of research and innovation centres. For this reason, there are plans  to promote an activity as part of the CATALONIA.AI TALENT programme  and co -funded by other  receiving centres , with the purpose of incorporating digital innovators , who will work in a network  and  manage innovation and digital knowledge -transfer in a specific area of action , such as innovators o r                                                              45 http://agaur.gencat.cat/ca/beques -i-ajuts/convocatories -per-temes/Ajuts -per-donar -suport -a-les-activitats -dels-grups -de-recerca SGR    
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   36 entrepreneurs in residence to attract ideas and new projects to be developed, as a reference for  companies and institutions interested in digital technologies and linked to artificial intelligence .  Collabora tion with the Barcelona digital talent  alliance   To ensure Barcelona and Catalonia’s competitiveness as a technological pole in advanced  digital  technologies as a whole and, specifically, artificial intelligence, the government of Catalonia in  collaboration with other public and private institutions has  set into motion the BARCELONA DIGITAL  TALENT46 alliance, with the idea of positioning Barcelona as a place with the capacity to create, retain  and attract talent with the necessary knowledge and capabilities to develop this new industry .  Barcelona Digital Talent is an alliance created with the purpose of positioning the city of Barcelona as  a pole of digital talent , thus responding to the lack of specific talent in the city and the increase of  technology -based businesses that need profiles with digital comp etencies. Barcelona’s experience is  highly relevant for the entire region; consequently, work will be carried out with other members of the  alliance to create other poles within Catalonia that can replicate the experience and form other  alliances between companies, public bodies and training centres, similar to the one described for  Barcelona . This territorial digital component , which will be included in the CATALONIA.AI TALENT   programme , will give preference to talent associated to AI development and will  spread this ability to  create, retain and attract talent to the rest of Catalonia.   The work established in the programme will have three facets: promote digital technologies  throughout the region, know the existing professional profiles and identify busin ess requirements.  Likewise, training programmes will be drawn up to satisfy existing need s and will focus on training wellqualified professionals, ranging from university courses to vocational training programmes and the  development of vocational training  in these fields of knowledge. Final ly, working in direct contact with  companies and user institutions, priority will be placed on developing a professional career in artificial  intelligence and in identifying Barcelona and Catal onia as an international pl ace of reference. All these  activities may be co -funded in collaboration with the Servei d’Ocupació de Catalunya  (Catalan  Employment Service) , by way of the innovative and experimental project programme, use of funds  from the European Social Fund, initiati ves associated to the Erasmus+ programme and own resources  from the interested private sector .  Program mes for entrepreneurial talent in artificial intelligence   Artificial intelligence will make it easier to create new applications that may be offered in different  fields of the productive and social network . This will entail the appearance of new companies and  entrepreneur ial programme s, whose objective is to implement and market these technologies in  different sectors , as a renewal point of the Catalan pr oductive network, particularly as regards  knowledge -creators and making professional development really possible for scientists and innovators  in Catalonia .                                                              46 https://barcelonadigitaltalent.com   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   37 In this regard, as part of the Embark Catalonia Programme of the government of Catalonia and the  associated Xarxa Emprèn  network, projects will be promoted to foster entrepreneurial talent  in the AI  environment, while putting priority on this technology in existing programmes in Catalonia that are  directed towards fostering technological development; fo r example, the I NNOVAR  Programme  through start -ups,47 driven by ACCIÓ o r the Knowledge Industry Programme  developed by AGAUR.   An e xample o f this kind of initiative is the programme called AI4ALL , Artificial Intelligence Applied to  Industry ,48 promoted by the UAB Research Park, the Computer Vision Center and the Autonomous  University of Barcelona with the purpose of bringing AI technologies closer, create new market ideas  and help boost Catalonia’s competitiveness in this field. This initiative  forms part of the programme to  promote specialised entrepreneurship in the territory (a pre -accelerator programme ) and constitutes  an embryo of great value as regards developing a programme with a general scope . The work will be  carried out  in collaborati on with the territory, the Catalan Employment Service and the institutions  that use AI technologies, rather than coordinating with other existing public or private initiatives . In  this regard, a programme of reference will be promoted based on existing goo d practices, in  collaboration with public and private stakeholders, especially training centres, research and innovation  centres, business associations and entities that use AI technologies.   In the same way, taking advantage of the opportunities linked to European programmes, efforts will  be made to create an entrepreneurial community in the field of AI technologies , based on the  possibilities offered by the Erasmus+  programmes . This will be a chieved by strategic alliances,  programmes developed by consortiums and the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and  Medium -sized Enterprises programme  (COSME49), through the Erasmus programme for young  entrepreneurs , which will enable exchanges between  new entrepreneurs and  experienced European  entrepreneurs  through the creation of consortiums. In this regard, an initiative associated to Advanced  digital technologies will be developed, especially artificial intelligence, which includes the European  coun tries that have made the most progress in the subject.   Training in artificial intelligence for everyone   Artificial intelligence forms part of our daily lives and in the future, it will have an even greater impact  on all industries and individuals . Everyone  will have the chance to understand what artificial  intelligence really is and the way it could impact our lives; for this reason, it is a priority to democratise  the knowledge of these technologies and empower citizens so they may play a more active role in its  deployment .  In this regard, CATALONIA.AI  includes the implementation of a training programme for citizens , to  teach the basics of artificial intelligence to anyone interested in this technology. The programme will  consist in offering free courses th at will adjust to each student’s needs and capabilities , taking  advantage of existing educational technologies, such as massive open online courses, classroom -based  and online employment and ongoing training programmes , as well as other activities that may  be                                                              47 https://barcelonadigitaltalent.com    48 http://www.accio.gencat.cat/ca/serveis/innovacio/startups -i-innovacio -disruptiva/innovar -a-traves -de-startups/   49 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/smes/cosme_en  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   38 carried out throughout Catalonia , drawing on collaboration with the corresponding public bodies of  the ICT network50 and CatLABS  network ,51 which already exist , or working in cooperation with  technological parks and training entities .  To develop this initiative, an agreement will be established with similar international initiatives  that  have a successful track record, like the course created by the company Reaktor and the University of  Helsinki, Elements of AI ,52 which already has 170,00 students from 110 different countries .  Besides the programme ’s dissemination campaign, agreements will be made with companies and  Catalan institutions  so they may promote training among their collaborators, therefore reaching the  maximum number of entities and citizens in the country .  Foster vocations in artificial intelligence   In a digital society it is absolutely necessary to train both present and future users. In this regard,  schools and the younger students need to know, have contact and be familiar with cutting -edge  technological tools, such as artificial intelligence .  Children feel drawn towards a vocation  during the ir first years at school . This mean s having to design  an effective vocational plan in artificial intelligence within the framework of the STEMcat Plan,  implemented by the government of Catalonia. The Plan should not only include activities in primary  and secondary schools : working with families, giving talks, organising workshops, providing support  networks, carrying out specific activities in  schools and preparing the corresponding teaching and  audio -visual material , but it should consider redesigning primary and secondary curriculum plans to  include content that stimulates computational thinking and prepares students for artificial intelligen ce,  incorporating gender perspective and training teaching staff to introduce this content .  Likewise, within the field of vocational training, it is necessary to guarantee training pathways that are  directly linked to Catalonia’s social and economic requir ements , placing special emphasis on advanced  digital technologies , not included at present as a training speciality in intermediate and higher level  training program mes of the Information and Communications family, apart from specific profiles like  cyberse curity and bioinformatics . Given the lack of digital talent detected, it is indispensable to  establish a specific programme in advanced digital technologies , at intermediate and higher level  vocational training , which ensures a better and fuller inclusion in the employment market and takes  advantage of the poten tialities currently offered by the dual vocational training, among other aspects  to consider .  4.2.3.2 Boost the role of women in artificial intelligence    The extremely low presence of women in the technology industry is a well known  fact. According to a  study drawn up by the Catalan Women's Institute ,53 only 30% of the jobs in the Catalan ICT industry                                                              50http://www.punttic.gencat.cat /  51http:/catlabs.cat/   52https://www.elementsofai.com/    53 http://dones.gencat.cat/ca/detalls/Noticia/Dossier -TIC-2019   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   39 are held by women. Bearing in mind that the report publish ed in November 2018 by the European  Center for the Development of Vocational Training54 forecasts that by 2025, 84.5% of jobs will be in  the technological field, the low presence of women in the industry means that in the near future, they  will run the huge  risk of being excluded from employment for gender reasons .    In the field of universities, the number of men studying information and communications technologies  is four times higher than the number of women ; in the case of computer engineering , one of the  core  degrees in the field of artificial intelligence, the situation is worse, as there is only one woman for every  10 men studying this degree in Catalonia .  The last factor of the equation is that artificial intelligence is an emerging sector in full grow th. In fact,  according to a report published by Randstad, the demand of technological professions in Europe will  increase every year by 14% until 2025 , and artificial intelligence is at the head of this movement. Thus,  the number of professionals required by AI is much higher than the number created by universities. At  the moment, there is a significant lack of professional s, which practically determines full employment  in the sector .  Consequently, we are faced by a picture where there are not enough women at all levels of the ICT  industry, especially in decision -making  positions, and the ir presence in university  degrees that qualify  them for this sector  is extremely low. However, the re is room to reverse this trend as the offer is  sufficiently large for eve ryone .  It is important to work towards rebalancing the presence of women in the sector for a number of  reasons :  1. The intention is to comply with article 32 of Act 17/2015, of 21 July, on effective equality between  women and men and establishes measures to ensure equality between men and women in access  to work, vocational training, professional promotion and working conditions .   2. Given the lack of professionals qualified to work in the general ICT industry, the re are huge   opportunities to access the employme nt market of this sector, particularly for women .  Consequently, in view of the trend of the employment sector, access to the employment market is  guaranteed for women with technical qualifications .  3. A plural view always enriches the exercise of professions and ICT is not an exception. A feminine  view is necessary to build a comprehensive and equalitarian future. Women’s perspectives create  quite a conclusive differentiating factor : according to Forbes, whenever women have led projects  and/or companies, they have overcome situations of crisis with greater success .  There are basically two  critical points in this aspect: very few girls have a technological vocation , so  their interest in technolog y-based professions needs to be awakened and they must be encourage d to  study scientific and technical degrees, and women encounter difficulties when it comes to exercising  leadership in the sector, which implies promoting the participation of women in the management of  organisations in technological fields .                                                                 54 http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   40 Catal onia is aware of the situation and a first network of agents is currently tackling the problem. The  government is deploying the Pla Dona TIC  (Women's ICT Plan), promoted by the Catalan ministry for  Digital Policy and Public Administration, thus providing a n inst itutional protective framework for  boosting female presence in the ICT industry . In recent years, emblematic entities of the AI sector have  set a benchmark  with their gender structures in these matters , for ex ample, the Col·legi Oficial  d’Enginyeria Informàtica de Catalunya  (Catalan Association of Computer Engineering)  and the gender gap commission, Dones COEINF, the Catalan Association for Artificial Intelligence and the donesIAcat  working group and the UPC with its Aquí STEAM  programme, which, in tu rn, collaborate with other  entities to study the gender gap in artificial intelligence and computer engineering and help reduce it .     In this regard, the CATALONIA.AI Strategy will focus on drawing up an action plan that will be  developed within the framework of the Pla Dona TIC , implemented by the government of Catalonia ,  with the collaboration of different existing initiatives. The plan will have the following objectives :     Encourag e early vocations in technology;    Balance the presence of women in ICT training and skills within the field of vocational training,  university studies and postgraduate courses;    Foster ongoing training that requalifies women so they may enter the AI sector;    Ensure women have equal rights to access employment in the sector ;   Enable mechanisms to encourage women to continue exercising the profession within the field of  artificial intelligence throughout their entire  working lives;    Encourage companies, entities, and public and private bodies to establish professional careers  that enable women to reach leadership positions with equal opportunities ;   Especially prevent the flight of female talent and encourage migrated human capital to return .   Establi sh a  legal order for gender -related actions in the field of artificial intelligence and  technologies in general to increase the effectiveness of actions aimed towards achieving the  objectives described above in which women and men collaborate together under th ese  guidelines .   It is important at all levels to make known and give visibility to successful women, both in schools and  the Catalan society in general. This may be carried out on a small scale  by giving ta lks in the different  forums mentioned above, awarding prizes to recognise the achievements of women in technology  (there ar e already a few in Catalonia ), or at a larger scale, by means  of actions on social media,  coordinated with well -known influencers or influencers like YouTubers or YouTube personalities with  the highest number of followers , writing stories or comics where women appear with technological  roles and their presence in the media, news programmes or series where visibility is given to these  leading names or which show what it means to develop a profession in the field of artificial intelligence.   As regards leadership, the development of a plan to support women’s working lives in the AI field that  combines services related to professional guidan ce, requalification, ongoing training, work -life balance  and professional promotion that respects the specific conditions of female s in professional  development and the system of valid accreditations. Incentives for companies with female managers, 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   41 subsidy programmes in the field of artificial intelligence led by women (at either a professional or  research level)  could effectively help reverse the current trend in the sector .  A fourth pivotal element will be the establish ment of  mechanisms to identif y and qu antify the flight of  female talent in the past and institutional actions will be designed to facilitate the return of this talent.   Several small actions are currently underway in many fields : schools, companies, entities and  institutions that work in this direction , donesCOEINF, donesIAcat, the fent.talent  platform and the  Aquí  STEAM programme are just a few examples, though there are many more . It is essential to identify,  arrange and coordinate these actions, strategically integrating them into more effective instruments  in the Catalan society , so they may work as a whole with greater strength , thus increasing their  impact,  which will be appropriately monitored and measured . As mentioned above, the establishment of a  general regulation would help mult iply the effect of this network, which is already in operation .  It is worth pointing out that all these actions will only be possible if they are performed by women and  men working together . Furthermore, even if the necessary resources are provided, the ac tions w ould   not be possible without the tireless work carried out by volunteers, who are currently moving them  forwards Consequently, both women and men, as well as institutions need to be made aware of the  matter.   4.2.4 Infrastructures and data   One of the  European Commission’s priorities in its strategic proposal for the development of artificial  intelligence in Europe is precisely making the access to data easier and more secure to be able to  explore and deploy all the potentialities of artificial intelligence . In fact, without quality data it would  not be possible to properly develop artificial intelligence; therefore, the Catalan strategy also considers  that accessing and sharing data with the aim of developing products and services with artificia l  intelligence is one of the first priorities.   4.2.4.1  Promo tion of laboratories and infrastructures    The rapid evolution of the market, not only in the field of artificial intelligence, but also in the general  technology field , and a need to search for go od solutions to problems that must be fast and smooth  when accessing the market, as well as capable of adapting to the market’s reality translates into the  need to create a prototyping environment that allows to share  experiences, data, algorithms, modules ,  computer capacity, etc. in order to test and adapt solutions to the market.   CATALONIA.AI LAB  will be implemented as a sharing and testing environment that acts as a window  open to ideas and surrounding initiatives, which can then be gathered and classifi ed: social innovation  by people for people . It has a dual purpose, to promote the technology sector offering access to  infrastructure and boost open innovation with companies and public bodies through t heir participation  in pilot tests.   The work in this field will also count on the collaboration of specialised research and innovation agents  to provide the projects with existing computer and data -analysis infrastructure; for example, the 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   42 Barcelona Supercomputing Center, Institut de Robòtic a i Informàtica Industrial, the Industrial Platform  4.0 or the labs and demonstration area of the Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence, among  others .  4.2.4.2  Access and sharing of data   One of the essential and differentiating components of an ar tificial intelligence system are the  necessary data to feed any AI system and its appropriate training  process . The quality of the data set,  the iterations and the suitability of the  algorithm training are very important in any AI project .  As regards this p oint, the following actions will be promoted :   Publi sh and make available quality open data and improve local research groups’ access to the  information and enable the use of verified information that helps develop the best solutions  possible .   Promo te and participate in markets of correct and secure data with other AI communities and  ecosystems. The volume and diversity of the data largely contribute to the quality and excellence  of the results obtained .   Promo te the production and donation of open an d private data as a fundamental right  of the  person and as a legacy of quality  and social benefit .    4.2.5  Adop tion of artificial intelligence    Although at first AI techniques were created with large technology -related companies in mind, more  and more companies and public bodies are starting to adopt AI -based solutions. This is due to different  factors : better and cheaper computer capacities, increased and better features in mechanical and  repetitive processes , increased availability of corporate and ex ternal data, development of prediction  capacities and an increasingly more positive correlation between applicability and benefits.   In this regard, one of the most important pivotal elements of CATALONIA.AI will be to foster and  accelerate AI adoption proc esses in Catalonia’s different industrial sectors, as well as in Public  Administration itself .  4.2.5.1  Public Administration as a pioneer in the application of artificial intelligence   Public Administration is a major data creator, manager and container; th erefore, it has to lead and set  an example as a user of artificial intelligence . The objective is to become an  intelligent, efficient and  transparent administrator with digital, proactive and personalised public services  that simplifies the  relationship be tween citizens and optimises their management through process automation .  The application of artificial intelligence at the service of the public offers citizens direct and indirect  benefits. The direct benefits include those resulting from the application  of artificial intelligence to  respond to citizens’ specific needs . Artificial intelligence facilitates and speeds up customer services, it 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   43 makes it easier to fill in forms, pay taxes, diagnose illnesses, take decisions and protect personal data,  etc. This new typology of solutions redounds in indirect benefits , improving the quality of public  service s, whether it simplifies processes, increas es efficiency, controls fraud, optimises r esources or  enables smart management .  The Catalan Public Administration has to be the driving force behind AI solutions. Guided by the  different government ministries , together with the pertinent bodies it has to gradually adopt AI  solutions . However, the goal will only be achievable if it has reliable data and a suitable testin g  environment for improving public services ; it will also be necessary to promote a set of initiatives  aimed towards accelerating the uptake of innovative technologies when using the data and artificial  intelligence, which include the following :  Opportunit y detection programme   To enable Public Administration to boost the use of AI technology, a first line of action will be to set up  a programme to detect and analyse use cases and improvement opportunities for the different  departments  and bodies of the gove rnment of Catalonia .  The goal is to determine how the government of Catalonia and citizens will benefit from technologies   of this kind, in regard to specific applications .  AI observatory for Public Administration    Given the speed at which these kind of technologies are developed and implemented around the  world, an AI observatory will be set up, which will take charge of identifying, classifying and analysing  the trends, evolution, technological development and deployment of artificial intelligence, both  in  Catalonia and abroad, as well as assess the different initiatives underway in Catalonia and share the  conclusions and created knowledge .  Development of use cases    In view of the different points mentioned in this section, the government of Catalonia wi ll promote the  development of proofs of concept and projects that use AI technologies in the different governmental  areas , with the purpose of improving public digital services .  In this regard, an interministerial working group will be created that will  be in charge of identifying,  prioritising and boosting the deployment of this technology in the different departments  and bodies  of the government of Catalonia .  CATALONIA.AI CHALLENGE   In order to involve developers, entrepreneurs, start -ups, and small and medium enterprises of  Catalonia’s AI ecosy stem so they may create new technological solutions, there are plans to launch  CATALONIA.AI CHALLENGE, a competi tion that connects the problems and challenges raised by Public  Administration with the proposals offe red by the Catalan AI ecosystem, in order to develop proofs of  concept and innovative solutions that respond to the outlined challenges.  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   44 4.2.5.2  The development of artificial intelligence in strategic sectors   The characteristics of AI tec hnologies will lead to the appearance of new products and services  specifically aimed towards key economic sectors, including transport, health , the manufacturing  industry , logistics and the media , thus enabling them to make use of the benefits of disruptive  innovations and improve their competitiveness in comparison to other international environments.  Likewise, AI technologies are frequently in the pipeline, although there are already effective products  in the market ; consequently, different technological waves are expe cted, meaning that continuous  cooperation between the different stakeholders of the ecosystem is even more important .  In this regard, a sectoral revitalisation programme  will be set in motion to attract business and social  challenges, with the aim of devel oping specific services and solution s adapted to existin g needs . Cocreation activities will be carried out to generate proposals that join the supply  and demand  in different  sectors into a single space, so as to analyse potential use cases, view success s tories and identify  required proofs of concept , taking advantage of existing programmes or new options that could  appear. W ithin this context, the connection activities may be developed as scientific -business forums  or gatherings, or through connections with clusters and associations that guarantee maximum  effectiveness and sectoral representation, together with the support of the differ ent government  departments and local public bodies that promote technological initiatives of a sectoral nature .  It is th erefore a matter of identifying the main use cases applicable to artificial intelligence in each  sector , disseminate them among businesses and accompany them in their implementation process.  Whenever necessary, companies will be encouraged to carry out r esearch and innovation in artificial  intelligence, whether it is internal or external (in this case especially fostering technology transfer with  the TECNIO Centres). The centre of excellence in artificial intelligence referred to above will be the  most suit able environment for starting many of these initiatives .  The development of this sectoral revitalisation programme will involve prioritising field s where  artificial intelligence is used, according to the leading sectors of RIS3CAT, which does not rule out  development in strategic projects in other fields. The priority sectors are initially the following :  Agri-food industry   The agri sector  (agricultur e, livestock , fishing and silviculture ) and agri -food  (manufacture of food and  drink ) represent s 17% of the Catalonia’s industrial gross domestic product (GDP). During the last 20  years, the sector’s transformation capacity has converted the agri -food industry into a fundamental  part of Catalan manufacturing and, at the same time, into one of the main driving for ces behind the  change and transformation of the region’s economic model . With over 3,500 companies , the agri -food  industry is the industrial branch in Catalonia with the highest turnover , it is the main export sector and  is Europe’s top agri -food cluster .   The application and use of artificial intelligence would focus on optimising natural resources and from  the very beginning it is closely linked to the internet of things ( IoT), which would increase the efficiency  and traceability of agricultural operation s.  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   45 The energy saving and optimisation of natural and own resources open up a wide range of possibilities  to be explored. Considering the weight of the sector in Catalonia, this would be one of the priority  sectors to develop.   Health and well -being   The hea lth sector is one of the fields where the use of artificial intelligence has the longest history and  a greater projection . This prioritisation is based on two main vectors: i ncreased life expectancy  and the  projected savings from using artificial intellige nce in health .   In the mental health field , artificial intelligence can contribute with innovative non -invasive diagnostic  procedures to identify illnesses before symptoms appear and help with profitable triage techniques.  Speech and writing analyses are a lready used among other techniques to detect changes in behaviour  and even suicidal tendencies. AI -powered social robotics could provide alternative therapies that go  beyond conventional treatment; for example, helping people who suffer autism spectrum dis order.   The wide variety of existing medical data (for example, the clinical records  of people living in Catalonia ),  protocolisation  of diagnoses and treatments, advances in computer vision and speed with which a  large amount of information can be interpreted, used and accessed , in addition to current trends in  preventive and personalised medicine, mean that there is a wide field of re search for artificial  intelligence and it can provide a high amount of value .  Furthermore, the pharmaceutical industry is one of the sectors that benefits from these techniques by  using supercomputing and simulation to create and assess new medicinal produ cts.  Experienced -based cultural industries    The sector known as experiences comprises tourism and culture. The technology applied to these two  industries can improve and increase productivity and promote offers and services, while providing  information abo ut the offer of competitors and the behaviour of potential customers . In this regard,  AI techniques have great potential in specific topics such as marketing, social media management,  personalisation of experiences, customer loyalty, improvement of the exi sting offer, etc.   Another feature  worth pointing out, of a cross -cutting nature, is that artificial intelligence can be used  to analyse and interpret existing data gathered from all this activity , thus improving future plans and  strategies.   Mobilit y  This s ector encompasses all the agents that work to develop solutions to make mobility and transport  more sustainable: the automotive industry (manufacturers and suppliers), railway industry, physical  infrastructures, transport and infrastructure operators, flee t managers, the logistics industry and  advanced mobility of people , ICT services (mobile technologies, V2X communications, self-driving cars ,  etc.), energy distributors, the energy supply industry  (electric vehicle charging points , alternative fuels,  etc.), public bodies and other institutions with authority in the management and safety of transport in 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   46 Catalonia, or promoters, legislators or users of corporate fleets, universities, research centres and  technology centres, as well as individual or collecti ve users, for private means or as a company/entity.   Self-driving vehicles, new means of transport, traffic planning and management, such as the adaptive  traffic signal control system , are just a small example of the fields of application of data convergenc e,  the internet of things and artificial intelligence . Redu ce pollution, prevent accidents and provide  everyone with transport and the possibility to move around are the priorities of this field .  Energ y and sustainability   Technology can become a catalyst f or social innovation, the internationally approved common  framework to orchestrate the action of responsible technology in society, within the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development. These are the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals for 2030) On 25  Septem ber 2015, the United Nations identified the 17 sustainable development goals that act as  guidelines for social and business action . The fact that the United Nations recognises the use of data  as a mechanism for revolution ising social systems has led to dif ferent international data -based   initiatives (for example, data4sdg.org and undatarevolution.org) to approach this matter . For this  reason, artificial intelligence plays a key role in the development of this new framework and the  implementation of the SDGs,  one of the government’s priorities .  The con tribution to circular economy, the fight against climate change and sustainable energy are  fields where artificial intelligence can and must contribute more .  Industry  4.0   Industry 4.0 will transform design, production systems and the products themselves. It is estimated  that connectivity between all the systems (known as cyber -physical systems ) throughout the value  chain and going beyond a single company, along with the interaction between the different parts ,  machines and humans , will make production systems 30% faster and 25% more efficient . Furthermore,  it will take mass customisation of products to new levels . Manufacturing will go from automated  individual parts to fully integrated automated facilities th at communicate between each other. It will  be possible to compile and analyse data between machines, which will lead to faster, more flexible and  efficient processes to produce higher -quality goods at a lower cost. This will increase productivity,  foster i ndustrial growth, modify the workforce profile and redefine the dynamics of global  competitiveness in companies and regions.   Artificial intelligence associated to industry 4.0 will play a fundamental role, as it facilitates the  transformation of data into knowledge by creati ng expert systems based on algorithms, predictive  models or machine learning solutions , so as to analyse data and facilitate decision -making , or also  incorporate smart functions into their components or associated systems, to access their full  traceability, their customisation according to customers’ requirements or the generation of new  disruptive business models based on the collection, analysis and use of the created data. In conclusion,  to increase competitiveness within in dustry 4.0, artificial intelligence will have a decisive role .  Within this field, the government of Catalonia is promoting the I ndustry  4.0 programme to encourage  technology transformation in companies established in Catalonia, including services and the 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   47 technological capabilities associated to the use and implementation of solutions for AI -based  companies .  4.2.6  Ethics and society   It is necessary to guarantee that the uses of artificial intelligence are focused on humans’ well -being:  artificial intelligenc e must be developed, applied and used with an ethical purpose based on  fundamental rights, our social and cultural values, and the ethical principles of beneficence, autonomy  of human beings, justice and the necessary explainability of their results . Impor tant grounds when  working towards achieving a really secure artificial intelligence .  The design of new applications and tools based on artificial intelligence must pay special attention to  situations that affect vulnerable groups, such as children, disabled people, elderly people or minorities,  or asymmetric situations related to power or information, such as those between employers and  employees or companies and consumers, and be aware that artificial intelligence, even if it offers  considerable ben efits for people and society, it could have a negative impact. Public Administration  and society need to be aware of these matters of special concern .  Mechanisms and requirements need to be incorporated to ensure the security of artificial intelligence,  and must include elements to be able to audit and evaluat e algorithms, procedures and traceability of  the use of these technologies. Artificial intelligence should be used in a responsible, sensible and  secure way and must include ethical reasoning, in terms  of following and maintaining tradition and the  European differentiating fact for everything that affects people and their development, as well as  guarantee ing justice, transparency and lawfulness.   4.2.6.1  Crea tion of the AI Ethics Observatory   Among other fields, CATALONIA.AI  has to stand at the helm of ethics and good practices in the use  and design of artificial intelligence . It must not o nly adhere to the ethics guidelines for secure  artificial intelligence presented by the European Commission, the Barcelona Declaration of March  2017 and Montréal Declaration of December 2018, but also propose actions, ideas and principles to  safeguard ethi cal and legal principles centred on people’s well -being , the ultimate goal of artificial  intelligence.   The Observatory will create a working group that will investigate ethical impact, establish guidelines  to publish the best practices in this field and sh are this knowledge and work with other international  bodies, especially The Partnership on AI55 and The AI4EU Platform.   4.2.6.2  Promo tion of spaces to debate and reflect upon the impact of AI on society   There is absolutely no doubt that artificial intellige nce will impact our society , although people are  beginning to ask if the impact will be positive or negative . In this regard, society is starting to demand                                                              55 https://www.partnershiponai.org   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   48 a certain ethical framework that defines the basic principles for a sustainable and responsible  development of artificial intelligence; as a result, competent institutions and leading groups in the  subject have begun to respond to this social demand .  It is important to open this debate to society as a whole, not just leave it in the hands of experts ; spaces  should be provided where people can reflect upon the purpose of artificial intelligence and how it  benefits citizens. These spaces for reflection must include dissemination activities and, at the same  time, be in contact with other international co mmunities so they can join in the debate. These actions  need to result in a true  story that puts an end to the false ideas surround ing artificial intelligence and  clarifies the benefits and risks we will face if we do not ensure the technology is developed  in an ethical  and responsible manner.   In this regard, CATALONIA.AI will collaborate with the Digital Future Society  programme ,56  implemented by the Mobile World Capital Barcelona, which includes a global think tank focused on  analysing the impact of techno logy on society. One of the main topics under study is the impact of  artificial intelligence . The goal is to connect the local ecosystem and the conclusions obtained in  Catalonia with international agents and experts participating in the programme .  In addi tion, citizen science activities will be launched  with collaboration of the CatLABS  network , driven  by the government of Catalonia with groups to stimulate the activities, where citizens may experiment  with artificial intelligence for themselves and provide us with their own conclusions . An example of  an  activity in this field is ExperimentAI ,57 promoted by the Computer Vision Center  and the Autonomous  University of Barcelona in the Library Living Lab of Sant Cugat. The project’s main purpose is to hel p  democratise universal access to knowledge and innovation for everyone , by starting up a co -creation  space to enable citizens, different social stakeholders and professional groups to respond to the  challenges society face as the result of c omputer vision  technology and artificial intelligence .                                                                   56 https://digitalfuturesociety.com/    57 http://librarylivinglab.cvc.uab.cat/calendar/experimentai -the-impact -of-artificial -intelligence -in-society/?lang=es   
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   49 5. Conclusions     It is evident that artificial intelligence plays a leading role in a technological revolution that will  considerably transform society and economy. Catal onia has to develop and execute a strategy in this  regard that is capable of turning this transformation into an important contribution that will benefit  society and the business and economic network of the entire territory .  Catal onia has excellent capabilities  that make it a n ideal country to stand at the forefront of artificial  intelligence. These capabilities include research and innovation capacity, the available  supercomputing, robotics and telecommunications infrastructures that already exist, research centres  with a  consolidated  reputation, capa city and experience , a notable posi tion as a country for attracting  investment and talent, start -ups and previously established companies, a first -rate digital ecos ystem  and the fact that Barcelona is the World Mobile Capital and venue of the world’s most important  technology fairs .   The government has put priority on promoting artificial intelligence and aims to support the  deployment of AI technology, thus making Catalonia a renowned pole of attraction for r esearch,  innovation and talent, companies and in vestors in the field of artificial intelligence .  With this objective, the government is promoting Catal onia’s  Artificial Intelligence Strategy. Under the  name of CATALONIA.AI, it will deploy a programme of specific actions to strengthen the AI ecosystem  existing in Catalonia and lead knowledge generation, social and business application and create  solutions based on artificial intelligence aimed towards fostering economic growth and improving  people’s lives.   Catal onia’s  Artificial Intelligence Strategy is coordinated by the Secretariat for Digital Polic y of the  Catalan Ministry for Digital Policy and Public Administration of the government of Catalonia, with the  direct collaboration of the Secretariat of Business and Com petitiveness and Secretariat of Universities  and Research of the Ministry of Business and Knowledge, and the participation of the remaining  ministries.   CATALONIA.AI  will deploy a multi -sectoral, cross -cutting strategic plan that focuses on people, which  prioritises sectors such as healthcare, mobility, sustainability, productive economy, the agri -food  sector and public services, which will be built around the pivotal elements listed below:   • Ecosystem: promote a cross -cutting governance model that supports th e development of a  coordinated ecosystem of artificial intelligence connected to the rest of the world.   • Research and innovation: boost research and innovation by applying specific instruments and  establishing synergies between public authorities, specialis ed research and innovation centres  and organisations that use artificial intelligence intensively.   • Talent: create, attract and retain specialised talent that fosters the development of artificial  intelligence solutions and transfer of knowledge to society,  while training citizens and  professionals of other sectors to be ready for its impact.   • Infrastructure and data: have the necessary infrastructures for the development of artificial  intelligence and provide secure access to public and private data.  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   50 • Adoptio n of artificial intelligence: promote the incorporation of artificial intelligence to drive  innovation in public administration and strategic sectors, including agri -food, healthcare and well being, the environment, mobility, tourism, culture and industry.   • Ethics and society: promote the development of ethical artificial intelligence that respects  applicable legislation, is compatible with our social and cultural norms and focuses on people.   Catal onia’s  Artificial Intelligence Strategy must be shared by all  the bodies that form part of Catalan  Public Administration, as well as the agents of the private sector, since artificial intelligence will lead  to transformations and changes in fields that cross the borders of technology, research and  investigation  and include people, ethics, the employment environment, the legislative field, education,  public services and the transformation of productive sectors .

      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   53 Annexe  I. Artificial intelligence in Catalan universities     Section 3.1.1 Universit ies identifies the main research groups or centres in different Catalan  universities that develop artificial intelligence or work intensively with this technology. Detailed  information regarding the implication of Catalan universities in AI development is provided below .   - Polytechnic University of Catalonia  (UPC)   The UPC particularly stands out in AI field . Intensive research on artificial intelligence carried out  by different groups of the UPC, s ome of which have been pioneers in this area for 40 years, led to  the creation in 2017 of the specific research centre for Intelligent Data Science and Artificial  Intelligence (IDEAI -UPC58), which dedicates its efforts in resolving real problems related to the most  immediate economic and industrial context .  This centre acts as an umbrella that joins competencies of a wide s pectrum  in this discipline and   complementary approaches . It is important to point out that one of the groups that forms part of  IDEAI, the Knowledge Engineering and Machine Learning Group (KEMLg59), is one of  the first AI  research centres in Catalonia and it in 1985, it introduced the PhD in Artificial Intelligence, the first  in Spain . Managed by the UPC, it led to the creation of the inter -university master’s degree in  artificial intelligence that from the beginning has been a pproached with a comprehensive  perspective for Catalonia . The course is coordinated by the UPC, UB and URV  and attracts a high  number of international students .  The activity of the IDEAI -UPC research centre focuses on seven strategic lines of application :  educa tion; environmental and sustainability systems ; inclusi on, health and well -being ; ind ustry  4.0; digital society ; econom y; ethics and responsibility , with th e intention to foster talent and  innovation  and address the ethical aspects surrounding the discipline .  To face the current challenges in these areas, the IDEAI -UPC research centre boosts research and  technology  transfer in the following fields of artifici al intelligence and intelligent  data sc ience :  - Machine learning algorithms : this line of research defines the basic nature that brings  together the different research groups . These systems have the capacity to learn and improve  from experience, without havi ng to be explicitly programmed . Work is carried out in fields  such as the development of smart agents, analysis of social structure dynamics, construction  of formal models to define norms and rules for ecommerce, design of information flow  processes , reaso ning based on tempor al episodes , argumentation methods, hybrid methods  between statistics and artificial intelligence, Bayesian networks, case -based reasoning,  supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques, identifica tion and construction of  know ledge models, knowledge representation , ontologies , social media , Semantic Web , web  services, etc.                                                               58 https://ideai.upc.edu/en    59 https://kemlg.upc.edu/ca  
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   54   - Data science and data engineering : research on methodologies to find, process, analyse and  extract relevant knowledge contained in data to support decision -making, among other  features .     - Natural language and voice processing systems : this line centres on language processing,  mainly written and spoken. The wide variety  of problems related to language processing  ranges from basic processing tasks (morphologica l, syntactical and semantic analysis ) to  applications of a higher level (information extraction, machine translation, automatic  summarisation, question answering, dialogue systems, etc. ). As regards voice, specialised  techniques are used to recognise disco urse from audio signals and conceptualise it with the  previously described natural language tools, as well as construct verbal discourse using  specialised databases . This is one of the few scientific fields that needs to develop specific  resources for each  language . IDEAI -UPC has resources in different Community and non Community languages.     - Intelligent systems to support decision -making : this line of research works on the creation of  algorithms , cognitive models and intelligent visualisation to effectively  support decision making by individuals and/or companies . The areas of application where IDEAI -UPC has  experience include healthcare, environmental processes and systems, social and internet based systems, and the industrial and business sector .     - Computer  vision : with expertise in visual signal processing techniques to analys e and  represent visual content, used in interaction  [interf aces , smart -rooms) , biomedical imaging  and remote sensing, audio -visual production and security . The centre’s experience in  representation of content includes video compression and indexing in accordance with  international standards, such as MPEG -4 and MPEG -7.    - Cognitive systems and computational thinking : this line of research is the result of combining  the experience of the di fferent groups that form part of the research centre in the  development of computer systems capable of employing different forms of knowledge to  think autonomously and/or semi -autonomously, often in social environments and in  cooperation with other intelli gent tools (including humans ).    - Applications used to (i) identif y and define real, more complex problems that require really  intelligent solutions ; (ii) ac hieve feedback in the developments performed ; and  (iii) interac tion  with the surrounding industrial a nd socio -economic network, thus adding value .  The UPC ha s created a complex network of international alliances with other universities, research  institutions and companies that draw up new projects and support a high number of initiatives in  which the word collaboration  is the key element . A global and interconnected world that fosters 
      Catalonia’s Artificial Intelligence Strategy   55 sharing knowledge and experiences is the background of the action of these alliances without  borders .  - Autonomous Uni versity of Barcelona  (UAB)   The UAB campus has two leading AI centres : The Artificial Intelligence Research Institute  (IIIA60)  and the Computer Vision Center  (CVC61).   The Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (IIIA) was founded in 1994 by a group of res earchers  from the Department of Artificial Intelligence of the Centre for Advanced Studies in Blanes (CEAB).  The IIIA is a member of the CSIC, which is an ‘a ggregated  entity’ of the International Campus of  Excellence (UAB -CEI) and has nearly 50 researchers  and engineers. Annexe II describes this centre  in greater detail.    El Computer Vision Center  (CVC) was founded in 1995 by the government of Catalonia and the  Autonomous University of Barcelona. It focuses on research in the field of computer vision and is   a leader in the creation of knowledge in this field , with over 130 researchers , advanced hardware  and software resources for computer vision . The centre covers an area of 2,000 m2 dedicated to  R&D of excellence . Annexe II describes this centre in greater detail .  The UAB also has a Department of Computer Science, which is in charge of teaching the subjects  related to artificial intelligence  (information technology , data engineering , computational  mathematics ), and is at the helm of the Inter -university Master’s Degree  in Computer Vision .  - Pompeu Fabra University (UPF)   Numerous research groups belong to the Department of Information and Communications  Technologies at Pompeu Fabra  University , incl uding the artificial intelligence and machine  learning group, COLT, WSSC, etc.   The group research covers several fields, including :   Automated planning : is the model -based approach to intelligent behavio ur, where conduct is  not programmed or learned, but effectively derived from a model of the agent’s goals, and in  the way that the actions and sensors work in the world.      Natural language : two groups (TRL -IULATERM and COLT) study natural language processing in  the Department of Translation and Language Sciences at the UPF.
