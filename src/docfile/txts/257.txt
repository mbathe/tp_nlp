The European Law Institute (ELI) is an independent non-profit organisation established to initiate, conduct  and facilitate research, make recommendations and provide practical guidance in the field of European legal  development. Building on the wealth of diverse legal traditions, its mission is the quest for better law-making  in Europe and the enhancement of European legal integration. By its endeavours, ELI seeks to contribute to the  formation of a more vigorous European legal community, integrating the achievements of the various legal  cultures, endorsing the value of comparative knowledge, and taking a genuinely pan-European perspective.  As such, its work covers all branches of the law: substantive and procedural; private and public.  ELI is committed to the principles of comprehensiveness and collaborative working, thus striving to bridge the  oft-perceived gap between the different legal cultures, between public and private law, as well as between  scholarship and practice. To further that commitment it seeks to involve a diverse range of personalities,  reflecting the richness of the legal traditions, legal disciplines and vocational frameworks found throughout  Europe. ELI is also open to the use of different methodological approaches and to canvassing insights and  perspectives from as wide an audience as possible of those who share its vision.

I. Background6I. Background The intensive and extensive use of algorithms has  pervaded an immense and growing variety of tasks,  activities, and decision-making processes in the digital  economy. In an over-informed society, automation is  key to managing complexity, curbing uncertainty,  performing mass activities at an affordable cost and  to ensuring effectiveness in the processing of data,  information, and digital content. From basic tasks  (searching, comparing, ordering, prioritising), to  more sophisticated added-value services (profiling,  personalising, recommending, multi-attribute  rating, filtering, content moderation, algorithmic  management, complaint handling), all are performed  by algorithm-driven systems.   Algorithmic automation provides efficiency,  dramatically reduces transaction costs, streamlines  processes, and assists decision-making in complex  contexts. Rating, ranking, recommender systems  or comparators are extremely helpful tools, which  assist users in making informed decisions. Profiling,  personalising or contextualising solutions enable  companies to successfully reach their prospective  customers with targeted communications,  personalised offers, and customised services.  Algorithms are instrumental in rendering flagging,  filtering, content moderation or content removal  feasible, affordable, and effective. Algorithms are vital  to managing complexity, uncertainty, and virality in  contemporary societies.    However, at the same time, significant risks and  undesired effects of algorithm-driven systems for  society are becoming increasingly perceptible.  Algorithmic logic may perpetuate choices and  preferences, radicalise speech, polarise public  opinion in echo chambers and ideological silos, reduce diversity, enlarge bias and discrimination  divides, standardise behaviour on the basis of  stereotypes, lead to opaque decisions that leave  victims undefended, stoke the virality of fake news,  encroach upon free speech, or distort consumers’  choices with misleading ratings, rankings, dark  patterns, or recommendations.  The potential, as well as the inherent risks, of  automation for the future of the digital society have  not gone unnoticed in the European Union (EU).  On the contrary, the principles of transparency,  explainability, risk assessment, and human oversight  of algorithm-driven systems are crystallising in the EU  legislative initiatives adopted in the last few years and  in those proposed more recently.   Inter alia, article 22 of the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR)1 on decisions based solely on  automated processing, including profiling, has long  been the centerpiece of the EU’s legal approach to  automated decision-making (ADM) and embodies  its main policy goals. The Platform-to-Business  Regulation (P2B Regulation)2 confirms these policy  goals with transparency requirements in the  provision of ranking services. Likewise, algorithmic  accountability and transparency also bolster some  obligations laid down in the proposed Digital Services  Act (DSA)3 – with respect to recommender systems,  terms and conditions, and content moderation. Risks  arising from algorithmic decisions are acknowledged  throughout the proposal and, accordingly, included  in the risk assessment and subject to risk-mitigating  measures that apply to very large online platforms. In  addition, the proposed Artificial Intelligence Act (AI  Act)4 represents a risk-based approach to AI systems  and the consolidation of certain principles, which aim  1Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free  movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) [2016] OJ L119/1.  2 Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of 20 June 2019 on promoting fairness and transparency for business users of online intermediation services [2019] OJ  L186/57.   3 Commission, ‘Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on a Single Market For Digital Services (Digital Services Act) and  amending Directive 2000/31/EC’ COM (2020) 825 final.  4 Commission, ‘Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on Artificial Intelligence  (Artificial Intelligence Act) and amending certain Union legislative acts’ COM (2021) 206 final. 
I. Background7at providing guidance as to the placing on the market  and the use of AI on the basis of its intended purpose.  The recent Proposal for a Directive on improving  working conditions in platform work5 (Directive on  Platform Work) devotes its Chapter III to algorithmic  management under the principles of transparency,  human monitoring, and human review of significant  decisions.      All the above references show that automated  decision-making systems are attracting regulatory  attention in the EU. Nevertheless, rules related to  automated processes are scattered in different pieces  of legislation, are partial in their scope, and are  unharmonised. Some rules are sector-specific, while  others apply solely to certain types of automated  systems (rating, recommender systems, algorithmic  management). Besides, despite the fact that the  main policy goals are enshrined in a number of legal  provisions (relating to transparency, explainability,  and human monitoring), their implementation is still  uncertain in practice, may be unfeasible or too costly,  or may become significantly complex.   Hence, even if useful rules on algorithm-based systems  and automated means can already be found in the  EU legislative scene, they do not form a consistent,  coherent, and all-embracing body of principles/rules  governing automated decision-making systems.    5 Commission, ‘Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on improving working conditions in platform work’ COM (2021)  762 final.  
II. Conceptualising ADM8II. Conceptualising ADM  Automation and algorithmic processes have  intensively permeated EU regulation. Automation  is explicitly mentioned, or is implicitly referred to, in  several provisions of the most recent pieces of EU  legislation. Legislation and legal proposals such as  the GDPR, DSA, the proposed Digital Markets Act  (DMA),6 and P2B Regulation refer to algorithmic  rating, algorithmic decision-making, algorithmic  recommender systems, algorithmic content  moderation, algorithmic structures, automated  profiling, or a variety of activities and actions  conducted by automated means. Nevertheless, there  is neither a unified concept of ADM nor harmonised  terminology to describe such a wide variety of  automated processes. The definition of ‘AI systems’ ,7  for the purposes of the AI Act,8 does, however, provide  key elements to enable the formulation of a working  definition of ADM:   1. inputs (these can be human-based inputs,  machine-generated data, or interactions with the  environment);   2. pre-defined objectives ;  3. techniques and approaches to achieve those  objectives ; and   4. outputs (deliver, enable or support content  moderation; ratings, rankings, predictions or  recommendations; online advertising; complaint  handling and dispute resolution; traceable traders  (Know Your Business User approach); algorithmic  management in platforms; credit scoring; pricing,  trading and investing, or compliance).  Based on the above-mentioned elements, for the  purposes of this Innovation Paper, the following  definition of ADM is proposed:   ADM is a (computational) process, including  AI techniques and approaches, that, fed by  inputs and data received or collected from the  environment, can generate, given a set of predefined objectives, outputs in a wide variety  of forms (content, ratings, recommendations,  decisions, predictions, etc).9    The above-proposed definition of ADM has two  consequences.   6 Commission, ‘Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on contestable and fair markets in the digital sector (Digital  Markets Act)’ COM (2020) 842 final.  7 Art 3(1) AI Act:  ‘Artificial intelligence system (AI system) means software that is developed with one or more of the techniques and approaches listed in Annex I  and can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing  the environments they interact with’ .   The compromise text unveiled at the end of November 2021 by the Slovenian Presidency of the European Council (‘joint compromise’ , Council of the  European Union, Presidency compromise text, 29 November 2021, 2021/0106(COD), henceforth simply ‘joint compromise’), <https://data.consilium. europa.eu/doc/document/ST-14278-2021-INIT/en/pdf> accessed on 27 April 2022, proposed some changes to this definition. In the preamble, the  joint compromise clarifies that the proposed amendments are intended to make explicit that an AI system, unlike traditional software, should be  capable of determining how to achieve a given set of human defined objectives by learning, reasoning, or modelling. The revised definition is the  following: ‘artificial intelligence system (AI system) means a system that:  (i) receives machine and/or human-based data and inputs,  (ii) infers how to achieve a given set of human-defined objectives using learning, reasoning or modelling implemented with the techniques and  approaches listed in Annex I, and  (iii) generates outputs in the form of content (generative AI systems), predictions, recommendations or decisions, which influence the  environments it interacts with. ’ 8 A similar definition can be found in the European Parliament Resolution with recommendations to the Commission on a civil liability regime for  artificial intelligence (2020/2014(INL)) [2020] OJ C404/107, that includes a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council on  liability for the operation of Artificial Intelligence-systems: ‘AI-system means a system that is either software-based or embedded in hardware devices,  and that displays behaviour simulating intelligence by, inter alia , collecting and processing data, analysing and interpreting its environment, and by  taking action, with some degree of autonomy, to achieve specific goals’ . 9 The definition of ADM is largely aligned with the definition of algorithmic decision-making proposed by Art 2 of the ELI Model Rules on Impact  Assessment of Algorithmic Decision-Making Systems Used by Public Administration. ELI, ELI Model Rules on Impact Assessment of Algorithmic DecisionMaking Systems Used by Public Administration , <https://www.europeanlawinstitute.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/p_eli/Publications/ELI_Model_Rules_ on_Impact_Assessment_of_ADMSs_Used_by_Public_Administration.pdf> accessed 20 April 2022. 
II. Conceptualising ADM91). First, the concept of ADM includes algorithmic  decision-making as well as AI-driven decision-making.   This is relevant for EU legislation, insofar as, while  AI-specific legislation explicitly refer to and define AI  systems within their scope, other texts (GDPR, DSA,  DMA, P2B Regulation, Directive on Platform Work)  refer, without defining it, to algorithmic processes,  or automated means. Both categories of legislation  are relevant in the attempt to specify potential uses  and applications of ADM, to infer principles and to  formulate harmonised rules for ADM.  2). Second, ADM can produce or deliver a myriad of  outputs from a rating to a credit granting decision,  from a movie recommendation to the allocation of  work assignments, from an estimation of an insurance  premium to a decision to remove illegal digital  content. The variety of outputs is immense. Thus, the  resultant legal consequences and the applicable legal  regimes to ADM differ and are potentially multiple and  varied.   Assuming a diversity of outputs delivered by ADM,  a relevant distinction is to be made between two  categories of outputs. The classification is based  on the position of the ‘affected person’ and their  relationship with the ADM’s output. To this end,  the term ‘affected person’ denotes the person who  interacts with the ADM, being the addressee of the  ADM (person affected by the decision), or using or  relying on its outputs for other purposes (relying  on a recommendation or on a ranking to make a  subsequent informed decision). The terminology  used to describe the parties involved in the operation  of ADM is further explained below (III).   2.a. The first category of possible outputs of  ADM comprises ratings, rankings, predictions,  recommendations, or content classification. The  ADM lists, prioritises, classifies, rates, filters, ranks  or recommends. The resulting output may be  ‘used’ as an input to make subsequent decisions:  what to buy, where to stay, which item to choose,  whom to deal with. Thus, the output is not a  decision which relates to the rights or the status  of the person interacting with the ADM, or which  has legal effects on them. Naturally, the person can also be indirectly affected by the ADM if the  prediction is inaccurate, the ranking is misleading,  the rating is based on self-preferring practices, or  the recommendation is biased to intentionally  promote the acquisition of operator-sponsored  products. Consequently, the person may  subsequently make a ‘wrong’ decision as a result  of relying on the ADM. But still, in all these cases,  the ADM’s output is an ‘input’ of the subsequent  decision taken by the person interacting with  the ADM. On the other hand, third parties can be  directly affected by the ADM: the downrated seller  who loses customers; the demoted professional  user whose reputation is harmed; the author of  content classified as unreliable who alleges that  the decision encroaches upon their freedom  of expression, or the unrecommended product  manufacturer who alleges unfair competition.   2.b. The second category of outputs covers  decisions adopted by the ADM related to the  affected person. In such cases, the person  interacting with the ADM is directly affected  by it. The ADM scores, grants, awards, settles a  dispute, handles a complaint, removes digital  content, assigns work, closes an account,  dismisses an employee, refuses a request for  credit, or decides whether an event notified by a  user has to be compensated as per the insurance  policy terms and conditions. The ADM produces  legal effects concerning the affected person  and/or significantly affects their rights, legal  or contractual status, or interests. The affected  person is selected or rejected, scored, awarded,  demoted, expelled from the platform, dismissed  or is somehow directly affected by the decision.    The Guiding Principles apply to both types of  outputs. However, the intensity of the legal effects in  the second category of ADM requires closer scrutiny  and greater legal control. Hence, certain Principles  are only relevant for the second category, where the  ADM makes decisions likely to produce legal effects  for the affected person or to have a significant impact  on their rights, status, or interests. 
III. Relevant Parties Engaged in ADM 10III. Relevant Parties  Engaged in ADM  For the purposes of this Innovation Paper, there are  two main parties involved in the provision and the  performance of ADM: the operator and the affected  person.   The operator  employs, implements, or utilises the  ADM in the course of a professional, or business  activity. Purely personal, non-professional activities  are excluded from the scope. However, as ADM can be  used in the provision of public services, in the context  of dispute resolution, or in the performance of public  administrative functions, the following Principles do  not, in principle, differentiate between private and  public activities and may potentially apply to public  authorities implementing ADM, without prejudice to  the application of additional specific principles and  rules relevant to public services, or public authorities.  The provision of public services or the exercise of  public functions likely to materially impact citizens’  rights and liberties should be subject to special  regulatory scrutiny.10 Likewise, legislators may  consider it unacceptable to admit fully automated  dispute resolution as access to justice would thus  be deprived of human intervention. Thus, although  these Principles aspire to lay the foundation for a  comprehensive set of rules for ADM, and to that end,  public entities are not per se excluded as operators  (ie providing ancillary services or certain decisions),  specific rules and principles will prevail on the basis  of the nature of the service delivered or the decision  adopted or supported by the ADM.   The concept of operator would describe what the  AI Act (article 3(4)) terms ‘user’ . In the terminology  and within the scope of the DSA, DMA, or the P2B  Regulation, examples of operators of ADM would be the ‘provider of online intermediation services’  (article 5 P2B Regulation) providing ranking  functionalities, the ‘very large online platforms’ using  recommender systems (article 29 DSA), the ‘provider  of hosting services’ using automated means in  content moderation (article 14(6) DSA), or the ‘core  platform service provider’ (or, if designated as such,  the gatekeeper) applying algorithms to the provision  of a variety of services (DMA).   The definition of ‘operator’ (frontend operator) on  the basis of control and benefit proposed in the  Report on Liability for Artificial Intelligence and  Other Emerging Digital Technologies11 by the Expert  Group on Liability and New Technologies – New  Technologies Formation, and followed by the cited  European Parliament (EP) Resolution of 20 October  2020 with recommendations to the Commission  on a civil liability regime for artificial intelligence,12  albeit formulated for the purposes of allocating civil  liability, is aligned with the concept of ‘operator’ in  this Innovation Paper. The operator is the person  in control of the risks connected with the ADM and  who benefits from its operation in the context of a  particular activity. Therefore, the binomial controland-benefit defines who is the operator of the ADM.   The affected  person , as described above (II), is the  natural or legal person interacting with the ADM,  either being the person affected by the final decision,  or the person using or relying on, for subsequent  purposes, including subsequent decision-making,  the output of the ADM (prediction, recommendation,  rating, ranking). The affected person can be a  consumer or a professional user. Additional consumer  protection rules apply if the affected person is acting  10 ELI (n 9).   11 Expert Group on Liability and New Technologies – New Technologies Formation, ‘Liability for Artificial Intelligence and Other Emerging Digital  Technologies’ (2019) <https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/1c5e30be-1197-11ea-8c1f-01aa75ed71a1/language-en> accessed 20  April 2022.   12 European Parliament (n 8).
III. Relevant Parties Engaged in ADM 1111outside the scope of an economic activity. Certain  outputs of ADM systems may have systemic effects  insofar as their operation potentially impacts a  multitude of persons. The term ‘affected person’ also  covers situations where the ADM makes (or supports)  decisions affecting a group of persons, a category  of potential beneficiaries, or a multitude of possible  recipients (eg the calculation of benefits that affects a  decision to grant or reject public aid and its amount,  a published credit rating of investment funds that  impairs the investment decisions of a multitude of  unsophisticated investors).      Other than the affected person, third parties  can also  be affected by the ADM. Should the ADM rank, list, rate,  recommend, or classify, third parties are positively, or  negatively affected by the process and the output.  By being downrated, unrecommended, demoted,  or unlisted, third parties may undergo undesired  consequences in their competitive positions, market  share, or customer retention capabilities.    The providers ,13 the importers  or the distributors   of the ADM, as defined by the AI Act as those that  develop, place on the market, import, or distribute,  may also be relevant for some of the Guiding Principles  formulated below. If so, they will be explicitly referred  thereto. Otherwise, the Guiding Principles are  addressed to operators in relation to the ADM that  they implement, use and employ in their activities  and for their intended purposes.   13 Providers include software developers, designers, and other providers participating in the development, design, and provision stages of ADM.   
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 12IV. ELI Guiding Principles  for Automated DecisionMaking in the EU  Compliance with law is the first Guiding Principle in  establishing an enabling legal regime for the use of  ADM in any social or economy activity and for any  particular purpose. Requiring that the design and the  functioning of the ADM comply with applicable laws  seems a basic and implied principle. Nevertheless,  the acknowledgement of the law-compliance  Principle is vital for fostering the use of ADM without  compromising the protection of interests and rights  at stake and, therefore, instrumental in providing a  flexible and future-proof legal regime for ADM.   The law-compliance Principle plays a two-fold role.   On the one hand, it plays a limiting or negative role  in deciding when the use of ADM is permitted and  to which extent, and whether additional measures or  safeguards have to be adopted. If an ADM cannot be  designed, or cannot operate, in full compliance with  applicable law, its use should be prohibited, limited or  subject to certain conditions. This Principle provides  guidance both to the legislator, where a general  rule in a specific sector is to be adopted, and to the  operator, who conducts a case-by-case assessment to  decide when and whether to use ADM.   Illustration A. In an enforcement procedure for  monetary claims, once a judicial enforcement  order is generated, an ADM might easily identify the debtor’s bank accounts and liquid assets  and automatically take steps to complete the  seizure, the transfer of the funds from the bank  accounts, or the transfer of receivables or digital  assets. The system will complete the actions on an  automated basis. However, that would disregard  the existence of exceptions, limitations, rights of  preference or prior attachments likely to reduce  the amount, or the right of the debtor to challenge  that order as per applicable law. A law-compliant  ADM has to integrate and properly assess these  exceptions, otherwise, the enforcement might  be excessive, abusive or unjustified. If the ADM  cannot be designed in a way that can take into  consideration all possible exceptions, as some  require a case-by-case evaluation, additional  measures limiting automation have to be  implemented. Thus, a stay mechanism would be  necessary to suspend the automated execution  until the period for the debtor to challenge the  order or to claim exceptions or limitations apply  elapses.      Illustration B. An app for travel insurance covers  the risks of flight delays and cancellations. The  app operates on the basis of an ADM that receives  inputs from airports, processes flight information,  calculates compensation, and completes the  payment. However, in the insurance terms and  conditions, a limitation clause includes a list of  circumstances exempting the insurer from paying  compensation or entitling it to reduce the amount  paid. The ADM has to be designed in such a way as  to assess the occurrence of relevant exonerating/ limiting circumstances. The intervention of  oracles (meteorology agency) may solve the  problem by inputting relevant data into the ADM  (eg storm alerts, snow, low visibility). However, Guiding Principle 1:   Law-compliant ADM An operator that decides to use ADM for a  particular purpose shall ensure that the design  and the operation of the ADM are compliant  with the laws applicable to an equivalent nonautomated decision-making system.  
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 1314 Regulation (EU) 2020/1503 of 7 October 2020 on European crowdfunding service providers for business, and amending Regulation (EU) 2017/1129  and Directive (EU) 2019/1937 [2020] OJ L347/1.   15 United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts (New York, 2005) (adopted 23 November 2005,  entered into force 1 March 2013). 16 Art 12: Use of automated message systems for contract formation: ‘A contract formed by the interaction of an automated message system and a  natural person, or by the interaction of automated message systems, shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that no natural  person reviewed or intervened in each of the individual actions carried out by the automated message systems or the resulting contract’ . if the occurrence of the exonerating/limiting  circumstances requires a judicial assessment or an  expert appraisal, the ADM has to be designed and  operated in a manner that ensures the decision is  not definitively made until account is taken of any  exonerating/limiting circumstances. Otherwise,  the ADM would not be compliant with the terms  and conditions of the insurance policy stipulated.      On the other hand, this Principle plays a positive or  enabling role in promoting the use of ADM for any  purpose. Provided that the ADM is designed and  functions in full compliance with applicable law,  the ADM shall not be denied legal effect, validity or  enforceability solely on the grounds that the decision  has been reached by automated means. The lawcompliance Principle enables the use of ADM without  the need for specific recognition by the law.   Illustration C. A platform for delivery services  implements an ADM that assigns work. Without  prejudice to any algorithmic-specific rule,  such as the provisions governing algorithmic  management in the Directive on Platform Work,  the ADM can be validly implemented by the  platform, provided that the ADM complies with  the applicable labour laws, respects working  times as well as abides by relevant collective  bargaining agreements and individual contractual  conditions.    Illustration D. Regulation (EU) 2020/1503 on  European crowd funding platforms14 incidentally  mentions ‘automatic investing (auto-investing)’  (recital 20), merely stating that it should be  considered individual portfolio management of  loans. However, there is no further reference in the  provisions in relation to the use of automation,  algorithms, or AI-driven functionalities. Should  the ADM abide by the rules governing portfolio  management, the use of ADM is permitted and is  law-compliant. There is thus no need to specifically  acknowledge the validity of algorithmic investing. Guiding Principle 2:   Non-discrimination  against ADM  As a general rule, ADM shall not be denied legal  effect, validity or enforceability solely on the  grounds that it is automated.   The principle of non-discrimination is widely  recognised in international legal harmonisation  instruments on the use of electronic communications  in international contracts. The United Nations  Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)  Model Law on Electronic Commerce (1996), on  Electronic Signatures (2001), and on Electronic  Transferable Records (2017) are all based on the  principles of non-discrimination, technological  neutrality and functional equivalence. More precisely,  the United Nations Convention on the Use of  Electronic Communications in International Contracts  (2005)15 extends the principle of non-discrimination  to the use of automated systems whose actions are  not reviewed or triggered by natural persons.16 Thus,  in the absence of human intervention, the action  performed by an automated system shall not be  denied legal effect, validity or enforceability solely on  the grounds that it is performed by automated means. The Principle of non-discrimination (Guiding  Principle 2), complemented by Guiding Principle  1 on law compliance, lay the foundations for the  valid and enforceable use of ADM for automatic  investing.   This Principle has to be complemented with Guiding  Principle 11 (Responsible ADM) that goes beyond  law compliance and incorporates other fundamental  values, goals and interests into the development, the  provision, and the use of ADM. 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 14This Principle should inspire an enabling legal regime  for ADM in the EU. In conjunction with Guiding  Principle 1, the non-discrimination Principle endorses  the use of law-compliant ADM, unleashing the full  potential of automation without compromising the  protection of rights and liberties.   Illustration A. In a procurement system, bidders  eligible for subsequent evaluation and interviews  are shortlisted by automated means. The ADM  takes into consideration, in conformity with  the law and the relevant terms of reference,  all relevant, objective, and quantifiable criteria  requested in the tender. The shortlisting by  automated means has the same legal effects as a  human selection procedure.   Illustration B. An electronic auction platform for  improving the realisation of value of collateral  is based on an algorithmic pricing mechanism.  The ADM initiates the auction, sets the price, and  adjudicates the sale. The ADM, in compliance with  the law, has the same legal effects as a humandriven adjudication.        A non-discrimination rule does not necessarily mean  that algorithmic-specific rules cannot be adopted.  Certain rules, such as those providing for duties of  transparency, explainability or human review, are  indeed technology-dependent. They apply precisely  where an algorithmic process exists. However, these  duties, unless so provided by law, do not result in  a questioning or challenging of the legal effects  attributed to the ADM, its validity or its enforceability.  If other legal consequences derive from failing to  comply with such algorithmic-specific duties, the  non-discrimination Principle is still preserved.   Illustration C. In the DSA, implied references  to automation and algorithmic decisions are  scattered throughout the text without specifying  the applicable regime. Guiding Principles 1 and  2 both provide guidance on implementing and  developing ADM for a variety of purposes, even if  there is no explicit recognition by the law: Measures against misuse (article 20 DSA):17  does an evaluation ‘on a case-by-case basis’  exclude any form of automation? Or, on the  contrary, is automation allowed? Automation  is allowed and ADM systems are designed to  detect the reiterative submission of manifestly  unfounded notices or complaints. Provided that  the ADM is designed to assess all the relevant  circumstances as listed in article 20(3) DSA on a  case-by-case basis, there is no objection to this  use.   Traceability of traders (article 22 DSA): is the use  of automated means for collecting, detecting  errors, and/or verification of information  provided by traders permitted? Online platforms  can employ automated systems to assess the  reliability, completeness and accuracy of the  information provided by traders or obtained by  the platform to identify them. ADMs for such  purposes are valid and enforceable, provided  that they are designed to comply with article  22(2) and (3) DSA.   The non-discrimination Principle can be limited,  exempted, or subject to conditions. Decisions that  are likely to significantly affect fundamental rights  or liberties (eg deprivation of rights, imprisonment,  loss of the right to vote, interference with freedom  of expression) or have other relevant legal effect (eg  dismissal, closure of an account, loss of access to a  service) on the user might be subject to a humanreview procedure in accordance with Guiding  Principle 10.     Illustration D. Article 17(5) DSA prevents online  platforms from making decisions by internal  complaint-handling systems solely on the basis  of automated means. Consequently, the ADM can  assist or support the decision, but the decisionmaking cannot be entirely and exclusively  automated.    17 Art 20(3) DSA: ‘ … 3. Online platforms shall assess, on a case-by-case basis and in a timely, diligent and objective manner, whether a recipient,  individual, entity or complainant engages in the misuse referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, taking into account all relevant facts and circumstances  apparent from the information available to the online platform. Those circumstances shall include at least the following: (a) the absolute numbers  of items of manifestly illegal content or manifestly unfounded notices or complaints, submitted in the past year; (b) the relative proportion  thereof in relation to the total number of items of information provided or notices submitted in the past year; (c) the gravity of the misuses and its  consequences; (d) the intention of the recipient, individual, entity or complainant … ’ . 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 15third-party provider, or that data was collected  from third-party data providers. The decision is  not attributed to the programmer, the provider,  the distributor or data providers. The operator is  responsible for ensuring that the ADM is fit for its  intended purpose and operates as it should.   Neither the autonomous nature of the process nor the  malfunctioning of the ADM justifies non-attribution  per se. Of course, the operator is entitled to prove that  the decision was erroneous due to a system failure,  inaccurate data or third-party interference, despite  the operator having acted with due diligence to  prevent such circumstances. In such cases, the burden  of proof is on the operator. By providing evidence of  the malfunctioning of the ADM, the operator is not  denying that the decision can be attributed to it  but is rather proving that an invalidating, excusable  mistake that might render the decision null and void  or annullable, or excuse liability under the applicable  liability framework (as per Guiding Principle 7) has  occurred.   Illustration A. An e-recruiting programme  implemented by a service company ranks  applicants, shortlists eligible candidates, and  finally selects the chosen candidate who  automatically receives an offer of employment.  The recruitment decision is attributed to the  company, as it is the operator.   Illustration B. A health insurance app implemented  by an insurer enables the user to fill out a health  questionnaire and to put forward an insurance  proposal. The app assesses the eligibility  conditions, calculates the premium, and accepts  or rejects the insurance request. The decision to  refuse the proposal or to conclude the insurance  contract is attributed to the insurer operating  the app. The insurer is the operator of the ADM  and becomes the contracting party vis-à-vis the  insured upon the acceptance of the insurance  proposal.       The decision taken by ADM is deemed to be the  decision of the operator implementing, employing  or using that ADM for making or supporting its  decisions. Accordingly, the legal consequences of  such a decision are to be attributed to the operator,  regardless of the fact that the decision was arrived at  by automated means.18   This Principle has a twofold impact:   On the one hand, the operator has to assume  the legal effects and bear the consequences of  the ADM’s decision. That refers to the attribution  of the legal effects and consequences to the  operator as the decision maker: ie the contracting  party (if the ADM concludes a contract vis-à-vis  the affected person), the party of a declaration  of will or a pre-contractual action, the promisor,  or the party adopting a unilateral decision  (ranking, downrating, demoting, removing). This  Principle is complemented by Guiding Principle 7  that provides a specific rule for the allocation of  liability.    On the other hand, the operator cannot excuse  itself from complying with the ADM’s decision or  bearing the legal consequences arising therefrom,  solely on the grounds that the decision was made  by automated means. The operator can also not  deny that the decision can be attributed to it on  the grounds that the ADM was developed by a Guiding Principle 3:   Attribution of decisions  adopted by ADM The decision adopted by ADM shall be  attributed to the operator. The operator shall  not deny the attribution of a decision solely on  the grounds that it was made by automated  means.  18 A similar principle was already enshrined in the UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Commerce:   Art 13: Attribution of data messages  ‘(1) A data message is that of the originator if it was sent by the originator itself.  (2) As between the originator and the addressee, a data message is deemed to be that of the originator if it was sent:  (a) by a person who had the authority to act on behalf of the originator in respect of that data message; or  (b) by an information system programmed by, or on behalf of, the originator to operate automatically … ’ . 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 16This Guiding Principle is complemented by the riskallocation Principle (Guiding Principle 7) that holds  the operator liable. Both Principles aim to allocate  legal effects and liability risks but they tackle two  different legal issues. This Principle addresses the  attribution of legal effects arising from the decisions  stemming from the ADM; whereas the risk-allocation  Principle (Guiding Principle 7) provides guidance  in allocating liability for any damage caused by the  operation of the ADM, including its non-functioning,  the fact that no decision is adopted, or the damaging  consequences of the intended operation.   Relevant contracts, or operating agreements related  to the operation of the ADM, can help to identify or  to confirm who the operator is by supplementing or  contractually clarifying the control and benefit test as  described in Guiding Principle 7. Guiding Principle 4:   Disclosure that the  decision-making is  automated  Unless it is obvious or unnecessary from  the circumstances and the context of use or  exempted by law, it shall be disclosed that the  decision is being made by automated means.  Disclosing the fact that the system is automated  (decision-making, facial recognition, content  generation, profiling, credit scoring, etc) would allow  parties to make informed decisions, minimise the  manipulative or misleading effects of such a system,  and enable objections to be subjected to such  automated processes, where applicable. Therefore,  it is particularly critical when the ADM makes a  decision that can have legal effects on the rights, or  the legal or contractual status of the affected person.  The rationale underlying this Principle is similar to the rule requiring commercial communications  (advertising) to be clearly identifiable as such,19 so  that the addressee is alerted and prepared to make  informed free decisions.      The AI Act relies on transparency with such purpose for  systems that interact with humans, detect emotions,  or generate or manipulate content (‘deep fakes’)  – article 52. Likewise, disclosure of the automated  nature of the decision is also presumed in article  22 GDPR as a prerequisite to exercising the right to  object. As, in fact, articles 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g) and 15(1) (h) GDPR explicitly include the information about the  existence of ADM, including profiling (referred to in  article 22 GDPR), in the list of further information that  the controller shall provide the data subject with to  ensure fair and transparent processing.20   This Guiding Principle exclusively refers to disclosing  the fact that the decision is made by automated  means. Beyond that, transparency and explainability  of the parameters, the conditions, and the criteria  an algorithm-driven system works on are policy  solutions already contemplated in the GDPR and  today commonly shared by the DSA, the P2B  Regulation and the DMA. Thus, the information that  the controller has to provide in respect of ADM,  pursuant to articles 13, 14 and 15 GDPR, is not limited  to the existence of ADM, but also has to include the  logic behind the decision-making, as well as the  significant and envisaged consequences of such  automated processing for the data subject. However,  the transparency obligations in the AI Act for highrisk systems go further and refer to clear instructions  for use and other relevant information for users  (article 13). The aim of this Guiding Principle is simply  to ensure that the affected person becomes aware  that they are interacting with (and possibly affected  by a decision made by) an ADM.   How the information is effectively disclosed depends  upon the context of use and the circumstances  surrounding the operation of the ADM. Should the  use of ADM be continuous and recurrent throughout  19 Directive 2000/31/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 June 2000 on certain legal aspects of information society services, in  particular electronic commerce, in the Internal Market ('Directive on Electronic Commerce') [2000] OJ L178 /1, Art 6(a).   20 Same paragraph in arts 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g) and 15(1)(h): ‘the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1)  and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of  such processing for the data subject. ’
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 17the contractual relationship cycle, as in the case  of algorithmic management in platforms, the  information21 is to be provided to a worker, say, in a  document and in advance (at the latest on the first  working day) – article 6(3) Directive on Platform Work.  Equally, that information can be stated in the terms  of reference of a tender, among the conditions for  an award, or in a competition call. However, in other  situations, the information needs to be disclosed  at the moment that the affected person begins to  interact with (or be affected by) the ADM if there was  no prior contact between the parties or a long-term  relationship that may render a previous disclosure  feasible.    Illustration A. A bank has implemented an ADM  to assess the creditworthiness of credit applicants  and screen eligible loan requests. The applicant  has to fill out a questionnaire and submit their  request via the bank app. The entire process is  fully automated. The applicant is informed by way  of a final decision of the refusal of the loan request  or its acceptance. Only if loan conditions need to  be discussed further will the applicant deal with  bank staff. The applicant may not be aware that  the submission and the screening process are fully  automated. This process might not be sufficiently  evident. Therefore, the bank has to ensure that  the app alerts the applicant that the decision is  made by ADM.    The duty to disclose should be linked to any ADM  used by an operator, even if it does not produce  the final decision but merely provides input for the  decision-making process. For instance, if the credit  scoring is based on automated profiling and then  inputted into the ADM deciding on the approval or  the rejection of the loan request, disclosure should  also cover the scoring.    Insofar as the aim of this Principle is to protect the  affected person from unknowingly interacting with  ADM and ensuring they are aware of such process,  a duty to disclose may not arise if it is obvious (or unnecessary) from the context of use or the  circumstances under which the ADM operates that  the decision is made by automated means. Such duty  may be unnecessary if there is a previous commercial  agreement establishing the use of the ADM, or the  parties have a long-term relationship where the use of  ADM is recurrent and the parties are aware of this. The  absence of a need for disclosure should be carefully  assessed in the case of standard terms and consumer  transactions. A case-by-case assessment would  determine how evident it should be for an average  user that the decision is automatically taken. Several  criteria may be taken into consideration: where the  ADM is located, interface design, means of interaction  between the affected persons and the ADM, types of  decisions, context, transactional environment, etc.  The targeted audience of a specific ADM should also  be taken into account (minors, elderly people, etc).  Illustration B. An electronic appliances store has  installed a customer service robot at the main  entrance of their premises. The robot processes  basic complaints and settles claims at a primary  stage. As the complaints are handled in situ,  it is obvious for any affected person that it is  interacting with an automated system and that a  decision will be made by ADM. 21 Art 6(2) Directive on Platform Work: ‘The information referred to in paragraph 1 shall concern:   … (b) as regards automated decision-making systems:   (i) the fact that such systems are in use or are in the process of being introduced;   (ii) the categories of decisions that are taken or supported by such systems;  …’.   Guiding Principle 5:   Traceable decisions  ADM shall be designed and operate in a  manner that enables the traceability of any  decision.  The Principle of traceability is a prerequisite for  the effective implementation of other Principles.  Traceable decisions enable the human review of  significant decisions, substantiate the statement of  reasons when it has to be issued, and complement  the risk-allocation rule on the operator insofar as the 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 18causes provoking malfunction, bias or failure can be  investigated.   The ADM has to be designed and operated in such  a way as to allow the traceability of decisions when  so required. Traceability is a technical possibility but  it is not an obligation for each delivered output.  Otherwise, all the benefits of automation in cost  reduction, time saving, and effectiveness would  be reduced. Each decision is not expected to be  traceable for the person affected by the ADM. The  operator should be in a position to trace any decision  either for internal purposes, auditing or monitoring,  or upon the request of the affected person in certain  circumstances.  The traceability Principle is not equivalent to the  Principle of transparency. Informing affected persons  of the criteria, parameters, and correlations of the  ADM provides a generic image of the decision-making  process, without explaining the concrete decisionmaking path for a specific decision. Traceability is a  decision-specific exercise, upon request or under  certain circumstances (ie for evidentiary purposes),  that manifests itself in a concrete exploration of  causes, steps, and concurring factors leading to a  specific output.   Illustration. For the purposes of minimising  tax fraud, a tax authority has implemented an  algorithmic process that assesses the risk of  tax evasion on the basis of a set of pre-defined  criteria revealing or evidencing fraudulent or  suspicious behavioural patterns. After several  months of functioning, it is alleged by a group  of affected persons that the ADM’s operation is  discriminatory. The affected persons argue that the ADM systematically raises the risk of tax evasion  by non-nationals. A legal action for the authority  to review the process and reassess the sanctions  imposed is initiated by a group of victims. The  tax authority must be in a position to trace all the  challenged decisions and provide evidence for the  proceedings.        Rendering traceability feasible depends upon the  implementation of auxiliary measures, functionalities,  and procedures: logging, event record retention,  event log management. The ADM has to be equipped  with these features by design and, therefore, from  the production stage and before being placed  on the market. The producer, the provider, the  distributor in the EU, or the importer are responsible  for guaranteeing that the system put into circulation  is duly equipped with such features. However, the  operator should ensure that the ADM employed in its  activity allows for the traceability of decisions. In that  regard, the operator should guarantee that decisions  are traceable for the user. Traceability standards and  methodologies would help to develop best practices  for the implementation of this Principle in industry.  Following the same logic proposed by the Report on  Liability for Artificial Intelligence and Other Emerging  Technologies  by the Expert Group on Liability and  New Technologies – New Technologies Formation,  in order to establish the liability of the producer and  to entitle the operator to file a recourse claim against  a producer who failed to equip a system with these  required features, the operator would inform the  affected person of the traceability of decisions and  would have a recourse claim against the producer  (provider, importer, distributor) if these logging  functions were not present. 22      22 Expert Group on Liability and New Technologies – New Technologies Formation (n 11):   ‘9. Logging by design ([20]–[23])  [20] There should be a duty on producers to equip technology with means of recording information about the operation of the technology (logging  by design), if such information is typically essential for establishing whether a risk of the technology materialised, and if logging is appropriate and  proportionate, taking into account, in particular, the technical feasibility and the costs of logging, the availability of alternative means of gathering  such information, the type and magnitude of the risks posed by the technology, and any adverse implications logging may have on the rights of  others.  [21] Logging must be done in accordance with otherwise applicable law, in particular data protection law and the rules concerning the  protection of trade secrets.  [22] The absence of logged information or failure to give the victim reasonable access to the information should trigger a rebuttable  presumption that the condition of liability to be proven by the missing information is fulfilled.  [23] If and to the extent that, as a result of the presumption under [22], the operator were obliged to compensate the damage, the operator  should have a recourse claim against the producer who failed to equip the technology with logging facilities’ . 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 19Guiding Principle 6:   Reasoned decisions  The complexity, the opacity or the  unpredictability of ADM is not a valid ground  for rendering an unreasoned, unfounded or  arbitrary decision.    The complexity of the algorithms driving the ADM,  the multitude of inputs and concurring factors  throughout the process, or the unpredictability  instilled by machine-learning/deep-learning  techniques should not per se render the decision  unreasoned, arbitrary, or unfounded.   The operator should ensure that any decision  made or assisted by the ADM and employed for  the intended purpose can be explained. Complex,  opaque or unpredictable features should not be  brought forward as excuses not to give reasons or  to refuse to account for the decisions made by the  ADM. Otherwise, the affected person is unprotected  and defenceless against unfounded decisions. In the  absence of reasons underlying a decision, the affected  person is not in a position to assess the correctness of  the decision and is deprived of the right to challenge  a decision affecting them.       As mentioned above, articles 13(2)(f), 14(2)(g)  and 15(1)(h) GDPR expressly require that the  controller provide the data subject with ‘meaningful  information about the logic’ involved in automated  decision-making, and ‘the significance and envisaged  consequences of such’ automated processing. Mere  transparency of parameters, criteria, and factors  upon which the ADM is based guarantees neither  that the decision is properly reasoned nor that the  data subject understands the basis upon which the  decision has been made. The principle of reasoned  decisions goes beyond transparency.  The DSA, in its article 15, provides for the duty of  hosting services providers to provide a clear and  specific statement of reasons for each decision  to remove or disable access to specific pieces of  information provided by recipients of the service.  The statement of reasons has to at least contain the  information listed in article 15(2) DSA. One of the  aims of the statement of reasons is precisely to allow  the affected person (recipient of the service in the  DSA terminology) to effectively exercise the redress possibilities available in respect of the decision, ie  internal complaint-handling mechanisms, out-ofcourt dispute settlement and judicial redress.   The Directive on Platform Work also stipulates, in its  article 8(1), that:  ‘(d)igital labour platforms shall provide the  platform worker with a written statement of the  reasons for any decision taken or supported by  an automated decision-making system to restrict,  suspend or terminate the platform worker’s  account, any decision to refuse the remuneration  for work performed by the platform worker, any  decision on the platform worker’s contractual  status or any decision with similar effects. ’   Both legal provisions above are evidence and  expressions of the principle of reasoned decisions.  Their respective scopes of application reveal that  those decisions likely to significantly affect a person’s  legal or contractual status, to impact their rights, or  restrict, suspend or terminate the affected person’s  account – insofar as that entails the limitation or  the termination of the exercise of rights – should  be reasoned. Even if the decisions are taken by  automated means, an explanation for them and  the underlying reasoning behind them should be  provided in the accompanying statement of reasons.      Not every output of an ADM process will have to be  accompanied by a statement of reasons. In the case  of ratings, rankings or recommendations, the mere  transparency of the relevant criteria fulfils all the  needs of the person who relies upon them.   The statement of reasons has to be proportionate in  terms of costs and complexity for the operator, and  formulated in such a way that the affected person can  easily comprehend the specific decision under the  given circumstances. Thus, a generic, standardised  statement may not be sufficient. The statement of  reasons has to be ‘as precise and specific as reasonably  possible’ (article 15(3) DSA) and this requires that  consideration be taken of the type of decision, the  potentially affected rights or the complexity of the  case. A decision dismissing an employee, resolving  a complaint or settling a dispute should be more  extensively reasoned in order to allow the affected  person to protect and defend their rights, whereas a  decision to remove illegal or inappropriate content  can simply be explained by reference to the illicit  character or the violated provision of the platform’s 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 20internal policy (eg prohibition on hate speech, illegal  advertising, infringement of IP rights).     Illustration. An insurer employs an app to screen  eligible insureds for health insurance. The  applicants fill in a questionnaire provided by the  insurer via the app. Additionally, the app tracks  the behaviour of the applicants in social media  and predicts future health risks on the basis of  certain patterns inferred from their digital activity.  A group of applicants whose requests have been  refused by the app alleges that the denial of their  requests is unfounded and arbitrary and ask for  an explanation for the decision. The operator  (the insurer) should be in a position to trace the  decisions refusing the requests and to provide  a statement of reasons. The variety of data  collected, the inaccuracy of such information  taken from social media or the fact that the app is  fully automated cannot lead to arbitrary decisions  or to these being put forward as excuses not to  provide reasons to the affected persons.  Guiding Principle 7:   Allocation of risks to the  operator  The risks that the ADM may cause any harm or  damage shall be allocated to the operator.  The decision made by ADM, particularly if it governs  the operation of a physical device (eg a care or a  surgical robot, autonomous vehicle, drone, access  control machines, smart home system), can cause  material damage, personal injuries or other economic  losses. The autonomous vehicle may be involved  in an accident, a care robot may harm the user or  cause material damage at home, robotic surgery  may aggravate the health of the patient undergoing  the procedure, or a delivery drone may crash into a  window.    Assuming that the operator is defined on the basis  of the control-and-benefit binomial, the risks of such damage should be borne by the operator – not  necessarily solely. As the operator controls the ADM  governing the device, it is in the best position to  assess, prevent and manage the risks. The operator  has incentives to adopt the most effective preventive  measures to minimise the risk of causing damage.  Besides, as the operator benefits from the advantages  of implementing and using the ADM in the course of  its business or professional activity, it is reasonable  that the risks inherent in the automated activity are  borne by the operator. This risk-allocation Principle  works coherently with Guiding Principles 3 and 5, in  particular.   Guiding Principle 7 is inspired by the conceptualisation  of an operator (‘frontend operator’/’backend  operator’) proposed in the Report on Liability for  Artificial Intelligence and Other Emerging Digital  Technologies23 by the Expert Group on Liability and  New Technologies – New Technologies Formation,  and the dual liability model (strict liability and  fault-based liability) of the operator provided for  by the cited EP Resolution of 20 October 2020 with  recommendations to the Commission on a civil  liability regime for artificial intelligence.24 As the  latter proposed, the strict liability of the operator  should be the exception and be applied to highrisk ADM, whereas fault-based liability is the default  regime for any ADM not listed as high risk.  The proposed liability model neither interferes with  nor replaces liability for defective products25 or the  applicable contractual liability. The liability of the  operator is triggered by its control of the ADM and the  fact that it benefits from its operation. Additionally,  the operator (specially, the backend operator) may be  the producer as well. Then, provided that the damage  was caused by a defect of the product, and as long  as the system of liability for defective products can  be applied to the ADM or to ‘smart devices’ operated  by the ADM, the operator may also be, alternatively,  liable as a producer. Besides, the operator may  concurrently be the vendor of the device and/or the  licensor of the ADM causing the damage. In such a  case, the operator may be liable on grounds of lack  of conformity or breach of contract but the basis of  23 Expert Group on Liability and New Technologies – New Technologies Formation (n 11). 24 European Parliament (n 8).  25 ELI, European Commission's Public Consultation on Civil Liability Adapting Liability Rules to the Digital Age and Artificial Intelligence, Response of the  European Law Institute, <https://europeanlawinstitute.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/p_eli/Publications/Public_Consultation_on_Civil_Liability.pdf>  accessed 3 May 2022. 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 21the liability, as well as the available remedies and the  persons entitled to claim would be different. The riskallocation model proposed by this Guiding Principle  is exclusively based on the operation of the ADM  under the parameters of control and benefit and has  to be complemented by other liability regimes.   Illustration A. A basic smart home system is  installed in a house to control the heating, the  shutters, the sunshades, and the sprinklers in  the garden. The operator – provider of the smart  home system and producer of all interconnected  devices – provides the ADM controlling the entire  system pre-installed in the central smart home  hub. The ADM is based on weather predictions  and data relating to temperature, sun hours, light,  and rain provided by the sensors connected to  the smart home system. For unknown reasons,  the ADM instructs the system to unfurl the  sunshades, open the shutters, and activate the  sprinkles at full power on a very rainy day. At the  end of the day, the garden, the porch, and the  garage are completely flooded, the sunshades  collapse due to the weight of the water, and the  water starts to seep through the windows of the  living room and the hall. As the operator is the  party who controls the entire system and benefits  from selling the smart home system and licensing  the software operating the system including the  ADM, the risks are to be borne by the operator  vis-à-vis the affected person. Once the risks are  placed on the operator, the applicable liability  regime will depend upon other elements. The  applicable liability rules may differ (and concur)  if the operator is also the producer (liability  for defective products), the vendor and/or the  licensor (contractual liability).   Illustration B. A university has implemented an  algorithm-driven system for the delivery of mail  and parcels on campus by a fleet of drones. The  central system automatically classifies the received  mail, assigns deliveries, and remotely activates  and operates the drones up to destination. Should  damage or personal injuries be caused by an  accident, a collision with buildings or windows, or  by a drone crashing in a garden, the university, as  the operator, bears the risk, without prejudice to  the liability of the producer, if damage is caused  by a defect of the product.Guiding Principle 8:   No limitations to the  exercise of rights and  access to justice Automation shall not prevent, limit, or render  unfeasible the exercise of rights and access  to justice by affected persons. An alternative  human-based route to exercise rights should be  available.   As a specific application of Guiding Principle 1, this  Principle focuses on the risk that the exercise of  rights by the affected person and effective access  to justice may be prevented, hampered or limited  by the inadequate use of automation. The situations  that this Principle aims to avoid are grouped into two  categories. First, where the affected person can only  exercise a right by resorting to an algorithmic process.  Second, where the affected person is deprived of the  possibility of exercising a right or access to justice  solely on the grounds that the contested decision  was made by ADM.   In the first group of situations, the procedure  required to exercise a right (the right to rectification  of personal data, the right of withdrawal, the right to  communicate risk-diminishing circumstances to an  insurer to improve insurance conditions, the right  of complaint, etc) is fully and exclusively automated.  Therefore, the affected person is entirely dependent  upon the correct, appropriate, and user-friendly  functioning of the automated process. However,  the process can be complex, poorly designed, userunfriendly, or simply unfamiliar. Then, the exercise of  a right is discouraged or prevented. The automated  procedure may become an insurmountable obstacle  for the affected person to exercise a right. If there is  no alternative route to exercise the right, in practice,  the affected person is effectively deprived of that  right. In such cases, the operator should ensure that a  human-based alternative is available.  Illustration A. An insurer employs an app that  manages the entire insurance cycle. Notification  of events, declaration of risks or changes of  relevant circumstances by the insured can solely 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 22be communicated to the insurer via the app and  on a fully automated basis. The insured attempts  to notify the insurer of a relevant change in riskreducing circumstances in order to benefit from  an improvement of the economic conditions of  the insurance policy by a corresponding reduction  of the insurance premium. The app provides a  form to communicate any change in the relevant  circumstances. However, the form is very simple  and merely offers the possibility for the insured  to select one change among a list of pre-defined  situations. The insured cannot communicate the  change and there is no other way to contact the  insurer.      In the second group of situations, the affected  person has been affected by a decision taken by  ADM and wishes to challenge it. The decisions made  by an ADM system cannot be considered final or  non-appealable solely on the grounds that they  were taken by automated means. Furthermore, if  the automated decision risks causing irreversible  damage or irrecoverable effects (destruction of data,  irreversible loss of digital content, etc), a mechanism  to challenge the decision before execution should be  implemented. Otherwise, the affected person would,  in practice, be deprived of any possibility to challenge  the decision other than claiming compensation.  Article 22 GDPR, the classical centrepiece of the  EU’s legal approach to ADM, provides for suitable  measures to safeguard the affected person’s rights,  freedoms and legitimate interests that stem from the  right of the affected person to object, to express their  point of view and to contest a decision. Therefore, the  availability of suitable mechanisms for the affected  person to contest, raise objections concerning, and  seek an explanation about a decision is crucial. As  this Guiding Principle states, an alternative humandriven route to exercise these rights to object,  contest or express the affected person’s views should  be available. Article 22 GDPR refers to the right to  ‘human intervention’ .    Illustration B. A platform for generating and  sharing artistic digital content has developed  a strict algorithm-driven content system to  remove illegal content and content violating the  platform’s policies. The content system detects  inappropriate/illegal content and removes it  automatically. If the system identifies more than two infringements in one week, it immediately  closes the content-publishing account and  deletes all the user-generated content. Once the  account of the user (affected person) is removed,  there is no access to the internal complainthandling process, dispute resolution mechanisms  or the affected digital content. Thus, the user is  totally defenceless, as there is no alternative way  to challenge the decision other than through  judicial action for restitution or compensation.  Meanwhile, the user has lost all their posted  digital content and has no reasonable means at  their disposal to exercise their rights. The effects  of closing the account and deleting all the  digital content may be considered excessive and  undesired if the consequence is that the user has  means of challenging the decision and defending  their rights before the closure and the removal  are executed. Guiding Principle 9:   Human oversight/action The operator shall ensure reasonable and  proportionate human oversight over the  operation of ADM taking into consideration  the risks involved and the rights and legitimate  interests potentially affected by the decision.   A delicate, but fundamental, balance has to be struck  between the benefits associated with full automation,  minimising human intervention, and the proper  protection of rights and interests at stake, ensuring  reasonable and proportionate human oversight.   Human oversight should not compromise the  benefits in cost reduction, effectiveness, and  economies of scale gained by introducing  automation. However, human monitoring of the  operation of the implemented ADM to assess its  intended functioning and to evaluate its impact on  the affected person’s rights and legitimate interests,  as well as on the overall socio-economic context in  which the ADM is used, is vital. The positive effects  of automated and increasingly autonomous systems  in decision-making should not lead to uncontrollable,  unsupervised ADM. 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 23The scope, the intensity, and the extent of human  oversight should be decided on the basis of the  characteristics of the ADM, the potential risks  involved, and the rights and interests affected thereby.  Hence, human oversight should be reasonable and  proportionate. The ultimate aim is to guarantee that  human control is always preserved in any decisionmaking that may affect the rights and legitimate  interests of affected persons and third parties.  Implementing ADM for any intended purpose should  not mean that an operator ‘outsources’ its business  risks by placing them in ‘externalised’ automated  systems. As any ADM operates within the operator’s  sphere of risk, its functioning should also fall under  the operator’s sphere of control.   In assessing the reasonableness and the  proportionality of the required human oversight,  the operator needs to calibrate costs, risks, and legal  implications of each ADM. For instance, the Directive  on Platform Work (article 7(2)) provides for rules on  human monitoring to ‘evaluate the risks of automated  monitoring and decision-making systems to the  safety and health of platform workers, in particular  as regards possible risks of work-related accidents,  psychosocial and ergonomic risks’ . Reasonable human  oversight is not expected to involve monitoring on a  decision-by-decision basis – this is beyond dispute as,  otherwise, the rationale for automating any process  vanishes. Requiring human oversight should also not  imply that the automatic functioning of the ADM  to make a decision without human intervention is  disregarded. On the contrary, automation means  that certain tasks, activities, or decision-making are  indeed performed by automated means without  being actioned, reviewed or ratified by a natural  person.26 Hence, human oversight should be aimed at  ensuring effective mechanisms, adequate resources,  and fit-for-purpose procedures to carry out an overall  supervision of the operation of the ADM in order to  retain an element of human control in the decisionmaking process.   Human monitoring would enable the operator to  detect malfunctions, to prevent failures, to identify unexpected outputs or deviations from the expected  functioning or abnormal functioning, to discover  systematic biases, or to assess the overall impact of  the ADM considering its intended purpose. Thus,  human oversight should be exercised as required in  order for the operator to remain in control.   The frequency and the scope of human oversight  or the resources allocated to it would be set in  accordance with the risk assessment of each ADM.  The legislator may wish to provide for specific rules  on frequency, scope or human involvement in certain  sectors. Otherwise, the combination of Guiding  Principles 3 (attribution of legal effects) and 7 (risk  allocation) should serve as effective incentives for  the operator to devise an appropriate strategy to  implement reasonable and proportionate human  oversight, insofar as the operator assumes the legal  effects of the decision taken by the ADM and wishes  to mitigate the risks arising from its operation.   Illustration A. A consulting firm implements  an algorithm-driven recruiting programme to  hire junior consultants. The e-recruiting system  screens the curricula of the candidates, uploaded  in a standardised form, rates them on the basis  of pre-defined parameters, adjusted by the  performance level of employees recruited in  previous rounds in the past, and selects the  eligible candidates to be recruited. There are at  least two risks to manage. First, the e-recruiting  system self-learns from the performance of  current employees, so it may perpetuate ‘past  decisions’ . Second, the curricula submitted  by the candidates are strictly standardised in  the application forms, with the result that the  professional profiles of the eligible candidates  are determined by the design and contents of  the standard form. Considering the risk of bias  in the selection and the relevant impact of the  decision on the individual candidates and on the  conditions of the labour market, regular human  oversight over the e-recruiting system would  be advisable to supervise the correct operation  of the ADM, identify biased or discriminatory  26 See art 12ff  UN Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts on the Use of automated message systems for  contract formation :  ‘A contract formed by the interaction of an automated message system and a natural person, or by the interaction of automated message  systems, shall not be denied validity or enforceability on the sole ground that no natural person reviewed or intervened in each of the individual  actions carried out by the automated message systems or the resulting contract ’ . Emphasis added. 
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 24choices, and assess the impact of the automated  recruiting on the diversity and quality of staff.    Illustration B. A private business school employs  an algorithm-driven programme to effectively  assign classroom space to different courses,  depending on the number of attendants, technical  needs, and timetable. In this case, neither the  risks nor the affected rights justify regular human  oversight. Sporadically, the business school can  verify if the ADM is fulfilling the expected goals,  if the assignment of space is optimised, or if  any error occurs in the assignment of classroom  space. Human action would be available to  solve unexpected false assignments (clashes of  activities) but regular human oversight is neither  expected nor needed.  Guiding Principle 10:   Human review of  significant decisions Human review of selected significant decisions  on the grounds of the relevance of the legal  effects, the irreversibility of their consequences,  or the seriousness of the impact on rights and  legitimate interests shall be made available by  the operator.  Among the most evident benefits of ADM, efficiency in  adopting recurrent, mass decisions and effectiveness  in executing them at reasonable cost and speed  can be mentioned. Unlike human-based decisionmaking, ADM can optimise resourses and processes  by reducing delays, minimising errors, and ensuring  immediate enforcement. The decision to remove  digital content, to close an infringing user account,  to reduce the credit scoring of a debtor, or to dismiss  a platform worker by disabling an account, taken  by automated means, are enforced immediately  and with full effectiveness. These benefits also hold  significant risks. Should certain decisions be enforced and executed immediately, without the opportunity  to challenge or review them, the resultant effects can  be excessive, irreversible or irreparable.   Actions and remedies provided for by applicable  law are available and, in many cases, can protect the  person affected by the decision. Judicial or extrajudicial actions will entitle the affected person to  challenge the decision, or claim compensation or  restitution following the ordinary routes to protect  and defend their rights.   This notwithstanding, certain significant decisions  made by ADM, due to their relevance and the  importance of their impact on the affected person,  may be subject to human review upon request and  prior to any other available means to challenge the  decision as provided for by the law being taken. This is  the rationale behind article 8(2) Directive on Platform  Work27 that entitles the affected person (the affected  platform worker) to request that the operator review  the decision and rectify it, if applicable. Equally,  pursuant to article 17 DSA, online platforms must  implement an internal complaint-handling system  for users to lodge complaints against decisions to  remove or disable access to information, decisions  to suspend or terminate the provision of services, or  decisions to suspend or terminate an account, on the  ground that the user has provided illegal content or  content incompatible with the platform’s terms and  conditions. The complaint-handling systems can be  partially automated but human intervention has to  be guaranteed (article 17(5) DSA).28 Thus, the DSA  provides for human review in the form of complainthandling of certain decisions, as listed in article 17(1)  DSA. However, article 22 GDPR, a pivotal provision  in the EU legal framework for ADM, requires the  controller to implement, as suitable measures to  safeguard the affected persons’ rights, freedoms,  and legitimate interests, mechanisms that enable  the affected person to contest the decision, provided  that it is based solely on automated processing (and  under the conditions of article 22(2) GDPR). Thus, the  right to have human intervention and to contest the  decision also converge in this Guiding Principle.    27 Art 8 Directive on Platform Work: ‘ … 2. Where platform workers are not satisfied with the explanation or the written statement of reasons obtained  or consider that the decision referred to in paragraph 1 infringes their rights, they shall have the right to request the digital labour platform to review  that decision. The digital labour platform shall respond to such request by providing the platform worker with a substantiated reply without undue  delay and in any event within one week of receipt of the request. … 3. Where the decision referred to in paragraph 1 infringes the platform worker’s  rights, the digital labour platform shall rectify that decision without delay or, where such rectification is not possible, offer adequate compensation. … ’ 28 Art 17(5) DSA: ‘Online platforms shall ensure that the decisions, referred to in paragraph 4, are not solely taken on the basis of automated means’ .
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 25The mass character of decisions made by automated  means, the immediacy in their execution, and the  great effectiveness of the technology-enabled  enforcement do not properly tally with the longer time  periods and the additional costs and complexities of  ordinary judicial ways to challenge a decision. This  results in a ‘bottleneck’ in the judicial satisfaction of  affected persons’ demands.    The human review of certain significant decisions  would be the corollary of Guiding Principles 5 and 6  and can serve as an effective complementary measure  to ensure full compliance with applicable law as  per Guiding Principle 1. Once the affected person  is aware of the statement of reasons supporting a  decision, they are in a position to assess the (un-) reasonableness of the decision and, accordingly,  to challenge it immediately by requesting human  review. Even if the operator has made all efforts to  ensure that the ADM is law-complaint, the inherent  limitations of an automated system may lead to  specific decisions being made which infringe upon  the rights of the affected person. Therefore, human  review guarantees full compliance with applicable  law without relinquishing the benefits of automation.   Human review represents an exceptional, additional  safeguard complementing human oversight. But,  unlike human oversight, whose operating conditions  are determined by the operator as part of internal  systems and controls, human review begins upon the  request of the affected person. Therefore, the human  review of each and every decision is neither proposed  nor expected.  The operator will inform the affected persons of  which decisions can be subject to human review and  specify the conditions under which human review will  be conducted. The operator may decide to devise a  specific human-review procedure (article 8 Directive  on Platform Work), or design it as a complainthandling mechanism (article 17 DSA).   Human review mechanisms can be required by law in  specific sectors or as regards certain types of decisions,  and/or can be implemented by operators on a  voluntary basis and, therefore, under the conditions  and to the extent established by the operator.    Illustration. A mobility-as-a-service platform  monitors the performance of drivers on the basis of data provided automatically by phones  installed in their cars and upon being connected  to an app. Pursuant to the platform’s internal  policy, if a driver fails to complete at least five  rides per week, the driver’s account is immediately  disabled and this constitutes a cause of dismissal.  The decision to terminate the account and dismiss  the worker should be subject to human review  upon request of the driver. Justified reasons  (malfunction of the phone, error, inaccurate data,  failed connection, work leave) for not completing  the required minimum number of rides per week  might be duly put forward by the affected driver  to stop or reverse the dismissal.     Guiding Principle 11:   Responsible ADM  Operators should acknowledge the potential  impact of the ADM systems they employ on the  socio-economic context (democratic values,  fundamental rights and liberties, human  dignity, social cohesion, etc), and ensure that  they use ADM systems responsibly. The recurrent, repetitive, automatic, and mass  operation of ADM result in amplifying and multiplying  its intended (or unintended) effects. These effects  can be positive, and intended, but also negative,  being either intended or unintended as a result of its  abnormal functioning. The viral potential of algorithmdriven automation calls for a responsible use of ADM  systems, taking into consideration the possible impact  on democratic values, fundamental rights and civil  liberties, market stability, environmental, social and  governance goals, sustainability or social cohesion. In  sum, the decision to employ and implement ADM for  any intended purpose should take into account the  potential impact on individual and collective rights  and on the socio-economic environment.   Beyond ensuring that the implemented ADM systems  comply with the law, the operator should do their  utmost to use responsible ADM systems. To that  end, the operator should be aware of the potential  risks of the mass operation of the ADM for the socio-
IV. ELI Guiding Principles for Automated Decision-Making in the EU 26economic context where it impacts and mitigate such  risks to the maximum extent possible.   Non-responsible ADM systems stoke social alarm  by enhancing the visibility of ‘controversial posts’ ,  radicalise public opinion by polarising debate,  contribute to mis-/disinformation by igniting the  virality of ‘fake news’ , encourage discrimination by  disregarding subtle algorithmic biases, undermine  democracy with targeted advertising before elections,  or interfere in human autonomy with misleading  dark patterns or vulnerability-exploiting personalised  recommendations. At the same time, the legislator  may decide to prohibit or limit some uses of ADM in  certain sectors or for specific purposes (ie prohibited  AI systems under the AI Act) that are deemed ‘non  responsible’ . Thus, this Principle, to some extent,  becomes a law-compliant Principle (Guiding Principle  1).   Responsible ADM systems contribute to  strengthening social cohesion, promoting diversity,  facilitating fact-checking to counter ‘fake news’ ,  mindful of the discriminatory effects of algorithmic  bias, containing the virality potential of hate speech,  and to improving personalising techniques to  reduce the risk of echo chambers, or exclude from  their recommender systems criteria that might be  associated with vulnerabilities or target vulnerable  groups.   Illustration. A home delivery platform implements  an algorithm-driven model to calculate salaries.  The ADM system penalises drivers who are not  able to reduce the delivery time by at least 2%  every week compared to the average delivery  time of all workers in the platform the previous  week with a salary reduction of 30%. The  number of accidents the drivers have increases  dramatically as the drivers struggle to prevent a  reduction in their salaries, putting their physical  integrity at risk. Article 7(2) Directive on Platform  Work specifically prohibits the use of automated  monitoring and decision-making systems in any  manner that puts undue pressure on platform  workers or otherwise puts at risk their physical  and mental health.  These Guiding Principles apply to a wide variety of  ADM as defined, for the purposes of this Innovation  Paper, in Section II above. The proposed definition  for ADM covers ratings, rankings, predictions or  recommendations that the affected person may  rely on and subsequently use as an input for further  decision-making, and decisions that affect the  affected person’s rights, legal or contractual status,  or legitimate interests. Given such a broad scope,  the risks involved in the use and the operation of  ADM largely vary depending on the type of decision,  the context of use, the affected rights, or the social  implications.   As noted throughout the text in the explanatory  comments to each Guiding Principle, the application  of these Principles has to be based on a risk approach.  The intensity and the extent of the proposed  Principles to be implemented by the legislator as  policy goals, as well as the conditions under which the  implementation has to be carried out by the operator  fully depend upon the assessment of potential risks.   Insofar as automation pervades all social and  economic activities, ADM systems are used in a  multitude of contexts and with myriad purposes.  ‘One-size-fit-all’ rules are unfeasible and unadvisable.  Therefore, these Principles provide guidance for the  formulation of rules and implementation of effective  operator-driven solutions on the basis of a riskbased approach. Risks involved in the use and the  operation of the ADM will be the measure to calibrate  the crystallisation of the Principles in the form of  legal rules and the implementation actions that the  operator is expected to undertake. Guiding Principle 12:   Risk-based approach to  ADM These Guiding Principles shall be applied on a  risk-based approach.
