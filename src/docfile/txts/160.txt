1         E-relevance of Culture in the Age of AI     Expert seminar on culture, creativity and artificial intelligence   Rijeka, Croatia, 12 -13 October 2018       C O N C L U S I O N S     AI solutions are now an invisible part of virtually any digital system and have greatly  enhanced their usefulness. What is new in recent years is that the fundamental computer science developments from the previous decade have been complemented with the gr adual  advancement of hardware and the exponential growth of available volume of data . Growth  of investor optimism , media -induced public hype and the apparent new role of AI as a topic  in global geo -politics are defining our time.     The Rijeka seminar focus ed on the repercussions of these circumstances for the Arts and  Culture. Below are its conclusions:       AI is FROM culture , …    1. Art & Culture are the historical fertile soil for the AI imaginary    Through out the  works of mythology and fiction  in the last se veral millen nia, fields of art  and tec hnology have cross -fertilized each other, thus setting the stage and expectations  that engineers are now fulfilling with their contributions.      The long history  of Artificial Intelligence begins in antiquity (me chanical Automatons  throughout G reek mythology), continues through the early middle ages (elaborate  programmable humanoid automata of early Islamic art) and comes to our times  via Byron’s  daughter Ada Lovelace (“the engine might compose elaborate pieces of  music”). During the  post-war era , the whole sector of science fiction is dedicated to exploring the speculative  development of engineered sentience, in turn greatly influencing the actual engineers ’ work  on AI.       … AI is ABOUT culture , …    2. Arts & Culture are an irreplaceable means of expression of the human genius , its  infinite innate inventiveness and creativity, its power of self -determination and its manifest  human rights.     A number of definitions of AI describ e systems that replace aspects of the human brain.  Typically these have a tendency to cross from ‘basic’ cerebral operations to ‘higher’  processes , sometimes including creativity. In order to make progress , AI often uses  reductionist models of the brain where subtleties and “broad frames” are omitted. Unlike  the fields of economy or AI, arts and culture operat e with a definition of humanity that is  not reduced to rationality. We need to talk about that.     
2         3. Arts & Culture stimulate active engagement and creativity in citizens  and hence  diversity in production, against the odds of global cultur al standardisation and  homogeniz ation.     Human idiosyncrasies , as well as broad cultural diversity , are all under increasing pressure  to homogeni ze under globalized economic  circumstances. It is imperative to understand the  deep logics of cultural production as a basic human activity in order to have more realistic  expectations of the advancement of AI.     4. Arts and Culture, in combination with education, are cham pions for ens uring a  human -centred and humanistic approach  when dealing with the challenges and  opportunities of AI and promoting an “Internet of Citizens”.        Social governance approaches that avoid a genuinely citizen -centred outlook can survive –  even in long term – but end up being the complete opposite of democracies. Each time a  society engages with citizen -centred practices , it quickly becomes inseparable from cultural  productions.  This is the European way.     5. Arts & Culture are key vectors in generating the necessary social intelligence  and  emancipation to accompany new life practices marked by increasing human -machine  interaction.     Much of contemporary art practice – especially in the field of critical media art – is aimed  precisely at speculative scenarios of human -machine interaction, thus generating a vast body  of tangible experiences that prov e to be a good basis for citizens ’ adaptation to new work/life  conditions.       … so it has to grow WITH culture .    6. Arts &  Culture need to be part of the dialogue about the information society (be it  about digital transformation at large , or AI in particular).     Engineering and the business interests deriving from it are undoubtedly a social sub -system  with the power to seriously influence social relations. Democratic procedures are often  presented as an obstacle to progress, but time and again it is being proven that careless  (or  lawless in the case of early Internet) reign of corporate interest is generally damaging basic  human rights, democracy and the rule of law .    7. Arts & Culture provid e essential contributions to the deliberations about our common  technology -influenced future , both in terms of realistic insight (through critical media art)  and sense of direction (reflexive and holistic approach).     While sincerely r especting the type of in novation and creativity needed in AI engineering ,  the fact remains that only lateral and holistic thinking that is not narrowly goal -oriented and  is not serving linear e conomic growth can ensure the necessary mutual respect betwe en AI  and the rest of society. This mutuality is the key prerequisite for any trustworth iness.     8. Arts & Culture lend themselves to surprising co -operation with AI -based systems  to  allow for the protection and promotion of the diverse cultural heritage in Europe and  showcase how the past and the future can successfully meet.      The m ajority of cur rent AI applications are in predictable arenas, dominated by consumer  electronics. Beyond any doubt, AI could offer great help in the domain of preserving and 
3         advancing the issues of massively heterogen eous and rich human heritage. Very little is being  done in this field.     9. Arts & Culture allow the elaboration of alternative development models.  They  demonstrate the need for transparent, open, participative, shared, non -normalised,  quality -content based, decentralised, de -monopolized infrastructure (data sets, sources,  search/filtering machines, processes) and the need for a genuine Europe an approach to AI  (and big data) that avoids the pitfalls of data and surveillance capitalism, or of total  government control.     Many artists and artistic collectives are active in the field of AI and technology, focusing their  attention specifically to in cubating functional alternative models of various social and  democratic processes. That space is seemingly the only laboratory for genuine social  innovation and AI and it deserves serious attention and support.     10. Arts and Culture, in combination with education, contribut e to standard -setting in  the digital area  in the form of three Recommendations of the Council of Europe’s  Committee of Ministers  [Recommendation CM/Rec(2018) 10 on culture’s contribution to  strengthening the internet as an emancipatory f orce; Recommendation CM/Rec (2016)2 on  the Internet of Citizens and Recommendation CM/Rec (2017)8 on Big Data for Culture,  Literacy and Democracy ] and can effectively inspire policy makers and practitioners.     The Council of Europe ’s practice  to include Art s & Culture in its deliberations shows how such  work can function and should be continued.                                                       *** This text has been prepared by Vuk Ćosić  for the Council of Europe.
