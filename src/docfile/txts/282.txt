Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       9 PE 703.345  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   Background   Between  the first communication on Artificial Intelligence (European Commission, 2018) and the  launch of the Policy Programme ‘Path to the Digital Decade’ ( September 2021 ), the European  Commission has been very active in the domain of digital transformation1. This fast- changing  legislative production is matched by an even faster pace of development in digital technologies and  their applications. In its draft report, the AIDA special Committee stressed the need for new digital  regulations to harmonise the European digital single market, closing some of the regulatory gaps which cumulated toward global competitors and preserving its  digital sovereignty. Due to rapid  technological development, the text calls for an adaptable, principle -based , and future- proof   legislation .   The proposal of the AI Act represents the first initiative providing a legal framework for Artificial  Intelligence. Together with the other proposed legislations (Digital Service Act, Digital Market Act, Data  Governance Act, and Data Act) and the GDPR, the new AI Act will shape the  EU digital policy. At the  same time, it is considered to influence other legislators in third countries. However, this ongoing  legislation  in the digital field is becoming increasingly complex, making at times regulatory coherence  and consistency  hard to be achieved. There are several interplays between the AI Act and the other  existing or upcoming legislations that have not received enough attention.   Aim   This situation justifies AIDA Committee request for an overview and a taxonomy of digital legislation and of possible regulatory gaps. Against this background, the overall objective of this study is to obtain  ‘an overview of all existing and planned EU leg islation in the digital field, together with an assessment  of the interactions amongst these pieces of (draft) legislation’. To achieve this objective this study  produced three main outputs. First, a systematic overview of existing and upcoming digital regulations and directives by vertical policy domains was produced. Second, the interplay between the main and  more important legislative acts and their coherence was analysed and systematised. Third, regulatory  gaps were identified and placed into a taxonomy  comprising three categories: a) identified in a  Commission’s document and already addressed under an upcoming or programmed legislative work; b) identified in a Commission’s document, but not yet addressed under an already and  upcoming or  programmed legis lative work; c) never addressed so far.  Key Findings  The analysis of the interplay between the selected legal acts, directly or indirectly regulating the development, placing on the market, putting into service or use of AI systems, or other AI -related  aspects, or issues arising from algorithmic processes and decision -making may reveal intended or  inadvertent regulatory gaps.  Gaps have been first identified within the AI Act. By delimiting the scope of application, the AI Act  delineates the contours of the regulatory perimeter, excluding or not addressing certain purposes, uses  or sectors. In that regard, the AI Act may leave certain gaps uncovered , such as, for instance, the social                                                                1  As can be seen in the long preamble of the Draft Final Report on Artificial Intelligence (2020/2266(INI)) released of 2 November 2021 by the  Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age (see AIDA, 2021a, pp. 3 -8). 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  10 scoring leading to detrimental treatment , the b iometric identification syste ms, and m ilitary purpose AI  systems. Moreover, as the AI Act is based on a purpose -specific approach , such a scoping strategy raises  the question of general -purpose and multi -purpose AI systems.    The interplay between the AI Act as the core component of the AI regulatory framework and other legal  acts have reveal ed some doubtful areas . First, the compliance or non -compliance of certain obligations  laid down by the AI Act may trigger (rebuttable) presumptions for the purposes of attributing liability  and allocating the burden of proof.  Additionally, it is not clear to which extent the designation as a  high -risk is consistent throughout all relevant regulations and whether the high- risk category should  lead to the application of strict liability regimes in a ny event.  Overall, t he adequacy of the liability rules  to properly address and compensate damages and losses caused by AI system is a critical issue in the  shaping of a flawless regulatory framework for AI in the EU.   The interplay between the liability ex emption – under e -Commerce Directive as revisited in the DSA  –  and the intensive use of algorithmic decision -making in content moderation, notice and removal,  complaint -handling or conflict solving is a nother critical issue  identified . There are friction p oints in  several aspects . For instance, it is not clear w hether the deployment of a large- scale algorithm content  moderation system may entail de facto general monitoring.  Whether the poor performance of  algorithmic voluntary measures failing to detect (il legal/inappropriate) content should be interpreted  as explicit operators’ knowledge and trigger the duty to react and the resultant liability.  In addition, it   is unclear whether Article 5(3) DSA goes beyond the  platform’s liability of information of the tr ader  and  might entail that the platform operator is placed at the position of the trader as contracting party vis à-vis the consumer.   In the context of contracts concluded by electronic means, while the e- Commerce Directive recognises  the validity and enfo rceability of such contracts, it remains unclear whether self -executed contracts  (smart contracts meeting the requirements to be qualified as legal contracts) shall not be denied legal effects solely on the grounds that are coded in machine language and self -executable. This might fill a  gap that has not yet been addressed in the EU. Divergent national legislation on this issue would  fragment the internal market in the development of AI/algorithms applications.  A thorough analysis of the regulatory gaps in relation to algorithmic transparency should jointly  consider Article 22 GDPR, the transparency requirements laid down in the AI Act, the provision on  ranking of the P2B Regulation or the provisions on recommender systems for very large platforms in  the DSA . The joint analysis of these legal acts that we carried out confirms that the transparency,  disclosure, and explanation of parameters, criteria, or conditions under which certain algorithm -driven  systems work is a fundamental horizontal policy decision th at should be taken at the EU level and  where existing and proposed acts show little coherence. Comparing the scope of application of the  relevant provisions as set out in the above- referred legal acts (GDPR, DSA, P2B Regulation) does show  an incomplete pic ture with some regulatory gaps needing attention.   The interplay between the AI Act and the GDPR is multi -fold and conspicuous. The AI Act acknowledges  that its provisions are without prejudice of any other EU legal acts the operators of AI systems must abide by  data protection regime (Recital 41 AI Act). And more explicitly, the AI Act (Recital 41) stresses  that it should not be interpreted as providing the legal ground for processing of personal data. But  such a generic statement of compatibility betwee n the AI Act and the personal data protection regime  may not be sufficient to cover all possible use of data by AI systems. Therefore, more clarity in the AI  Act as regards the processing of personal data is needed and, consequently, some regulatory gaps c an  be singled out.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       11 PE 703.345  There are also several interplays between AI and cybersecurity. First, machine- learning and deep learning techniques, might aggravate the cybersecurity risks insofar as they render cyber- attacks better  targeted, more destructive, and ef fective, and more elusive to prevention measures as they change and  adapt to new counterattacking responses. Second, however,  AI systems will enhance the effectiveness  of preventive measures against cyber- attacks, serving  as a shield against sophisticated cybersecurity  breaches. Third, AI systems are exposed to vulnerabilities. Measures to ensure resilience, technical  robustness, and cybersecurity in AI systems, and the ICT infrastructure, especially in critical and  strategical sectors, are to be adopted an d effectively implemented. These  interactions between AI and  cybersecurity lead to varied interplays between the AI Act and the Cybersecurity Act, and the AI Act and the NIS2 Directive that may reveal certain overlaps or regulatory gaps.   Finally, the pres ent study has identified other gaps of potential implementation issues in the Open Data  Directive in relation to the proposed Data Governance Act , in the Database Directive, in the P2B  Regulation, in the DSA and in the DMA. In conclusion, in this study the authors claim that regulation of  the digital domain in Europe should strike a balance between protecting fundamental rights,  promoting innovation, being ambitious but at the same time coherent without adding unnecessary layers of complexity. It seems, how ever, that in the building of digital constitutionalism, coherence and  simplicity have been at least partially overlooked.     
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  12 INTRODUCTION   Rationale and objectives   In the four years elapsed between the first communication on Artificial Intelligence (European  Commission, 2018) and the launch of the Policy Programme ‘Path to the Digital Decade ’ on September  2021, the Commission has been very active in the domain of digital transformation with both  communications and legislative acts2. In the past two years , several proposal s for new regulations have  been presented . At the time of publication (December 2021), some important proposals are still being  discussed and  modified .   This fast- changing legislative production is matched by an even faster pace of d evelopment in digital  technologies  and their application s. In its draft report, AIDA special Committee stressed the need for  new digital regulations  to harmonise the European digital single market, closing  some of the regulatory  gaps which cumulated toward  global competitors and preserv ing its digital sovereignty. Due to rapid  technological development, the text calls for legislation that: ‘ […] should always be swiftly adaptable,  principle -based and future -proof, while adopting a risk -based approach; stresses, furthermore, the  importance of legal certainty and, consequently, the need for robust, practical and unambiguous applicability criteria, definitions and obligations in all legal texts  ‘(AIDA, 2021 a, p. 24) .  This situation justifies AIDA Committee request for an overview and a taxonomy of digital legislation  and of possible regulatory gaps. Against this background, the overall objective of this study is to obtain ‘an overview of all existing and planned EU legislation in the digital field, together with an assessment  of the interactions amongst these pieces of (draft) legislation’. To achieve this objective this study  produced three main outputs. First, a systematic overview of existing and upcoming digital regulations and directives by vertical policy domains was produced. Second, the interplay between the main and more important legislative acts and their coherence was analysed and systematised. Third, regulatory gaps were identified and placed into a taxonomy comprising three categories: a) identified in a  Commission’s document and already addressed under an upcoming or programmed legislative work;  b ) i dentified in a Commission’s document, but not yet addressed under an already an upcoming o r p rogrammed legislative work; c) never addressed so far. To this purpose , a team comprised by two policy analyst s (Open Evidence) and one legal expert  (Professor Teresa Rodriguez de las Heras Ballell )3 were supervised by the lead author Cristiano  Codagnone (Open Evidence). The brief description of the team is instrumental to transparently make the following distinction about the contents of this study. Most of this introduction, chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 are strictly based on legal analysis and are, as much as possible , factual. The next section of  this  introduction , as well as parts of the conclusions in chapter 6 , contain considerations by the lead author   that are based on extra -legal  literature (i.e., political,  and socio -economic) and to some extent should  be read as subjective appraisal and interpretation. Some of such considerations are also placed in boxes  to flag their different nature to the reader in chapters containing strictly legal analysis.   2  As can be seen in the long preamble of the Draft Final Report on Artificial Intelligence (2020/2266(INI)) released of 2 November 2021 by the  Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age (see AIDA, 2021a, pp. 3 -8).  3  Professor of Commercia l Law at Universidad Carlos III de Madrid.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld  13 PE  703.345  Some general c onsiderations  As noted, ‘ the world stands on the verge  of the fourth industrial revolution’ (AIDA, 2021a , p. 8), where  data are the new oil  and algorithms the new machines . Within this fourth industrial revolution AI is the  pivotal and cornerstone technology, for it will become the steering centres of surrou nding data layers,  and by 2030 is e xpected to contribute more than EUR 11 billion to the  global e conomy  (AIDA, 2021x,  p. 9). Indeed, the proposal of the AI Act, as a complement to GDPR, has been defined by the European Data  Protection Supervisor as ‘t he f irst initiative, worldwide, that provides a legal framework for Artificial  Intelligence’.  This  act is considered ‘one of the most influential regulatory steps take n so far  internationally ’ (Floridi, 2021, p. 216). Together with the GDPR, and with the othe r proposed regulations  (Digital Service Act, Digital Market Act, Data Governance Act, and Data Act) it will make up a hexagon  envisaging the coming of a new EU Digital Constitutionalism (Celeste, 2019; De Gregorio , 2021) for  better and more sustainable lives, work, and businesses.  All these acts tend to be ‘extra -territorial’, or  technically to have territorial exte nsion (Scott, 2014) with the consequence  that  market players must  deal with EU regulations regardless  of where they operate if  such ope rations affect EU citizens . This is  considered the source of the so -called Brussels effect (Bradford, 2020). It is an approach where legal act  are no longer applicable only on the basis o f the territory when an activity takes place ( Floridi, 2014).  It must be anticipated, however, that this ongoing legal construction in digital constitutionalism is  becoming increasingly complex, making at times re gulatory coherence and consistency, two  dimensions where EU law doesn’t always score well (Brownsword, 2019, p. 155), hard to be achieved.  Many impact assessments carried out by the Commission before unveiling the AI Act could not  analyse its many interplays with other existing or upcoming legislative acts. In the AI Act Impact  Assessment, only a few paragraphs are devoted to the analysis of its cohere nce with other legislative  acts (European Commission, 2021, pp. 84-8 5). In this respect it is worth mentioning that recently the  Regulatory Scrutiny Board re jected the impact assessment supporting the proposal for the Data  Act4. This confirms the  complexity of the digital dossier and in view of such complexity, in this  report, le aving aside visions of digital constitutionalism and the related Brussels effect,  interplays and coherence are considered quite  thoroughly. Scope an d contents  The scope of the re port follows a funnel approach start ing with a wide overview of relevant legislative  and other initiatives, then narrow ing down the analysis of interplays to main selected  areas and  finally   reducing  its scope when considering regulatory gaps.   The initial wid e overview , presented i n chapter 1, covers t he following v ertical policy d omains :  1) IC T services, infrastructures, and networks; 2) Trust and security; 3) Consumer protection and competition;4)Online services and e- commerce; 5) Data protection and governance; 4  See Bertuzzi, L. ‘Draft impact assessment sheds some light on upcoming Data Act’, Euractiv, 21 November 2021.

The initiatives5 under each of this vertical policy domains present some overlaps especially between:  a)T rust and Security with Data Governance and Management; b) Consumer Protection and competition with Online Services and e-Commerce; c) between almost all seven domains and AI. Accordingly, the analysis of interplays is performed for three more broadly defined policy areas: data protec tion and governance (C hapter 2); digital services and markets (chapter 3); and AI (Chapter 4). In the following, the  analysis of regulatory gaps in chapter 5 focus es on AI as such (Section 5.1), on the  interplay of AI with GDPR and the proposed ePrivacy Regulation (Section 5.2) , and on the interplay  between AI and Cybersecurity (Section 5.3). Other relevant gaps are residually reviewed in Section 5.4,  whereas the synoptic taxonomy of regulatory gaps is presented in Section 5.5.  Chapter 6 concludes  with some  general considerations and recommendations.  5  In Chapter 1 of the study, we use the extended and official names of the legislations (e.g., General Data Protection Regulati on (EU) 2016/679)  together with the hyperlinks. In the following chapters we used abbreviations that are commonly used (e.g., GDPR) .  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld  15 PE  703.345    OVERVIEW OF EXISTING AND UPCOMING REGULATION  1.1. Dimensions used for the overview and their rationale.  The EU procedures and acts in the digital domain  reviewed  in this study are  categorised along three   dimensions : the ir type , status,  and vertical policy domain. First, there are two broad types : legislative  and non -legislative, including intergovernmental alliances and co nclusions of international  summits .  Although the latter do es not have a legislative nature, it nonetheless may lead to future legislative  initiatives  or be impacted by them  or by judicial decisions based on existing and future legislation. For  instance, the EU -US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) may solve the earlier problems emerged  regarding the EU-U S Privacy Shield or be affected by the provisions of upcoming acts such as the  Digital Governance Act and its implications on international data transfer (see Te xt Box 1,  p. 36). A  second distinction is between already existing legal acts, draft legislative acts with official proposals  having been presented, and annou nced legislative acts. Third, we use seven vertical policy domains  (ICT services, infrastructures, and networks; Trust and security; Co nsumer  protection and  competition; Online services and e-c ommerce; Da ta protection and governance; Copyrights and  audio -visuals ; e-Government).   Any new conceptualisation faces a trade -off between  having enough descriptive power and empirical   basis and  avoiding  the introduction of categories  not  easily recognised by practitione rs. As such, it  requires  hard choices of inclusion and exclusion of items  (Bailey, 1994)6. We have tried to strike a  compromise with respect to this trade -off, although some potential overlaps and possible alternative  choices remain that we transparently acknowledge here. First, one could further  split initiat ives  by  separating  online services and their management from consumer protection and competition. We   refrained from doing so because the analysis of interplay s in chapter 3 will show that they are re lated.  Second, we could have included one more vertical domain for initiatives related to VAT and othe r issues  concerning  tax and payments. Doing so, however, would have left a category with only two items,  which from an  empirical point of view suggests that they should be rather grouped with another  category. T hird, inste ad of having a single ‘data protection and governance’ category, we could have  split it in two sub -categories , such as ‘data protection and governance’ and ‘data management’. This   aspect, however, will be specifically addressed in the next chapters focussed on the  interplay and  cohe rence of the main pieces of digital legislation.   Let us now map our review against all initiatives announce d in the  European Digital Strategy (2020a)   in the  Table  1 below . The parts in blue indicate our additions as compared to the content of the  strategy .  6  A sound typology or taxonomy is one that (i) have descriptive power and be empirically grounded, (ii) reduce complexity, and (iii) identify  similarities  and differences. Robust typologies and taxonomies should be based on intentional definitions that establish the necessary and  sufficient conditions for a ‘thing’ being a member of a specific set.  The disadvantage of such definitions is that empirical reality is always  more complex and nuanced than any of such definitions  could capture; using the intentional approach may entail excluding items from a  specific set of ‘things’ in ways that may appear artificial or arbitrary  to practitioners. The alternative are so called ‘ostensive definitions’ that  simply pragmatically list what is included in them. Thei r advantage is that they are more inclusive and reduc e hard clear -cut choices and  exclusions . Their disadvantage is that, if they are too loose and encompassing, they become trivial with limited descriptive power and do  not reduce complexity as they group together entities that are similar with regard to very few characteristics .

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  20  1.3. Short description of items   1.3.1.  ICT services, infrastructure, networks   Regulation on High Performance Computing Joint Undertaking (EU) 2021/1173   Regulation (EU) 2021/1173 was formally adopted in July 2021. It repeals Regulation (EU) 2018/1488,  which established the EuroHPC Joint Undertaking as a legal and financial framework, pooling resources  from the European Union (EU), 32 countries and two non- governmental members7. The ne w legal act  introduced modifications to adapt the Regulation to the programmes in the framework of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MMF) 2021 -2027 while maintaining European Commission’s  priorities. This regulation strengthens research and innovation c apabilities, the development of a  supercomputing infrastructure ecosystem and the acquisition of world -class supercomputers by  means of a joint undertaking. It aims at developing, deploying, extending, and maintaining in the EU a world -leading federated, s ecure, and hyper- connected supercomputing, quantum computing, service,  and data infrastructure ecosystem.   European electronic  communications Code Directive (EU) 2018/1972   Directive (EU) 2018/1972 was adopted by the European Union in December 2018 to set up a European  Electronic Communications Code. This Directive establishes common EU rules and objectives on regulating the telecom industry and defines how providers of networks and/or services can be  regulated by national authorities. The provisions includ e measures to stimulate investment in, and  take -up of, very high- capacity networks in the European Union (EU), new spectrum rules for mobile  connectivity and 5G, as well as changes to governance, the universal service regime, end -user  protection rules, and  numbering and emergency communication rules.  Broadband Cost Reduction Directive (EU) 2014/61  [under revision]   The Broadband Cost Reduction Directive (EU) 2014/61 entered into force in July 2016 to facilitate and  incentivise the roll -out of high -speed electronic communications networks by lowering the costs of  deployment with a set of harmonised measures. Furthermore, it facilitates shared use and deployment  of physical infrastructure such as poles within several sectors, besides the electronic communic ation  sector, such as energy and water. The report on the implementation of the Directive published in 2018  concluded that it was being transposed with significant delays in most Member States and its  implementation has been inconsistent across the EU. The  review of the Directive started in 2020 and it  should provide investments adequate to achieve the new connectivity objectives.  Regulation establishing the European Cybersecurity Industrial, Technology and Research  Competence Centre and the Network of Nati onal Coordination Centres (EU) 2021/887   Regulation (EU) 2021/887 entered into force in June 2021 with the aim of establishing the European  competence  centre  for industrial competition, technolog y and research on cybersecurity  and network  of national coordination centres . The centre and network will strengthen Europe’s role, leadership, and  strategic autonomy in cybersecurity by maintaining and developing its capacities, including in the                                                                7 The European Technology Platform for High Performance Computing (ETP4HPC) and the Big Data Value (BDVA) associations.

Furthermore, it w ill support critical infrastructure networks, software, and  information systems used in the EU. Finally, it will enhance the EU’s cybersecurity stance and convert  cybersecurity into a competitive advantage.   Proposal for a Regulation on a pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger  technology COM/2020/594  Proposal COM/2020/594 was drafted by the Directorate General for Trade (TRADE) and by the  Directorate General Financial Stability, financial services, and capital markets union (FISMA) of the  European Commission. It aims to provide legal certainty, support  innovation, consumer and investor  protection and market integrity, and ensure financial stability, by establishing uniform requirements  for operating DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology8) market infrastructures: permissions granted under  this Regulation wo uld allow market participants to operate a DLT market infrastructure and to provide  their services across all Member States. This proposal was submitted to the Council of the European  Union in September 2020 as well as for co -decision to the European Parli ament.  European Chips Act   In September 2021, during the State of the Union letter of intent to the European Parliament President, Ursula von der Leyen and Maroš Šefčovič announced that the European Chip Act would be among the  key new initiatives of the Eu ropean Commission for 2022. The aim of the act is to better regulate the  semiconductor market to innovate and increase the production of chips, the majority of which are  imported from Asia and the United States. It would not only address the fostering of c ompetition but  also the creation of a European chip ecosystem, including manufacturing. The European Chips Act will  try and integrate a coherent European vision and strategy and will provide a framework to avoid  national subsidies, set conditions to protec t European values and interests and define Europe’s role in  the global playing field.   Legislative proposal on building an EU space -based global secure communication system   In September 2021, during the State of the Union letter of intent to the European Parliament President,  Ursula von der Leyen and Maroš Šefčovič announced that a legislative proposal on building an EU  space -based global secure communication system would be among the key new initiatives of the  European Commission for 2022. The system woul d ensure access to high -speed connectivity across the  EU, relying on a multi -orbit space infrastructure including low earth orbit satellites. The system would  also ensure highly secured connectivity and communication for governmental and commercial services, based on quantum encryption technologies; it would allow to better connect key  infrastructure, to support crisis management, surveillance, and potential mass -market broadband  applications. Furthermore, the system is intended to make sure that the EU wou ld remain connected  in case of cyber -attacks on the internet. The four objectives of the system would consist in: being  independent from the non- EU initiatives, providing access to high -speed broadband to everyone  across the EU, projecting Europe into the quantum security era, with protection against cyber-  and  hybrid threats; and keeping the continent connected including during attacks on the terrestrial infrastructure.                                                                 8 A distributed ledger technology is a class of technologies which support the distributed recording of encrypted data.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  22  Declaration of the Industrial Alliance for Processors and Semiconductor Technologies   The European Commission launched this alliance in July 2021. The overall objective of the Alliance is  to identify current gaps in the production of microchips and the technology developments needed for companies and organisations to thrive. The desired imp act will be to increase Europe’s digital  sovereignty, foster competitiveness, and address the growing demand of chips and processors. The two main lines are: The reinforcement of the European electronics design ecosystem and the  establishment of the necessary manufacturing capacity.   EU-US Trade and Technology Council (TTC)   The European Union and the United States launched the EU -US Trade and Technology Council (TTC) at  their summit in Brussels on 15 June 2021. The TTC serves as a forum for the EU and the U S to coordinate  approaches to key global trade, economic and technology issues, and to deepen transatlantic trade  and economic relations based on shared democratic values. On 29 September 2021, an inaugural  meeting of the TTC took place in Pittsburgh, USA. It was co -chaired by Commission Executive Vice Presidents Margrethe Vestager and Valdis Dombrovskis, together with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, and Trade Representative Katherine Tai. Following the  meeting, a joint statement was published, with a first set of concrete deliverables, i.e., declarations on  investment screening, export controls, artificial intelligence, semiconductors,  and global trade  challenges. The next meeting of the TTC is planned in 2022.  1.3.2.  Trust and security  EU Cybersecurity Act Regulation (EU) 2019/881   The Cybersecurity Act became effective in June 2019 and strengthens the EU Agency for cybersecurity  (ENISA). It establishes an EU -wide cybersecurity certification framework for ICT products, services, and  processes with the purpose of protecting the systems of organisations from cyberattacks. Companies  doing business in the EU will benefit from having to certify their ICT products, processes, and services  only once and see their certificates recognized across the European Union. Furthermore, this act fosters  operational cooperation at an EU level by supporting Member States with cybersecurity incidents upon request and assisting in large -scale cross- border cyber -attacks.   Network and Informatio n Security (NIS) Directive EU 2016/1148   [under revision]   The NIS Directive was adopted in 2016 with the goal to enhance cybersecurity across the European  Union. It requires that EU Member States have certain national capabilities to supervise the  cybersecurity of critical market operators in their country as well as for cross -border collaboration  between EU countries. It sets up the designation of competent authorities, the computer- security  incident response teams (CSIRTs), and the adoption of nat ional cybersecurity levels. To provide greater  support against threats from digitalization and cyber -attacks, the NIS Directive has been revised into  the NIS 2 Directive. It would repeal the existing NIS Directive and broadens the scopes by introducing mor e security measures and enforcement. In April 2021, the Commission presented the NIS 2 Directive  proposal to the Parliament lead committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE).   
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       23  PE 703.345  ePrivacy Directive 2002/58/EC   The ePrivacy Directive was adopted in 2002 to safeguard the confidentiality of electronic  communications in the EU. The ePrivacy Directive is a key instrument to protect privacy and it includes specific rules on data protection in the area of telecommunica tion in public electronic networks.  It deals  with the regulation of several important issues such as confidentiality of information, treatment of traffic data, spam and cookies. This Directive has been amended by Directive 2009/136, which  introduces severa l changes, especially in what concerns cookies, that are now subject to prior consent.   Legislative proposal for an Artificial Intelligence Act COM 2021/206   Proposal COM 2021/206 was tabled by the European Commission in April 2021 as part of a legislative  package on Artificial Intelligence (AI) overviewed by the Communication on Fostering a European  approach to AI. The aim is to provide a legal framework for A I, proposes a single definition of AI, and  provides legal certainty surrounding the scope of the act by enumerating computer sciences  techniques and approaches that would be regulated. It identifies certain AI practices as harmful and  prohibits them as wel l as lays a risk methodology for other types of AI. Furthermore, it proposes specific  restrictions and safeguards in relation to certain uses of remote biometric identification systems.   Proposal for a Regulation on a high common  level of cybersecurity Directive COM(2020) 823  Proposal COM(2020) 823, which was tabled by the European Commission in December 2020, aims to  close the gaps on the limitations of the NIS Directive identified by the Impact Assessment. This proposal  calls for increasing the level of cyber resilience across businesses operating in the EU, reduce  discrepancies in resilience across the internal market, improve the level of situational awareness and  the capability to prepare and respond to cybersecurity challenges in a coordinated way.   Proposal for a Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communications COM(2017) 10 final   [revision of ePrivacy Directive]  Proposal COM(2017) 10 was published by the European Commission on 10 January 2017. It repeals and  replaces the ePrivacy Directive EU 2002/58 and aims to regulate privacy related topics while considering the rapidly evolving technological landscape, with is sues such as confidentiality of  machine- to-machine communication (Internet of Things) or the confidentiality of individuals’  communication on publicly accessible networks. The existence of various challenges and gaps of the original Directive were raised i ncluding techniques to store and access information on users’  equipment. Other parts of the Directive appear to have become technologically obsolete. Another key  aspect under political discussion is related to storing and accessing data on a users’ device,  such as so called Internet cookies. As of February 2021,  the Council reached an agreement on its negotiating  position, marking the beginning of negotiations with the European Parliament on the final text of the  Regulation.   Proposal for a Regulation on Mac hinery products COM(2021) 202 final   Proposal COM(2021) 202 was tabled by the European Commission in April 2021 as part of a legislative  package on Artificial Intelligence (AI) overviewed by the Communication on Fostering a European  approach to AI. It aims  to establish a regulatory framework for deploying machinery on the Single

It fosters coordination of health safety requirements for machinery at a EU -level and  proposes to increase users’ trust in new, technological products.   Proposal fo r a Regulation on digital operational resilience for the financial sector COM/2020/595   Proposal COM/2020/595 was published in September 2020 as part of the European Commission’s  Digital Finance Strategy. This proposal builds on risk management requirements for ICT already  developed by EU institutions and creates a cohesive approach across the EU, regulators, and financial  entities. It aims to enhance the operational resilience of financial firms in case of severe ICT disruptions.  Furthermore, it  calls for the supervision of critical ICT third party providers, including cloud service  providers, by European Supervisory Authorities.   European Cyber Resilience Act   In September 2021, during the State of the Union letter of intent to the European Parli ament President,  Ursula von der Leyen and Maroš Šefčovič announced that the European Cyber Resilience Act would be  among the key new initiatives of the European Commission for 2022. It would be added to other  proposals and directives about cybersecurity, s pecifically it aims  to set common cybersecurity  standards for connected devices.  1.3.3.  Consumer protection and competition   Regulation on platform -to-business relations (P2B Regulation) (EU) 2019/1150   The so -called P2B Regulation was applied in July 2020 and aims to ensure fair and transparent rules for  business users on online platforms. It set rules to ensure this and creates a predictable business  environment for smaller businesses and traders on online platforms to avoid unfair contracts and  trading practi ces in platform -to-business relations.   Roaming Regulation (EU) 2017/920   [under revision]   Regulation (EU) 2017/920 amended Regulation (EU) 2012/531 concerning rules for wholesale roaming  markets and abolishing all roaming charges within the EEA. The Roaming Regulation is currently under revision with the proposed legislation COM/2021/85 final, presented in March 2021. The modified  regulation would extend the current rules that will expire in 2022 for another 10 years and enhance the  roaming services for tra vellers across the EU. The provisional agreement reached in December 2021 9  includes an adjust ment of  the maximum wholesale prices to ensure that the provision of retail roaming  services at domestic prices is sustainable for operators throughout the EU.  In addition, the revised  regulation would include measures to ensure a good customer experience in terms of quality of service  and access to emergency services, including for people with special needs.                                                                       9  Available at: https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press -releases/2021/12/09/mobile -roaming -with -no-extra -fees -to-continue -aspresidency- reaches -deal -with -european -parliament/ .

This regulation  amended Directive 2002/22/EC on universal service and users’ rights relating to electronic  communications networks and services, and Regulation (EU)  No 531/2012 on roaming on public  mobile communications networks within the EU. The aim is to introduce safeguards for net neutrality, or the equal and non- discriminatory treatment of internet traffic and regulate mobile roaming services  EU-wide by setting up a new pricing scheme. This pricing scheme abolishes surcharges without  disrupting the market in the home or visited country. The regulation has applied since April 2016 and roaming charges were abolished from June 2017.   Proposal for a Digital Markets A ct COM(2020) 842  Proposal COM(2020) 842 was tabled by the European Commission in December 2020. It aims to ensure open and contestable digital markets by preserving effective competition and ensuring that the large online platforms behave in a fair way. F urthermore, the proposal sets rules for platforms that act as  ‘gatekeepers ’, large platforms that have a durable position between business users and end users due  to their impact on the digital markets. These platforms will have to comply with a series of obligations  and prohibitions. This legislative proposal builds on the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2918/1150 (P2B Regulation).   Proposal for a Regulation on Markets in Crypto -assets COM(2020) 593   Proposal COM(2020) 593 was tabled by the European Commission in September 2020 and aims to  amend Directive (EU) 2019/1937. It proposes to support innovation and fair competition by creating a  framework for the issuance, and provision of services related to crypto assets. In addition, it aims to ensure a high level  of consumer and investor protection and market integrity in the crypto -asset  markets, as well as address financial stability and monetary policy risks that could arise from a wide use of crypto -assets and DLT -based solutions in financial markets.   Common charges for mobile phones and similar devices   The envisaged legislation for common charges for mobile phones and similar devices was announced in the 2020 European Commission work programme. It would propose to harmonise legislation on common chargers for  mobile phones and similar devices. Its overall aim is to provide greater  convenience and cost -savings for the consumer and reduce electronic waste. Due to the COVID crisis,  this was p ostponed  until 2021 and in February 2021, along with the New Circular Economy Action Plan,  the Parliament called on the Commission to launch a common charger for smartphones and all small and medium -sized electronic devices.   New design requirements and consumer rights for electronics   This legislative initiative was announced  in the Commission’s 2021 work programme, A Europe fit for  the digital age, and is due on Q2 2022. The Commission intends to propose measures on eco -design of  mobile phones, tablets, computers, and computer servers are intended to be implemented in line wi th  the Circular Economy Action Plan. The future e regulation for mobile phones and tablets will aim to address issues such as limited availability of the most damaged spare parts; limited availability of 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  26  updated versions of the operating system, firmware, or software; cost and ease of repair; and reduced  battery endurance over time. Whereas the future regulation on computers and computer servers will  aim to update energy efficiency requirements for these products, increase reparability of computers,  improve  lifetime of both computers and batteries, and reduce purchases of unnecessary chargers.  Furthermore, the Commission has launched other initiatives to improve the sustainability of products,  including electronics, such as the Digital Product Passports intr oduced by the Sustainable Products  Initiative10.  Multimodal digital mobility services   In September 2021, during the State of the Union letter of intent to the European Parliament President,  Ursula von der Leyen and Maroš Šefčovič announced that the multimo dal digital mobility services  would be among the key new initiatives of the European Commission for 2022. The aim is to facilitate  the planning and purchase of transportation tickets in the EU by implementing route- planners or ticket  vendors to assist cons umers by comparing travel options. The legislative proposal is planned to be  presented by the Commission during the second quarter of 2022. However, in the Commission Work Programme 2022, this legislative proposal is announced for the fourth quarter of 202 2.  1.3.4.  Online services and e- commerce   EU VAT for e -commerce package (EU VOEC)   The EU VAT for e- commerce package is one of the priorities under the Digital Market Strategy and was  first adopted by the Council in December 2017. Since then, it has been deployed gradually and has  introduced reforms to the VAT requirements for business -to-consumer (B2C) ecommerce sellers and  marketplaces. Furthermore, it aims to facilitate cross- border trade, ensure fair competition for  businesses in the EU, and combat fraudulent V AT practices. It has also improved the mini one stop shop  (MOSS) portal, which is a system to declare and pay VAT on B2C for certain services in the EU.   Payment Services Directive (EU) 2015/2366   The Payment Services Directive has been applied since January 2016, with Member States required to  incorporate it into national law since 2018. The aim of this Directive is to improve existing EU regulation  for electronic payments by considering emerging payment methods, such as through mobile or  internet. It sets requirements to protect consumers’ financial data, transparency for information  requirements for payment services, and the rights and obligations of users and providers of these  payment services. Furthermore, this Directive strengthens the role of the Euro pean Banking Authority  (EBA) to develop a central register of authorised payment institutions, assist in resolving disputes, and  develop regulatory technical standards.   e-Commerce Directive 2000/31/EC   The e- Commerce Directive entered into force in July 20 00 with the deadline for transposition in  Member States by January 2002. This Directive establishes a set of standardised rules at an EU -level on  various key issues related to e- commerce. It covers several online services including news services,                                                                10 European Parliament, Europe’s Digital Decade and Autonomy , 2021, available at:  https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/695465/IPOL_STU(2021)695465_EN.pdf .

Member State governments are obliged to ensure that  online advertising identifies the following clearly: the advertising itself, the company or personal  responsible, and promotional offers, games, or competitions along with their conditions.   Geo -Blocking Regulation (EU) 2018/302  The Geo -blocking Regulation aims to give all EU consumers equal rights to access a trader’s goods or  services, under the same terms, irrespective of their location. The new rules aim to tack le geo -blocking  as well as other forms of discrimination based on nationality, residence or establishment. It applies in principle to both business- to-consumer (B2C) and to business -to-business (B2B) transactions.   Proposal for a Digital Services Act COM/20 20/825   The proposal for a Digital Services Act is a legislative proposal by the European Commission that was submitted to the European Parliament and the European Council in December 2020. The objective of this proposal is to modernise the EU’s legislative framework by updating the concepts contained in the e-Commerce Directive. The Digital Services Act proposal aims to create a safer digital space in which the fundamental rights of all users of digital services are protected. In particular, the proposal concerns  online intermediaries and platforms such as online marketplaces, social networks, content -sharing platforms, app stores, and online travel and accommodation platforms. Legislative proposal on a Single Market Emergency Instrument   This legislative proposal was first introduced in a speech delivered at the EU Industry Days in February  2021 by Ursula von der Leyen. This new instrument would aim to ensure the free movement of goods, services, and people, with greater transparency and coordination in times of crises. The key elements  of the single market emergency instrument would be to reinforce single market governance tools and  procedures, improve transparency and coordination on intra -EU export restrictions and services  restriction. Furtherm ore, the legislative proposal would strengthen structures and tools to facilitate the  circulation of goods and services in the context of border restrictions, target measures for speedier product availability, enhance market surveillance procedures, and reinforce cooperation and  information -sharing in public procurement.   1.3.5.  Data governance and management   Open Data Directive (EU) 2019/1024  The Open Data Directive was adopted in June 2019 and revises Directive 2003/98/EC on the re- use of  public sector informati on (the PSI Directive). The aim of the Directive is to strengthen the EU’s dataeconomy by increasing the amount of publicly held and funded data available for re- use. The Directive  introduces an obligation for public bodies to publish available data unles s access is restricted or  excluded. It brings public undertakings such as public utilities under the PSI, and it proposes using Implementing Acts to set out lists of high value datasets which must be made available by public  bodies.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  28  General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) (EU) 2016/679   The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has applied since May 2018. The GDPR is a data privacy  and security law that aims to allow EU citizens to better control their personal data by facilitating citizen access, providing an individual the right to know when their personal data has been hacked, and  providing rules on the right to erasure of personal data from platforms. Additionally, it harmonises rules to reduce excessive bureaucracy and allow business to benefit from greater consumer trust. It also  establishes the data protection officer role, which is responsible for data protection and is designated  by public authorities and businesses which process data on a large scale.   Regulation on the free flow of non- personal data (EU) 2018/1807   The Regulation on the free flow of non- personal data has applied since June 2019. The aim of this  Regulation is to ensure free movement of non- personal data across borders so that every organisation  can store and process d ata anywhere in the EU. Furthermore, public authorities will retain access to  data, even when it is in another EU country or when it is stored or processed in the cloud. It encourages providers to develop codes of conduct regarding the conditions under whi ch users can move data  between cloud service providers and back into their own IT environments.   Directive on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital  services (EU) 2019/770   The Directive on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital content and digital services aims to fully harmonise a set of key rules that are so far not regulated at Union level. It includes  rules on conformity of the digital content, remedies available to consumers in cases o f lack of  conformity of digital content with the contract and certain modalities for the exercise of those  remedies. The Directive also aims to harmonise certain aspects concerning the right to terminate a long term contract, as well as certain aspects con cerning the modification of the digital content.   Data Governance Act  (DGA) COM(2020) 767   The Data Governance Act is a legislative proposal that was first announced within the 2020 European  strategy for data and officially presented in November 2020. The aim is to foster the availability of data  for use by increasing trust in data intermediaries and by strengthening data -sharing mechanisms  across the EU. It would make public sector data available for safe reuse when such data is subject to  rights of others. Furthermore, it creates a new business model to foster data intermediation services, to  help companies or individuals share data in a secure way and allows for data use on altruistic grounds.   European Health Data Space   The European Health Data Space was  first announced in the State of the Union address in September  2020 by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. The combined evaluation roadmap  and inception impact assessment were published 23 December 2020 and a consultation ran from 3  May to  26 July 2021 and the legislative proposal is expected for 202211.                                                                 11  European Parliament, Legislative Train Schedule, Creation of A European Health Data Space : https://www.eur oparl.europa.eu/legislative train/theme -promoting -our-european -way -of-life/file -european -health -data -space/11 -2021 . 
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       29  PE 703.345  The aim is to promote safe patient data exchange, facilitate citizen control over their own health data,  and support research on medicine treatments and outcomes. Furthermore, it encourages  access to  health data for policy making purposes and regulation, supports digital health services, and outlines  the safety and liability aspects of artificial intelligence in health care. The legislative proposal resulting  from this consultation is expect ed to be adopted in the fourth quarter of 2021.   Data Act   The Data Act was first announced in the 2020 European strategy for data and then its Inception Impact  Assessment was published in May 2021. The adoption of the Data Act is expected by the first quarter  of 2022.  This proposal aims to create a safer digital space in which the fundamental rights of all users  of digital services are protected. In particular, the proposal concerns online intermediaries and platforms such as online marketplaces, social  networks, content -sharing platforms, app stores, and  online travel and accommodation platforms. The DA will include a review of the rules of the legal  protection of databases and deal with the planned revision of the Database Directive. In addition, the  Trade Secrets Directive was discussed in the DA Inception Impact Assessment, which is an instrument  that ensures protection against (un)lawful acquisition, use and disclosure of certain business sensitive  information 12.  European Alliance for Industrial Data,  Edge, and Cloud   The Alliance builds on the 2020 European data strategy and was endorsed by the European Council  and the Declaration on European Cloud, signed by all Member States, in October 2020. This Alliance  aims to bring together businesses, Member S tates representatives and relevant experts to strengthen  the position of EU industry on cloud and edge technologies. Furthermore, it will serve the needs of EU  businesses and public administrations that process sensitive categories of data and has the obje ctive  to increase Europe’s leadership position on industrial data.  1.3.6.  Copyrights and audio -visuals   Directive on Copyrights and related rights in the DSM Directive (EU) 2019/790   The Directive on Copyrights and related rights in the Digital Single Market (DSM) has applied since June  2019 and became law in all EU countries since June 2021. The Directive updates the EU’s copyright  legislation. It is composed of three over -arching objectives: adapt key exceptions to copyright in the  digital and cross- border environment, improve licensing practices and facilitate wider access to  content, and achieve a marketplace for copyright. It aims to make it easier to use copyright -protected  materi al for some purposes, including access to knowledge. It also includes the protection of press  publications for online use and provides rules for fair remuneration for authors and performers, among others.                                                                     12  The directive can apply to (business sensitive) data. The assessment of the application of the directive in the context of th e data economy  is ongoing, and it includes the launch of a study focusing on four key sectors (automotive, health, energy and financial services). Based on  this assessment, clarifying guidance may be issued at a later date.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  30 Satellite and Cable Directive (EU) 2019/789   The Satellite and Cable Directive was first proposed by the European Commission in September 2016  in the context of the Digital Single Market strategy and along with a legislative package designed at  the revision of EU copyright regulations. The objective of this Directive is to facilitate and promote  cross- border delivery and access of online services to broadcasts. Furthermore, it aimed to adapt the  EU legal framework to enable digital retransmissions over closed networks of TV and radio programs  from other Member States.   Portability Regulation (EU) 2017/1128   The Portability Regulation has been applied since 2018 with the aim of ensuring that subscribers to an online content service in one Member State can access it when traveling cross -borders to other EU  Member States. It calls for giving access in the same way as in their country of residence and includes video on demand, music streaming, and online game marketplaces. To note, there is no obligation to  provide the same quality, unless it has been agreed with the subscriber. However, the quality for the  service must not be deliberately reduced.    Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/EU   The Radio Equipment Directive entered into force in June 2014 with the deadline for transposition into Member States by June 2016, repealing Directive 1999/5/EC. The aim of the Directive was to harmonise the laws of Member States related putting radio equipment on EU’s internal market and applies to all equipment which emits or receives radio waves for radiodetermination or communication purposes. It sets rules to ensure that radio equipment devices respect health and safety requirements and sets  out means  for market surveillance to track products which fail to comply with requirements.    Database Directive 96/9/EC   [under revision]   The Database Directive, which was adopted in March 1996, aims at supporting the development of the  European database industry. In accordance to the Directive, all databases that ‘ constitute the author's  own intellectual creation shall be protected as such by copyright ’. The European Commission conducted  an evaluation and carried out a consultation in 2017 and 2018 to understand how such directive, and in particular the sui generis  protection of databases, is applied and what impact it had on users and  maker s. The second evaluation of the Directive from 2018 showed that, while the Database Directive  provides added value, it could be revisited to facilitate data access and use. The Commission work programme for 2021 foresees the review of the Database Directiv e in Q3 2021.   1.3.7.  e-Government E-invoicing Directive (EU) 2014/55 The E -invoicing Directive entered into force in May 2015 with November 2018 as the deadline for  transposition into the Member States. This Directive was adopted in tandem with laws on public procurement to result in a greater uptake across Europe of e- voicing by contactors for work in the  public sector. This does not apply to contracts that fall within the scope of Directive 2009/81/EC in  sectors such as defence and security.

It provides a predictable regulatory environment to enable secure and seamless electronic interactions between businesses, citizens, and public  authorities. It ensures that people and businesses can use their own national electronic identification  schemes (eIDs) to access public services in other EU countries where eIDs are available. The eIDAS Regulation creates a European internal market for electronic trust services by ensuring that they will work across borders and have the same legal status as traditional paper -based processes.   Digital isation of visa procedures   The envisaged legislation for the digitalisation of visa procedures was announced in the 2021 European Commission work programme and proposes to fully digitalise the visa procedure by 2025 developing a digital visa and the implementing the ability to submit visa applications online. The legislative  proposal is scheduled to be published in the fourth quarter of 2021.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  32    DATA PROTECTION AND GOVERNANCE   The interplay between the items in this area is analysed along three dimensi ons:   • The distinction between personal and non- personal data ;  • The conditions of the parties involved ; and  • Interaction between an open data approach and data protection regimes.   2.1. Personal and non -personal data   While the GDPR only applies to  personal data13, in the Free Flow Regulation on non- personal data, the  EU also recognises that non -personal data are a source of potential great value in the context of the  development of AI, IoT and other emerging technologies , and for the platform economy  more broadly  defined . There is awareness of the existence of mixed datasets with personal and non- personal data  that can be inextricably linked . This requires considering  both anonymisation and re- identification of  data and their implications in the applicable regime. Therefore, legal acts on data may be applied  concurrently to different scenarios and actors. A simple classification based on the dualism of personal  data/non -personal data provides a first map of interactions among legal acts within the policy area of  data governance and management.   2.1.1.  Personal data  The EU has put in place a solid legal framework for the protection of personal data that fundamentally pivots on the GDPR, and the ePrivacy Directive. The latter is being revised both for taking into  consideration new technological development and for better alignment with the GDPR . The  complementarity between the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive is recognised and guaranteed in Article  95 of the GDPR, which prevents from imposing additional obligations on natural or legal persons that  are already subject to specific obligations with similar objective s set out in the ePrivacy Directive. The  ePrivacy Directive would be repealed by the proposed ePrivacy Regulation 14. The complementarity  with the GDPR is acknowledged in Ar ticle 1.3 of the ePrivacy Regulation by stating that the aim of the  Regulation is to complement the GDPR by defining  rules for the purposes of protecting fundamental  rights and freedoms of natural and legal persons in the provision and use of electronic co mmunications  services . In particular, it protects  the rights to respect private life and communications and the  protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data . It also ensures  free  movement of electronic communications data and services within the Union (Article 1.3 GDPR) .  2.1.2.  Non -personal data   The Free Flow Regulation is  solely focused on non -personal data15. Hence, the GDPR and the Free Flow  Regulation of  non -personal data jointly provide for the free movement of ‘ all’ data within the EU.   The Free Flow Regulation lays down a general prohibition against data localisation requirement (Art.  4.1) unless justified on grounds of public security,  whereas the GDPR allows the free movement of                                                                13  Article 4.1. GDPR: ‘personal data’ means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an  identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier  such as a name, an  identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, me ntal,  economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.   14  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning the respect for private life and the protection of  personal data in electronic communications and repealing Directive 2002/58/EC (Regulation on Privacy and Electronic Communica tions).   15  Article 1 of the Regulation defines the subje ct matter: “This Regulation aims to ensure the free flow of data other than personal data within  the Union by laying down rules relating to data localisation requirements, the availability of data to competent authorities and the porting of data for profes sional users”.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld  33   PE 703.345  personal data within the Union witho ut restrictions on the grounds of protection of personal data  (Art.1.3). Thus, the complementarity between the GDPR and the Free Flow Regulation on free  movement of data within the Union and data portability is smooth , to the extent that the classification   of data ( as either personal or non- personal ) is evident and unquestioned. Mixed datasets, especially  with linked personal and non- personal data, use anonymis ation  and re -identif ication  mechanisms  and  require closer consideration to provide a suited soluti on.   2.1.3.  Personal and non -personal data  The Open Data Directive and the Data Governance Act focus indistinctively on both personal and nonpersonal data. Personal data are defined in conformity with the GDPR. The proposed Data Governance  Act complement s the Op en Data Directive as its scope of application covers those data held by public  sector bodies that, being subject to rights of others, fall outside the scope of the Open Data Directive. As per Article 3 of the Data Governance Act, the text applies to data held by public sector bodies which are protected on certain grounds: commercial and statistical confidentiality, intellectual property rights, or personal data. While Article 1.2 of the Open Data Directive excl udes , from its scope of  application , documents for which third parties hold intellectual property rights, documents excluded  from access on grounds of commercial confidentiality, statistical confidentiality  (Article 1.2.d), and  documents that cannot be accessed  on grounds of personal data protection  (Article 1.2.h). The  adoption of the proposed Data Governance Act would then fill a regulatory gap  that the material scope  of the Open Data Directive had left unaddressed. Concurrently, the Open Data Directive i n combination  with the Data Governance Act would pave the path towards an open data environment, facilitating  data sharing with an important role of data sharing intermediaries and under the FAIR data principles   (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperabilit y, Reusability) . In addition, the proposed Data Act  would  complement a legal framework conducive to a fair allocation of data value among actors of the data  economy, especially B2B (data sharing, portability, safeguards of non -personal data in internationa l  contexts), as further discussed below.   2.1.4.  Mixed datasets and prevalence of personal data protection   Datasets, in practice, are frequently mixing personal and non-personal data ; moreover,  the processes  for anonymising or re -identifying data can change the status of the data at different stages throughout  their life cycle . It is, thus,  important to analyse how personal data and non -personal data regimes  interact in mixed datasets and, in pa rticular, when data are so inextricably linked that separation is not  feasible, affordable, or commercially reasonable. As the  Guidance on the Free Flow Regulation16  explains, the key rule is to apply each regime to the respective type of data, and in case that separation  or identification is not possible ( ‘inextricably linked ’), personal data protection prevails. This proposal  is based on the following reasons and legal grounds. First, Article 2.2 Free Flow Regulation provides  that:   ‘In the case of a dataset composed of both personal and non -personal data, this  Regulation applies to the non -personal data part of the dataset. Where personal  and non -personal data in a dataset are inextricably linked, this Regulation shall  not prejudice the application of Regul ation (EU) 2016/679.’   16  See the Practical guidance for businesses on how to process mixed datasets available at: https://digital strategy.ec .europa.eu/en/library/practical -guidance -businesses- how -process -mixed -datasets . 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  34  This means that, in a case of a mixed dataset , the Free Flow of Non- Personal Data Regulation applies to  the non- personal data part of the dataset , while  the GDPR’s free flow provision (Art. 1.3 GDPR)17 applies  to the personal data part of the dataset. If the non -personal data part s and the personal data parts are  ‘inextricably linked’, the data protection rights and obligations stemming from the GDPR fully apply to  the whole mixed dataset, even when personal data represent only a small part of the dataset. The  presence of personal data, irrespective of how relevant or significant the part is in the context of the  whole set, triggers the protection for personal data18. This interpretation is in line with t he right to  personal data protection guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.   Consequently, in the interplay between all data -related legal acts, it is confirmed that those provisions  facilitating access to data and re -use wo uld apply without prejudice of the protection of individuals  regarding  the use of personal data under Union and national law, particularly GDPR and any  supplementing provisions of national law (Art. 1.4 Open Data Directive). This explains , for instance, th at  in promoting use and re- use of open data,  the costs of anonymisation of documents can be considered   in the charging of fees and the allowed recovery of marginal costs (Art. 6 Open Data Directive). While  rendering information anonymous is intended to rec oncile the public interest in making public sector  information as re- usable as possible with the obligations under data protection law, it  does  entails  costs. Under the Data Governance Act , which  cover s data protected on grounds of personal data  protection , it is particularly relevant to consider the implementation (Recital 6) of techniques enabling  privacy- friendly approach es to databases that contain personal data . This includes techniques such as  anonymisation, pseudonymisation, differential privacy, generalisation, or suppression and  randomisation. ‘In many cases this implies that the data use and re- use in this context can only be done  in a secure processing environment set in place and supervised by the public  sector ’ (Recital 6).  Furthermore, the  Data Governance Act reaffirms that , in general , the processing of personal data  should rely upon one or more of the grounds for processing provided in Article 6 GDPR.  A more  speculative appraisal of the DGA effects is added in the text box below.                                                                 17  Article 1.3 GDPR: The free movement of personal data within the Union shall be neither restricted nor prohibited for reasons connected  with the protection of natural persons  with regard to the processing of personal data.   18  Commission Staff Working Document, Impact Assessment accompanying the document Proposal for a Regulation of the European  Parliament and of the Council on a framework for the free flow of non -personal data  in the European Union (SWD(2017) 304 final), part 1/2,  p. 3.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       35  PE 703.345  Box 1: The DGA and international data transfer    2.2. On the conditions of the parties: B2C, B2B, B2G, and G2B   The legal acts on data can also be classified on grounds of the condition that the parties to the legal  provisions on data access, use and re -use, or data sharing are addressed to. Essentially, the GDPR  focuses on the protection of natural persons regarding the processing of personal data and the free  movement of personal data (‘ data  subject ’). Other data -related legal acts provide rules governing data  access, data use and re -use, or data sharing in the context of B2B or B2G relations. This is particularly  visible in the Data Governance Act and the Open Data Directive,  whose material scopes of application  are defined by the fact that data (or documents) are held by public sector bodies or public  undertakings. In such cases, the ‘G’ component of the relation (G2B) is consubstantial to the goal of  ensuring the social benefit of protected  public sector data. The Data Governance Data also address es  B2B and B 2C data sharing with the establishment of a notification scheme for the provision of data  sharing services. Thus, in Chapter III (Arts. 9 and following), the Data Governance Act sets out  the  requirements that providers of certain data sharing services are subject to: intermediation services  between data holders that are legal persons and potential data users ; between data subjects seeking  to make their personal data available to potential  data users ; and members of a data cooperative (data  subjects, one -person companies, micro -SMEs). The Free Flow Regulation tackles the portability of data  in B2B scenarios while the GDPR provides rules for data portability  that benefit the data subject (na tural  persons). The proposed Data Act intends to complement the existing framework and enhance access  to, and further use of data in the benefit of both public and private actors. So far, the conditions of  access and further usage of data in B2B contexts a re frequently agreed by contracts between the  parties. In the negotiation and conclusion of such agreements, unfair situations due to asymmetric  bargaining of powers between the parties, or restrictive competition practices may emerge. Therefore,  the propo sed Data Act aims to provide fairness, clarity,  and certainty with respect to B2B access  and  sharing of data, both personal and non- personal, and to facilitate the use of privately held  data by the  public sector.  The Data Act is also expected to deal with the revision of the Database directive, but at  the time of writing only the roadmap and inception impact assessment were published, which are not  sufficient for a thorough legal scrutiny.  The DGA also establishes specific conditions applying to international transfers of certain categories  of non -personal data, identified as ‘highly sensitive’ (Article 11 and Recital 19). This kind of data  should be identifi ed by subsequent Union law, for instance in the context of the European Health  Data Space proposal. In this respect it has been observed that the DGA might render such  international transfers difficult (Baloup, 2021). It might also compound further the pro blems with  international transfer of data after that the US Safe Harbour and later the EU -US Privacy Shield were  invalidated by the Court of Justice (Schrems I and II case- law, C -362/14 and C -311/18), as illustrated  by Kiner (2020). Such problems have so f ar created legal uncertainty to the detriment of companies  dealing with EU -US data transfers that may result in soft data localization (Chander, 2020). An  econometrics study commissioned by Digital Europe shows that, reversing the current trends and harnes sing the power of international data transfers, Europe could be €2 trillion better off and gain  two million jobs by the end of the Digital Decade (Digital Europe, 2021). It is yet premature to  conclude that the DGA will exacerbate such problems, but this i s an example of how lack of  coherence between legal acts and the difficult trade- off between protecting citizens and not  hampering businesses can be detrimental to the European data economy and to the renewed  partnership with the US.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  36  As noted by the High -Level Expert Group on Business -to-Government (B2G) data sharing19, there are  some obstacles in B2G data use and data sharing to serve the public interest that requires attention.  An effective access to data for public interest depends on organizational, operational, technical, cultural, and legal facto rs. Lack of infrastructures, models and data sharing culture for public interest  compromises the effectiveness of B2G data sharing. A delicate balance is needed between the  protection of sensitive business data  and  possibility for data providers to continue monetizing their  data, and  the fluent access to data for serving public interest.  Although there are some references in  the Trade Secret Directive to public interest (Arts. 1.2.b 20, 5.b, 11.2.g, 13.1.g) as a limitative or exclusion   factor  as well as, int er alia, in the Database Directive (Art. 9.c referring solely to public security or  administrative and judicial procedure that is narrower than the idea of serving the  public interest).  However, these do not suffice to provide a clear, consistent, and comprehensive framework for B2G  data sharing. Likewise, in addition to existing sectoral rules21, data sharing in B2B contexts may require  further facilitating rules. First, to promote contractual fairness in private agreements to regulate B2B data sharing in asymmetric situation s. Second, to ensure that access and use of co -generated nonpersonal data, especially machine -generated data and linked to the use of IoT, AI and other emerging  technologies, do es not create unfair competition problems. Even more, i t might be considered whether  a sector -specific approach to B2B data sharing, after the accrued experience and the lessons learned in  the application of existing sectoral rules, is the optimal model, or, on the contrary, has a gap to fill with  a horizontal, coherent B2B data sharing regulatory strategy. Thus, the proposed Data Act would fill the gaps identified in B2B data sharing to ensure fairness in market transactions and in B2G contexts to facilitate the use of data for public interest.   2.3. On the interac tion between data access and data protection   The third vector to approach data- related legal acts underlines the interplay, and critical balance  between data governance and open data policies that promote data access, use and re- use, and the  protection reg imes that exclude or restrict access to data on grounds of confidentiality, trade secrets,  intellectual property rights, and privacy. From this perspective, the complementarity between t he  proposed Data Governance Act and the Open Data Act  is easily identi fied. As the latter excludes from  the scope of application precisely these documents (data) on grounds of such protection schemes, the  Data Governance Act would come to fill that gap. As the proposal explains, certain categories of data in public databases  are often not made available, not even for res earch or innovative activities.   19  Towards a European strategy on business -to-government data sharing for the public interest Final report prepared by the High -Level Expert  Group on Business -to- Government Data Sharing , European Union, 2020.   20  Article 1.2.b Trade Secret Directive: (b) the application of Union or national rules requiring trade secret holders to disclose, for reasons of public  interest, information, including trade secrets, to the public or to administrati ve or judicial authorities for the performance of the duties of those  authorities.  21  Inter alia, bank account information via the Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the interna l market, amending Directives 2002/65/EC, 2009/110/EC and 2013/36/ EU and Regulation (EU) No  1093/2010, and repealing Directive 2007/64/EC (OJ L 337, 23.12.2015, pp. 35 -127);  metering and electricity consumption information via  the (future) directive on common rules for the internal market in electricity (COM(2016)864/F2); repair and maintenance information via Regulation (EU) 2015/758 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 concerning type -approval requirements for the  deployment of  the eCall in -vehicle system based on the 112 service and amending Directive 2007/46/EC (OJ L 123, 19.5.2015, pp. 77 -89).:  information on medicinal products and clinical trials via the Commission Regulation (EC) No 729/2004 of 15 April 2004 concerning the classification of certain goods in the combined nomenclature; chemical properties of substances via the Regulation (EC) No 1907/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 December 2006 concerning the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH), establishing a European Chemicals Agency, amending Directive 1999/45/EC and repealing Council Regulation ( EEC) No  793/93 and Commission Regulation (EC) No 1488/94 as well as Council Directive 76/769/EEC and Commission Directives 91/155/EEC, 93/67/EEC, 93/105/EC and 2000/21/EC.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       37  PE 703.345  These categories include commercially confidential data, data subject to statistical confidentiality, data  protected by intellectual property rights of third parties, including trade secrets and personal data not  accessible because of  specific national or Union legislation, such as GDPR and ePrivacy Directive. The  required implementation of costly and time- consuming protection measures to comply with  relevant  legal conditions for  each category of data has led to the underutilisation of such data. The proposed  Data Governance Act responds to this need and fills the gap for data held by public sector bodies. The  interplay is also recognised in the GDPR as a natural limit in the exer cise of the right of access to  personal data by the data subjects, provided that the protection of third parties’ rights does not entail  in practice a total rejection (Recital 63). A data subject should have the right of access to personal data  which have been collected concerning him or her, and to exercise that right easily and at reasonable  intervals, to be aware of, and verify, the lawfulness of the processing. ‘ That right should not adversely  affect the rights or freedoms of others, including trade sec rets or intellectual property and in particular  the copyright protecting the software. However, the result of those considerations should not be a  refusal to provide all information to the data subject’ . Therefore, the consistency of the right of access  to personal data that underpins the GDPR,  and the protection  of certain rights should be  preserved to  the maximum extent possible with the red line drawn to prevent a total refusal of the right of the data  subject. Yet, there is an interesting interplay betw een the sui generis protection provided for by the  Database Directive and the data- driven innovation policy in the context of technological advances. In  the current legislative scenario, datasets can be protected as a trade secret if relevant protection  conditions are met (Art. 2.1 Trade Secret Directive), by intellectual property rights if they are original (Art. 3 Database Directive). They can also be protected under  the sui generis protection for databases  (even if they are not original) on grounds of the substantial investment in the obtaining, verification of  presentation of contents to prevent extraction and/or re- utilization of the whole or of a substantial part  of that database (Art. 7.1). In a pre -digital context, these protection schemes fit toge ther and provide a  coherent framework. The characteristics of the data economy and the need to foster data -driven  innovation require a re- evaluation of the existing framework. The policy aspiration to facilitate data  access, further use, and free flow might be countered by existing protection schemes that lead de facto  to restrictions in the access to and the further use of valuable data linked to IoT, AI and other emerging technologies. Such an undesired effect does not result from a regulatory gap as such, as long as there  are rules potentially or inadvertently addressing the issue. It might be considered instead as an overlap or a supervening conflict  between existing rules and policy goals in the database industry and  emerging data -economy policies. In t hat regard, the gap would be filled, or the conflict untangled with  the review of the Database Directive and the clarification of the controversial points. Primarily, the critical points are the following. First, the unclear status of machine -generated dat a and IoT data under  the sui generis database right. Machine -generated data can be massive and of utmost importance  either for public interest or for private activities. Therefore, the interpretation of the Database Directive provisions in the current draf ting or a future review of the Directive to address this controversy is critical  to assess whether the sui generis protection is consistent with the data policy in the Union or, on the  contrary, is counterproductive as it represents an obstacle to data  access. Second, is the distinction  between collecting and systematizing tasks (traditional database making) and data creation activities  (updating, maintenance, publication, curation). The original goal of the Database Directive to promote investment may beco me a disincentive and a barrier for the data economy depending on the  interpretation of the extent and scope of database making or the final direction taken in the review of  the Directive regarding data creation activities. In addition to the legal analysi s presented so far, some  final more general considerations are reported in the text box below.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  38 Box 2: On B2G data sharing also as a matter of non -regulatory governance  The access by governments to private sector data, or B2G data sharing is a particularly wicked issue.  The Commission Data Strategy (European Commission, 2020b : pp. 7 -8), considers the insufficient  access by public bodies to private sector data as a main barrier to improve evidence -driven policy making and public services provisions. There often are conflicts of interests between the private and  the public actor , for the latter aims at creating public value rather than mere financial gains that tend  to be sought by the former. The lack of governance frameworks creates uncertainties for companies sharing data as to issue of ‘liability regimes, intellectual propert y, and competition law’, as well as  problems related to privacy and the protection of customers’ personal data (Micheli, 2020, p.2). Furthermore, there are economic barriers: monopolistic companies charging high prices, high transaction costs and perceived  risks for data providers, and lack of incentives for private companies  (Martens and Dutch- Brown, 2020). So, there is a clear power dimension that relates to data  governance, defined as the power relations between all the actors affected by, or influencing, the way data are accessed, controlled, shared, and used, the various socio -technical arrangements set in  place to generate value from data, and how such value is redistributed between actors. In this context, data governance does not refer to data management practices, but to the decisions made  over data, who is able to make such decisions and thus to influence the way data are accessed,  controlled, used, and benefited from (Abraham et al., 2019). So, data persistence contributes to blur the understanding  of the potential risks and benefits of sharing own data with government. Prior  beliefs together with heuristics and bias may over- inflate perceived risk or expectation about  fairness, reciprocity, and equity, especially for non- dominant private sector act ors. 
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld  39   PE 703.345   DIG ITAL SERVICES AND MARKETS   3.1. The role of intermediaries and the interplay between digital services  and markets act s with data governance   In the data economy, platforms and other providers of intermediary services are principal actors. They  facilitate matching, reduce transaction costs, render trade more efficient, and help businesses reach their customers and explore new markets. Their prom inent position in the market is built on data and  fuelled by strong data -driven indirect network effects (Recital 2 P2B Regulation). Data generated  through or in relation to platforms foster innovation, and assist firms in business intelligence, product  development, and process optimization.  Data provide valuable, deep insights on how markets  function, prospects,  and trends. However, different actors – platform operator, professional /business   users, consumer users, third parties - have interest s in getting access to data and opportunities to re use it and , therefore, conflicting interests may concur in the elaboration and the implementation of  data -related practices in the platform economy. Data asymmetries and the power of data aggregation  (whose replicatio n is unfeasible or unaffordable) reinforce the dominant position of platforms and the  economic dependence of users, even professional /business users. This finding captures the critical  interplay between the data governance and management policy area and the legal acts on digital  services and digital markets (namely, e- Commerce Directive, P2B Regulation, DSA, DMA).   In the context of the platform economy, data sharing, access, and usage can be internal (in platform),  between users and the platform operator, which collects, observes,  and infers data from users’ activity ,  or external, in relation to third parties, either competitors or data seekers, or even public sector bodies  and authorities. There are different incentives or disincentives for the platform to  share data internally  or externally. Internally, platforms’ terms and conditions and policies establish the conditions on which users get access to, are entitled to use, and must  provide data. Therefore, data practices in the platform  economy must  be conf ronted with the data principles and rules provisioned in the data -related legal  acts. The e-Commerce Directive laid the foundations for the provisions of digital services (information  society services) in the Union. The extraordinary expansion of the market and the sophistication of the business models required first some sector -specific provisions ( i.e., in the Audio -Visual Services  Directive; the Copyright Directive) and subsequently a more ambitious initiative to revisit and update  the legal framewo rk with the proposed DSA . Furthermore, it required, to a certain extent and for certain  platforms with gatekeeping potential , the proposed DMA. In the e- Commerce Directive, the interplay  with data -related acts, in force at that time, is assumed with a simp le and clear recognition of  compatibility (Recital 14). It is stated that personal data protection and privacy rules are fully applicable to information society services; and therefore, it was not need ed to cover this issue in the Directive to   ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market, in particular the free movement of personal data between Member States. Accordingly, the implementation and application of the e-Commerce   Directive had to be made in full compliance with the principles relating to the protection of personal data, as regards to unsolicited commercial communication and the liability of intermediaries. Finally,  in the same Recital, it is explicitly recognised that it is not aimed to prevent the anonymous use of open  networks such as th e Internet. The relevance that access to personal data  gained  in the decades  following the adoption of the e-Commerce  Directive , explains the more explicit and wide treatment of  data -related issues in the subsequent legal acts and initiatives. The key points of interaction between  the P2B Regulation, the DSA and the DMA, and the data legal framework are considered below.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  40 3.2. Data -related issues in the P2B Regulation  The scope of P2B Regulation application is limited to the (contractual) relationship (Art. 2.2.c) between  business users (Art. 2.1) and certain intermediaries (Art. 1.1) as defined by the Regulation (P2B  relationship): online intermediation services (Art. 2.2) and online search engines (Art. 2.5). This scope of  application is narrower than the proposed scope of the DSA and, therefore, the interplay between the P2B Regulation, as lex specialis , and the DSA must be considered. Within its scope of application as  defined above, the P2 B Regulation contains several provisions on data- related aspects. The starting  point is the declaration that if personal data are processed in the platform, the GDPR, the ePrivacy Directive and any other relevant legislation must be complied with. Hence, the natural interplay with personal data legislation is recognised. Bey ond that, it must be taken into consideration that the  relationship between the provider and the professional user is based on a contractual agreement (including terms and conditions and internal policies included by reference). These contractual terms will address and govern data access, data use and data sharing within the platform.   The P2B Regulation aims to ensure fairness and transparency in these P2B relationships  by limiting  certain clauses, requiring transparency obligations, or imposing duties. As  far as data are concerned,  there are two key provisions. First, Article 4 on restriction, suspension, and termination. Second, Article 9 on access to data. When a provider decides, in conformity with the terms and conditions and its  internal policies, to restrict, suspend or terminate the provision of the services to a given business user  a statement of reasons for that decision must be provided. Against this decision, the professional user can complain (by the complaint -handling mechanisms of Art. 11). In case that the decision is revoked  accordingly, the provider must reinstate the business user and provide him/her with any access to  personal and non- personal data resulting from its use of the services , up to the moment the decision  (of restriction, suspension,  or termination) took effect. Therefore, the Regulation establishes here an  obligation to provide or restore access to data. As per Article 9, which clearly address the data access  question, the Regulation imposes a transparency obligation on pr oviders regarding the technical and  contractual conditions to access data by the business user. Data refer to both personal and non personal data. The description of data access policies (or non-access to data at all) must be contained in the terms and conditions (including the items listed in Art. 9.2). It is important to note here two  considerations. Firstly, that this provision does not prejudice the application of GDPR and the ePrivacy  Directive, and any other relevant legislation, to such data. Secondl y, that this provision only concerns  a duty of transparency, but it does not entail any obligation on the provider to disseminate or not  personal or non- personal data to business users (Recital 35). This leads to two conclusions. The  interplay between the P2B Regulation and the data protection legislation as far as personal data and  privacy legal acts are concerned, is preserved and unaltered. In fact, the Regulation aims to complement rules on data access and use with specific provisions in B2B contexts. From this  perspective, the P2B Regulation may create a regulatory gap, which is  two -fold. First, there is no  obligation to share data or provide access to, but a mere duty to disclose it in the terms and conditions.  So, there is no duty beyond that. It is n aturally not a gap if it embodies a policy decision. But it is  interesting to connect it with the following point, insofar as a gap might appear if such transparency  obligation is not applicable to similar services under equivalent policy conditions. Indeed, second, the rules provided for the Regulation, as limited as they have  been described, apply solely to the services  falling under the scope of the regulation. The P2B Regulation leaves services unregulated and data  aspects unaddressed. And in the analysis of the interplay between the DSA and the P2B Regulation,  this may represent  regulatory gaps  for consideration.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld  41   PE 703.345  3.3. Data -related issues in the DSA  This paragraph is focused on the interaction between the DSA and the data  protection and governance  policy area. First, the compatibility with personal data and privacy protection is explicitly recognised  (Article 1.5). Additionally, in several provisions regulating transparency and reporting obligations on  hosting services providers (including online platforms), the inclusion of personal data in publicly accessible information is prohibited  (i.e., Art. 15.4 or 30 DSA). Based on this key principle, the most  interesting, and probably challenging interplay between the DSA and the data domain is in relation to  solutions adopted to minimize the information asymmetry between the market players (platforms and very large platforms) and the regulators and authorities as the main addressees and beneficiaries. Many obligations and requirements provided for by the DSA are intended to ensure data accessibility for  monitoring and compliance assessment purposes. There are also other addressees of data such as  auditors (Art. 28) or vetted researchers (Art. 31). This scheme the DSA is built on is highly dependent upon a solid, well- defined, and fluent infrastructure to facilitate data access with such purposes. The  need to specify the data to be provided to comply with the different obligations (risk assessment,  audits, transparency reports, etc) should not be te chnically deemed as a regulatory gap, but it may be  highlighted as an implementation need.   3.4. Data obligations in the DMA  The DMA crystallizes an ex- ante regulatory strategy aimed to ensure contestability of digital markets  across the Union and to prevent unfair practices in the digital sector, where certain actors operate as  ‘gatekeepers’ by complement ing and reinforc ing antitrust mechanisms. The prominent position of  certain core platform service providers (Art. 2) and their gatekeeping potential to access markets,  resources, services, or infrastructures have defied the competition law logic. As a matter of fact,  competition law would be arguably too slow and to a certain extent inefficient. Therefore, the DMA represent s a regulatory shift towards a pre -emptive model. As in other legal acts, the compatibility of  the proposal with personal data protection framework is explicitly recognised. Not only the provisions of the DMA are applied without prejudice of the GDPR and other relevant legislation, but also the gatekeepers shall comply with and implement the obligations (under Arts 5 and 6) in compliance with  the GDPR and, it must be added here, with the cybersecurity legislation, with consumer protections  laws and with product safety  legislation . Furthermore, in relation to certain obligations, the gatekeeper  should enable business users to comply with GDPR requirements, for instance, with the obtaining of  the consent when required (Art. 6.1.h), Recital 55). It is important to note , however, that the DMA  is  intended to complement the data protection laws. Transparency obligations on deep consumer  profiling would help inform GDPR enforcement, and mandatory opt -out for data combination would  supplement the existing level of protection under the GDPR. These statements in the Explanatory  Memorandum  contained in the Proposal for the Regulation COM(2020) 842 final  (pp. 1 -13) 22 spotlight  the expected added protection that, beyond relying on and respecting existing data protection  legislation, the DMA may bring . Wi thin its scope of application delineated by the concept of  gatekeeper, the DMA contains several data -related provisions that reveal an interplay with data  protection legal acts. Article 5 contains a list of obligations that will follow the designation of a  provider  as gatekeeper and in respect of the core platform services. Letter a) prohibits the practice of combining  22  See:  https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/pr oposal -regulation -single -market -digital -services -digital -services act_en.pdf  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  42 personal data sourced from the core platform services with personal data from any other services  offered by the gatekeeper or with personal data from third -party services, and of signing in end users  to other services of the gatekeeper to  combine personal data, unless the end user has been presented  with the specific choice and provided consent in the sense of the GDPR. Article 6 lists obligations that  are susceptible of being further specified. Without being a real gap,  however, it has been questioned  whether placing such obligations under Article 6 is appropriate or rather placing them under Article 5 ,  where no further specification is needed. Specifically, the proposal has been made in relation to obligations under h) and i) that are data related. Attention will be solely focused on the former one due  to its interactions with other legal acts. Letter h) describes an important obligation of po rtability of data  for business users and end users. Portability of data is a clear intersection between GDPR for personal data, Free Flow Regulation for non- personal data and the DMA. The contribution of DMA to the  portability regimes, where gatekeepers are obliged to  it, should  ensure that business users and end  users can port that data in real time effectively, such as, for example , through high -quality application  programming interfaces. In that sense, the portability is not approached a s one -shot action, but as a  continuous, dynamic process based on real -time solutions. It has been proposed whether it should be  understood as a real portability right or rather as a ‘right to continuous, real -time access to data in situ’.  In assessing whether the adoption of the DMA fill s or open s regulatory gaps, the following  considerations must be made. First, it has been argued that the scope of application defined by an  exhaustive list (despite the review mechanism of Art. 17) in Article 22 might neither be complete no r  future -proof. The DMA applies to ‘core platform services’ defined as any of the following digital  services: online intermediation services, online search engines, online social networking services, video -sharing platform services, number- independent interpersonal communication services,  operating services, cloud computing services, advertising services. Only these services qualify. It is not  a gap to fill if that represent s an explicit choice. Second, the specification and the implementation of  the obliga tions under Article 5 and, especially, under Article 6 will require further efforts to provide  guidance and standards for compliance. That is not necessarily a regulatory gap , but it places the focus  on the implementation stage. The solution can be adopted  on a case -by-case basis along the logic of  the DMA of dialogue authority -provider, or in form of Guidelines as the ones adopted under the P2B  Regulation on rankings 23.  3.5. Digital services and digital markets   The interplay between the policy areas of consumer protection and competition and online services  and e -commerce primarily crystallizes in the interaction among the e-Commerce Directive, the DSA,  the P2B Regulation, and the DMA. All these legal acts togeth er, in addition to certain provisions in  sector -specific acts (Audio- Visual Services Directive 2010 and Copyright Directive 2019), shape the inprogress platform regulation in the Union. Whereas the DSA builds on the foundations of the eCommerce Directive , the DMA builds on the P2B Regulation without conflicting with it. Concurrently,  the DSA is a horizontal initiative that interweaves with the DMA but also with different policy goals and  objectives. An enticing interplay to explore is whether the criteria  (Art. 25 DSA) to define very large  platforms for the purposes of the DSA – methodology to be set out in delegated acts – will be or should  be consistent with the criteria for the designation of gatekeepers under the DMA or if these respective  23  Guidelines on ranking transparency pursuant to Regulation (EU) 2019/1150 of the European Parliament and of the Council (OJ C 424,  8.12.2020, p. 1).  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld  43   PE 703.345  designations  will have any mutual implications. Under the DSA, very large platforms, pursuant to a  staggered scheme of obligations, are subjected to additional substantive obligations.   In the DMA, the designation as gatekeepers is linked to certain obligations stated  (Art. 5 DMA) or to be  specified (Art. 6 DMA). The interplay between the DMA and the P2B Regulation is of a complementarity  nature. The DMA relies on concepts, definitions, and certain solutions ( i.e., the Guidelines on rankings)  of the P2B Regulation but differ in several aspects. First, even if the P2B Regulation excludes providers  that are small enterprises pursuant to the Annex to Recommendation 2003/361/EC from certain obligations ( i.e., Art. 11.5, Art. 12.7), the Regulation is not based on the size or  the market relevance of  the provider, whereas the logic of the DMA is to identify and designate on quantitative and qualitative  criteria providers with gatekeeping potential. Second, while the P2B Regulation applies to online intermediation services and online search engines, the DMA covers online intermediation services,  online search engines, online social networking services, video -sharing platform services, numberindependent interpersonal communication services, operating services, cloud computing services,  advertising services. From this comparison, there is a possible gap to highlight. The P2B Regulation  restricts its scope of application to platforms (online intermediation services providers) that enable the  initiation or the completion of B2C trans actions. But it should be considered whether there are  sound  reasons not to extend the Regulation to platforms enabling B2B transactions.

Concept and definition of AI in the legal acts   In assessing the status of the regulation on AI in the EU and selecting relevant the vertical legislative  act that mention AI and are, thus relevant , the first step to take is to define the subject matter. AI is a  multifaceted phenomenon whose operation depends upon a conjunction of actors (operators, users,  manufacturers, data providers, distributors, etc. ), components, and technological solutions, and with  uses and purposes extremely varied and diverse. Therefore, a complete regulatory framework for AI  will come as  a combination of both AI -specific and general rules dealing with transversal aspects (data,  cybersecurity, consumer protection, competition, IP rights, etc. ). Legal acts defining and explicitly  addressing AI systems   In this category there is basically only one legislative proposal  presented by the Commission: the AI Act  proposal24. Of relevance, however, there is also the European Parliament Resolution with  recommendations to the Commission on a civil liability regime for artificial intelligence  (2020/2014(INL)) that includes a Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council  on liability for the operation of Artificial Intelligence -systems. This is only and approved resolution that,  however, contains an example of an AI -specific legislative proposal. We refer to it henceforth simply as  Resolution on liability.  The Resolution on liability act provides for rules on the placing on the market,  the putting into service and the use of AI systems. The definition of AI system for the purposes of the  proposed instrument is as follows: ‘artificial intelligence system ’ (AI system) means software that is  developed with one or more of the techniques and approaches listed in Annex I and can, for a given  set of human -defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or  decisions influencing  the environments they interact with’ (Art. 3.1 AI Act) . The compromise text  unveiled at the end of November 2021  by the Slovenian Presidency of the European Council  [‘Joint  Compromise’, Council of the European Union, Presidency compromise text, 29 November 2021,  2021/0106(COD), henceforth simply ‘ Joint Compromise’] proposed the changes to this definition as  depicted in the screenshot below. The text, in its preamble, explains that the changes make an  explicit  reference to the fact that AI  system should be capable of determining how to achieve a given set of  human defined objectives by learning, reasoning, or modelling , to distinguish them of more traditional  software systems, which should not fall under the scope of application of this proposed regulation.   24  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on Artificial Intelligence (Artificial  Intelligence Act) and amending certain union legislative acts, COM (2021) 206 final, Brussels, 21.4.2021.

Likewise, insofar as AI systems’ outputs are content,  predictions, recommendations,  or decisions, legal acts laying down rul es for algorithmic content  moderation, recommendation or decision -making will be to that extent also applicable. Interestingly,  also the European parliament R esolution on liability for the operation of Artificial Intelligence- systems  expressly refers to AI systems and formulate s its own definition26 for the purposes of introducing a  future legal act (Art. 3.a). The resolution  establishes a liability regime for the damages caused by AI  systems and, therefore, this would be  a private -law legal solution  compare d to the regulatory approach  of the AI Act .   25  The compromise proposed by the Slovenian EU Presidency is available on the Council’s public register of documents at:  https://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST- 14278 -2021-INIT/en/pdf .  26  “AI- system” means a system that is either software -based or embedded in hardware devices, and that displays behaviour simulating  intelligence by, inter alia , collecting and processing data, analysing and interpreting its environment, and by taking action, with some  degree of autonomy, to achieve specific goals ”.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  46 This purpose -specific definition, even if it does  not depart from AI Act’s definition, does include an  express reference to  the vital role that data play in the operation, and training of AI systems. Hence, the  importance of data -related legal acts is utmost for painting the full regulatory picture for AI.   A more analytical comparison of both definitions invites the following considerations. First, both  definitions describe AI systems as software. The resolution  on liability makes the distinction between  embedded software and standalone software because damages caused by robots and other AI -driven  hardware devices are to be clearly addressed. Second, the AI  Act is more specific in detailing the  techniques that qualify a software as an AI system. To that end, selected techniques are listed in Annex I 27. The proposal utilizes a more abstract characterization of AI with a reference to ‘behaviour simulating  intelligence’. Third, both definitions stress the fact that AI systems operates to achieve pre -defined  goals.  Four, it is interesting to note how the AI Act is more cautious in defining AI systems a software  that operate s and generates outputs based on  human -defined objectives . On the other hand , the   Proposal on liability introduces an enticing element of ‘ autonomy ’. Five, both the AI act and the  resolution on liability  underline the interaction of the AI system with the environment, by collecting  and interpreting data and producing actions. The AI Act is simply more specific in defining such actions as content, predictions, recommendations,  or decisions. We add in the box below some general extra legal  considerations on the problematic aspects of defining AI  based on a review of relevant definitions  in the literature (Buiten, 2019).  Box 3: On the problems of define AI for legislative purposes   27  (a) Machine learning approaches, inclu ding supe rvised, unsupervised and reinforce ment learning, using a wide variety of methods including  deep learning; (b) Lo gic and knowledge -based approaches , including knowledge representation, inductive (logic) programming,  knowledge bases, inference and deductive engines, (symbolic) reasoning and expert systems; (c) Statistical appro aches,  Bayesian e stimation, search and optimization method.There is not yet any widely accepted definition of AI even among experts in the field. Various  definitions focus on concept of autonomy and intelligence, but there are no objective and future  proof ways to characterise what one can consider an autonomous and intelligent computational  procedure. The problem for the perspective of law is that what we consider autonomous or  intelligent is subjective and will change over time. What we perceived as unpredictable,  autonomous, and intelligent outcomes of a computa tional procedure thirty years ago, it probably  appears as nothing special today. If we define AI by intelligence, then the definition is highly  contingent on how we as humans perceive outcomes to be intelligent. So, most definitions based on  autonomy and i ntelligence are subjective, circular, and are not future proof. AI becomes what we call  AI. But this makes it unsuitable as a basis for laws and regulations. A more pragmatic solution would be what is common to all AI system and applications. The answer is simple: the technology of  algorithms. So, policy debates and law making, may be, should focus on regulating algorithms rather  than AI systems in general.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld  47   PE 703.345  In the legal acts grouped under sections 4.1.2. and 4.1.3. there is no definition of AI and, as it  is explained  below, the term is not even mentioned in the text s. Nonetheless, these legal acts do incidentally define  the legal framework for AI in a broad sense either tackling legal issues related to algorithmic systems  or laying the foundations of a co nducive environment.   4.1.1.  Legal acts providing for rules on algorithmic processes and algorithm -driven  decision -making   There is a larger number of legal acts whose subject matter is not AI but which they refer to  it. They  provide for rules on algorithms, algorithmic systems of diverse sorts, automation,  or automatic  decision -making. In this category of legal acts, the term AI or AI system is not mentioned at all in the  legal provisions and only some references to AI, if any, might be occasionally contained in the recitals  or the preamble. However, they are relevant in the study if a functional, operational, and/or conceptual  link between the definition of AI systems and the variety of algorithmic systems can be explained, as discussed below. The legal acts pertain to this broad category  include  GDPR, DSA, DMA, or, inter alia,  P2B Regulation . They  refer to algorithmic rating, algorithmic decision -making, algorithmic  recommender systems, algorithmic content moderation, algorithmic structures, automated profiling,  or a variety of activities and actions conducted by automated means. They  include rules related to  algorithms, such as: disclosure, risk assessment, accountability and transparency audits, on -site  inspections, obtaining consent, etc. As the definition of AI systems proposed by the AI Act reveals,  recommendations, decisions, predictions, or content of any kind, as well as resultant actions of the system on or in relation to the environment are natural and frequent outputs of AI systems.  Accordingly, legal ac ts providing rules for algorithmic processes and decision -making in a diversity of  scenarios and with a variety of purposes are also relevant to the construction of the regulatory  framework for AI in the EU. Provided that the methods and approaches listed in Annex I of the proposed  AI Act are used, an AI system may fall under the AI Act as well as under other legal acts to the extent of the specific purpose or the concrete action. As an example, if the system is intended for producing  recommendations by a very large platform, DSA (Art. 29) may be applicable; or if the system is applied  to profiling, GDPR (Art. 22) may be relevant. In conclusion, u nderstanding the complementarity   between the AI -centred legal acts and the range of legal acts that directly or indirectly address the use  of algorithms for a variety of purposes and tackle different legal issues arising from algorithmic decision -making is instrumental to depict the full  picture on the current and future AI regulatory  framework.   4.1.2.  Legal acts paving the way for the development of AI   There are other legal acts that, although do not regulate AI and in some cases neither mention it, lay  some of the foundations for creating an A I-promoting environment. In this respect, it is worth recalling  that the development, testing, training, deployment and use of AI systems do greatly depend upon an  environment conducive to promote trustworthiness, fairness, and safety of AI. This category of legal  acts concerns  cybersecurity, data governance, infrastructure, digital identity, or trust services, inter alia .  Most of the legal acts falling under this category are not going to be analysed in detail in the study of  the interplay and the regulatory gaps, insofar as they aim to settle the general environment for the digital economy without a specific focus on AI.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  48 4.2. Taxonomy of relevant legislative initiatives   In assessing the relevance of the legislative initiatives for the regulation of the AI and  before delving  into the coherence of the work in progress, the interplay between each initiative and the possible  overlaps and gaps, the legislative initiatives must be grouped in three categories based on the  proximity to the subject matter: artificial i ntelligence (AI). While there are legal acts that are intended  to regulate, totally or partially, the use, placing  on the market or the application for certain purposes of  AI systems, others do or may simply impact on the regulation of AI indirectly or inc identally, as the  scope of application of the legal act and its policy goals are different and AI is only referred as a tool or  an instrument. Listed legal acts, in all categories (existing, proposed, and possible) that are relevant for  the EU, can be clas sified in the following three groups28.  4.2.1.  Legal acts, proposals, or possible initiatives aim to regulate, totally or partially, in  a horizontal manner or with a sector -specific approach, the use of AI   The most paradigmatic and clear example would be the AI  Act . The AI Act follows  a risk -based  regulatory approach. AI systems are classified in three groups  in the Act preamble and in the related  Impact Assessment: unacceptable, high,  or low /minimal risk.  In the Act itself only ‘high risk’ and ‘other  than AI risk’ systems are mentioned. Regulatory consequences are  prohibition (selected unacceptablerisk use s), compliance of mandatory requirements and ex -ante conformity assessment  and post- market  monitoring  (high -risk use s), and transparency obligations (certain l ow-risk uses). In complying with the  AI Act requirements: providers of AI systems, manufacturers, importers, distributors, users or third  parties (if they are deemed providers for the purposes of the AI Act) are subject to a set of obligations.  These obligations are without prejudice to other obligations under Union or national law. Therefore,  ‘the AI Act does not aim to provide  an all-e mbracing, comprehensive regulatory frame work for the  use, placing on the market or putting into service in the Union’. The scope of application is limite d  by the specific practices and uses covered (with the subsequent amendments of respective  Annexes), the territorial application (Art. 2), and the specific regulatory goal (require ments for the  use, placing on the  market and putting into service). Other implications or legal issues arising from AI  systems, even those  covered by the AI Act, do not fall under the sphere of application of the proposal   (liability for damage s caused, IP rights, consumer protectio n, etc.). The European Parliament  Resolution on liability is aligned with the efforts made in the EU to assess the adequacy of the  legacy  liability regimes to the distinctive features of AI systems and the effectiveness of the current  legal framework (contractual liability, extracontractual liability, defective  product liability), both at  an EU level and at a national one, to prevent and compensate damages caused by AI. The Expert  Grou p on New Te chnologie s and Liability, divided in two formations (Ne w Technologies formatio n  and Pro duct Liability) tackle d these issues and the Report on Liability for AI and other emerging  technologies was published with a set o f findings, recommendations, and guidance . As the Report  and the work of both formations reveal, a coherent, effective, and sound liability regime for damages  caused by AI system is one of the areas claiming more regulatory atte ntion and a gap to be filled,  either by the adoption of new legal acts, as the proposal of the EP, or by the amendment of existing  instruments in the Union, namely, the Defective Product Liability Directive29.  28  Not surprisin gly, these groups widely correspond with the three categories proposed under 4.1 above even if now the perspective is not  the definition of AI but the  impact o f the legal act on the subject matter.   29  Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the appr oximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member  States concerning liability for defective products. Directive 1999/34/EC extended the scope of liability to agricultural and fishery products.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld  49   PE 703.345  4.2.2.  Legal acts, proposals, or possible initiatives whose subject matter is not explicitly the  AI, but they deal with aspects, features, properties, or dimensions of AI and its impact  on the economy.   AI systems are designed, developed, put in service, distributed, operated, and used in a technological  and regulatory environment. Thus, the regulation of converging technologies and the digital environment does impact on the reliability, the quality, the safety,  or the efficacy of AI. AI and other  emerging digital technologies share some disruptive features that explain the need to revisit current concepts and reconsider existing rules. These distinctive characteristics, of disruptive potential, are 30:  autonomy, complexity, opacity, openness, data dependence, and vulnerability. Accordingly, those legal acts aimed to either counter the negative effects of these distinctive features – i.e., laws on  cybersecurity to mitigate the vulnerability - , or to pro vide a legal framework conducive to foster the  positive effects of such features – i.e., data -related acts facilitating the free flow of data for AI -related  purposes. The feature- based description of AI as proposed above provides helpful guidance in  assessing the interplay of relevant legal acts.   a) Data use and reuse, data sharing, database protection AI’s training, development, and effective operation is highly dependent on the availability, reliability,  accuracy, and sufficiency of data. Therefore, legislative initiatives promoted by the European strategy for data and pertaining to the data economy af fect AI as far as data dependency is concerned. Data related legal acts’ relevance for AI is two -fold: data availability, accessibility,  and use/re- use, on the one  hand; and protection tools for investment in collection, processing, and aggregation of data .  AI development benefits from all efforts to foster data -driven innovation and economy. The EU has put  in place a solid and entrenched legal framework for the protection of personal data with the GDPR and  the ePrivacy Directive. Concurrently, the Open Data Directive in combination with the Data  Governance Act would pave the path to facilitate data sharing with an important role of data sharing intermediaries under the FAIR data principles. In addition, the Data Act would complement a legal  framework conducive to a fair allocation of data value among actors of the data economy, especially   B2B (data sharing, portability, safeguards of non -personal data in international contexts). AI and  technologies enabling data analytics and fed by machine- generated data are commonly dealing with  mixed datasets consisting of both personal and non- personal data. Therefore, a consistent approach  interlinking personal data protection rules and non- personal data legal framework is critical to foster  AI in the Union. The GDPR and  the Regulation on the free flow  of non -personal data provide for the free  movement of ‘all’ data within the EU. The Regulation on free flow  of non -personal data lays down a  general prohibition against data localisation requirement (Art. 4.1) unless justified on grounds of public  security; whereas the GDPR provides for the free movement of personal data within the Union without  restrictions on  the grounds of protection of personal data. Thus, the complementarity between the  GDPR and the Regulation on free  flow of non -personal data, on free movement of data within the Union  and data portability, does also reinforce the development, the training,  and the operation of AI systems  30 Commission Staff Working Documen t, Liability for emerging digital technologies - Accompanying the document Communication from the  Commission to the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council, the European Economic and Social Committee and the  Committee of the Regions, Artificial intelligence for Europe, SWD(2018) 137 final.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  50 in the EU.  Hence, the legal acts implementing the EU strategy on data economy do not directly address  AI as the AI Act and the Proposal on Liability, but they impact on the fuel that the AI needs to learn and  develop. In th at regard, the interplay crystallizes in a relation of complementarity. Policy goals and  scopes are different but converge in the resultant effect: an environment favourable to the  development of safe, reliable, and trustworthy AI.   Investment in sophistic ated systems for collecting, processing, and organizing data is vital to the data  economy. The concepts, rules and principles underpinning the Database Directive upon its adoption need to be reconcile d today with the technological advances and the policy g oals pursued by the EU  to foster a thriving data economy and data -driven innovation. Latest developments in data processing,  big data analytics, and database production are very closely linked to the burgeoning of AI and  challenge the Database Directive lo gic. In the absence of a proper adaptation of the Database directive  to the new scenario where AI plays the leading role, a regulatory gap may materialize. AI development and operation might be disincentivi sed if the Database Directive happens to have a deterring effect on  AI investment. But, concurrently, an expansion of the sui generis  protection enshrined by the Database  Directive might interfere with the policy goals of the EU Data Economy strategy in relation to the access to data. The distinction betw een purely collecting and systematizing tasks (traditional database  making) and data creation activities (updating, maintenance, publication, curation). The impact of expanding the database protection to data creation on data access for the development of AI. This  interplay, as described above, is conflictive. The Database Directive in its current version contradicts or may counter the efforts to unleash the potential of AI for Europe. Thus, more than a regulatory gap, a potential conflict of policies is to  be untied.    b) Cybersecurity and resilience Vulnerability is another distinctive feature of AI systems. Cybersecurity plays a crucial role in ensuring  that AI systems are resilient against attempts to alter their use, behaviour, performance or compromise their security properties by malicious third parties exploiting the system’s vulnerabilities. Cyberattacks  against AI systems can cause  damages with massive  losses or  alter the functioning of critical  infrastructures managed and operated by AI systems. The A I Act acknowledges the criticality of certain  AI systems that classif y as high -risk (Annex III) and the need to minimize the vulnerability of these  systems by ensuring a level of cybersecurity appropriate to the risks. Thus, suitable measures should theref ore be taken to provide accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity in the design and the  development of high- risk AI systems. (Art. 13, Art . 15). The interplay between the AI Act requirements  on cybersecurity and the Cybersecurity Act (Art. 42.2 AI Act) is the presumption that high- risk AI  systems that have been certified or for which a statement of conformity has been issued under a cybersecu rity scheme pursuant to the latter Regulation 2019/881 shall be presumed to follow the  cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 15 AI Act. Besides, the AI Act expressly recognizes the application of the Regulation 2019/1020 on market surveillance and compliance of products to AI systems covered by the AI Act with the needed adaptations: extensive concept of economic operator  to include all operators of the Title III, Chapter 3, AI Act, and definition of product as to cover all AI  systems falling under the scope of the AI Act. The interplay with existing sectoral safety legislation is ensured by integrating in the conformity assessment procedures the checks of the AI requirements  (new legislative framework) and by considering the requirements of the AI A ct in the adoption of  relevant implementing or delegated legislation under the old approach legislation. (i.e., Art. 82 in  relation to Regulation 2019/2144 on motor vehicles or the incorporation of the conformity assessment  and the provider’s procedural ob ligation into the Directive 2013/36 for credit institutions).  It must be  noted that, the earlier cited compromise text of the Slovenian Presidency introduced proposed 
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       51  PE 703.345  changes relevant to this matter. First, apparently EU Member States have obtained that security  competence are exclusively nationals and that AI systems developed exclusively for military purposes  should be taken out of the scope of the regulation. Second, the possibility of using biometric  identification systems in real -time has been extended  to actors that are not law enforcement  authorities but are collaborating with them. Third, t he reason for employing these systems has been  extended to protect critical infrastructure.   c) Opacity versus transparency  Transparency has been a constant in several  legal initiatives aimed to ensure fairness, well -informed  decisions, reduction of information asymmetry or protection and enforcement of rights. Transparency  is also deemed as an effective policy tool to counter the opacity of AI systems that would make their  operation incomprehensible to or too complex for natural persons. Opacity may describe two  situations. First, the fact that the process, the decision, or the interaction is performed by automated  means. Disclosing the fact that the system is automatic  (decision- making, facial recognition, content  generation, profiling, etc. ) would allow persons to adopt informed decisions, minimize the  manipulative or misleading effects, and enable objection to be subject to such automated processes. The AI Act relies on transparency with such purpose for systems that interact with humans, detect  emotions, or generate or manipulate content (‘deep fakes ’). Likewise, disclosure of the automated  nature of the decision is also presumed in Art. 22 GDPR as a prerequisite to exercise the right to object.  Second, the parameters, the conditions, and the criteria an algorithm -driven system works on. From  this perspective, transparency and explainability are policy solutions commonly shared by DSA, P2B  Regulation or DMA. Transparency obligations in the AI Act for high -risk systems goes further and refer  to clear instructions for use and other relevant information for the users (Art. 13).  d) Autonomy and complexity   Complexity and increasing autonomy are features that clearly impact on t he application of traditional  liability rules to damages caused by AI systems. The  inherent complexity of AI systems renders the  identification and the proof of the possible causes and the liable person/s particularly difficult, costly,  or onerous for the victim. Besides, the learning capabilities of the AI system may lead to increasingly  autonomous decisions whose consequences depart to a certain extent from the expected pre-determined performance. In such cases, the causal link debilitates, and the alloca tion of risk and liability  becomes a challenging task. Therefore, all efforts to adapt liability rules to face the challenges posed  by complex, autonomous AI system will contribute to the consolidation of the AI legal framework and  the filling of the gaps opened by these characteristics of AI systems: complexity and autonomy.  The  definition of AI system formulated by the Proposal on liability as described above underlines the  element of autonomy and tackles the problems that assuming a level of autonomy may entail. First, in  the definition (Art. 3.a) a certain degree of autonom y in taking actions and adopting decisions to  achieve the goals is accepted. That debilitates the link to attribute the damaging consequences.  However, to prevent a situation of undercompensating or non- compensating victims at all on the sole  basis of the technology user, the Proposal on liability warns that autonomy is not per se a defence for  the operator under the fault -based regime.  Article 8.2 in fine is clear when declaring that ‘(t)he operator  shall not be able to escape liability by arguing that the  harm or damage was caused by an autonomous  activity, device or process driven by his or her AI -system ’.      
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  52  4.2.3.  Legal acts that provide for rules related to algorithmic decision -making   Relevant legal acts contain several provisions on algorithmic decision- mak ing, processes,  or tasks  (GDPR, DSA, P2B Regulation, inter alia ). Some provisions provide for specific rules related to the use of  algorithmic decision -making – such as Article 22 GDPR on profiling or Article 29 DSA on algorithmic  recommender systems – while others are drafted as enabling provisions for the use of automated  means – content moderation or complaint -handling by automated means in DSA Articles 14, 15 o 17.  Algorithm -centred provisions complement the legal framework for AI insofar as they addres s certain  uses, applications, or purposes. In the analysis of the regulatory gaps below, these provisions will be  considered.   The focus of these legal acts is not the AI, but they provide for rules that do incidentally impact on the  legal regulation of AI inso far as they deal with obligations linked to the implementation  of algorithmic driven mechanisms. From these rules, certain principles can be inferred to trace the regulatory contours  of AI.   
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       53  PE 703.345    REGULATORY GAPS  AND COHERENCE   The analysis of the interplay between the selected legal acts, directly or indirectly regulating the  development, placing on the market, putting into service or use of AI systems, or other AI -related  aspects, or issues arising from algorithmic processes and decision -making may reveal intended or  inadvertent regulatory gaps. We  classify regulatory  gaps in three categories: a) regulatory gaps strictu   sensu  (see below); b ) latu sensu  inte rplay gaps (where interplay  creates  a space that remain s uncovered  or where it creates  uncertainty for market players ); c) implementation postponed gaps areas where the  legislative act postpones (possibly problematic issues are not addressed in the legal act and  will  become part  of the implementation phase ). Since  type ( c) has been widely discussed in the previous  three chapters, in this one  we focus on  gap strictu sensu  and on areas of lack of coherence in the  interplay bet ween legislative acts. Most prominent example of type (a) are:   • A narrow delimitation of the scope of application or a questionable exclusion f rom the scope  of a relevant act;   • An absence of substantive rules governing a specific issue deserving regulatory a ttention;   • An unintended unregulated space due to the draft ing/wording of legal provisions; and   •  A space uncovered by interrelated legal acts.   We do this with a specific focus on AI (section 5.1) and on its interaction with data protection and  privacy (section 5.2), and with cybersecurity (section 5.3). Other noteworthy gaps are briefly reviewed in section 5.4. Finally, in section 5.5 we present a summary taxonomy of gaps. As anticipated in the  introduction, AI is currently the cornerstone of digital legislation, and relatively more space is dedicated to it in section 5.1 where, however, besides the AI act  its interplays with other legislative acts are amply  discussed .  5.1. Focus on AI Act and interplay with other legislative acts   5.1.1.  The scope of application of the AI Act   Regulatory gaps will be first identified within the AI Act. By  delimiting the scope of application, the AI  Act delineates the contours o f the regulatory perimeter, excluding or not addressing certain purposes,  uses or sectors. In that regard, it might be argued that the AI Act leaves certain gaps uncovered. While  in some cases uncovered regulatory gaps  are unintended and require a discussion about how they  should be address ed, in other cases identified gaps may represent a policy decision. Finally, in other  cases, they are the results of a misinterpretation and thus require a clarification.   The gaps identified in the original proposal are listed below and integrated with considerations on the  changes introduced by the Joint Compromise  of 29 November 2021.   The following gaps in the AI Act are identified :  1. AI Act, Article 5 : the list of prohibited AI practices and uses in  Article 5  doesn’t cover a few  AI  practices , which are instead addressed by the Joint Compromise . In particular :  a. Social scoring  leading to detrimental/unfavourable treatment . It was argued31 that  social scoring by private entities non acting on behalf of pu blic authorities should be                                                                31  EDPB -EDPS Joint Opinion 5/2021 on the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised  rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act), 18 June 2021. The reason behind the opinion of the EDPB -EDPS was basically logical 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  54  prohibited together with any social scoring practice implemented by social media and  cloud service providers. The Joint Compromise , amending Article 5(1)c of the AI Act  by  erasing reference to ‘ public authorities or on their behalf ’, seemingly go es in the  direction of closing  this gap, insofar as it extend s the prohibition  of social scoring  beyond its initial use by public authorities;   b. Biometric identification systems . It was  argued32 that the definition of b iometric AI  system s in the proposal creates some inconsistency, which lends support to calls for  banning their uses  in non -public spaces for purposes other than law enforcement, or  not in real -time . The amendments to Article 5(1 )(d) agreed by the Joint Compromise  do not full y incorporate the proposed expansion of scope. The scope of the prohibition  for real -time use of biometric systems has been reduced. The amendment  of Article  5(1)(d) clarified that r eal-time remote biometric identification systems in publicly  accessible spaces could also be used by other actors, acting on behalf of law  enforcement authorities. Moreover, the list of objectives for which law enforcement  should be allowed to use real -time remote biometric identification, included also in  Article 5(1) (d), has  been slightly extended;   c. Military purpose AI systems . The general exclusion from the scope of the AI Act of AI  systems exclusively developed or used for military purposes has been questioned upon  the adoption of the Proposal. The Joint Compromise proposes the adding of a  justification of such exclusion in Recital 12 AI Act. As national security remains the sole  responsibility of Member States (Article 4(2) TEU), AI systems that are used or developed with an exclusive national -security purposes remain exclud ed from the AI  Act. The Joint Compromise would be then confirming that an unnoticed regulatory gap   is absent in the AI Act in relation to AI systems for military purposes, but the exclusion responds to a political decision. Nonetheless, the added clarifica tion in Recital 12 as per  the amendments proposed by the J oint Compromise reaffirms that the exclusion is  purely purpose- based. Therefore, dual -use AI systems would fall under the scope of the  AI Act ; and   d. AI system for research . The application of the AI Act to systems specifically developed  and put into service only for the purpose of scientific research and development  activity is unclear. The risk of an undesired deterring effect on freedom of science and  of an undermining impa ct on the development of research activity has been noted. The  Joint Compromise proposes the adding of a new Recital 21a to clarify to which extent  AI Act applies to AI systems specifically developed and put into service only for   scientific research:  not a pplicable , if the purpose  is only to conduct basic research ;                                                                and by analogy. The opinion notes that, in view of large discrimination risk, the AI Act proposal prohibits social scoring, i f performed over a  certain period of time or if performed public authorities or on their behalf. Then, it derives consequentially t hat the ban should include  private companies (the opinion cites social media and cloud service providers), since the process vast amount personal data a nd conduct  social scoring over long time periods. So, for the sake of symmetry, the opinion argues, the AI Act should prohibit any type of social scoring.   32  The EDPB -EDPS joint opinion also noted that the first version of the proposal has some conceptual shortcoming on biometric AI systems,   resulting in an incoherent account of their collective risks .See f or instance the analysis provided in L. Belkadi ‘The Proposed Artificial  Intelligence Act and Biometric Systems: A Peek Into the Conceptual Maze’, Law KU Leuven blog, 3 November, 2021  (https://www.law.kuleuven.be/citip/blog/the -proposed -artificial -intelligence -act-and-biometric -systems- part -ii/).  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       55  PE 703.345  applicable , if the purpose is the conduct of any research and development activity that  may lead to market deployment .  2. The purpose -specific approach . The AI Act is based on a purpose- specific  approach. Thus, the  classification of AI systems on a risk basis relies on the use or purpose. Such a scoping strategy  raises the question of general -purpose and multi -purpose AI systems. It is doubtful whether  general -purpose AI system33 would be subject to the proposal and, if so, to which extent,  insofar as the risk -based classification and the relevant obligations require a prior  determination of the purpose. The proposed Article 52a by the J oint Compromise intends to  close  the regulat ory gap by clarifying the application of the AI Act and the identification as a  provider of the AI system to  any person plac ing on the market or put ting into service a general purpose AI system ‘ for an intended purpose that makes it subject to the provisio ns’ of the  proposed Regulation. The Joint Compromise also proposes to exclude from the scope of  the AI  Act application a new category of general -purpose AI systems unless they are put under a  trademark or integrated into another s ystem subject to the regul ation;   3. AI Act, Article 6 :  it is argued that AI systems (scoring, rating) used in the insurance sector seem  not to be covered neither by Annex II nor by Annex III34. The proposed amendment of the Joint  Compromise to Annex III, point 5, would fill that regul atory gap insofar as it explicitly includes  high -risk AI systems ‘ intended to be used for insurance premium settings, underwritings and  claims assessments’ ;  4. AI Act, Article 7 : Annex III can be properly updated by the Commission. The above- mentioned  gap may be filled either by redrafting the text before approval, or by a future amendment of  the Annex III, or by providing guidance in interpretation, or by confirming the intended  exclusion from the scope of application. The proposed drafting of the J oint Compromise of  Article 84 may decrease the adaptability of the AI Act to future technological advances and AI uses (future proof), as paragraph 1.b delays the assessment of the Commi ssion of the need for  amendment of the list in Annex III to a 24 -month period. Even if such an extension reduces the  burden on the Commission to pilot and monitor the review of the AI Act and the costs of regular revision, it might fossilize the AI Act sco pe in the facing of the exponential growth of  technological applications. Nevertheless, Art 7 AI Act is always enabling the Commission to adopt delegated acts where needed. The combination of Art 7 and the new Article 84 as  proposed by the J oint Compromise   may succeed in strik ing a balance between the aspiration  to embrace new AI uses and the minimization of the cost of review ;  5. AI Act, Article 4.  The same reasoning applies to the definition of AI system as per the AI Act  and the agility of the procedure to  amend the techniques listed in Annex I, pursuant to Article  4. These considerations reveal a  potential  regulatory gap if the definition of AI or the listed  techniques and approaches under Annex I (unintendedly) leave outside the scope of the AI Act  practi ces, solutions or systems that should be covered by the legal act in conformity with its  policy goals.   By establishing an amendment procedure for the Commission to update the list of Annex I by  the adoption of delegated acts, the legislator is assuming that the scope of the proposed legal  act (AI Act) can evolve. In determining the definition of AI systems,  for the purposes of the                                                                33  It should be noted that, according the GDPR,  general -purpose AI systems would not be allowed to collect personal data.   34  Annex II contains the list of Union harmonisation legislation, while Annex III contains the list of High -Risk  AI systems referred to in Article  6(2).  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  56  proposed legal act, on the basis of the techniques and approaches listed in Annex I, there is a  policy decision to include certain techniques and exclude others  at the time where the AI Act  is adopted. In that regard, if the initia l list is very limited it might be always argued that there is  potentially a regulatory gap: those techniques and approaches that are not, at least in the initial  list, covered by the AI Act. For example, if there are techniques other than those listed in Annex  I but functionally equivalent to them that can be used in AI system – as Art. 4 does precisely set  out 'characteristics that are similar to the techniques and approaches listed’ in Annex I . But as  in many other aspects of the proposed legal acts, the re is not a pure regulatory gap if the  delimitation of the scope and, therefore, the exclusion of certain techniques and/or of specific  AI systems from the AI Act is not unintended but a conscious policy choice. The evolution of  the definition of AI system s in the AI Act exemplifies how the policy compromise has to  crystallize in the final drafting of the legal provision. During the negotiations, it has been discussed whether the scope of the AI Act should cover any automated system or solely those  systems that can be classified as ‘learning systems’. Accordingly, the list of techniques and  approaches in Annex I should be adjusted to a wider view or to a narrower view  instead . Should  the narrower view prevail, it can always be asked which legal regime, if any, applies to the  systems not falling under the scope of the AI Act.   Art. 4 AI Act will indeed work as a gap -filling mechanisms provided for by the same legal act to  keep the legal framework up to date to market  and technological developments;    6.  Low risk  AI systems and Article 67 AI Act  – It cannot be totally excluded the possibility that  a low -risk AI system, despite not having been classified as a high -risk AI system, may present a  risk to the health or safety for persons as referred by Article 67 AI Ac t. However, it seems that  Article 67 AI Act cannot apply to compliant low -risk AI systems. That means that the only way  to mitigate the risk and ensure the appropriate measures is to amend the Annex III and include  the concerned purpose or use. It might be reconsidered this methodology and provides for  more granular application of certain duties or provisions.   In particular, the resort to codes of conducts to incentive voluntary compliance of requirements  by AI systems other than high -risk AI system may co ntribute to such a granular application (Art.  69 AI Act) ; and   7. Mixed high -risk/low -risk AI systems. Insofar as the classification of AI systems as high -risk in  Annex III is based on purpose or use, it is plausible and likely that providers put on the market   AI systems of a mixed nature due to the combination or the convergence of listed high- risk  purposes and non- listed purposes. If that happens, the providers need to know whether the  two regulatory regimes should be applied: high- risk AI system requirements  to the part of the  system performing such high -risk purpose, and low -risk AI system requirements to the rest, if  that is feasible, or, on the contrary, the high risk absorbs the low risk and then it prevails. Then,  as soon as a high -risk purpose, even inc idental or minor, is pursued by the AI system the  strictest high -risk regime applies. The AI Act does not provide for a n express rule or guidance  for the providers to assess compliance in such cases of mixed AI system. This case may recall the solution provided for mixed databases where personal and non- personal data are closely  linked. Clarification in the proposed legal act (AI Act) how to manage complex and mixed AI  system may desirably increase legal uncertainty.     
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       57  PE 703.345  5.1.2.  Interplay between AI Act and other legal acts   The interplay between the AI Act as the core component of the AI regulatory framework and other legal  acts, as identified below  (rules on sandboxes, liabilit y rules, defective product liability and strict liability  regimes) reveal some doubtful areas:   1. Title V. Art. 53 AI Act -  AI Regulatory sandboxes . Subject to further implementing acts, a  proper coordination between AI regulatory sandboxes and other ongoing  or future sandboxes  (financial sandboxes, mobility sandboxes) within the EU needs to be guaranteed, as many  innovative projects eligible in other sandboxes do frequently incorporate AI solutions. As an  illustration, the financial sandbox implemented in Sp ain by Law 7/2020, of 13 November, para  la transformación digital  del sistema financiero . (Official Bulletin BOE 14 November 2020), Title II,  Articles 5 and following. A need of coordination with existing laws, but more importantly with future ini tiatives in other EU states, is to be alleged;   2. Burden of proof for n on-compliance of obligations . The effect s of non -compliance of  obligations and requirements,  laid down in the AI Act , by the relevant actor on the application  of extracontractual and defective prod uct liability rules  remain unclear. The compliance or non compliance of certain obligations laid down by the AI Act may trigger (rebuttable)  presumptions for the purposes of attributing liability and allocating the burden of proof. The allocation of burden  of proof is mainly regulated by national law as EU tort law is not  harmonized. In that regard, domestic liability rules or procedural rules establish the level of  proof and the allocation of the burden of proof in general. At the  EU level, there is a harm onized  regime though for defective products 35. Under this regimen, t he injured person shall be  required to prove the damage, the defect and the causal relationship between defect and  damage.  According to a recent report of the Expert Group on Liability and New Technology set  up by the Commission (European Commission, 2019), logging requirements should protect the  victims. AI systems should have logging features to monitor activities, in absence of which or in case of failure to provide logged data, the bur den of proof should be reversed;  3. High -risk category  (Art. 6 AI Act) and liability rules . Additionally, it is not clear whether  the  high -risk category under the AI Act is consistent with  the liability rules  for damages caused by  AI systems. Speci fically, to which extent the designation as a high- risk is consistent throughout  all relevant regulations and whether the high- risk category should lead to the application of  strict liability 36 regimes in any event. Traditionally, the high risk posed by an act ivity (keepers of  animals, motor vehicles, immovables in unsafe conditions, etc .) is an argument for applying  strict liability to the ‘keeper of a source of danger’. Consequently, a strict liability system would efficiently allocate the incentives to adopt  the duty of care and adapt the level of the high- risk  activity. Non -contractual liability rules, either being fault -based or risk -based regimes, are  essentially at a national level. At an EU harmonized level, the product liability regime is arguably  a cas e of strict liability  (even if there is scholars’ debate on whether there is a genuine strict  liability regime or, on the contrary, the product defect is indeed replacing the concept of  diligence as inspiring a fault -based liability regime) . The aim of the Directive on defective  product liability (Directive 85/374/EEC and Directive 1999/34/EC) is precisely to hold the  manufacturer strictly liability for damages caused by defect in the products put on the market.                                                                35  Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member  States concerning liability for defective products .  36 Strict liability means liability for injury or damage to another person without  fault . 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  58 The emergence of AI system has revitalized the rationale behind the strict liability. Thus, if AI is  deemed to be a source of danger that  is likely to  increase the ordinary risk of any activity, a case  for a strict liability regime for damages caused by AI system is put forward . That is the interlink   between the definition of high-risk in the AI Act and the relevance for the purposes of liability.  In fact, a  connection can be found between the notion of high- risk under the AI Act and the  risk-liability regime proposed by the Proposal on Liability. Acc ording to this proposal , fault based liability is the liability regime by default. Strict liability rules are provided for certain AI systems designated as high -risk, which is defined  as ‘a significant potential in an autonomously  operating AI -system to ca use harm or damage to one or more persons in a manner that is  random and goes beyond what can reasonably be expected; the significance of the potential depends on the interplay between the severity of possible harm or damage, the degree of  autonomy of deci sion -making, the likelihood that the risk materializes and the manner and the  context in which the AI -system is being used ’ (Art 3. Proposal on liability) . Even if the description  of high risk might be aligned with the  high -risk category under the AI Act, the Proposal on  liability adopts a list- based approach , which is different. Article 4.2 refers to an exhaustive,  amendable by delegated act list enumerating which high- risk AI systems are subjected to strict  liability.  Still the opened question is whether an alignment or any kind of mutual interaction  between the definition of high-risk in the AI risk and the application of strict liability is needed  or there are distinct and separate legal systems with  different policy  goals to meet; and    4. Causal link (Article 62 AI Act) –  liability rules. By regulating reporting duties of serious incidents and malfunction of high- risk AI system, Article 62 AI Act states that the providers of such systems ha ve to notify any serious incid ent or any malfunctioning that entail a breach of obligations under Union law to protect fundamental right ‘immediately after the provider hasestablished a causal link between the AI system and the incident or the reasonable likeli hood of such a link’. The drafting of this provision brings about an interesting and uncertain interplay of AI Act and liability rules. Is Article 62 AI Act a provision aiming to allocate a burden of prooffor the purposes of placing liability? Shall the causal link established by the provider for the mere purposes of reporting incidents be relevant for attributing liability? Can thatdetermination of the causal link be deemed an assumption of liability by the providers? Andfinally, on which grounds should that causal link by rea sonably established by the providers ? I n that regard, the coordination with a future/possible legal action on liability for AI systems will be  fundamental.   5.1.3.  Liability for damages caused by AI systems   The adequacy of the liability rules to properly addre ss and compensate damages and losses caused by  AI system is a critical issue in the shaping of a flawless regulatory framework for AI in the EU. We should distinguish here between (i) strict and fault- based liability and (ii) defective product liability.   Strict and fault -based liability. In the absence of an AI -centred proposal as the one proposed by the  European Parliament resolution of 20 October 2020, the application of existing liability rules to  damages caused by AI system is challenging. As the Expert Group Report on Liability for AI  and other  emerging  technologies underlined, there are challenges in the application of legal liability systems that  deserve attention. Inter alia , the identification of the liable person might be difficult considering the  complexity of technological ecosy stem with multitude of providers, components, and services. The  opacity and the vulnerability invite reconsidering the traditional placing of the burden of proof. The  increasing autonomy, the openness, and the data -dependency of AI systems may require furt her  monitoring of the system after the market placement.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       59  PE 703.345  Thus, if a European initiative for the liability of AI systems is not adopted, the liability rules may not be  suited to accommodate the challenges of AI leading to uncompensated or undercompensated victims.  Besides, the liability regime would remain unharmonized within the Union. Not only inharmonious  among the Member States, but also potentially disparate compared to the protection (level of  compensation) provided to victims of damages caused by oth er technologies.   Defective product liability.  Being the defective product liability regime harmonized at the EU level,  its consistency with the efforts to provide comprehensive rules for AI systems is particularly critical. A  public consultation37 collect ed information, findings, and views on the need to adapt the Product  Liability Directive for addressing products in the digital economy and the circular economy. Concerns  are related to the concept of product (AI as service or complex product of interconnected devices with  multiple, changing components), the proof of defect and causal link, the identification of the producer (or liable person), the extent and scope of the defences (later- defect defence, development risk) and   the impact of upgrading and upda ting the product after the market placement.   5.1.4.  Liability exemptions for intermediaries and use of AI systems  under the DSA   The interplay between the liability exemption –  under e-Commerce Directive as revisited in the DSA  –  and the intensive use of algorithmic decision -making in content moderation, notice and removal,  complaint -handling or conflict solving is a critical issue. The DSA does not ignore the interplay,  but it  requires further discussion. There are friction poi nts in several aspects:   1. Article 7 in relation to Article 6 DSA : Whether the deployment of a large- scale algorithm  content moderation system may entail de facto general monitoring ;  2. Article 4.1.e) and Article 5.1.b) DSA : Whether the poor performance of algo rithm ic voluntary  measures fail ing to detect (illegal/inappropriate) content should be interpreted as  explicit  operators’ knowledge and trigger the duty to react and the resultant liability ;   3. Article 22 DSA : How to determine under Article 22 DSA the liabil ity of the platform operator  vis-à-vis the party who is relying on the trader’s information if the data are inaccurate, outdated,  unverified, unverifiable, false. Is the platform a Trusted Third Party? ;   4. Article 22 DSA in relation to Article 5.3. DSA : How to apply Article 22 in the relation with  Article 5(3): if the information relating the transactions is presented in a way that it  leads  consumers to believe that information was provided by platforms or under their authority or control, besides excluding exemption of liability , might it render the platform liable for the  information of the trader as well? Would the platform become the ‘contracting party ’ (trader)? ;  and    5. Article 5(3)  DSA  and the consequences on contractual liability : In a close connection w ith  the previous issues, might the consumer enforce contractual remedies against the platform? It  is unclear whether Article 5(3) DSA goes beyond the liability for the platform for the information of the trader and might entail that the platform operator i s place d at the position of the trader  as contracting party vis- à-vis the consumer. The wording of Article 5(3) DSA seems to be limited  to liability for the trader’s information,  but a deeper reflection is advisable. The consumers’  expectations as regards to the actual contracting party might trigger further liability                                                                37  Civil liability – adapting liability rules to the digital age and artificial intelligence, Public consultation, https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/better regulation/have -your -say/initiatives/12979 -Civil -liability -adapting -liability -rules -to-the-digital -age-and-artificial -intelligence/public consultation_en . The public consultation period ended on 10 January 2022.  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  60  consequences. An eventual integration of the contract with the trader’s information may lead  to contractual liability. T hat invites a careful consideration of the remedies available for  consum ers in the EU consumer protection framework.   5.1.5.  Attribution of legal effects   In the context of contracts concluded by electronic means, while the e- Commerce Directive recognises  the validity and enforceability of such contracts, it remains unclear whether self-executed contracts  (smart contracts meeting the requirements to be qualified as legal contracts) shall not be denied legal  effects solely on the grounds that are coded in machine language and self -executable. This  might fill a  gap that has  not yet been addressed in the EU . Divergent  national legislation on this issue would  fragment the internal market in the development of AI/algorithms applications. There is still  uncertainty on this point because, despite the relevance for these purposes of Article 1 2 of the United  Nations on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts:   • No EU Member State has ratified the Convention;   • Article 12 does not necessarily cover either the conclusion of contracts in machine language  or the performance of s elf-executing obligations resulting from a smart contract; and   • Article 12. Use of automated message systems for contract formation . A contract formed by  the interaction of an automated message system and a natural person, or by the interaction of  automated  message systems, shall not be denied validity or enforceability  on the sole ground  that no natural person reviewed or intervened in each of the individual actions carried out by  the automated message systems or the resulting contract.    Clarifying the sta nce of the EU on the validity of smart contract s would also facilitate the decisions on  the attribution of legal effects arising from the use of AI systems beyond civil liability: whom to attribute  contractual rights and obligations, decisions, or actions with legal relevance adopted or performed  entirely by AI/algorithm -driven systems.   5.1.6.  Algorithmic transparency   A thorough analysis of the regulatory gaps in relation to algorithmic transparency should jointly  consider Article 22 GDPR, the transparency requirements laid down in the AI Act, the provision on  ranking of the P2B Regulation or the provisions on recommender systems for very large platform s in  the DS A. The joint analysis of these legal acts that we carried out confirms that the transparency ,  disclosure,  and explanation of parameters, criteria, or conditions under which certain algorithm -driven  systems work is a fundamental horizontal policy decision that should be taken at the EU level and where existing and proposed acts show little coherence. Comparing the scope of application of the  relevant provisions as set out in the above- referred legal acts (GDPR, DSA, P2B Regulation) does show  an incomplete picture with some regulatory gaps need ing attention. The scope of application of the  P2B Regulation is limited to online intermediation services (Art.2.2) that only cover transactional (or  pre-transactional) platforms for B2C relationships. Then, its provisions do not have impact beyond then.  While the DSA’s scope is significantly wider, the duties related to recommender systems are imposed  to very large platforms. Thus, transparency requirements provided for by the P2B Regulation (Art. 5) do  only apply to providers of online intermediation, while transparency requirements laid down in DSA  (Art. 29) a re only applicable to very large platforms. Providers other than providers of online  intermediation services covered by the P2B Regulation and platforms that are not very large platforms  are not subject to such transparency requirements as respectively pro vided by the two legal acts.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       61  PE 703.345  But additionally, the transparency requirements of the P2B Regulation are only applicable to ranking,  whereas the ones laid down in the DSA are exclusively related to recommender systems. Other  algorithmic systems are not regul ated by the referred legal provisions (Art. 5 P2B Regulation and Art.  29 DSA).   Yet, GDPR focuses on decisions ‘based solely on automated processing’  (Recital 71 and Art. 22) and it is  not clear the extent and the meaning of a purported right to explanatio n. Hence, Art 22 GDPR  requirements applies neither to partially automated processes that combines human and automated  processing nor vis -à-vis a person other than the data subject affected by the decisions adopted by  profiling, even if it is based solely o n automated processing.   Article 23 DSA applies to platforms – and  very large platforms by accumulation in the staggered model implemented by the DSA –  and adds to  the general transparency reporting obligations laid down in Article 13 other items. But the  obligation  imposed in Article 23 DSA is just limited to the ‘use of automatic means’ not the criteria and the  algorithmic patterns, and solely those automatic means used for the purpose of content moderation.   The above -noted illustrations reveal that the re are regulatory gaps in the transparency requirements  in relation to the personal scope of application (who has the duty to disclose or inform) as well as the  objective scope of application -  which algorithmic system is covered (ranking, recommender syst em,  content moderation, etc. ).   Among these items, it must  be mentioned the one included in paragraph 1 letter c) as it is aligned with  the policy of advising the user on certain decisions adopted by automated means. In fact, o nline and  very large platforms must  include in the report ’ any use made of automatic means for the purpose of  content moderation, including a specification of the precise purposes, indicators of the accuracy of the  automated means in fulfilling those purpo ses and any safeguards applied ’. There is no other limitation  or consequence deriving from the use of automated means for such purpose other than the need to report it. Along the same lines, all these legal acts contain references to ‘human review ’, ‘human   oversight ’ or ‘human intervention’ . It would be advisable to clarify the policy on this matter. Whether  there is a right to ask for human intervention and then when and on which conditions. Whether human  oversight is a duty, when and to which extent. Whet her human oversight is a measure to be adopted  on AI systems in any event and which consequences may arise from non- compliance. Thus, in this case,  the gap refers to a lack of totally homogeneous and consistent policy approach and regulatory  treatment that  may require further consideration.   In concluding on AI and the AI Act it is worth adding the  extra -legal considerations  included in next  text box.   Box 4: The debate on error -free datasets for AI systems    The expectation that ‘Training, validation and testing data sets should be sufficiently relevant,  representative and free of errors and complete in view of the intended purpose of the system” (Recital 44)  is unrealistic. Most public datasets are incomplete and, it is suggested , it would be better to talk of  thresholds (Floridi, 2021, p. 219). According to commentaries (see for instance Bertuzzi, 2021) on the  debate among Member States at the time the Joint Compromise text was leaked to the press, it seems  that also several EU c ountries stressed that requiring data sets that are complete and free of error might  be unfeasible. Such commentaries also noted that the excessive administrative burden for SMEs was a  recurrent theme in the discussions, an issue that was also raised at th e last summit of EU heads of states.  The requirement of complete datasets may turn into a gap because of inapplicability during the  implementation process. Whereas the issue of administrative burden might become the basis for opposition and other changes a s the legislative process of the Act continues . 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  62  5.2. AI, data protection, and privacy   The interplay between the AI Act and the GDPR is multi -fold and conspicuous. The AI Act acknowledges  that its provisions are without prejudice of any other EU legal acts the operators of AI systems must   abide by, in particular, data protection regime (Reci tal 41 AI Act). And more explicitly, the AI Act (Recital  41) stresses that it should not be interpreted as providing the legal ground for processing of personal  data. But such a generic statement of compatibility between the AI Act and the personal data  protection regime may not be sufficient to cover all possible use of data by AI systems. Therefore, more  clarity in the AI Act as regards the processing of personal data is needed and, consequently, some  regulatory gaps can be singled out.   a) Scope of AI Act, prohibited practices under Art icle 5 from the perspective of compatibility with  fundamental rights   Soon after the adoption of the AI Act, some claimed that the act does not protect individuals from  harms sufficiently, for it does not engage with the limita tions in international human rights treaties and  the EU Charter regarding the protection of fundamental rights in the digital context (Krupi, 2021) . In  the analysis of the prohibited AI practices and uses listed in Article 5, some of the practices have been  mentioned as uncovered in paragraph 5.1.1 above , with additional changes in op posite directions  introduced by the Slovenian Presidency compromise text of 29 November  2021. Additionally, from the  perspective of the compatibility with ‘ fundamental rights ’ and with  personal data protection, other  practices are arguably38 missing in the scope or under- classified – allegedly, they should be prohibited  or reclassified as high- risk. The following practices might be taken into consideration in the assessing  of possible regulatory gaps. As previously noted, the drafting decisio n to include or exclude and the  final classification of specific practices, as listed below, depend upon a policy decision, and therefore,  they do not constitute a regulatory gap if it is based on a policy option.   (i) Any  social scoring performed by socia l media and cloud service providers might be deemed as a  prohibited practice – as the proposal of the J oint Compromise , as detailed above, suggests.   (ii) Biometric  identification systems used in public spaces should include not only facial recognition,  but also gait, fingerprints, DNA, voice, keystrokes and other biometric or behavioural signals.   (iii) Emotion  recognition systems powered by AI may have highly undesired discriminatory and dignity  consequences, manipulative effects, and risk impact. Therefore, general prohibition might be an option  to consider.   Additionally, it has been claimed that the violation of data protection and privacy as a result of the use of AI system or as a consequence of the malfunctioning of the AI system should be explicitly considered  in the AI Act due to the serious impact. Simply relying on the general application of the GDPR and the  ePrivacy to prevent such infringements might not be sufficiently effective. The Joint Compromise  proposes a new drafting of the definition of ‘serious incident’ to include a ‘breach of obligations under  EU Law intended to protect fundamental rights’ (Art icle 3 (44) AI Act).                                                                       38  EDPB -EDPS Joint Opinion 5/2021 on the proposal for a Re gulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised  rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act), 18 June 2021.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       63  PE 703.345  Box 5: Two sources of AI risks     b) High -risk in both AI Act and GDPR –  Article 35  It might be clarified whether the categorization as high- risk un der the AI Act does automatically trigger  the presumption of high -risk for the purposes of the GDPR and with which consequences. Even if the  initial assessment reveals that the AI system is not high -risk, a more granular impact assessment on  data protectio n (under Article 35 GDPR) is needed considering the different uses.   c) Users and providers in the AI Act and controllers in the GDPR   In many AI systems, the data controllers, subject to the relevant obligations under the GDPR, are not  the providers but the u sers under the AI Act. The applicable obligations differ for users under the AI  Act.  If the proposal of the Joint Compromise for Art icle 52(a) on general purpose AI system is finally  adopted, the clarification of who is the relevant provider for the purpo ses of the AI Act in relation to an  intended purpose falling under the AI Act scope is needed. The proposed drafting of the J oint  Compromise does address such issue. Then, it should be maintained to prevent an unintended gap  that would require interpretative effort.   d) Chapter 2 Title III AI Act   Compliance with the GDPR might be explicitly required under Chapter 2, Title III, AI Act for AI systems.   e) Article 22 GDPR   It might be dubious whether the rights enshrined in Article 22 GDPR cover AI -driven systems  (automated decision making). In case, this aspect should be made explicit.   f) Remedies for individual under the AI Act   The AI Act does not specify rights and remedies available for individuals affected by AI systems. General  remedies or data -specifi c remedies might suffice, but clarification and considered analysis are needed.  The AI Act  could do much more to protect consumers’ rights and be much more incisive about  providing measures to redress the possible harms or losses that AI systems may cause.  This is the part  where one may expect and welcome more improvements in the proposal.   g) Article 25 GDPR   AI systems would be subject to data protection by design and by default, where applicable, but it might  not suffice. Encouraging the effective implementat ion of data protection principles in the design of AI  systems might help to ensure consistency and guarantee proper protection under the AI Act.   h) Regulatory sandbox es - Article 53 and 54 AI Act   Despite Recital 41 of AI Act, the relationship between Article  54 AI Act and data protection regimes is  unclear. GDPR provides the  legal basis for ‘further processing’ (as referred to by Article 54 AI Act), but In this respect a more general, non -legal commentary may be added. AI systems can be high -risk for  two broad reasons: they fail to work properly (but they are potentially useful) or simply because they  are put to work and they should not be used, such as for instance the potential abuse by public  authorities of AI systems for surveillance purpose. Without such distinction the regulator may  confuse ‘the resilience that good AI systems must have, with the resistance that must be exerted towards the bad AI systems’ (Floridi, 2021, p. 219). This conceptual gap, as other s can spotted in the  definition and scope of application will make conformity assessment harder (Floridi et al. 2018;  Mokander & Floridi 2021).  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  64  the AI Act does not clarify under which criteria are the interests of data subjects taken into  consideratio n as Articles 6(4) or 14 GDPR provides. Unless it is simply considered that Article 54  constitutes the Union law on which the ‘lawful processing’ is based –  as Art-  6(4) GDPR clearly states.  Besides, in Article 54 AI Act is not stated whether the AI system s referred therein are only be used within  regulatory sandbox es.   i) Algorithmic training in the ePrivacy Regulation –  and Article 10 AI Act   AI-system training, validation and test are key to ensure the development of reliable, trustworthy, safe  AI. Therefore, the compatibility with purpose exception under ePrivacy Regulation is vital. Training  purpose might be considered explicitly as a compatible purpose. Consent in those case and for such  purpose is unfeasible. Therefore, Article 10 AI Act may be d rafted accordingly.   j) M2M data processing: ePrivacy and AI Act   AI systems can frequently operate in Machine- to-Machine (M2M) environments. AI Act can apply to AI  systems that process data in M2M contexts. The application of the ePrivacy Regulation to M2M  com munications should be clarified. Excluding M2M data processing from the scope of the ePrivacy  Regulation, even if it might be covered by the AI Act, is advocated to facilitate, and promote data  processing and data sharing that may drive circular and sustai nable economy39.   k) AI Act record -keeping and ePrivacy and GDPR   Article 12 of the AI Act sets out rules for logging capabilities of AI systems enabling the automatic recording of events. In complying with these logging capabilities, the high -risk AI systems should be  designed and developed so as to provide at minimum the data listed in Article 12(4) AI Act. That may  entail to record traffic data, access to information related to electronic communications or persona data   in tracing and logging the inputs feeding the AI -driven decision- making or action . This obligation  should then be put in connection with the types of communication data that the ePrivacy Directive   covers as the logging purpose may interfere with the data processing rules. As regard the general material scope, the ePrivacy Directive applies when the four following conditions are met: there is an electronic communications services, offered over an electronic communication network, being the  service and the network publicly av ailable and offered in the EU. Nonetheless that, Articles 5(3) and 13  ePrivacy Directive has an expanded material scope not only covering providers of electronic  communication services bat also website operators and other business. Concurrently , the data to be  logged must be treated as personal data for the purposes of the GDPR. Interplay between the ePrivacy  Directive and the GDPR exists. Both legal acts interact each other under a model of lex specialis   (ePrivacy) / lex generalis  (GDPR). Interestingly, the ePrivacy Directive ‘particularises’ GDPR provisions,  even by limiting the general lawful processing grounds of Article 6 GDPR when ePrivacy Directive applies . In that regard, the ePrivacy Directive  would act as lex specialis to the GDP R and, consequently ,  Article 5(3) ePrivacy Directive prevails over Art icle 6 GDPR.   5.3. AI and cybersecurity   There  are several interplay s between AI and cybersecurity. First, machine- learning and deep -learning  techniques, might aggravate the cybersecurity risks insofar as they render cyber- attacks better  targeted, more destructive,  and effective, and more elusive to prevention measures as they change and                                                                39  Comments by the Centre for Information Policy Leadership on the Draft E -Privacy Regulation for the Purpose of the Trilogue Discussions,  29 September 2021.  
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       65  PE 703.345  adapt to new counterattacking responses. In that regard, AI increases the cybersecurity risk by  expanding the cyber threats and altering the typical characteristics of cyber- attacks.   Second, on the opposite direction AI systems will enhance the effectiveness of preventive measures  against cyber -attacks. AI serves as a shield against sophisticated cybersecurity breaches. The self learning capabilities of AI will enable to rapidly accommodate the preventive and responsive actions  to the changing nature of cyber- attacks.   Third, AI systems are exposed to vulnerabilities. Data -dependency, complexity, interconnectivity, and  increasing a utonomy due to learning capabilities expose AI systems to higher risks of hacking,  unexpected outputs, malfunctioning, or undetected biases. Measures to ensure resilience, technical  robustness, and cybersecurity in AI systems, and the ICT infrastructure, especially in critical and  strategical sectors, are to be adopted and effectively implemented.   The three above- mentioned interactions between AI and cybersecurity lead to varied interplays  between the AI Act40 and the Cybersecurity Act41, and the AI Act and the NIS2 Directive42 that may  reveal certain overlaps or regulatory gaps.   a) Objective/material Scope: AI Act and NIS2 Directive   The NIS2 Directive  adopts a scoping strategy based on sectors, subsectors, and types of entities. As per  Art. 2 NIS2 Directive , the provisions apply to public and private entities of a type referred to as essential  entities in Annex I and as important entities in Annex II. Annexes I and II list types of entities (undertakings, operators, producers, market partici pants, providers) in a variety of sectors and  subsectors classified as essential (electricity, transport, banking, financial market infrastructures, health, digital infrastructure, public administration) or important.   The AI Act approach to delimit the sco pe of application is, however, slightly different. The AI Act  focusses on the use or purpose for which the AI system is meant . That scoping strategy is particularly  illustrated by Annex III that list high -risk AI systems referred to in Art. 6(2) AI Act. Ev en if the listed AI  systems are group ed by areas (education, employment, public services, law enforcement, migration,  etc.), the selection of AI practices in the list is use/purpose -specific instead of sectoral. Additionally, the  classification as high -risk AI systems intended to be used as a safety component of a product or being   itself,  a product covered by the Union harmonisation legislation listed in Annex II is essentially  equipment -specific more than sector- specific.   Consequently, the AI Act and the NSI2 might differ in their scope of application. The AI Act  requirements will only apply if an AI system included in Annex II or Annex III and therefore classified as  high -risk is placed on the market, put into service, or used. Concurrently, if  the user of an AI system  is  a public or private entity classified as an important or essential type pursuant to NSI2, such regime will  apply on such grounds.                                                                   40  Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council laying down harmonised rules on Artificial Intelligen ce (Artificial  Intelligence Act) and amending certain union legislative acts, COM (2021) 206 final, Brussels, 21.4.2021.   41  Regulation (EU) 2019/881 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 April 2019 on ENISA (the European Union Agency f or  Cybersecurity) and on information and communications technology cybersec urity certification and repealing Regulation (EU) No 526/2013  (Cybersecurity Act) (Text with EEA relevance), PE/86/2018/REV/1, OJ L 151, 7.6.2019, p. 15 –69,  42  Proposal for a Directive  of the European Parliament and of the Council  on measures for a high co mmon level of cybersecurity across the  Union, repealing Directive (EU) 2016/1148, COM/2020/823 final.    
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  66  There are some evident connections between the use of certain AI systems in some sectors such as ‘ AI  systems intended to be used as safety components in the management and operation of road traffic  and the supply of water, gas, heating and electricity ’ listed in Annex III point 2 (a) of AI Act in relation to  the essential entities in the subsectors of electricity, heating, or gas listed in Annex I of NIS2 Directive. But other uses and purposes of AI systems listed in Annex III of AI systems are transver sal and do not  necessarily fall under specific sectors.     A potential regulatory gap would only arise if an AI system covered by the AI Act is not placed on the  market, put into service,  or used by an essential or important entity as listed in the Annexes  I and II of  the NIS2 Directive .   b) Personal scope: AI Act and NIS2 Directive   The NIS2 Directive  applies to public or private entities if  they are included in Annexes I and II and,  therefore, classified as essential or important.   The obligations provided for by the AI Act apply first to providers of high -risk AI systems. For the  purposes of the AI Act , providers are defined (Art. 3(2) AI Act) as ‘ a natural or legal person, public  authority, agency or other body that develops an AI system or that has an AI system developed with a  view to placing it on the market or putting it into service under its own name or trademark, whether  for payment or free of charge’ . Chapter 3 specifies the obligations of high- risk AI system  providers  (Arts.  16-23). But, in accorda nce with Art. 24 AI Act, such obligations do also apply to product manufacturers .  Under the same Chapter 3, the AI Act also provide s for obligations to importers (Art. 26), distributors  (Art. 27), and even users and third parties (Arts. 28 and 29) when, un der the circumstances provided for  by Art. 28(1), they are considered as providers for the purposes of the AI Act.     Interestingly, the AI Act provide s for obligations to ‘operators ’ – defined in Art. 3 as ‘ the provider, the  user, the authorised represent ative, the importer, and the distributor’  -, whereas the NIS2 provisions  apply to the public and private entities falling under the sector- based scope of application. As both  positions may or may not coincide, the provisions may concurrently or alternatively apply to the market  participants depending upon their status (listed entity, provider, importer, user, distributor, etc. ).   c) Micro and small enterprises in AI Act and NIS2 Directive    Both legal acts take into consideration the specific interests and needs of micro and small enterprises within the meaning of Commission Recommendation 2003/361/EC, but they differ in the treatment  and the extent of the exclusion. The AI Act uses the term ‘ small- scale provider ’ to describe a provider  that is a micro or a small enterprise. It should be noted that the J oint Compromise proposes to replace  in the AI Act the term ‘small- scale provider ’ by ‘ SME provider ’. Hence, the size- related criterion is  relevant for providers and their obligations.   The NIS2 Directive excludes from the scope of application entities that qualify as micro and small  enterprises (Art. 2(1)). Nonetheless, as explained in Recital 9 and detailed in Art. 2(2), small and micro  entitie s fulfilling certain criteria that indicate a key role for the economies or societies or for particular  sectors or types of services (trust services, top -level domain name, public administration entity, the sole  provider in a Member State, potential impact  on public safety), are covered by the NIS2 Directive.      Under the AI Act, small -scale providers, as named by the proposal, are not excluded from the scope of  application. The provisions of the proposed Regulation apply to small -scale providers. Specific  rules for  small- scale providers are of two types.   First, Annex III AI Act point 5 contains a specific size -based exclusion: ‘ AI systems intended to be used  to evaluate the creditworthiness of natural persons or establish their credit score’  are classifie d as high -
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       67  PE 703.345  risk AI system except for AI systems put into service by small scale providers for their own use. The  reasons for this size -based personal exclusion are the limited scale of the impact and the available  alternative on the market (Recital 37 AI Ac t).  Second, AI Act provides for certain measures to promote and protect innovation taking into  considerations the interest of small -scale providers. That includes (Art. 55 AI Act) the access to  regulatory sandboxes, awareness -raising initiatives, guidance, and advice about the implementation  of the proposed Regulation, or even the proportionate reduction of fees for conformity assessment  under Article 43.   Accordingly, micro,  and small entities would be exempted from the obligations provided for the NIS2  Directive, except for those meeting the criteria laid down in Art. 2(2) NIS2 Directive, whereas they are  neither excluded from the AI Act’s scope, nor overall exempted from their obligations.   d) Critical infrastructure   The Joint Compromise proposes the inclusion of a definition of ‘critical infrastructure’ that would  connect the AI Act with the proposed Proposal for a Directive on the resilience of critical entities  (COM/2020/829 final). Adding ‘critical infrastructure’ in Article 5 AI Act traces a fundamental link between the AI Act and the Cybersecurity legal act insofar as it is complemented with the concept of  serious incident that essentially cover disruptions related to cybersecurity resilience.   The Joint Compromise also sugg ests the expansion of the exceptions to the prohibited practice of real time biometric identification in publicly accessible  spaces by law enforcement authorities ('or on their  behalf’) precisely to cover the use of such AI system to prevent specific and s ubstantial threats to critical  infrastructure.   Thus, the AI Act’s ban on certain AI purposes would not interfere, and possibly undermine the  effectiveness, of the efforts to ensure the resilience of critical entities, the protection of critical  infrastruc ture and the implementation of cybersecurity measures based on sophisticated AI systems.   e) Certification on cybersecurity: Article 42.2 AI Act in connection with Cybersecurity Act   The interplay between the AI Act requirements on cybersecurity and the Cybers ecurity Act (Art. 42.2 AI  Act) is the presumption that high -risk AI systems that have been certified or for which a statement of  conformity has been issued under a cybersecurity scheme pursuant to the latter Regulation 2019/881  shall be presumed to follow the cybersecurity requirements set out in Article 15 AI Act.   This solution avoids duplication of compliance costs, provides legal certainty to operators, and ensures a smooth interaction of both legal acts.   f) AI Act and Regulation 2019/1020 on market surve illance   Besides, the AI Act expressly recognizes the application of the Regulation 2019/1020 on market surveillance and compliance of products 43 to AI systems covered by the AI Act with the needed  adaptations: extensive concept of economic operator to inclu de all operators of the Title III, Chapter 3,  AI Act, and definition of product as to cover all AI systems falling under the scope of the AI Act.                                                                 43  Regulation (EU) 2019/1020 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 June 2019 on market surveillance and compliance  of  products and amending  Directive 2004/42/EC and Regulations (EC) No 765/2008 and (EU) No 30 5/2011 (Text with EEA relevance ).

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  68  g) Sectoral safety legislation and AI Act   The interplay with existing sectoral safety legislation is ensured by integrating in the conformity  assessment procedures the checking of the AI requirements (new legislative framework) and by  considering the requirements of the AI Act in the adoption of relevant implementing or delegated  legislation under the old approach l egislation. (i.e., Art. 82 in relation to Regulation 2019/2144 on motor  vehicles or the incorporation of the conformity assessment and the provider’s procedural obligation  into the Directive 2013/36 for credit institutions).   5.4. Other gaps  or potential impleme ntation issues   We list below gaps or potential implementation issues, extracted from chapter 2 and chapter 3:   • Gap in the Open Data Directive . Article 1.2 of the Open Data Directive excludes, from its scope  of application, documents for which third parties hold intellectual property rights, documents  excluded from access on grounds of commercial confidentiality, statistical confidentiality, and documents whose access is excluded or restricted on grounds of personal data protection. The  adoption of the proposed Data Governance Act might  then fill this regulatory gap that the  material scope of the Open Data Directive had left unaddressed. Furthermore, there is a gap  concerning B2B and B2G data sharing  that might be filled in the proposed Data Act to ensure  fairness in market transactions and in B2G contexts to facilitate the u se of data for public  interest.;   • Gap in the current version of th e Database Directive . In the current legislative scenario,  datasets can be protected as a trade secret if relevant protection conditions are met (Art. 2.1  Trade Secret Directive), by intellectual property rights if they are original (Art. 3 Database  Direct ive). The characteristics of the data economy and the need to foster data -driven  innovation require a re- evaluation of framework  defined by the Database Directive. Primarily,  the critical points are the following. First, the unclear status of machine -generated data and IoT  data under the sui generis database right. Second, the distinction between collecting and  systematizing tasks (traditional database making) and data creation activities (updating,  maint enance, publication, curation);   • P2B Regulation Gaps . The P2B Regulation may create a regulatory gap, in that  there is no  obligation to share data or provide access to, but a mere duty to disclose it in the terms and  conditions. So, there is no duty beyond that. It is naturally not a gap if it embodies a policy  decision. The P2B Regulation leaves services unregul ated and data aspects unaddressed. And  in the analysis of the interplay between the DSA and the P2B Regulation, this may represent  regulatory gaps for consideration. The P2B Regulation restricts its scope of application to  platforms (online intermediation services providers) that enable the initiation or the  completion of B2C transactions. But it should be considered whether there are sound reasons  not to extend the Regulation to platf orms enabling B2B transactions;   • Implementation need for DSA . The most cha llenging interplay between the DSA and the data  domain is in relation to solutions adopted to minimize the information asymmetry between  the market players (platforms and very large platforms) and the regulators and authorities as  the main addressees and b eneficiaries. Many obligations and requirements provided for by the  DSA are intended to ensure data accessibility for monitoring and compliance assessment  purposes. There are also other addressees of data such as auditors (Art. 28) or vetted  researchers (A rt. 31). This scheme the DSA is built on is highly dependent upon a solid, well defined, and fluent infrastructure to facilitate data access with such purposes. The need to  specify the data to be provided to comply with the different obligations (risk assessment, 
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       69  PE 703.345  audits, transparency reports, etc) should not be technically deemed as a regulatory gap, but it  may be highli ghted as an implementation need;   • The DMA potential gaps . Portability of data is a clear intersection between GDPR for personal  data, Free F low Regulation for non -personal data and the DMA. In assessing whether the  adoption of the DMA fill or open regulatory gaps  in this domain , the following considerations  must be made. First, it has been argued that the scope of application defined by an exhaustive  list (despite the review mechanism of Art. 17) in Article 22 might neither be complete nor future   proof. The DMA applies to ‘core platform services’ defined as any of the following digital  services: online intermediation services, online search eng ines, online social networking  services, video -sharing platform services, number- independent interpersonal communication  services, operating services, cloud computing services, advertising services. Only these services  qualify. It is not a gap to fill if that represent an explicit choice. Second, the specification and the implementation of the obligations under Article 5 and, especially, under Article 6 will  require further efforts to provide guidance and standards for compliance. That is not  necessarily a regulatory gap, but it places the focus on the implementation stage.

Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld  73   PE 703.345   F INAL CONSIDERATIONS AND RECOM MENDATIONS   In this c onclusive  chapt er we f irst m ake a f ew final e xtra -legal c onsiderations a nd a ppraisal, which a re  followed b y six high-level and s elective  recommendations.  The first general consideration is that re gulation of the digital domain in Europe should strike a balance  between protecting fundamental rights, promoting innovation, being ambitious but at the sam e time  cohere nt without adding unnecessary layers of complexity. It seems, howe ver, that in the building of  digital constitutionalism and in the search for the ‘Brussels effect’44, coherence and simplicity have been  at least partially overlooked. Consider t hat if all the proposed acts are approved, one single company  could be “controller” or “processor” under the GDPR, “data holder” under the DGA and “developer”  under AI re gulation. Obviously, a company may have different role s depending on the data processing  done, but consistency and coherence in the terminology and in the application of the provisions should  be sought. This and other aspects of the AI Act and Data Governance Act may create legal uncertainties.  Making good law s can also creatively introduce new rules, as long as they are  clear and inte lligible,  non- contradictory, stable, and possible to obey (Fuller, 1969, p. 39).   Second, the tendency of the AI Act to replicate the GDPR model could be a limitation because pers onal  data protection and AI Regulation are fundamentally diffe rent (Papakonstantinou & De Hert, 2021a,  2021b). This is not a critique to the GDPR as such, but rather to the extent to which the AI Act attempts  to mimic it. The GDPR  is about a fundamental hu man right with respect to a single and well -identified  activity: data processing. AI regulation is broader : it aims at both protecting individuals and boosting  AI de velopment and does not refer to specific activities, which poses the overambitious and unrealistic  task of catalogu ing AI in its entirety, given how problematic is just defining AI for legislative purposes  (see Text Box 3, p. 44). Bringing all of AI unde r the supe rvision of one single autho rity may prove  a  daunting task even only because of the large volume of work needed to catalogue and monitor  all possible AI uses. Furthermore, it has been noted that the AI Act has several shortcomings such as:  a) enforcement regime and the  risks of maximu m harmo nisation may pre-e mpt legitimate national AI  policy45; b) it combines elements from product safety regulation, fu ndamental rights protection,  surveillance and consu mer prote ction law that not necessarily fits consistently together; c)  the  transparency provisions either add little to  existing law or raise more questions than answers when  their implications are considered (Veale & Zuiderveen Borgesius, 2021).  Third, as noted the AI Act ‘could d o much more to protect consumers’ rights and be much more incisive  about providing measures to redress the possib le harms or losses that AI systems m ay cause. This is the part  where one may expect and welcome more improvements in the proposal. It was one of the main  recommendations made by the AI4People project: ‘ 7. Develop  a redress process or mechanism to remedy or  compensate for a wrong  or grievance  caused by AI ’ (Floridi, 2021, p. 218) . In reality, there are already  several redress rule s established at the EU level that could be leveraged also by the AI Act46.  44 The expression ‘Brussels effect’ derive from Bradford’s book The Brussels Effect. How the European Union Rules the World   (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2020). The expression , which became very popular and by now is an idiom in policy circles,   refers to  the process of unilateral regulatory globalisation achieved  by the European Union de facto (but not  necessarily de  jure) externalising its laws outside its borders through market mechanisms .  45 While this is true for any EU legislation, for AI policy the risk of pre- empting national legislation is even greater, as the  technological advancements may reque st a rapid national intervention before the EU legislation is ad opted.     46 See for instance “Commission welcomes confirmation of provisional agreement to strengthen collective redress in the EU”  (30, June 2020:  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/statement_20_1227 ). 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies   PE 703.345  74 Fourth, there are some areas of ambiguity in the interplay between the AI Act and the cyber- security  legislation, in particular with the  NIS2 directives both in terms of scope and of obligations for micro and  small entities. The NIS2 Directive  defines  its scope o f application  based on sectors, subsectors, and  types of entities. The AI Act focusses on the use or purpose for which the AI system is meant. So, the AI  Act provide s for obligations to ‘operators’, whereas the NIS2 provisions apply to the public and private  entities falling under the sector- based scope of application. As both positions m ay or may not coincide,  the provisions may concurrently or alternatively apply to the market participants depending upon their  status (listed entity, provider, importer, user, distributor, etc.) . Micro and small entitie s would be  exempted from the obligati ons provided for the  NIS2 Directive, except for those meeting the criteria  laid down in Art. 2(2) NIS2 Directive, whereas they are neither excluded from the  AI Act’s scope , nor  overall exempted from their obligations .  Fifth, w hen considering the legislative effort to promote B2B and B2G data sharing, it is worth recalling  that such activities are not simply a matter of regulatory frameworks, but also depend on non regu lato ry governance elements such as incentives, business models, cu lture and the need to  practice and gradually build trust (see T ext Box 2,  p.35).  Sixth , a c onsideration about digital legislation and the international dimension of digital diplomacy  and partnerships should also be made. As AIDA Chair Dragoș Tudorache stated: “As we prepare, at the  European level, multiple and complementary pieces of le gislation  setting the rules of the digital world,  we need to also start promoting our views, values, and rules around the  world. For the EU to become a  global geopolitical actor, we need to adapt our foreign policy and e xternal action to the digital future,  and a k ey component of this is strengthening the digital transatlantic partnership. The EU and the  US  are both founded on the values of freedom, human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. These values  need to serve as cornerstones for the global digital future.”  (AIDA, 2021c, p. 3). Some of the hard  regulation reviewed so far is not received immediately and intuitively well in the US and should  be  accompanied  more  by digital diplomacy. There is already some dialogue, as the European Union  regularly  coordinates  with  the US through the T TC talks47, and Transatlantic Legislators' Dialogue  (TLD)48 works to enhance exchanges between legislators working in the European Parliament and the  US Congress . Howe ver, the European digital diplomacy should improve, given that EU  is likely to be  the first to legislate in the digital domain on the global scene . Moreover, it has been noted that: “ the  EU nee ds to forge strong alliances worldwide with likeminded partners and overcome re gulatory  divergences re volving around privacy rights, data flows and taxation. Soft governance mechanisms  may be more amenable to securing international consensus on AI governance than hard law  approaches” (AIDA, 2021b, p. 3). In this respect, it is worth recalling the risk that the proposed Digital  Gover nance Act may hamper transatlantic cooperation and data transfers in the same way as it  happened with the Privacy shields, causing losses to Eu ropean firms involved in such activities (see  Text Box 1 p. 32). In fact, while the DGA proposal intends to regulate inte rnational transfe rs of  protected data held the public sector, in practice it may howe ver render such transfers impossible. In  that respect, adequacy systems have significant drawbacks, such as the le ngth of the process to assess  the legal and judicial syste ms of a cou ntry and the influence of political factors.  47  See the EU -US Trade and Technology Council Inaugural Joint Statement of 29 September 2021 available at:  https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/STATEMENT_21_4951   48  See the European Parliament’s transatlantic antiparliamentary relationship, where Members of Pa rliament's D -US Delegation meet  their  counterparts in the US House of Representatives to discuss matters of common interest , available at:  https://www.europarl.europa.eu/tld/en/about/overview
Identification and assessment of existing and draft EU legislation in the digital fie ld       75  PE 703.345  These drawbacks may translate into a very limited implementation of the system that would  significantly affect international data transfers.   In sum, the coherence of the regulatory system is vital to create an environment conducive to  innovation, entrepreneurship, and consumer protection. Lack of coherence or excessively complex  legal acts whose application and interpretation by market actors entail high costs is counterproductive. Negative externalities and unwanted effects on market access result fro m incoherent, inharmonious  legal system. Lack of legal coherence and consistency increase complexity , which in turns is a source  of barriers to market entry . These barriers  are particularly dissuasive for micro -and SMEs due to the lack  of capabilities to e valuate complex regulations, count on sophisticated legal advice, and re -adapt their  business models to uncertain rules. Legal uncertainty related to overly complex regulations discourages innovation insofar as the cost of defining the game rules is too high for start- ups. Lack of  coherence dramatically increases the cost of compliance: cost of determining which legal act is applicable and to which extent; cost of interpreting the legal provisions; cost of duplicating the  compliance of requirements where the applicability is dubious to mitigate the risks of sanctions; cost  of monitoring regulatory changes; cost of complying with new rules and adapting previous business models (alt hough in many cases this cost is alleviated with transition periods in the legal acts and no retroactivity clauses) . In fragmented legal systems with a plurality of national rules potentially  applicable, gaining scale is prevented. The combination of Regul ations and Directives reviewed in this  report may lead to a partially fragmented regulatory system.  In a complex regulatory system, the legislator is in a better position to clarify the interactions between the different legal act s with clear  cross- references, and undoubted referral to other legal provisions. Thus, the legislator helps private  actors in the process of interpreting, applying, and complying with laws in force. The legislator has to  be extremely careful in: ensuring total consistency in inter- legislation terminology and definitions;  clarifying  interactions among legal acts in recitals; provid ing specific cross -references where applicable;  and provid ing guidance to operators/companies on the compliance of legal requirements.   Moving to high -level recommendations, our analysis of the selected relevant legal acts has revealed   that the regulatory landscape is becoming highly complex. Operators in the market need to conduct a  notably cost -intensive, legal -advice -dependent assessment to determine the rules applicable to the  relevant activity, system, use or purpose. The interplay between the different legal acts on AI,  cybersecurity, digital services and markets, and data governance is multi -fold, variegated, and in many  cases dubiou s and confusing. Several regulatory gaps have been identified, as well as unintended  interferences, overlaps or contradictions among legal instruments in different level of adoption. Based  on our analysis , we propose here below six high- level recommendatio ns:  (1) The summary table identified seven interplay gaps between the AI Act, GDPR, and ePrivacy that  need to be addressed. In particular, the interplay between data protection and privacy regimes   should be better clarified, since a  general referral to the app lication of the data protection and  privacy provisions is not sufficiently clear. For instance: a) relying on the general application of the  GDPR and the future ePrivacy regulation framework to prevent violations of data protection and  privacy, as a result  of the use of AI system or as a consequence of the malfunctioning of the AI  system, might not be sufficiently effective; b) in many AI systems, the data controllers, subject to  the relevant obligations under the GDPR, are not the providers but the users u nder the AI Act. The  applicable obligations differ for users under the AI Act ;  (2) Clarify the compatibility of the AI Act requirements for high- risk AI systems and the requirements  provided for by the c ybersecurity legislation, and especially the status of mi cro and small entities  
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies       PE 703.345  76  to avoid uncertainty on compliance  requirements and possible duplication of certification and  conformance costs ;  (3) The AI Act currently lacks clear and well - defined mechanisms for remedies and redress to protect  the rights of individu als affected by AI systems. It should add reference to collective redress  mechanism already existing at EU level and specify how they w ould apply in the context of AI;   (4) Clarify better the liability arising from the infringement of the AI Act provisions. The compliance of  certain obligations laid down by the AI Act may trigger (rebuttable) presumptions for the purposes  of attributing liability and allocating the burden of proof. It is not clear whether the high- risk  category under the AI Act  may impact the li ability rules;   (5) Revise and clarify product liability and liability rules applicable  to damages caused by AI system;   (6) Coherence is needed between the AI Act and the Digital Service Act , with their respective scope  of application (AI systems, algorithmic conte nt moderation, partially automated complaint handling, etc.).
