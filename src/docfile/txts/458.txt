Strategy for the Development of Artificial Intelligence in the Republic of Serbia for the Period 2020-2025


With the Fourth Industrial, i.e. the Digital Revolution, we have a chance to make up for lagging behind and catch up with more developed countries ...
The digitisation process will enhance the standard and quality of life for hundreds of thousands of Serbian citizens. Efficiency will be increased, costs will be reduced and new value will be created in almost all areas of life and work. The digitisation process is the most important catalyst of innovations, competitiveness and growth.
