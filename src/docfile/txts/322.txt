4  Engagement Letter       66, rue de Bellechasse   75007 PARIS   Tél. 01 42 75 66 42     March 22nd 2018       Fo r the attention of Claude Kirchner and David Gruson       Dear colleagues,      Digital sciences, technologies, uses, and innovatio ns are profoundly  altering our society as a whole and in particular a ll of the life sciences,  research, and medical practices from birth to the e nd of life. The report on  Artificial Intelligence directed by Cédric Villani describes the consequences of  this development for all aspects of our society. Mo re generally, Artificial  Intelligence obliges us to (re)-examine the relatio ns between human beings  and machines in society.      Recent advances have highlighted, in particular, th e important role of  machine learning techniques based on the availabili ty of datasets of all kinds.      In order to help CCNE to address all the big questi ons raised by  Artificial Intelligence in the life sciences and in  healthcare — more specifically  the multiple interactions between digital technolog y and health, — the ethical  challenges they pose, as well as the potential cons equences for their  incorporation into legislative measures, I am askin g you to lead a taskforce  that will be open to contributors (CERNA, academics  and professionals,  relevant ministerial actors…) other than the member s of CCNE (particularly  members of the working group dedicated to big data) . The aim of this  taskforce is to provide a rapid briefing for the CC NE for the life sciences and  health as part of the National Consultation on bioe thics.   To this end, I would like to receive your first con clusions at the end of May (to  be presented at the CCNE meeting of May 31), so tha t they can be debated in  the plenary committee meeting on June 14, 2018.      
5 Drawing on documentary and bibliographic research, and on a series of  specialized hearings, the taskforce will produce a report on the current forms  of interaction between digital technology and healt hcare, also mentioning  directions for research on this subject, will provi de insight into the strengths  and weaknesses of the current positions, and will p resent the potential  conflicts of values it identifies, before identifyi ng the underlying ethical issues.  The taskforce will seek to propose ideas for substa ntive regulation on the  spread of digital technology in healthcare in both the legal and operational  domains, and more specifically on the spread of rob otization and artificial  intelligence.      The primary objective of this taskforce is to ident ify some of the  questions and challenges associated with these deve lopments. For this  reason, its ideas will contribute to the position p aper that CCNE will submit for  the National Consultation on bioethics, but also — more globally — to the  necessary investigation into a “governance of digit al ethics” called for in the  recommendations formulated by Cédric Villani’s work ing group.     In full awareness of the importance of these delibe rations, and in the  confidence, Dear colleagues, that I can count on yo ur expertise and  commitment, I wish you all the best in this endeavo r.

Jean -François Delfraissy    President, Comité Consultatif    National d’Ethique             Comité Consultatif National d’Éthique pour les scie nces de la vie et de la  santé    66, rue de Bellechasse - 75700 Paris   Tél. : 01 42 75 66 42 www.ccne-ethique.fr          
6  A. Summary of the  joint conclusi ons of  the taskforce        In this summary, we present the joint conclusions o f the taskforce, which  readers will also find in the body of the report.   The very rapid spread of digital technology in healthcare   • The rapid pace at which digital technology is s preading through our  healthcare system is a major and irreversible reali ty, which needs to  become an even greater priority in the future response to public  health challenges.  The information we have shows how digital  technology can be a source of major adv ances in the quality and  efficiency of our healthcare system . The benefits it can bring in the areas  of teaching and research are also considerable. All this potential is only  just beginning to be marshalled . The likely scale of the spread of these  technologies calls for a parallel commitment to continuing analysis of  the ethical challenges  associated with them and with their future  developments .      • The organization and governance of the entire healt hcare system,  from research to clinical practice, from ind ividuals to health  professionals, from the independent practitioner to  the biggest health  institutions, will be profoundly affected  by digital technology, with  consequences at the national, European, and interna tional levels that are  multiple but at present hard to predict. This transformation is a source of  opportunity, but its implementation entails tension s  that analysis of the  ethical issues can help to identify. Digital techno logy is transforming our  healthcare system by enhancing the quality of patie nt care and  organizational efficiency. It is also helping to br eak down traditional divides  and to facilitate the emergence of a “learning heal thcare system” that is  favorable to medical, technical, or managerial inno vations. Already, and to  a greater extent in the future, profound changes are underway in the  practices, roles, functions, and responsibilities o f people working in  the healthcare system . This will have multiple consequences for the  training of everyone concerned. Finally, infrastruc tures from the individual  to the global level will change profoundly .  
7 Major ethical issues      • The insufficient use of digital technology in patie nt care, in research, or to  support the development of data-based management, are a source of  situations of substantial une thical practice within our healthcare  system . Resolving these problems is a priority and entail s the use of public  policy instruments that lie outside the primary nor mative provisions of the  forthcoming French Bioethics Act.   • An ethical middle way needs to  be found between the imperatives of  protecting health data and the need for the sharing  of health data in  order to enhance the quality and efficiency of our healthcare system.   The President of the Republic’s announcement of a p lan for a “national  hub” for health data represents an interesting move  in this direction,  provided that the principles governing data acquisi tion and security, and  the operation of the instrument, are clearly define d.   • The uptake of digital technology in healthcare can have potentia lly  significant effects on health inequalities, both re ducing and, in certain  cases, exacerbating them.  It is therefore indispensable to monitor the  implementation of digital technology in healthcare in order to ensure that  its adoption contributes to reducing these inequali ties.   • Two major ethical challenges associated with the sp read of algorithmic  medicine have been identified and require regulatio n:   - The risk of depriving patients  — in practice by the “delegation of  consent” — of a significant  part of t heir  capacity  to  participate in  the construction of their  healthcare pathways  as a result of the  role of algorithms in decision-making;   - The danger of a  loss of responsiveness to personal situations   as a consequence of the reliance on reasoning based  on models  that may be limited in their capacity to take indiv idual patient  characteristics and preferences into account.   • Digital technology, as a means of avoiding the trad itional channels  of  access to information and care or of sharing evalua tions of practitioner  performance, constitutes a  source of freedom and transparency for  citizens, but also of destabilization  for our healthcare system  and   health professionals . These phenomena need to be carefully monitored,  in particular to maintain the imperative of healthc are quality and safety  that citizens have a right to expect.   • The sharing of research data according to ‘FAIR’  (findable, accessible,  interoperable, reusable ) principles is a crucial factor for the  development of world -class scientific research in heal thcare and in  helping to guarantee the reproducibility and validi ty of results. Moreover, in 
8  the field of health research, access to data from h ealthcare itself, from  healthcare systems, or from other personal database s, represents a major  advance by avoiding the duplication of data collect ion, which can  significantly increase the cost of intervention res earch (clinical trials,  intervention trials) or observation research (cross -sectional studies,  cohorts). It would therefore be good practice, as f ar as possible, to have a  consent procedure that enables people to authorize the sharing of their  data in the knowledge of how they will be shared (s haring plan), rather  than why (by whom and for what research). It is also important to acquire  the scientific, techn ical, and regulatory resources to control the risks   of people being re -identified from databases in which direct identifyi ng  information has been removed  and to support the development of  ethical tools for the regulation of access to sensi tive data.    What instruments of regulation?      • The exercise of maximum restraint in the use of leg islative and  regulatory instruments to regulate the uptake of di gital technology in  the healthcare system  should be considered a key priority.  This  recommendation should be considered in the light of  the forthcoming  revision of the Bioethics Act and in the current le gislative and regulatory  context, including in particular the transposition of the GDPR (European  General Data Protection Regulation) into French law .   • The Comité Co nsultatif National d’Éthique pour les sciences de l a vie  et de la santé  (CCNE — National Ethical Consultative Committee for  life  sciences and health) should evolve into a Comité National d’Éthique   (National Ethics Committee), a body with the capaci ty to work on ethical  issues relating not just to life sciences and healt h, but also to digital  sciences, technologies, practices and innovation. I f necessary, it could be  able to address the ethical problems associated wit h other scientific  disciplines.   A corollary of this  development would be that the terms of reference of  CCNE would be broadened in the next  Bioethics Act .1   • The ethical issues of digital technology in healthc are are dealt very  differently at European or international level, but  there is a consensus on  the need to take practical measures, which will be as responsive to change  as possible, to ensure the reliability of digital applications and control  of their use .                                                     1 It should be noted that CCNE did not adopt this re commendation as such in its position paper  129, September 2018  
9 • The response to the ethical challenges associated w ith the spread of  digital technol ogy in healthcare will be enhanced by  adopting an  international  — and initially European  — perspective . Nonetheless, there  is still an essential role for the national level, since the implementation of a  flexible normative system of regulation at European  level will require a  strong initiative on the part of governments to sup port the joint  construction of regulatory tools appropriate to nat ional needs.   • With respect to the next  Bioethics Act , it is desirable that the  fundamental principle of a Human Warran ty  of digital technology in  healthcare should be entrenched in law.    With regard to the equally fundamental principle of  obtaining patient  consent (for the collection of health data and for the care process itself),  the substantive right — in all its stringency — rem ains appropriate.  Nonetheless, this substantive legislative right would  gain from  additional new or updated practical tools to guaran tee that such  consent is actually obtained  (sequential consent arrangements, revival of  the trusted person concept, stronger procedures for  vulnerable  individuals…).   The creation of a secure national hub for the colle ction and processing  of health data  represents a useful method of connecting together the  different ethical issues relating to health data.  The decision on how  data would be fed to this hub would fall within the  legislative arena if a  political intention was expressed for the creation of a mechanism of  presumed consent in the case of a public health int erest, of the kind that  exists for organ donation.   • The establishment of a general framework of compens ation for injury  that may be caused by digital objects does not seem  to be an  immediate priority in the revision of the 2018 Bioe thics Act. This issue  is worth examining in depth in a context where dama ge and injury, as  things stand, remain relatively well covered by lia bility arrangements  relating to damage or injury caused by things which  are in one’s custody  and caused by defective products. Given the potential scale of the issue   in coming years,  it wou ld be desirable if a framework specifically  designed to cover injury caused by digital objects were developed at  least at European level .   • There needs to be a strong initiative within the next few months to  trigger a dynamic for the practical creation of s oft law type  instruments of substantive regulation applicable to  the spread of  digital technology within our healthcare system .   • The effects that the adoption of a digital system will have on the  conditions of professional practice in the health a nd medico -social 
10   sectors need to be anticipated with supportive meas ures. Public and  private actors should be further encouraged to adap t the training — both  initial training and continuing professional develo pment — of healthcare  workforce to the challenges of digital technology a nd to support the  emergence of new professions associated with the sp read of digital  technology in the health and medico-social sectors.  The very large  mismatch that currently exists between our system of initial training  and continuing pr ofessional development and the challenges associated  with the spread of digital technology is a serious problem for our  healthcare system. Initiatives  — such as those of the Conférence des  Doyens de Faculté de médecine  and of UNESS — are in preparation to  remedy this situation and should be encouraged .        
11 B. Background to this report        The taskforce on digital technology in healthcare w as set up in  response to the engagement letter reproduced in the  appendices to this  report. Its objective was to provide additional bri efing on a specific theme in  order to support the Comité Consultatif National d’Éthique pour les scie nces  de la vie et de la santé  (CCNE - National Ethical Consultative Committee fo r life  sciences and health) in drafting its position paper  following the National  Consultation on bioethics in 2018 and, more broadly , to guide its future  deliberations on these issues. “ The primary objective of this taskforce is to  identify some of the issues and priorities . For this reason, its ideas will feed  into the position paper that the CCNE will submit f or the National Consultation  on bioethics, but also — more globally — will contr ibute to the necessary  investigation into a “governance of digital ethics”  called for in the  recommendations formulated by Cédric Villani’s 2 working group.”       This assignment was the basis of the composition of  the taskforce and  the different qualified individuals interviewed in order to marshal materials  previously considered by CCNE, in particular:   The National Ethical Cons ultative Committee   The Comité consultatif national d’éthique (CCNE) is  an independent French  institution, created in 1983, whose mission stipula ted by law is "to formulate  opinions on ethical and social issues arising out o f advances in biology,  medicine, and health.” Since 2011, the CCNE’s remit  has been to organize  and stimulate public debate in the run-up to the re vision of the bioethics law.     Currently chaired over by Professor Jean-François D elfraissy, the CCNE has 39  members from various disciplines that raise bioethi cal questions: medicine,  philosophy, research, law, religion… It has produce d nearly 130 opinions and  reports since its creation, by a process of self or  direct referral.                                                        2 Cédric Villani is a mathematician (Field medal in 2012) and member of the French  Parliament. He has been commissioned by the governm ent to produce a report on artificial  intelligence (March 2018)

The work was pursued in consultation with the “ Big Data ” working  group otherwise established through the normal CCNE  procedure.   The French bioethics law     A strong attachment to ethical questions and to dem ocratic involvement in  health policy has underpinned France’s pioneering r ole in bioethics legislation.  A specific so-called “bioethics” law has defined a set of legal rules governing  medical and/or research practices relating to the h uman body and human  embryos. The first law was approved in 1988 and is revised regularly.     The last revision of the bioethics law dates from 7  July 2011 and a new  revision is scheduled for 2019. The law asserts, am ong other things, “any  planned reform concerning ethical and social issues  arising out of advances in  biology, medicine, and health must be preceded by p ublic debate in the form  of consultations, organized on the initiative of th e Comité consultatif national  d’éthique.”                                                     3 “Doctors and patients in the world of data, algori thms and artificial intelligence”, Conseil  national de l’Ordre des médecins (CNOM), January 2018.

13   The National Consultation on Bioethics, “les Etats généraux de la Bioéthique”,  was held in the first half of 2018 and all studies,  arguments, and opinions  were included in a synthesis report 7 published in June 2018.    The CCNE also formed an opinion 8 on all subjects that were debated, based on  all the views voiced during consultations and on th e principal conclusions of  its previous studies.     The taskforce, whose final short form report was ex pected at the end of  June 2018, drew on an already extensive body of res earch materials, studies  and reports. Among them, several documents were see n as of specific interest  in terms of the terms of reference of the engagemen t letter:   - The report by the Office parlementaire d’évaluation des choix  scientifiques et technologiques (OPECST — Parliamentary office for  the evaluation of scientific and technological choi ces);9   - The report published by the French Member of Parlia ment Cédric  Villani on artificial intelligence;10    - The CERNA reports Éthique de la recherche en robotique , Éthique  de la recherche en apprentissage machine , and La souveraineté à  l’ère du numérique; 11   - The report of the Académie des Technologies (Technologies  Academy);12   - The report Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the  UK  by  Wendy Hall and Jérôme Pesenti,13  whose recommendations are  reproduced in the appendices;                                                     7 A summary in English of the synthesis report is av ailable at: http://www.ccneethique.fr/sites/default/files/synthese_anglaise_v1 909.pdf   8 Opinion 129 is available at: https://www.ccne-ethique.fr/en/publications/contrib utioncomite-consultatif-national-dethique-revision-bioet hics-law    9 C.

The taskforce was also involved in a number of hear ings held by CCNE as part  of the National Consultation on Bioethics, which fo r the first time included  topics relating to digital technology in healthcare . At this stage, it would be  useful to recall the aspects of the subject that ar e usually seen as the most  technical and difficult for our fellow citizens to understand, and are therefore  least often tackled.      Main lessons from the National Consultation On Bioethics concerning  “Health Data” and “Artificial Int elligence and Robotics”  15      As the Comité consultatif national d’éthique noted in its short form report, the  2018 National Consultation on Bioethics highlighted  certain key points  relating to the recent spread of digital technology  in healthcare, which reflect  the opinions and concerns expressed by the particip ants. The human priority  at the heart of the healthcare system was frequentl y stressed in the course of  the consultation and strong emphasis was placed on the risk of dehumanizing  the relationship between patient and caregiver. Fea rs were expressed  concerning the fraudulent or abusive use of health data, as well as about  inequalities (territorial, intergenerational) in ac cess to healthcare in the digital  age.      In addition, the public consultation showed that th e subject of digital  technology is not ancillary to bioethical deliberat ion, but an integral part of it:  “implicitly revealed… [was] what might be described  as a “transformation of  the core of the bioethical debate” (…) [i.e.] a new  objective view of the human  body in which the genome and health data, for examp le, become integrated                                                    14  CNIL (2017).

15 into the traditional characteristics of the body an d further complicate the  bioethical question”  notes the Committee in its su mmary.      Health data       1.  Generally speaking, the lack of information cited b y many in the  debates or hearings with regard to technical data ( anonymization,  pseudonymization, data security methods) or legal t exts may explain why the  participants did not tackle certain questions speci fic to this topic, including  the sharing of data for research.   2.  The participants above all shared their perceptions , firstly, of what big  data represents in the context of healthcare and, s econdly, of the impact that  they expected the use of these data to have on thei r lives.     Three recurrent points thus emerged from the consul tation:     (i)  The first point, universally shared, was a demand f or explanation and  information regarding digital systems, and therefor e about the use of the data  collected. This demand, which the participants cons idered to be inadequately  met at present, creates a certain sense of powerles sness and lack of control  over the use of one’s own data.   (ii)  The second point was a marked fear that the progres s of these digital  instruments (which people find easier to picture th an data, which are more  virtual) might lead to a loss of the human relation ship between patient and  doctor, and ultimately to medical decisions being d ictated by computers rather  than explained and shared between the patient and t he physician. Moreover,  there was a concern that telemedicine and connected  objects might be the  only solutions available to mitigate the inadequaci es of the healthcare system  and, in particular, the growing shortage of doctors .   (iii)  The third point was a widespread mistrust concernin g the use of data  and the risk of those data being diverted to malici ous, coercive, or commercial  ends, in particular in the case of vulnerable indiv iduals, by insurance  companies or medical platforms, or even by the nati onal Health Insurance  system itself.     3. In response to these concerns, beyond the primar y imperative for citizens to  be kept informed, two other main imperatives were e xpressed: (i) that each  person’s freedom of choice should be genuinely guar anteed, in particular  through an overhaul of the consent system, (ii) tha t data systems should not  replace human decision-makers in healthcare, and th at safeguards should be 
16   put in place to protect privacy. These demands were  not translated into  specific proposals for legislative change, but into  general safeguarding  principles with respect to confidentiality, data an onymization, medical  confidentiality, a prohibition on the selling of da ta, and secure data hosting.  The institution of trusted third parties to explain  the purpose of the data and  ensure traceability, or else the introduction of la bels for telemedicine systems,  are potential options. The public institutions are strongly encouraged to  develop these monitoring measures.      Artificial intelligence and robotics       1. In the health sphere, applications of new techno logies offer great  promise, and in some cases are already being implem ented. Putting brakes  on their development, as has sometimes been propose d, could itself be  considered unethical.    2.  Nonetheless, these applications raise issues, even concerns, which  lawmakers and system designers need to take serious ly. Excessive reliance on  these systems carries the risk of dehumanizing medi cine. The relationship  between the caregiver and the patient remains funda mental. Human beings  “must stay in control”, must remain the final decis ion-makers.      3.  Following the consultation, a few themes could be i dentified as  summarizing the fundamental ethical questions: (i) Given the complexity of the  systems, how do we ensure that the patient gives in formed consent for their  use? (ii) Who is responsible if the machine makes a  mistake or malfunctions?  The chain of liabilities (designer, user?) therefor e needs to be defined. (iii) The  management of the huge volumes of data collected by  these systems is a  concern. What happens to them and what are the impl ications of this for  medical confidentiality?      4.  While these systems could offer solutions for geogr aphic zones that are  devoid of medical services, they would not be “the”  solution and should not  become a pretext for the elimination of positions o r jobs in the caring  professions. Instead, these services should be avai lable everywhere and to  everyone, and should not create new social or terri torial inequalities. In this  respect, it is important to take note of the risk o f potential biases that could  become built into algorithms in the machine learnin g process.      5.  Education and information are crucial. The training  of doctors and  healthcare personnel needs to be based on an analys is of their specific roles 
17 and their particular responsibility with respect to  the use of these instruments;  for their part, the designers who work on them need  to be educated about the  consequences of their choices. CNIL made three reco mmendations on this  subject in its contribution: (i) all the links in t he algorithmic chain (designers,  professionals, citizens) should receive training in  ethics; (ii) algorithmic  systems should be made understandable by reinforcin g the existing rights set  out in France’s Data Protection Act, and by organiz ing mediation with users;  (iii) AI algorithmic systems should be designed and  built to serve human  freedom, in particular in their human/machine inter faces.       The taskforce also conducted some 30 additional, mo re targeted  hearings on the question of digital technology in h ealthcare (see appendix 10).  These hearings were held on the basis of proposals by the task force or at the  request of certain actors.   This report is divided into three parts:    1.  A progress report on the uptake of digital technolo gy in the healthcare  system;   2.  A description of ethical issues associated with thi s uptake;   3.  The formulation of a series of recommendations for the regulation of  these existing or potential ethical conflicts.   It culminates with a series of appendices that prov ide more insight into  the topics raised as necessary.   This report contributed to CCNE’s collective delibe rations about the  ethical challenges of digital technology in health.  While most of the main  recommendations formulated were incorporated into C CNE’s position paper  129, this paper in fact adopted a different formula tion with regard to the  recommendations on the future missions and scope of  CCNE itself. Indeed,  they call for consultation and reflection that is b oth larger in scope and longer  in duration (http://www.ccne-ethique.fr/fr/actualit es/lavis-129-contributiondu-ccne-larevision-de-la-loi-de-bioethique-est-en-l igne).   The publication of this report in November 2018 wil l allow everyone,  citizens, healthcare system users, patients, health  professionals, companies,  and politicians, to draw on its analyses and propos als to instigate or pursue  their own reflections.     
18   C. The very rapid spread of digital  technology in Health care        "Information is information, not matter or energy. N o materialism  which does not admit this can survive at the presen t day ." N.Wiener  (1948). Cybernetics: or control and communication i n the animal and  the machine. 2 nd  revised version in 1961. The MIT Press, Cambridge,   MA, 231 p.      The digital revolution is profoundly transforming o ur societies on a  worldwide scale. This impact is also apparent in th e healthcare sector, which  is now completely permeated with digital sciences, technologies, practices,  and innovations. These technological inputs are oft en seen, experienced, or  suffered as unnecessary but often unavoidable impos itions, a reflection of the  general digitization of our societies.   While this is true, the fundamental role of digital  science and  technology for the processing of information makes it a critical component in  the handling of information in the fields of health  and biology, a reality that is  often poorly understood. Information as an elementa ry entity is fundamental  to being human: we are information processing syste ms, though of course that  is not all we are. From the level of DNA, through o ur cells, our organs, our  bodies, our social structures, we store, communicat e, and process  information. Reading this text, the functioning of an organ, using reason to  understand a situation, these are all forms of info rmation processing, in many  cases highly complex.   Digital processes are therefore fundamentally and i ncreasingly a reality  at the very heart of the whole healthcare system. T heir spread is driving major  upheavals in patient care, in research, in the orga nization of health services,  and in the evolution of professions in the health a nd medico-social fields.   These major transformations are, to a large extent,  already underway  within our healthcare system. Nonetheless, they are  far from always visible in  all their dimensions to professionals who, working on the frontline, are  frequently propelled by concerns that are more pres sing and immediate.       
19 1) Digital technology, artificial intelligence , and robot ics      What are we talking about? We will begin by recalli ng the fundamental  definitions of these three concepts, which are ofte n used as buzzwords,  fashionable notions rather than technical concepts.16    “To give a precise intentional definition of Artifi cial Intelligence is not  easy, and if we take a broad approach, it covers mu ch of information  technology. The ambiguity begins with the word “int elligence”. This term can  be understood by reference to human intelligence, m aking AI the science of  imitating human reasoning, or in a performative sen se, to mean taking good  decisions based on the effective understanding of a n environment.” This  quotation from the report Renouveau de l’Intelligence artificielle et de  l’Apprentissage Automatique [Renewal of artificial intelligence and machine  learning] from the ICT Committee of the Académie des Technologies moves  the term first introduced by John McCarthy in 1956 into the contemporary  context.   Today, the term Artificial Intelligence (AI) is oft en used in the generic  sense of “digital technology”. Originally, in 1956,  the aim of AI was to simulate  human cognitive faculties on computers and the term  encompassed scientific  approaches relating to computer science and mathema tics, at the leadingedge of cognitive sciences such as knowledge repres entation, machine  reasoning, problem-solving with constraints, optimi zation, automatic language  processing, machine vision, or machine learning. To day, the term AI tends to  be employed in reference to machine learning, or ev en more specifically deep  learning.   The first medical decision support systems were bas ed on making  expert knowledge explicit in the form of decision r ules. With machine learning,  the systems build up knowledge by different approac hes. With  supervised  learning , predictions are made — for example diagnoses of c linical situations  — on the basis of data previously labelled by exper ts. With unsupervised  learning , the system groups data into homogeneous classes. And finally, in the  case of reinforcement learning , the system learns by interacting with its  environment, which then provides reinforcement in t he form of positive or                                                    16  Readers wishing to enter into the subject in great er depth can, for example, consult the  book by Gérard Berry (G. Berry (2017). L’hyperpuiss ance de l’informatique : algorithmes,  données, machines, réseaux. Éditions Odile Jacob, 5 12 p.), based in particular on his classes  at the Collège de France, including his inaugural 2 008 lesson, « Pourquoi et comment le  monde devient numérique » [Why and how is the world  becoming digital].  
20   negative feedback. Learning systems are used, among  other things, in  predictive medicine and in genomic medicine.   The recent successes of learning methods (in partic ular  so-called  “deep  learning”) owe a great deal to the increase in the computing power and  storage capacity of machines, as well as to an expl osion in the volume of data  available and the ability to process them on a larg e scale. A feature of this  vastly increased performance is that it is currentl y difficult to explain the  results obtained by these methods. The possibility that algorithms may behave  unpredictably as a result of machine learning is al so problematic in our  current state of knowledge, especially as this coul d be exploited to malicious  ends.   AI techniques can be used in the design of robots, in particular for  environment recognition and interpretation, computa tion of the most relevant  tasks to perform, and the planning of those tasks. As most commonly  understood, a robot  is a computer-controlled machine that moves in phy sical  space.17  The robot acquires data using its sensors, and mak es an  interpretation or interpretations of those data, in  order to compute decisions  relating to its actions in physical space. A robot can also be a software agent  with no physical parts (also called a bot), which a cquires data and performs  tasks within the cyberspace. A robot can be program med to interact with a  user, either physically or via an interface. The ge neric term robotics refers to  the science of designing and studying robots.   The term “ digital technology ” as used here refers to the sciences (in  particular informatics and mathematics), technologi es, uses, and innovations  associated with the study, storage, processing, rec eption, or transmission of  information. Digital technology in healthcare thus refers to all the  computerized processes in the health field, whether  on not these processes  involve artificial intelligence or robotics.       2) Prospects  of major advances associated with digital   technology in health      The spread of technology in healthcare is currently  well underway in  France in an extremely active international context .. The year 2018 marked  the sixtieth anniversary of the “ordonnances Debré” , the ministerial orders  that set up France’s CHU (university hospitals), an d these institutions in                                                    17   J.-P.

21 particular are determinedly pursuing the potential for innovation that has  opened up in the fields of healthcare, teaching, an d research. This pursuit of  innovation is increasingly widespread within our he althcare system, going  beyond the traditional divides, notably between the  independent health  practioner and the hospital, prevention, treatment,  and medico-social support,  or between the public and private sectors.   So medical professionals in all sectors, whether wo rking in  independent practice, big health institutions, or m edico-social structures, are  directly involved in this movement towards technica l innovation and digital  democratization in the field of healthcare. More an d more institutions are  acquiring robots, for example in the context of str ategies to improve cognitive  functions.   With respect to the development of medicine itself,  the “human  component” in medical practice has been steadily di minishing in the last few  decades, with significant developments in medico-te chnical robotics  (especially in biology and pharmacy) and, more rece ntly, in software to assist  treatment prescription and decision-making. The use  of such software is even  covered by specific legal provisions, notably with the assignment of jurisdiction  to the Haute Autorité de Santé  (HAS — Central Health Authority). In the last 10  years or so, surgery itself has been on an accelera ting path towards  robotization.   As noted by the Conseil national de l’Ordre des médecins in its  previously cited report, “ the medicine of the future is already here”:  “the first  computerized diagnostic support algorithms have bee n approved, surgeons  manipulate robots, while their anesthetist colleagu es test the impact of virtual  reality on patient anxiety….”    With respect to patients or future patients, people  today are not the  same as they were yesterday. Digital technology is an integral part of their  lives, they have immediate access to information fr om numerous sources with  no hierarchy of priority. This raises the question of the individual’s ability to  analyze this information, in particular its relevan ce and validity. The huge  increase in access to information is altering the r elations between individuals  and healthcare professionals.   Cédric Villani’s report identifies health care  as a priority sector for  the development of artificial intelligence.  According to this report, “ artificial  intelligence in healthcare offers very hopeful pros pects for improvements in  the quality of patient care and reductions in its c ost — through more  personalized and predictive care practices — but al so for safety — thanks to  greater input into medical decision-making and bett er traceability . It can also 
22   help to improve citizens’ access to health, with pr e-diagnosis systems or  guidance through the treatment pathway.”   The potential benefits of digital technology in hea lthcare apply equally  to the areas of prevention, screening, care, suppor t, training, and research, as  well as to the governance or organization of health care systems.   These attainable advances in the quality of patient  care and in the  efficiency of the healthcare system have already be en demonstrated in  numerous studies.   As noted in the previously mentioned France Stratég ie  report, “almost  all areas of artificial intelligence — image and vi deo recognition, natural  language processing, machine learning, robotics, et c. — can have applications  in the health sphere. It is true for diagnosis and care recommendations, for  treatment, surgery, personalized monitoring, the me dico-social field, and for  rehabilitation, but also for prevention and clinica l research. With artificial  intelligence, it is possible to automate not only s imple tasks such as  measuring a patient’s weight or blood pressure, but  also complex tasks such  as medical diagnosis and therapeutic care. […]   There are numerous AI tools on the healthcare marke t and the range of  their current applications in medical diagnosis is substantial. They can be  found in medical specialties like oncology — coveri ng all the medical aspects  of cancer care, tests, diagnoses, and treatment — c ardiology, ophthalmology,  radiology, the detection of specific physical condi tions (diabetes, Alzheimer’s,  etc.) or mental health conditions (depression or ot her psychological  problems). Whatever the field, the principle is alw ays the same: algorithms fed  and driven by big data (medical image recognition, medical research results,  etc.) are programmed to detect pathologies using pr otocols predefined by the  medical community.”      3) Multiple examples in all areas of the life scien ces and  health care  illustrate  the progress that digital technology  brings      • Signal processing, machine learning , and health care : major advances  in digital image analysis, in sensor design, in pro cessing and transmission  speed, are now spreading into every field of medici ne. Whatever the  technology used — MRI (magnetic resonance imaging),  scans, radiology,  ultrasound, and their combination — the acquisition , visualization, and  interpretation of data by means of algorithms have made and will continue 
23 to make remarkable progress. Machine learning techn iques are bringing  results in the interpretation of images that can ou tdo the capacities of the  top specialists. The role of the radiologist has be en profoundly  transformed, to the point that some see it as desti ned to disappear,  though this is not a common view. However, the real ity of the  transformation is universally recognized, along wit h the current inadequacy  of training in this field. A more recent developmen t concerns the tools  employed: the sensors used for these analyses can b e highly  sophisticated, as with very high-density MRI, but c an alternatively be  simple and widely available, like the cameras or mi crophones on  smartphones. In the latter case, it is now possible  to diagnose skin lesions  by photographic analysis, or neurodegenerative dise ases through voice  and speech analysis.      • Telemedicine : the capacity to send data at speeds and with a de gree of  reliability never previously achieved, potentially anywhere in France, and  even overseas, raises the possibility of applicatio ns of telemedicine  ranging from prevention to monitoring. Here again, whether for citizens or  for health professionals, the change is profound an d is significantly  altering the relationship between individuals and h ealth professionals.  Medical consultations can be conducted remotely wit h the patient at  home, for example using specific devices, some of t hem cheap, to  measure physiological parameters with the participa tion and direct help of  the individual patient.      • The digitization  of operating  rooms : already a reality for some 15 years  with, for example, the development of Da Vinci type  robots initially  designed at the international Stanford Research Ins titute at Menlo Park in  California, digital technology in all its forms has  arrived in operating  theatres. Here too, the consequences are profound. Firstly in the use of  these techniques to train healthcare professionals in highly realistic virtual  environments for technical procedures such as catar act operations, brain  surgery, or micro-invasive surgery. And secondly, t o provide additional  capacities within operating rooms, for example in a nesthesia, to enable  medical personnel to manipulate documents (images, texts) without  touching them, to plan and record activities for pu rposes of traceability,  teaching, or research.      • Digital research for  healthcare : digital research is omnipresent in every  field of healthcare. To cite just a few examples, b ioinformatics research,  including genomics, research on the modelling of co gnitive capacities, 
24   cardiac modelling, the modelling of cells, tissues,  organs, organisms, the  modelling of the propagation of infected cells or e pidemics, affective  robotics, etc. It is significant that in the 6 IHU (university-hospital institutes:  LIRYC, Imagine, MIXsurg…) digital healthcare resear ch plays a fundamental  role.      • Hospital management : computerized handling of data, inventory,  maintenance, energy, digital or physical networks, safety, human resource  management… The use of artificial intelligence solu tions in healthcare  system funding is also significant, with solutions — like the one proposed  by ALICANTE — for the automated coding of medical a cts in hospital  financial management systems.     • Diagnostic support : to take only one example, the possibilities of pr ogress  in the handling of cancer opened up by artificial i ntelligence are very  considerable. For example, the French firm Therapixel  distinguished itself  in several international competitions, notably by w inning the Digital  Mammography Challenge . Its solution can identify early signs of tumor ri sk  through the mass processing of medical images by AI .      • Genomics : the application of AI is a major objective of the  sequencing  platforms provided for in France’s Genomic Medicine  Plan 2025. However,  artificial intelligence is already present in genom ics, as illustrated by the  example of the Dr WareHouse  instrument developed by the Necker  Hospital (AP-HP — Assistance publique — Hôpitaux de  Paris) and the  Imagine university hospital institute (IHU). Indeed , this institute has just  been given labelling for a RHU (university-hospital  health research) project  in Machine Learning on genomics and renal ciliopath ies.      • Medical teaching : the uptake of digital technology in medical teach ing has  accelerated considerably in the last 10 years or so , notably with the use of  MOOCs (massive open online courses) and the develop ment of training  centers that use robot and digital simulation. The establishment of a  Université du numérique en Santé et Sport (UNESS) —  with the active  involvement of the Conférence des Doyens de Faculté de médecine ,  pharmacie et odotonlogie  — constitutes a very important step in the  development of a full spectrum of digital training in France.      • Personal empowerment : digital technology is a key instrument for  reinforcing individual autonomy with respect to hea lth. The very positive  role played by digital technology in the autonomy o f people living with a 
25 disability was highlighted by Pascal Jacob, preside nt of Handidactique .  Practical tools already exist in this domain: one e xample is the mobile  phone app Jase Up , developed by the Down-Up  voluntary sector  organization, an easy and everyday tool for managin g solidarity networks in  support of individual autonomy.      • Clinical research : clinical research is embarking on a digital revol ution  driven by a combination of two factors:   - the possibility of collecting large volumes of data  generated by highspeed techniques (multiomic, imaging), which can fe ed algorithms  capable of stratify patients independently of any k nowledge of  biological mechanisms, a contribution to the quest for  “personalized” medicine;   - the possibility of reusing, for research purposes, pre-existing data  originating in research, in healthcare, or in healt hcare systems,  which potentially represents a major advance in avo iding the  duplication of data collection.      • Public health research : similarly, the possibility of reusing pre-existin g  data from multiple sources, including sources outsi de the healthcare  system (e.g. by reconstructing the lifelong exposur e of individuals to  pathogens in their working or living environment), and the exploitation of  the new capacities for large-scale data processing,  create the prospect of  understanding the complex interactions that determi ne changes in the  health of people and groups within the population, the real nature of their  interactions with the healthcare system, and the ef fects of those  interactions.       • Risk detection and management : algorithmic tools raise the possibility of  early detection of epidemic risks and therefore ear ly decision-making on  how to handle such risks,18  but also of detecting “weak signals” associated  with environmental exposure, with medication, ...   This is only a sample of the fields of application.  Others might include: the  training and monitoring of healthcare workers; the evaluation of doctors and  health professionals in general, including those in  the medico-social sector;                                                    18  Tested in Brazil and in Malaysia, AIME — Artificial Intelligence in Medical Epidemiology —  detected the start of an epidemic of Zika virus and  of dengue with almost 90% accuracy  within a radius of 400 meters. HealthMap  also uses mapping. An online application, this  system was designed by researchers at Boston Pediat ric Hospital and Harvard University in  2006.  It focuses on the early detection of risks o f dengue fever, chikungunya, or malaria  epidemics.   
26   medical data from definition to use and persistence ; the design, development,  and use of drugs; digitization in reproductive heal th; brain-machine interfaces;  prevention and personalized medicine; etc.  The applications of AI in healthcare are extensivel y covered in the book “Santé  et intelligence artificielle”,19  a publication directed by Bernard Nordlinger and  Cédric Villani. It looks in particular at applicati ons for medical imaging,  oncology, diagnostic support, genomics, emotions.     The rapid pace at wh ich digital technology is spreading through our  healthcare system  is a major and irreversible reality, which needs to   become an even greater priority in the future response to public health  challenges.  The information we have shows how digital technology  can be a  source of major advances in the quality and efficie ncy of our healthcare  system . The benefits it can bring in the areas of teachin g and research are  also considerable. All this potential is only just beginning to be marshalled .  The likely scale of the spread of these technologie s calls for a parallel  commitment  to continuing analysis of the ethical challenges associated  wit h them and with  their future developments .     4) Major impact of digital technology on the govern ance and  organization  of healthc are system s at national and  global  scales      International research has shown that digital techn ology is a major  source of change in healthcare systems. Firstly, th ese systems increasingly  use digital tools to organize patient care and path ways, in particular, and also  and increasingly in aspects of management associate d with the collection and  processing of health data.  Such “data -based management” is an absolutely   crucial project for the future of the French healthcare system .20                                                      19  B. Nordlinger and C. Villani (2018). Santé et inte lligence artificielle. CNRS Éditions, 416 p.   20  Strictly speaking, this can be broken down into:   - The use of digital tools in individual patient ca re and procedures, with major impacts on  the organization of the system;    - The use of digital tools (production of indicator s, analytical models for the use or  performance of healthcare services…) to support sys tem management decisions, the aspect  that might be referred to as “data-based management ”.  In this report, the latter expression  will be used in its broadest sense, encompassing th ese aspects of the use of digital  technology in health.   
27 This report is not the place to draw up a comprehen sive inventory of  the applications and impacts of digital technology in the operation,  organization, and governance of the healthcare syst em. The contribution by  Thomas London, Director of McKinsey Santé and Presi dent of the Health data  Institute,  reveals extensive documentation on the major posit ive effects — in  terms of greater efficiency and increased quality o f patient care — of more  widespread use of data-based management and digital  technology in our  healthcare systems.   The taskforce was reminded of the major benefits of  digital technology  for the improvement of our healthcare system by Pro fessor Guy Vallancien,  whose work has demonstrated the prospects of achiev able progress and the  need to support it.21  These advances apply equally to the healthcare sys tem  and to the social and medico-social sectors. Digita l technology can thus be a  major resource for responding to the challenges of ageing and failing health,  as was shown by Dr Philippe Denormandie in his cont ribution to the  taskforce.22    Professors Nathalie Salles and Thierry Moulin from SFT-ANTEL (Société  française de télémédecine) showed the very signific ant impact of the spread  of telemedicine on the organization of the system, with very positive results  already observed for the use of telemedicine in are as with poor medical  coverage, but also for the monitoring of patients a t home or patients with  reduced mobility.   Rémy Choquet, Innovation Director at Orange Healthcare  gave specific  examples of programs that show how digital technolo gy can contribute to the  emergence of genuine patient care improvements. Thi s logic is at work, for  example, in a post-operative face recognition proje ct for pain management  being conducted in collaboration with Nice Universi ty-Hospital, or in the  development with Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital (AP-HP)  of an algorithm for  monitoring patients suffering from rheumatoid polya rthritis.   The hearings and meetings with the heads of health institutions also  showed the profound effects of the digital transfor mation on the management  and organization of the healthcare system. At his h earing for the National  Consultation on bioethics, Martin Hirsch, CEO of AP -HP described the  establishment of a health data warehouse for the Assistance publique                                                     21  See in particular G.

28   (welfare system) and the development of very signif icant transformation  programs underpinned by digital technology. The mee tings with Professor  Michel Claudon, President of the Conférence des présidents de CME   (commission médicale d’établissement ) de CHU  (Conference of Presidents of  University-Hospital Medical Committees ) and Dr Thi erry Godeau, President of  the Conférence des présidents de CME de Centres hospita liers  (Conference of  Presidents of Hospital Centre Medical Committees), highlighted the potential  benefits and opportunities for medical practice of greater access to health  data and more possibilities for the use of digital tools. For its part, FEHAP   (Fédération des Établissements Hospitaliers d’Aide à  la personne  —  Federation of Hospital Human Assistance Institution s) has been working with  its member structures for many months around shared  projects relating to  artificial intelligence. UNICANCER is running the Consor (Continuum Soins  Recherche) project — a common database for cancer t reatment centers — and  OncoSnipe , a machine learning project on biomarkers in breas t, pancreatic,  and lung cancers, funded by BPI  (Banque Publique d’Investissement  — Public  Investment Bank) and headed by the firm OncoDesign .   Growing awareness of the major consequences associa ted with the   speed of current and future changes linked to digit al technology may  challenge the traditional dividing lines within our  healthcare system .   Thus, the announcement by the “G4” 23  in early June 2018 of the start  of a plan to build a global French ecosystem for th e development of image  recognition algorithms in radiology, transcends the  traditional oppositions  between public and private or between institutions and independent medical  practice.   From a managerial point of view, Etienne Grass, Dir ector of Health at  CapGemini , in his contribution to the work of the taskforce,  explained the  positive benefit of the simultaneous uptake of digi tal technology and design  thinking within our healthcare system. Exploration around the design of the  human/machine interaction contributes, in particula r, to the development of  ways to reinforce the quality and efficiency of hum an intervention or human  use of digital tools, and thereby to transform our healthcare system in a  positive direction.   The French government indicated the priority it pla ces on this question  by asking Dominique Pon and Annelore Coury to devel op proposals on the  digital transformation of our healthcare system. Th e conclusions of this                                                    23  French professional radiology council.  
29 mission, presented in September 2018,24  specified in particular the methods  envisaged for the implementation of a secure and pe rsonalized digital space,  the promotion of a framework of values and a set of  criteria for digital ethics,  as well as the proposal for a package of services i ntended to simplify access  to the different digital services for professionals  and institutions.   The organization  and governance of the entire healthcare system , from  research to clinical practice, from individuals to health professionals,  from the independent practitioner to the biggest he alth inst itutions, will  be profoundly affected  by digital technology, with consequences at the  national, European, and international levels that a re multiple but at present  hard to predict. This transformation is a source of opportunity, but  its  implementation enta ils tensions  that analysis of the ethical issues can help  to identify. Digital technology is transforming our  healthcare system by  enhancing the quality of patient care and organizat ional efficiency. It is also  helping to break down traditional divides and to fa cilitate the emergence of a  “learning healthcare system” that is favorable to m edical, technical, or  managerial innovations.  Already, and to a greater extent in the future,  profound changes are underway in the practices, rol es, functions, and  respons ibilities of people working in the healthcare system . This will have  multiple consequences for the training of everyone concerned. Finally,  infrastructures from the individual to the global l evel will change profoundly.                                                            24  “Accélérer le virage numérique”, report submitted on 18 September 2018 to the Solidarity  and Health Ministry following the mission conducted  under the Healthcare System  Transformation Strategy;  https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/IMG/pdf/masante20 22_rapport_virage_numerique.pdf    
30   D. Major ethical issues        “[…] In my view, we have three challenges that are extremely typical  when innovations of this kind appear or big revolut ions occur: we have a  choice in terms of conflicts between values and tec hnology, we have an  ethical tension in the geographical domain, and we have a tension in  relation to time factors. We find ourselves in a sy stem and a grammar that  are, in this respect, familiar, and this is what we  need to think about.”   Speech by Emmanuel Macron President of the Republic  — “AI for Humanity ”   Paris, Collège de France — Thursday, 29 March 2018      Ethical thinking is about taking a position on hier archies of values, as  one goes along, on the basis of personal and collec tive experience and  reflection. The aim of this reflection is to determ ine, in a reasoned way, what  can be considered to be the most correct decision o r action at a given moment  and in a given context. Depending on the viewpoints  considered, the  hierarchies of values are not necessarily the same:  it is the tensions between  these values that define ethical issues. For exampl e, the points of view of a  patient with a particular health condition and of t he citizen who does not have  that condition are not necessarily the same and can  themselves differ from  society’s collective viewpoint.   This attention to ethical issues is strongly presen t in the Villani report  and in the speech given by the President of the Rep ublic following the  submission of that report.   Of course, ethical thinking about digital technolog y should not be  separated from the application of more general ethi cal principles that date  back at least to ancient times. In particular, in m edicine, CNOM refers in its  report to the applicability to digital technologies  of the four principles of  medical ethics: beneficence, non-maleficence, auton omy, and justice. Bearing  these elements in mind, we will now explore the eth ical issues associated with  digital technology in healthcare, though we will st op short of considering  points relating to trans-humanism and the “singular ity”, notions that are  particularly well elucidated in Jean-Gabriel Ganasc ia’s book.25                                                         25  J.-G. Ganascia (2017). Le Mythe de la Singularité.  Faut-il craindre l’intelligence artificielle ?  Science Ouverte. Seuil, 144 p.  
31   1) Multiple examples of ethical issues in digital technology  and health      • I have a rare disease  and making my personal data available for  purposes of research and to improve treatment could  add to the existing  body of data. However, those data are sensitive. Sh ould I do it and, if so,  how?   The values in conflict here are essentially respect  for privacy versus  contribution to knowledge. The decision is personal , but clearly has an  impact on the community of people suffering from th e same condition.       • I am a doctor  and I use Gmail and DropBox to exchange informatio n about  the patients in my care. The convenience and speed of these methods  make me more efficient.   The values in conflict here are a degree of conveni ence versus medical  confidentiality.      • I am a patient and I  have been asked to give my free and informed  consent for the use of my personal data for purpose s of research or  healthcare system  management : free in what sense? Can I give my  agreement for my data to be shared and reused for o ther purposes of  public interest? If I refused, would I receive the same level of care? Can my  data be shared then reused for other purposes, in p articular commercial  purposes? How can I give my consent, how long will it be maintained, who  will have access to these data? Is there a risk tha t they could be used  against me or against my children?   The ethical issues here concern patient autonomy, t he ability of  patients to control what happens to the data they p rovide, the potential  public interest of using those data, and collective  responsibility in the  protection and use of data.      • I am an engineer working on the development of poll ution monitoring  software  (i.e. work that has an impact on public health). H ow should I  respond if I am asked to develop programs that are intended to falsify  measurements?   This would create tensions between professional res ponsibility, the  capacity to manage intracompany conflicts, and the values of  beneficence.     
32   • I a m a doctor and I use digital  systems to help me  make diagnoses or  choose treatments . What responsibility can I attribute to the digita l  system, and what confidence will the patient ultima tely have in me? Can I  be blamed if I take into account factors other than  the recommendation  generated by the digital system?    The ethical issues here are multiple and there is a  consensus, at least  in France, about the importance of the final decisi on being taken by a  human being, here in interaction between the patien t and the  physician. However, do doctors today, through their  initial training and  ongoing learning, possess the knowledge they need t o understand how  the digital instrument decides on its diagnosis or treatment plan and  how to take this into account in their final decisi on?      • I am the director of a  medical institution and I am working with my  teams to establish a health data warehouse.  This will allow me to  support the development of research programs and im plement data-based  health management measures.   The ethical issues here lie between the principle o f obtaining patient  consent and the need for flexibility in exploiting the benefits associated  with digital technology. In addition, this issue ra ises the question of the  security of the interface between these institution al data warehouses  and the national health data hub currently under de velopment.      • I am a citizen and I could have myself “augmented” through the  implantation of connected  devices : where is the boundary here between  the person and the artificial device?   The ethical issues here relate to the effects on th e definition and  protection of the human body associated with the sp read of digital  technology. What is the future of the current prote cted status of the  human body in a context where the growing accumulat ion of  connected objects will gradually alter the contextu re of the human  body itself? 26  Moreover, are all possible augmentations desirable ? How                                                    26  Act 94-653 of July 29, 1994 concerning the respect for the human body established the  legal status of the human body by distinguishing, f or purposes of protection, the person from  his or her body in its physical contexture. The pur pose of this Act was to remove the  paradoxical difference that previously existed betw een the protection of the person in their  environment and way of life (Article 9 of the Civil  Code) but not in the sensory reality of the  physical elements of their body. Arising from this Act, the terms of Article 16 of the Civil Code  state that “ legislation ensures the primacy of the person, proh ibits any infringement of the  latter's dignity and safeguards the respect of the human being from the outset of life ”. Article  16-1, based on the same law, states that “Everyone has the right to respect for his body. Th e  human body is inviolable. The human body, its eleme nts and its products may not form the  subject of a patrimonial right..”  
33 much will they cost? Will they generate inequalitie s? How might they  affect attitudes to people who are more fragile or who refuse to be  augmented?       • I work as a care give r for elderly people who use a digital assistant to   keep them company : what is the psychological and emotional impact of   such digital assistants? Could the use of these art ificial aids generate a  conflict of values for human caregivers?   The ethical issues involved here are made explicit by Professor  Laurence Devillers with her most recent work on hum an-machine  interaction and on language. 27  The use of these technologies may  generate a paradoxical development whereby an expan ded digital  presence goes hand-in-hand with greater isolation f rom other people.      • I am a researcher in the field of public health , and I have received  public funding to produce a meta-analysis, based on  patient data present  in all existing published clinical trials, comparin g the effectiveness and  side-effects of treatments given for a specific con dition, which will enable  HAS (Central Health Authority)  to improve its reco mmendations.    Would it be possible to have access to these indivi dual data, whether  or not patient consent has been obtained for the us e of their data? Will  the consents have the effect of limiting the reuse of data to certain  research studies? Were the patients able to withdra w their consent  and their data after the end of the study, which mi ght have the effect  of distorting my analysis if patient dissatisfactio n influences the  decision to withdraw consent (“I am withdrawing my consent because I  experienced a negative side-effect”)?       • I am a medic al student , and the training I am receiving includes the use  of digital tools in my practice.   If I have to take over from a digital device, will I know everything I need  to know in order to do so? Will I also be taught ho w to enhance the  human relationship in healthcare?       • I am a specialist in genomics and am doing research  in bioinformatics ,  and I have multiple questions.   What does it mean to obtain an individual’s informe d consent in the  case of genome treatment, given that genome analysi s generates                                                    27  See in particular L. Devillers (2017). Des Robots et des Hommes : mythes, fantasmes et  réalité. Plon, 240 p. 
34   information not only about the individuals, but als o about their family,  and high-speed analysis techniques now allow us to analyze entire  genomes, which may lead to incidental discoveries? What assurance of  confidentiality can I give people when handling the ir anonymized data,  given that the data could be reidentified by cross- referencing with  other data sources? Can this information on the gen ome be shared  and used for purposes other than those stated at th e outset? Is there  not a risk that my genome research could lead to ge netic  discrimination against individuals or groups, by re vealing their  predisposition to developing certain diseases?      The progress already made and the advances likely t o be  accomplished  suggest that approaching these questions  from a  restrictive  perspective would result in France missing out on  unprecedented  possibilities for innovation, with a major ethical component.    The ethical problems associated with the spread of digital technology  itself appeared less immediately discriminatory. No netheless, those problems  are real and need to be tackled at the highest leve l through preventive or  regulatory initiatives.      2) CNIL’s overview  of the ethical issues  raised globally by  algorithms and AI       In its previously mentioned report, CNIL formulated  a set of general  recommendations for responses to the ethical issues  raised by AI. It thus  identified “ two seminal principles for an artificial intelligen ce that works for  people”:    - A principle of loyalty  applied to all algorithms and that includes  their public — and not just their personal — impact s. Any algorithm,  whether or not it processes personal data, must be loyal to its  users, not only as consumers, but also as citizens,  and also loyal to  communities or large public interests whose existen ce could be  directly affected.  The interests of users must take  priority .   - A principle of vigilance/reflexiveness : a process of regular,  methodical, and deliberative questioning should be established and  maintained with regard to these evolving objects. T his principle  constitutes a direct response to the imperatives ra ised by these 
35 technological instruments, because of the potential  difficulty of  predicting the results that they may produce (e.g. in machine  learning), the highly compartmentalized nature of t he algorithmic  chains to which they belong and, finally, the exces sive trust they  can inspire.   CNIL also formulates six generic “ practical recommendations ” that may  be equally applicable to digital technology in heal thcare. They are reproduced  in the appendices.    These general principles and these practical recomm endations were  considered with interest and attention by the taskf orce. Nonetheless, in the  different contributions from experts, there was ano ther message often  conveyed by figures within our health service, whic h concerned the scale of  the current blockages and rigidities that hinder th e effective spread of digital  technology in health.    3) Insufficient use of digital technology , a source of  immediate and already visible ethical problems      In comparison with the countries where data-based h ealth  management has made the most progress, France in 20 18 is in a paradoxical  situation. Although it possesses health databases w ith exceptional coverage, it  is still relatively behind in the use of such data for management or research  purposes. This situation is a source of ethical pro blems that are immediately  visible.   In its contribution, France Assos Santé  – a consortium of Patients  associations - laid great emphasis on the need for more widespread databased management in order for our healthcare system  to progress.   In his submission to the taskforce, Pascal Jacob, C hairman of  Handidactique , highlighted the “ lack of memory ” in our healthcare system,  because of the social and health components of the system in different silos.  There are major difficulties in trying to establish  interfaces between them.  These partitions also exist between the different o perators within each sector,  with a general problem arising from the existence o f parallel information  systems with no interoperability, and in the absenc e of a culture of data  pooling and shared data processing to generate info rmation of joint interest.  Yet being able to access the stored information hel d by the different players is  very important for providing effective care.  
36   In the field of healthcare itself, the spread of da ta-based health  management represents a major instrument for detect ing cases of  inappropriate care. In his contribution, Alexandre Vainchtock, Chairman of  Hevaweb , showed the potential of data-based management to tackle this  major challenge for the quality and efficiency of o ur healthcare system, an  objective now recognized by the government as a pri ority for action.   The negative effects on the quality of patient care  and on the efficiency  of the healthcare system arising from the current m odel used in the funding of  the treatment of chronic renal failure are another example of problems that  could be more effectively identified and treated th rough an expansion of databased management.   Identified by the Cour des comptes (Court of Accoun ts) in 2015, the  deficiencies of this funding model act as a disince ntive to effective measures  to prevent and slow the progress of kidney disease,  to the provision of home  dialysis, to the maintenance of patient autonomy, b ut also to kidney  transplants, by far the most efficient treatment fo r patients whose kidneys  have ceased to function.   In its contribution to the taskforce, the Renaloo  association reported  that this funding system in particular is one of th e factors that explains the  obstacles and differences between regions in access  to the transplant waiting  list. It could also play a major role in the very l imited use of palliative  maintenance treatment rather than dialysis for very  elderly or terminal phase  patients by comparison with other countries. More w idespread use of databased management relating to chronic kidney failure  would probably have  facilitated earlier identification of these cases o f inappropriate care, which is  associated with significant reductions in patient l ife chances.   The insufficient use of digital technology in patie nt care, in research, or to  support the development of data-based management, are a source of  situations of substantial unethical practice within  our healthc are system .  Resolving these problems is a priority and entails the use of public policy  instruments that lie outside the primary normative provisions of the  forthcoming Bioethics Act.            
37 4) Health  data : between protection, medical confidentiality,  porta bility, and communicability      While much still remains to be done on the introduc tion of data-based  management, the ethical challenge of protecting the se sensitive data is also  particularly crucial. In fact, a first essential po int is to determine which are the  data of interest. While all the data arising from p atient care, together with  those relating to healthcare personnel, are obvious ly a subject of interest,  there are many kinds of additional data, such as in formation from other big  administrative databases, GPS data, or data supplie d by digital personal  assistants or smartwatches, and air quality or slee p quality sensors. Here we  provide simply some initial guidelines, bearing in mind that CCNE’s Big Data  working group is also tasked with developing these points.   The transposition of the GDPR (European General Dat a Protection  Regulation)28  represents a significant positive step in strength ening the  protection of such data. Since French legislation h as been harmonized with  this development through a specific legislative ins trument, the taskforce did  not feel it appropriate to open up this program imm ediately within the  framework of a future discussion on the revision of  the Bioethics Act..   Although they are not potential targets for legisla tive action in the near  future, certain questions nevertheless deserve more  in-depth exploration. This  is the case, in particular, for the conditions gove rning access to data by  insurance companies and mutual insurance companies.    In its previously mentioned report, CNOM moreover n otes that “medical  confidentiality with regard to personal health data  should be applied to the  processing of big data and these data should not be  used in such a way that a  person may be identified, with a consequent risk of  discrimination.”   In its contribution to the taskforce, France Assos Santé  emphasized  that  “one of the dangers often identified with the comp uterization of health  data concerns the practice of risk selection by ins urance companies. While  the law prohibits discrimination on grounds of heal th, it excludes the domain  of personal insurance, and therefore supplementary insurance. In a country  where the patient’s contribution to costs is 20% in  hospitals and 30% for a  doctor’s visit, this is already a sensitive issue. It is even more sensitive in the                                                    28  Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliamen t and of the Council of 27 April 2016  on the protection of natural persons with regard to  the processing of personal data and on the  free movement of such data, and repealing Directive  95/46/EC (General Data Protection  Regulation).   
38   case of standard care overall, where the patient’s contribution is close to  45%. If insurers know what health conditions their policyholders have, the  categorial solidarity of supplementary insurance mi ght be adjusted to take  account of the level of risk of the condition in qu estion. This is what is called  customer stratification on the basis of risk.” 29  On this subject, it should be  recalled that, since the 2002 Act, which created so lidarity-based health  insurance policies in order to make supplementary h ealth cover affordable  regardless of the policyholder’s state of health, p olicies are said to be  “solidarity-based” if there is no medical selection  when they are taken out and  the contribution rates do not change according to t he individual’s state of  health. In return, these specific policies receive exemption from the tax on  insurance contracts. A very large majority of the p olicies offered by insurers  and health and pension insurance providers are ther efore solidarity-based, as  are all those offered by the mutual insurance compa nies. This is a legal  obligation under the Mutuality Code.      A related question arises, in this respect, with re gard to the update of  the so-called “AERAS” system, which has failed to a dequately reduce cases of  adverse selection on health grounds in access to cr edit. The development of  data-based management creates a risk that this adve rse selection might be  intensified if appropriate regulatory mechanisms ar e not implemented. France  Assos Santé suggests that the Bioethics Act might be used as an  instrument  to tackle this situation. A device similar to quali ty certification could be  another possible option, provided that the represen tatives of healthcare  system users are involved in its governance.   The Villani Report also notes that “the portability and ease of  communication of “data relevant to health” need to be rethought in the age of  AI. The challenge is to involve individuals, to emp ower them in the production  of this information, while ensuring that the risks of intrusion into privacy and  of escalation are limited.”  The introduction of the “shared medical file” (DMP )  provides a practical instrument for this.   Nonetheless, this imperative of protection needs to  be balanced with  the value added by the sharing of these data in imp roving the quality and  efficiency of our healthcare system. Appropriate to ols therefore need to be  developed to facilitate such sharing.                                                     29  The use of data obtain from the SNDS (national hea lth data system) for this purpose is  expressly forbidden by Article L1461-1 of the publi c health code, but the question may arise  for health data from other sources, starting with d ata that may be held by the insurance  companies themselves.      
39 The announcement by the President of the Republic, following the  submission of the Villani report, of the establishm ent of a future national  health data “hub” administered by the Institut nati onal des données de santé  (INDS – National Institute of Health Data) is a cle ar and powerful initiative. The  methods of connecting this future national hub with  the data warehouses  currently being established within healthcare insti tutions or across health  regions will need to be defined.   As was explained by Yvanie Caillé, Director of INDS , the new  procedures for access to health data that have come  into force since the  healthcare system modernization act have reduced th e time taken to obtain  regulatory approval: the mean delay between submitt ing an application for  access to INDS and authorization by CNIL is now 70 working days, as  compared with previous waiting times that could be as long as 18 to 24  months. Since the opening of the procedure in Augus t 2017, some 300  applications have been submitted. Most of these are  academic, but other  types of applications for access are emerging. None theless, there have so far  been very few applications concerning development p rograms for Machine  Learning solutions.   The establishment of this kind of national hub, wit h the appropriate  level of security, would make it possible to advanc e further, to strengthen  individual or collective digital sovereignties in p articular at European level, to  reassure the parties concerned, and to pursue artif icial intelligence initiatives  on a much larger scale. In this regard, the Health Data Hub  project presented  in October may constitute an appropriate pathway co mbining the need for  data protection with the need for data sharing.30  With respect to the methods  of data supply, two approaches are theoretically po ssible:   - To obtain informed consent on a case-by-case basis for the  secondary sharing of data on such a hub;   - A broader mechanism of consent, or even presumed co nsent, to the  sharing of data for public interest purposes and wi thin the  framework of this secure national system.   The legitimate interest of processing data for publ ic interest purposes,  as Professors Anne Laude and Lydia Morlet of the In stitut Droit Santé from  Paris-Descartes University showed in their contribu tion, will undoubtedly be an  essential consideration for the effective operation  of this national hub. It  would naturally need to be subject to specific mech anisms of regulation and                                                    30  M. Cuggia, D. Polton and G. Wainrib (2018).  Healt h data hub.

40   supervision involving professionals and representat ives of healthcare system  users.   Another possible proposal might be worth considerat ion in this domain:  the recognition of “public interest data”. The poss ibility could be explored of  opening up certain datasets held by private actors for reasons of public  interest, following on from the recognition of the notion of “ public interest  data ” by the Digital Republic Act of 2016. In this resp ect, and in keeping with  the conclusions of the Cytermann mission (Dec. 2015 ), the Villani report  recommends consideration of the possibilities of ac cess to private data for  public interest purposes, ranging from access for p ublic authorities alone, to  access for other economic actors. In parallel, it w ould certainly be necessary,  as also recommended by the Villani report, to stren gthen public rights over  data in order to adapt the protection of fundamenta l rights and freedoms to  new practices, in particular with the aim of guaran teeing the protection of a  right to nondiscrimination.   An ethical middle way needs to be found between the  imperatives of  protecting health data and the need for the sharing  of these data in order  to enhance the quality and efficiency of ou r healthcare system . The  President of the Republic’s announcement of a plan for a “national hub” for  health data represents an interesting move in this direction, provided that the  principles governing data acquisition and security,  and the operation of the  instrument, are clearly defined.      5) The risk of increasing  inequalities within the healthcare  system       In its aforementioned report, CNIL notes that “algorithms and artificial  intelligence can introduce bias, discrimination, ev en forms of exclusion.”    In its previously mentioned report, CNOM refers to the difficulties of  accessing healthcare associated with the “ digital divide” . It therefore  recommends that efforts should be made, in particul ar investment in  equipment, in order to bring access to high-speed I nternet to the whole  country. The purpose of this is to guarantee equali ty of rights in the uses of  digital technology. According to CNOM, “these efforts must be accelerated, in  particular in vulnerable areas, in order not to int roduce a further digital divide  in access to health innovations and healthcare. Spe cific attention needs to be  paid to the French overseas departments.”  
41 The Ordre des médecins also takes the view that it is “imperative that  the anticipated progress in the technologies of art ificial intelligence, big data,  and robotics should benefit everyone and should not  exacerbate social, socioeconomic, or cultural divides. Our society, in its democratic and republican  organization, must ensure in particular that the pr ogress that these  technologies may bring, in the screening and enhanc ed understanding of  disease and disease risk, should not undermine our solidarity-based model of  social protection, but should contribute to reducin g inequalities and the risks  of exclusion.”   The Conférence nationale de santé (CNS — National H ealth Conference)  addressed this question in its position paper of Fe bruary 8, 2018.31  CNS called  for “the resolute pursuit of the digital transformation  of our healthcare system,  by employing the essential instruments capable of f acilitating access for all:  this means training users (and also providing help for those who need it),  training professionals, guaranteeing digital covera ge across the country and  access for every individual to their DMP (personal medical file).”  CNS also  recommends that connected applications and objects should be used as an  instrument for combating health inequalities by “developing information and  evaluation by users, by supporting research in fiel ds where the market would  not spontaneously go .”   The uptake of digital technology in healthcare can have potentially  significant effects on health inequalities, both re ducing and, in certain  cases, exacerbating them.  It is therefore indispensable to monitor the  implementation of digital technology in healthcare in order to ensure that its  adoption contributes to reducing these inequalities .       6) The ethical issues more specifically linked  with the spread  of algorithmic medicine      Two major ethical issues associated with the spread  of algorithmic  medicine have been identified: the delegation of in formed consent to an  algorithm and a reduction in the responsiveness to personal situations.                                                     31  Conférence nationale de santé (2018).

42   The delegation of informed consent to an algorithm   The spread of digital technology in healthcare may come with the risk  of undermining the reality of patient consent. Inde ed, since digital technology  and algorithmic medicine rely on big data that can demonstrate its  effectiveness in terms of care quality and efficien cy, what will remain of the  reality of patient choice when giving consent for t reatment? 32    These risks concerning the real involvement of pati ents in decisions  concerning their care are highlighted in the contri bution addressed to the  taskforce by France Assos Santé:  “artificial intelligence is now about to burst  into the relations between caregiver and patient, r aising new ethical  questions. The question is not whether we should fe ar or place excessive trust  in Artificial Intelligence. While it without any do ubt increases our capacities for  medical analysis, the challenge is simply — but to the highest degree — to  ensure that we work to readjust the relations betwe en patients and health  professionals. As things stand, we are afraid that the algorithms used take  little or no account of the complexities of the dim ensions of patient  preferences and of the number of psychological fact ors involved, thereby  introducing a new form of domination into the power  balance between  medicine and patience.”   More broadly, in its previously mentioned report, t he Ordre des  médecins recommends “ that the development of technical devices that  employ artificial intelligence should be encouraged  to move in the direction of  an industrial market for decision support in medici ne, rather than algorithms  that dictate decisions to both doctor and patient, without the option of critique  or contravention.”   Reduc ed  responsiveness to personal situations    Digital technology highlights and headlines a quest ion that has long  been asked in the field of epidemiology, concerning  the applicability to  individuals of results obtained from population gro ups.                                                     32  In a way, this is already true for decisions based  on clinical practice recommendations or  protocols; the principles applied were developed so me 30 years ago by David Eddy, in  particular, emphasizing the need to take into accou nt both uncertainties and variability in the  preferences of patients (Eddy, D. M. (1990). Design ing a practice policy. Standards,  Guidelines and Options.  JAMA, 263 : 3077-3084. 10.1001/jama.1990.0344022010 5041.);  these principles were taken up in approaches that p romote “shared decisions”:  https://www.hassante.fr/portail/upload/docs/applica tion/pdf/201310/12iex04_decision_m  edicale_partagee_mel_vd.pdf       
43 This ethical issue is intertwined with the very nat ure of algorithms,  which depend on computations of probabilities arriv ed at through the  processing of mass data.   In the health sphere, therefore, there is a risk of  the application of  mechanisms — on an undoubtedly unprecedented scale — that reduce the  responsiveness to specific personal circumstances a nd place reliance on an  analysis that is perceived as universal in scope.      Two major ethical challenges associated with the sp read of algorithmic  medicine have been identified and require regulatio n:   - The risk of depriving patients  — in practice by the “delegation of  consent” — of a significant part of their capacity to particip ate in the  constr uction of their healthcare pathways  as a result of the role of  algorithms in decision-making;    - The danger of a loss of responsiveness to personal situations  as a  consequence of the reliance on reasoning based on m odels that may be  limited in their capacity to take individual patien t characteristics and  preferences into account.      7) Digital technology and avoidance  of the healthcare  system       Digital tools can be used by patients as a means of  “bypassing” the  traditional forms of access to the healthcare syste m.   There are now numerous ways in which people can acc ess health  information online. This increasing availability of  information can be seen as  contributing to an overall movement towards greater  empowerment of citizens  in the management of their health. However, it also  exposes them to risks of  disinformation or of mistakes in their approach to the healthcare system. In  another respect, the broadening of access to remote  consultation services not  covered by Social Security increases the risk of de epening health inequalities  with the de facto  creation of a “two-speed system”, where digital ac cess to  some healthcare is confined to those who can afford  it.   As well as being an instrument for bypassing the tr aditional means of  access to the healthcare system, digital technology  has also led to the  development of forums or groups through which citiz ens can rate the  performance of professionals in the health and medi co -social sectors.  
44   Online evaluation of health professionals is a sour ce of transparency for  citizens, but also a potential source of destabiliz ation for professionals. In fact,  CNOM has just addressed this topic with the publica tion of a guide to good  practices.   Digital technology, as a means of avoiding the trad itional channels  of  access to information and healthcare or of sharing evaluations of practitioner  performance, constitutes a source of freedom and transparency fo r  citizens, but also of destabilization  for our healthcare system  and health  professionals . These phenomena need to be carefully monitored, i n  particular to maintain the imperative of healthcare  quality and safety that  citizens have a right to expect.      8) Digital technology and research in health care       The digital revolution in healthcare research relie s in part on the possibility of  reusing — for the purpose of interventional or obse rvational studies — data  from multiple sources: research data, treatment dat a, data from connected  devices, from large administrative databases,…   - Sharing and reusing data from interventional resear ch (clinical trials,  therapeutic trials) or observational research (coho rts, registers) entails  transposing the principle of access to research dat a into the healthcare  field (“FAIR: findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable”, Ohmann et  al. 2017)33  .  - Using data from treatment, from healthcare systems (electronic  hospital files, data generated by connected objects , data from national  databases) or from other big databases (in particul ar social or  professional databases) raises technical problems ( data formats and  interoperability, traceability, quality, security, and need for an approved  host for health data), but potentially represents a  major advance by  avoiding the duplication of data collection, which is one of the main  factors that determines the cost of clinical trials , patient cohorts, or  surveys (cross-sectional, cohort, intervention stud ies) conducted in the  general population.                                                          33  Ohmann et al.  (2017). Sharing and reuse of individual participan t data from clinical trials :   principles and recommendations. BMJ Open ;7 : e0186 47. doi:10.1136/bmjopen-201701864   
45 This nevertheless raises the question of consent, o f withdrawal, and the risks  of people being reidentified from reused data.      - With regard to the reuse of research data, it is im portant to be aware  that the unit here is not the patient, but the study . If it is not possible  to obtain the consent of all the patients who took part in a cohort or a  clinical trial, subsequent analyses (reanalysis, me ta-analysis,  secondary analyses) will be exposed to a risk of di stortion that would  undermine their validity. For example, the withdraw al of consent for the  reuse of data by patients who had experienced a neg ative side-effect  would seriously skew results towards a better risk- benefit analysis. The  same risk of distortion would arise if the investig ator had to obtain  individual consent for reuse from patients. It is t herefore important that  consent for the reuse of data should be obtained (o n a separate  consent form from that used for participation in th e trial or cohort)  before the beginning of the study , with a limited possibility of  withdrawal for legitimate reasons , and in the form of a truly broad  consent, authorizing  all reuses for purposes of medical and health  research, following approval by the appropriate operational ethics  committees.       - In the case of treatment data, distortions can also  arise from consent  or non-consent, insofar as non-consent can affect t he  representativeness of the sample. Worse still, the possibility of  retrospective withdrawal of consent opens the door to distortions if the  withdrawal is related to satisfaction. It is theref ore important that  consent should be obtained before treatment is give n  so that the  patient’s satisfaction does not affect their decisi on to consent or  maintain consent, which would otherwise be a major confounding  factor.      - The patient’s consent must be informed, and it is t herefore important,  in order to establish trust and empower patients, t o tell them how the  data will be shared, which implies that the data sh aring plan should be  an integral part of the research protocol, and that  the conditions of  sharing (identity removal, register, control of acc ess, etc.) should be set  out in detail in the information sheet provided bef ore consent is  obtained. The vast majority of patients understand the benefit of  sharing data (93% in the survey by Mello et al., 20 18).      - Identity removal can be reversible (pseudonymizatio n) or irreversible  (anonymization), and in the latter case the data ar e no longer 
46   considered personal and therefore are not covered b y the GDPR (i.e. do  not require consent and can be freely accessed), pr ovided however  that there is no risk of re-identification, which i n practice — given the  possibilities of cross-referencing data — is diffic ult, if not impossible, to  guarantee. If reducing this risk demands the remova l of large  quantities of data that could potentially be used f or reidentification  (e.g. an adverse side-effect in a clinical trial), the utility of these  “anonymized” data would be greatly attenuated. It w ould therefore be  desirable to provide the scientific community with standard  anonymization procedures that as far as possible sa feguard the  content of the data and are combined with the proscription of any  attempt at reidentification.  The  continuing risk of reidentification  means that the possibilities of access to these sen sitive data must  be monitored and managed.       This analysis, which agrees closely with the findin gs of CCNE’s Big Data   working group, leads us to the following joint conc lusions:      The sharing of research data according to ‘FAIR’  (findable, accessible,  interoperable, reusable) principles is a crucial factor for the development  of world -class s cientific research in healthcare and in helping to guarantee  the reproducibility and validity of results. Moreov er, in the field of health  research, access to data from healthcare itself, fr om healthcare systems, or  from other personal databases, represents a major a dvance by avoiding the  duplication of data collection, which can significa ntly increase the cost of  intervention research (clinical trials, therapeutic  trials) or observation  research (cross-sectional studies, cohorts). It wou ld therefore be good  practice, as far as possible, to have a consent pro cedure that enables people  to authorize the sharing of their data in the knowl edge of how they will be  shared (sharing plan), rather than why (by whom and  for what research). It is  also important to acqu ire the scientific, technical, and regulatory  resources to control the risks of people being re -identified from  databases in which direct identifying information h as been removed  and  to support the development of ethical tools for the  regulation of access to  sensitive data.       One of the keystones of the ethical deliberation un dertaken here is the strong  tension between the values of protection and the va lues of sharing. It will be  very usefully complemented by CCNE’s forthcoming po sition paper on the  subject of Big Data .     
47 E. What instruments of regulation?        “The regulation of artificial intelligence in healthcare is an issue  of national sovereignty  within the context of an international technology  race.  Indeed, while an excessively restrictive regulator y environment would  present the advantage of maintaining something of a  short-term status quo, it  would cede to states with a more flexible framework  the capacity to develop  their own philosophy on the uses of artificial inte lligence in healthcare. It is  therefore important that France should be contribut ing to the development of  ideas at international level, and be fully involved  in negotiations on future  technological standards.”   Villani  Report: conclusion of the section “AI for health policies”    In accordance with the objectives of the engagement  letter, the  taskforce has a number of recommendations to put fo rward to CCNE intended  to address at least some of the ethical issues iden tified.   The exercise of maximum restraint in the use of legislative an d regulatory  instruments  to regulate the uptake of digital technology in the healthcare  system  should be considered a key priority . This recommendation should  be considered in the light of the forthcoming revis ion of the Bioethics Act and  in the current legislative and regulatory context, including in particular the  transposition of the GDPR into French law.    There are two major reasons for this recommendation :   - Firstly, the introduction of too many enforceable  standards on digital  technology in healthcare into our substantive law might further  exacerbate the obstacles to the spread of innovatio n in France.  In fact,  as was noted above, as things stand the main proble m is the inadequate  use of digital technology in healthcare services, r esearch, and data-based  management;      - Secondly, there are practical limitations on the use of enforceable  national law as an instrument in a context of accelerated globalization   in access to healthcare services. If we regulate too much in France with  the collateral effect of slowing down innovation, t here is a big risk that, in  the very near future, patients and professionals ma y demand access to 
48   digital solutions developed in and imported from ot her countries and under  conditions that do not provide sufficient regulator y guarantees.   However, such moderation in the imposition of enfor ceable national standards  does not mean that any attempt to regulate the spre ad of digital technology in  healthcare will be ineffective in propagating an et hical vision commensurate  with France’s objectives in this domain.      1) Development  of the missions and scope of CCNE       In the speech he made following the submission of C édric Villani’s  report, the President of the French Republic strong ly and repeatedly  emphasized the need to consider the ethical issues associated with artificial  intelligence.      In his report, the member of Parliament Cédric Vill ani recommended  the creation of a specific ethics body to tackle th e issues associated with  artificial intelligence: “The question of ethics in the debate on AI has now   taken on such importance that it would seem that th ere is a need to establish,  within an institutional framework, a National Ethic al Consultative Committee  for digital technologies and artificial intelligenc e. Such a body could follow the  model of the Comité consultatif national d’éthique (CCNE), which has been in  existence since 1983 in the fields of life sciences  and health. Though  separate, these two institutions could nevertheless  explore and adopt a joint  position on the problems that emerge at the interfa ce between their fields of  expertise, issues such as transhumanism, biohacking , or the use of AI for the  processing of health data. Moreover, the two commit tees could have one or  more common members, and it should also be understo od that the rules of  membership need not be excessively restrictive.”    The taskforce took the view that there might be a risk in this proposal  of cutting this field off from others connected wit h digital technology in  healthcare. Creating a separate body with a more sp ecific focus on healthcare  could potentially lead to a loss of expertise and d epth of field for ethical  regulation and reflection in this often complex and  very fast changing domain.  How, for example, could there be generic regulation  of digital technology  without capitalizing on experience acquired in robo tization in healthcare or in  the growing role of social networks in the sphere o f preventative healthcare?  
49 It may be noted that this change in the role of CCN E would be  consistent with the op-ed published in Le Monde numérique, 34  but also that  the important and acknowledged part played in Franc e by CCNE for the life  sciences and for health could be extended beyond di gital sciences,  technologies, and uses, to the ethical problems of the environmental sciences  or of training, themselves closely linked with thos e relating to digital  technology or healthcare.   From an operational perspective, this shift could b e achieved by  broadening the terms and references of CCNE in the next Bioethics Act. The  establishment of an equal “digital” jurisdiction wo uld be a first step. This  would typically enable CCNE to handle referrals rel ating to digital technology in  health, as discussed in this report, but also, for example, to address the  ethical issues associated with autonomous vehicles,  with digital technology in  education, or with autonomous weapons with lethal c apacity. The committee  college could, where necessary and in accordance wi th the revised rules, set  up ad hoc working groups to tackle different referr als, and thereby develop its  positions with the input of appropriate experts.   Moreover, the taskforce took the view that the term  “consultative” is  redundant in the title, even with respect to the co mmittee’s current activities.  It therefore reached the following joint conclusion :      The Comité Consultatif National d’Éthique pour les scie nces de la vie et  de la santé  (CCNE — National Ethical Consultative Committee for  life sciences  and health) should evolve into a Comité National d’Éthique  (National Ethics  Committee), a body with the capacity to work on eth ical issues relating not  just to life sciences and health, but also to digit al sciences, technologies,  practices and innovation. If necessary it should be  able to address the ethical  problems relating to other scientific disciplines.    A corollary of this development would be that the  terms of reference of  CCNE would be broadened in the next Bioethics Act .                                                        34  https://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2017/12/14/il -faut-creer-un-comite-national-dethique-dunumerique_5229661_3232.html   
50   2) Differing approaches to the ethical issues associated with  digital technology in healthcare at  international and  European levels      The ethical issues associated with digital technolo gy in healthcare, and  the methods of regulating those issues, are underst ood and addressed  differently at European and international levels. A n analysis of this  international diversity of approach is undertaken i n an appendix to this report.  This analysis concludes that, with the implementation of the GDPR, the  European Union is already one of the areas in  the world where the spread  of digital technology and data protec tion are subject to the greatest legal  regulation.  By way of an example of this difference in the lev els of regulation  and risk associated with time differences in the sp read of innovation, in April  2018 the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued the first official  license for a working digital solution applicable t o image recognition for the  diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy.35    The previously mentioned Hall-Pesenti report argues  that the increased  use of artificial intelligence could have very bene ficial social and economic  effects in the United Kingdom.   According to the guidelines formulated for the cont inuing development  and application of AI, the report asserts that the UK will need to increase the  ease of access to data in a wider range of sectors.  The review recommends to:   – develop data trusts in order to increase confidence  and ease around  sharing data;   – make researches in machine learning more readable a nd accessible;   – support text and data mining as a standard and esse ntial tool for  research.      The ethical issues of digital technology in healthc are are dealt with very  differently at European or international level, but  there is a consensus on the  need to take practical measures, which should be as  evolutive as possible, to  ensure the reliabili ty of digital applications and control of their use .                                                     35  This condition, which affects 50% of patients with  type II diabetes, is caused by high blood  glucose levels, which damage the blood vessels in t he retina. In France, it is the primary cause  of blindness in people under the age of 65, accordi ng to the FFD (French Diabetics  Federation). The device approved by the US agency, named IDx-DR, is able to detect diabetic  retinopathy (mild to advanced) using an algorithm t hat screens for ophthalmic disorder by  analyzing photographs. It is authorized solely for adults over the age of 22 (W. Zirar (2018). La  FDA autorise le premier dispositif médical utilisan t l’IA pour dépister la rétinopathie  diabétique, TICpharma.com, April 17)  
51 3) A debate  on regulation nevertheless needed at national  and perhaps above all at European and international  levels       France needs to develop appropriate instruments to support the  establishment of vehicles for regulating the spread  of digital technology in  health. The matter can be divided into two layers.   Support for research on the regulation of digital t echnology in healthcare   As can be seen, the spread of digital technology in  healthcare raises  issues that are multiple and complex, and deciding on the right level and the  right intensity of regulation demands input from a wide range of disciplines. In  order to ensure that digital innovation in healthcare spreads effectively  and responsibly, sustained research is needed into the regulation of this  process.   As part of the public consultation undertaken by Cé dric Villani, the  Ethik-IA initiative put forward an initial proposal  that one such vehicle could be  a Foundation to support applied research on  the ethical, legal, and social  regulation of the spread of robotization  and AI in health .   Engagement by France in the  development of regulatory standards at  European and international levels   France, which was a frontrunner in building the leg al frameworks  applicable to data protection or telemedicine, need s to take the initiative in  the development of a system of adjustment to digita l technology in healthcare  that reflects the demands of a democratic society.   This initiative cannot be restricted to the nationa l level. It would benefit  from being taken up at European level.   Initiatives also need to be pursued at internationa l level. In this respect, the  project for a “COP for AI” proposed by Professor Gu y Vallancien would certainly  be worth pursuing. Such a “conference of the partie s” would establish a  multilateral framework for discussion of these ques tions. Nonetheless, the  disparities in approach between countries with rega rd to the necessity and the  nature of regulation on the spread of digital techn ology in healthcare suggests  that progress is first likely to happen at the Euro pean level, where the example  of the GRDP shows that a community dynamic on these  digital issues is  possible.     
52   The response to the ethical challenges associated w ith the sprea d of  digital technology in healthcare will be enhanced by adopting an  international  — and initially European  — perspective . Nonetheless, there is  still an essential role for the national level, sin ce the implementation of a  flexible normative system of regulation at European  level will require a strong  initiative on the part of government to support the  joint construction of  regulatory tools appropriate to national needs.      4) Possibilities of regulation for the future legis lative process       So, while the taskforce took a strong position in f avor of legislative  moderation on digital questions at the time of the revision of the Bioethics Act,  this preference should not rule out all legislative  initiatives. Under the “Ethik  IA” initiative mentioned previously, “5 keys to regulation”  were proposed for  the dissemination of artificial intelligence and ro botization in health. This tool  — set out in an appendix — identifies the normative  elements already present  in substantive law and those which, where appropria te, might be included in  the revised Bioethics Act.   There needs to be better compliance with legislative principles or   standards already in force  in order to tackle the issues of digital  technology   It should be possible for individuals to be informe d in advance when a  digital device will be used in their future healthc are program. In its ruling  2018-765 DC on  “Law relating to the protection of personal data” , the  Constitutional Council specified that the person should  receive advance  information on the use of an algorithm as the basis for an individual  administrative decision . The principle of doctors giving their patients  advanced warning about the use of an algorithm ther efore seems consistent  with this constitutional interpretation. A specific  statement to this effect in the  upcoming Bioethics Act would, however, emphasize th e importance assigned  to medical decision-making.36     The digital device should not undermine the import ance ascribed to  obtaining the patient’s informed consent. Specific procedures — such as the                                                    36  Alongside this, there should be an awareness of th e practical necessity of not making the  process of obtaining consent for these digital devi ces excessively specific and fragmented,  whereas the principle of informing patients of all the factors entering into decisions about  them is a major principle of informed consent for t reatment.  
53 use of a trusted person, or of arrangements for obt aining advance consent for  a set of treatment options, or stronger protective measures for vulnerable  people — should, where needed, be developed to guar antee that consent is  genuinely obtained.   Several new legislative provisions could  beneficially be introduced into  the upcoming Bioethics Act   The inclusion of a “Human Warranty” principle on di gital technology  would place France in a positive position as an int ernational pioneer.37    The principle of a Human Warranty of digital system s in healthcare  must be followed. This guarantee could be upheld fi rstly by regular processes  — both targeted and random — to verify the treatmen t options proposed by the  digital system and, secondly, by arrangements for a  second human medical  opinion to be sought at the request of a patient or  a health professional, and  finally by the recognition of the need to maintain the ultimate prerogative of  the health professional, in interaction with the pa tient, to take the decisions  appropriate to each specific situation.   In the course of his contribution, Pascal Jacob, Ch airman of  Handidactique , placed great stress on the importance of human pr inciples  being applied when using digital technology in the case of people living with a  disability. The goal must be that digital technolog y should assist people with  disabilities in their quest for autonomy.   With respect to medical practice itself, Dr Jean-Pa ul Ortiz, Chairman of  the Confédération des syndicats médicaux français ( CSMF — Confederation of  French Medical Federations), highlighted the fact t hat the spread of digital  technology could facilitate a return to humanism in  patient care, after a phase                                                    37  In its previously mentioned ruling 2018-765 DC, th e Constitutional Council argues that an  algorithm cannot constitute an “exclusive” paramete r in the taking of an individual decision.  The Council noted that the person responsible for t reatment must ensure that the algorithmic  treatment and its developments are managed, so that  it is possible to explain to the person  concerned, in detail and in intelligible form, how their treatment was given. The result is that  algorithms that are capable of revising the rules t hey apply — i.e. Machine Learning algorithms  — cannot be used as the exclusive basis for an indi vidual administrative decision, unless  monitored and validated by the person responsible f or treatment. This interpretation by the  Council should probably not be seen as proscribing the use of any artificial intelligence  process that entails a degree of autonomous decisio n-making. In fact, a whole series of  processes of this type are already operating today in our healthcare system, especially in the  case of medico-technical platforms. This ruling sho uld probably be understood as a call for  human supervision of the performance of an algorith mic decision-making system, but also as  a reminder of the need to maintain a human intellig ence in charge of decisions, in order to  take into account specific factors that the algorit hm would not have considered.  
54   of relative blindness associated with the promotion  of a “medical technician”  culture.   This general principle should also be applied in pr actice to define a new  phase in the progress of telemedicine, so-called “h uman warranteed”  telemedicine, a notion developed by the Société fra nçaise de télémédecine  whose Chairs, Nathalie Salles and Thierry Moulin, w ere also interviewed. Its  principle is simple: in the event that the patient or the treating physician  should be in any doubt about a diagnosis reached by  an algorithm, a new form  of tele-expertise would be recognized, whereby a se cond medical opinion  could be delivered by a human being.   In addition, it would be advantageous to introduce a legislative  measure to provide a framework for a system of prof essional standardization.  The taskforce took the view that specialist medical  oversight by the Haute  Autorité de Santé  could be appropriate.      With respect to the next  Bioethics Act , it is desirable that the  fundamental principle of a Human Warranty  of digital technology in  healthcare should be entrenched in law.    With regard to the equally fundamental principle of  obtaining patient consent  (for the collection of health data and for the trea tment process itself), the  substantive right — in all its stringency — remains  appropriate. Nonetheless,  this substantive legislative right would bene fit from additional new or  updated practical tools to guarantee that such cons ent is actually  obtained  (sequential consent arrangements, revival of the t rusted person  concept, stronger procedures for vulnerable individ uals…).   The creation of a secure nati onal hub for the collection and processing of  health data represents a useful method of connecting together the  different ethical issues relating to health data.  The decision on how data  would be fed to this hub would fall within the legi slative arena if a political  intention was expressed for the creation of a mecha nism of presumed  consent in the case of a public health interest, of  the kind that exists for organ  donation.         
55 5) Instruments  of regulation that do not fall primarily within  the legislative and regulatory domain     Digital technology in health: approach to the issue s of legal liability   The Villani report calls for a “ clarification ” of the liability of health  professionals in the use of AI. However, as things stand, the question of the  impact that the use of digital technology in health care might have on medical  liability has received relatively little attention.38    From a global perspective, this question is  broadly and  judiciously  covered by  existing law relating to liability for damage or inj ury caused by  things in one’s  custody and for damage or injury caused by defective  products .   So while it has so far been possible for these majo r transformations in  the foundations of medicine — both somatic and psyc hiatric — to be validly  interpreted within the framework of liability law, by the system of liability for  damage or injury caused by things in one’s custody,  the new generation of  algorithms has upset the applecart. The current tec hnological changes are  creating conditions in which a change in the legal approach is needed.   The use of learning algorithms may result in the sy stem of liability  for damage or injury caused by defective products b ecoming partially  inoperative.  Indeed, the notion of development risk represents a reason for  exemption from liability. This is a risk that arise s from product defects that  could not be anticipated at the time a product was designed in the then  prevalent state of scientific and technical knowled ge.39  We could find  ourselves in precisely this situation in the case o f damage or injury caused by  developments “self-generated” by an algorithm beyon d its initial programming,  on the basis of inferential reasoning. The first pr actical applications of  machine learning techniques in the health sphere ha ve shown that these  possibilities of damage or injury are not at all th eoretical and could be  expected to increase significantly.                                                     38  D. Gruson (2017).  Les robots et l’intelligence ar tificielle vont-ils décider de l’avenir de nos  corps ? La revue hebdo, Lexbase Privé, n°723, 14 dé cembre ; J. Petrelluzzi et M. Miliotis  (2017).

Le risque de développement : contribution au maintien du droit à la  réparation, Editions universitaires de Dijon, 360 p .  
56   This development should lead to general reflection on the  organization  of professional liability  regimes, which in recent years has been  characterized by the emergence of regimes that attr ibute an ever smaller role  to the notion of fault on the part of medical and p aramedical teams. The use  of digital objects may therefore “slot” into this g eneral organization, leading to  the emergence of a new category of compensation reg imes that is not directly  based on the actions of the professionals themselve s.   This raises the question of the potential basis of a possible system of  compensation for injury caused to bodies by an algo rithmic object. Given the  possible scale of the issue, one might reasonably t hink that national solidarity  alone would not be enough. Broader risk pooling sch emes, at European and  perhaps international level, may perhaps have to be  considered. A  consultation process on this is in fact currently u nderway, initiated by the  European Union institutions.40    The establishment of a general framework of compens ation for injury that  may be caused by digital objects does not seem to b e an immediate  priority in the revision of the Bioethics Ac t. This issue is worth examining in  depth in a context where damage and injury, as thin gs stand, remain relatively  well covered by liability arrangements relating to damage or injury caused by  things which are in one’s custody and caused by def ective products. Given  the potential scale of the issue  in coming years, it would be desirable if a  framework specifically designed to cover injury cau sed by digital objects  was  developed at least at European level .      Regulation and soft law (self -compliance and volu ntary certification)   The ruling on December 7 last by the European Court  of Justice notably  circumscribed national capacity for regulation on d igital innovation in the  healthcare sphere.41  This Community framework therefore opens the door to  methods of regulation that do not entail enforceabl e law.                                                     40  European Parliament (2017). Report with recommenda tions to the Commission on Civil Law  Rules on Robotics (2015/2103(INL)). Committee on Le gal Affairs.   41  The Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) was called upon to rule on a prejudicial  question regarding whether a software program for p rescription support meets the definition  of a medical device, if that program provides at le ast one function that can be used to process  data specific to the patient for the purpose of hel ping the doctor to establish a prescription, in  particular by detecting contraindications, drug int eractions, and overdoses, although it does  not of itself act in or upon the human body (CE, Ju ne 8, 2016, n° 387156). In a ruling of  December 7, 2017, the  CJEU answered that a softwar e program that has a function that  enables the processing of data specific to a patien t, notably for the purpose of detecting 
57 In its aforementioned report, CNOM takes the view “that we should not  try to make laws about everything, or seek to regul ate everything by  ministerial order. Instead, it recommends that qual ified entities should  produce flexible legal rules, modelled on the “soft  law” of Anglo-Saxon  countries.”   In the same way, the Villani report notes, more spe cifically with  reference to AI, that the “ speed of change and democratization of the uses  associated with artificial intelligence in healthca re demands that the  authorities adapt quickly, or risk watching powerle ss as the issues of public  health and medical practice are entirely reformulat ed . Indeed, overregulation  would maintain the existing balances in the short-t erm, but would expose us  to a loss of control over desirable changes in our health model.”   The work of the taskforce confirmed these risks of a disconnect  between advances in research on digital technology in healthcare and their  conversion into applications useful to patients. An  early legislative or  regulatory obstacle could stop potential progress i n its tracks. Moreover, as  was revealed in the hearing with Professor Olivier Amédée-Manesme, Director  of Paris BioTech , it could increase the cost of innovation and lead  to an  international exodus of French digital innovators i n health.   The Villani report also argues “ the systems that implement AI take  decisions based on models constructed from data. Th is means that protocols  must be developed, incorporating new metrics, that can be applied to data, to  performances, to interoperability, to usability, to  security, and to  confidentiality. ” A process of certification and of measurement, to  assess the  real utility of these applications, is particularly  necessary in healthcare  applications where the cost-benefit ratio needs to be evaluated.   Nonetheless, despite their utility, certification a nd standardization work  in artificial intelligence for health and health ro botics remains, for the  moment, in a very fragmentary state.   The approach pursued by the Imagine  University-Hospital Institute to  produce a prototype standard for the good use of ar tificial intelligence applied                                                                                                                                          contraindications, drug interactions, and overdoses , constitutes, by virtue of that function, a  medical device under the terms of Directive 93/42/C E of June 14, 1993, even though the  program does not act directly in or upon the human body. In this ruling, the CJEU also takes  the view that CE marking constitutes a necessary an d sufficient condition for the device to be  put into service, thereby rendering superfluous the  additional prior national licence that had  been intended by the French legislature of (Sources : J. Peigne (2017). Un logiciel d’aide à la  prescription est-il un dispositif médical ? Edition s législatives, December 8; V. Granier (2017).  La CJUE sonne le glas de la certification des logic iels d'aide à la prescription, TICpharma.com,  December 19).   
58   to genetic data, provides a concrete example of the  value added by the  possibility of standardization in this domain.   There needs to be a strong initiative with in the next few months to trigger  a dynamic for the practical creation of soft law type instruments of  substantive  regulation applicable to the spread of digital tech nology  within our healthcare s ystem .   Regulation and management (anticipation of the effe cts on health  professions, digital corporate social responsibilit y)   The effects of the spread of digital technology in general and of artificial  intelligence and robotics in particular may be part icularly significant for  jobs in the healthcare and medico -social sectors.  These potentially major  changes were clearly indicated in the previously ci ted France Stratégie report.  As Salima Benhamou pointed out, digital corporate s ocial responsibility also  needs to be seen as an instrument of global perform ance, in other words  organizational, economic, and social performance. A ccording to a survey  conducted by France Stratégie  with more than 8,500 French companies,42  the  average economic gains (measured in particular by a dded value and net  profit) arising from responsible practices in organ izations were estimated at  13% on average for economic gains, and 20% specific ally with regard to the  “responsible” practices associated with the introdu ction of managerial  practices (participation, collaborative management,  teamwork…) and of  management measures focusing on the anticipation of  the skills needed to  adjust in particular to technological and organizat ional changes.   Investment in  regulating the implementation of  digital technology  will should therefore be recognized  as a new form of corporate social  responsibility (CSR).  The decision to invest in a responsible framework for the  use of digital technology is in fact an integral pa rt of the broader trajectory of  sustainable development as a whole.   In reality, nothing contradicts this recognition of  the CSR perspective as  defined in law. In its third report on CSR in 2011,  the European Commission  thus defines it as “ the responsibility of companies for the effects the y have on  society .” ISO 26000 guidance on CSR adopts the same positi on. The  introduction of digital technology into a company o r a given business sector  undoubtedly produces major effects for society as a  whole. Approaching this                                                    42  S. Benhamou and M-A Diaye (2016). Responsabilité s ociale des entreprises et compétitivité.  Évaluation et approche stratégique, France stratégi e,  http://www.strategie.gouv.fr/publications/responsab ilite-sociale-entreprises-competitivite     
59 process ethically and responsibly can therefore be seen as an instrument in its  own right through which a socio-economic entity exe rcises its social  responsibility. From a practical point of view, thi s new form of CSR linked with  responsible digital technology can take various for ms: adaptation of initial and  lifelong learning tools and forward management of j obs and skills;  engagement in systems of self-compliance and volunt ary self-certification;  support for research on regulation…   More broadly, a strong initiative to better antic ipate and  manage  the effects that the spread of digital technology has on the  healthcare  and medico -social professions  should be a priority .   In its previously cited report, CNOM “considers it essential to begin  immediately to train doctors for the world in which  they will practice, where  technologies — alongside clinical practice — will p lay a big role.” It also  recommends that “ in the initial training syllabus, as well as subseq uently in  continuing professional development, simulation usi ng interactive digital  methods should be more widely practiced, as a way o f learning to respond to  situations, to practice technical skills, or to con duct an investigation.”  Finally,  CNOM recommends that “in making demographic decisions about the training   of different medical specialists in university facu lties, and about the content of  those training paths, the foreseeable changes in pr ofessional disciplines  should be taken into account.”   For its part, the Villani report suggests “ training health professionals in  the uses of artificial intelligence, of the Interne t of Things (IoT), and of big data  in healthcare, as well as in the skills of coordina tion, empathy, and relations  with patients .”   With regard to the possibility of a “disruption sce nario”, the previously  cited report by France Stratégie  notes that “ in the health sector, the arrival of  newcomers to the healthcare “market” is controlled by the state (planning of  hospital services, numerus clausus). However, there  are other competitive  players, international in scale. The drug and medic al devices industry is a  vehicle for the spread of AI into the health sector , notably through mobile  applications incorporated into treatment protocols.  Applications that can  demonstrate high added value in terms of healthcare  gains or quality of life  could achieve dominance in patient treatment pathwa ys.”   The effects of such a major change on professions i n the health  and medico -social sector should be considered closely and atte ntively, in  particular  with an eye to creating new monit oring and anticipation  mechanisms.   
60   The aim of these measures would be to assess the ri sks of substantial  job losses or changes, but also the possibilities o f creating new professional  disciplines (for example in the different fields of  Data Management or in the  reinforcement of the human relationship between car egiver and patient).   These systems would benefit from the inclusion of forms of shared  governance between users of the healthcare system  and health  professionals .   In his contribution to the taskforce, Professor Jea n Sibilia, Chairman of  the Conférence des Doyens de Faculté de médecine , placed great emphasis  on the need for initial medical training programs t o include modules that raise  awareness about the ethical and practical issues as sociated with the use of  algorithms in medicine. Simulation-based training t echniques could be a very  useful instrument for this purpose. As mentioned ab ove, the establishment of  a comprehensive French strategy on the use of digit al technology in medical  training, through the vehicle of UNESS, holds promi se of significant progress in  this respect.   Professor Jean-François Meder, Chairman of the Société française de  radiologie (SFR — French Radiology Society) and Dr Jean-Philip pe Masson,  Chairman of the Fédération nationale des médecins radiologues (FNMR —  National Federation of Medical Radiologists), told the taskforce about the  ways radiologists were seeking to adapt their profe ssional practices positively  in order to incorporate the contributions of artifi cial intelligence.   The effects that  the adoption of a digital system will have on the  conditions of professional practice in the health a nd medico -social  sectors need to be anticipated with supportive meas ures . Public and  private actors should be further encouraged to adap t the training — both initial  training and continuing professional development — of healthcare personnel  to the challenges of digital technology and to supp ort the emergence of new  professions associated with the spread of digital t echnology in the health and  medico-social sectors. The very large mismatch that currently exists  between our system of initial training and continuing professional  development and the challenges associated with the spread of di gital  technology is a serious problem for our healthcare system. Initiatives  — such  as those of the Conférence des Doyens de Faculté de  médecine and of UNESS  — are in preparation to remedy this situation and  should be encouraged.          
61 F. Glossary of  certain terms relating to  digital technology in healthcare        Artificial intelligence (AI): Originally, in 1956, the aim of AI was to sim ulate  human cognitive faculties on computers it encompass ed scientific approaches  in computer science and mathematics, at the leading -edge of cognitive  sciences such as knowledge representation, machine reasoning, problemsolving with constraints, optimization, automatic l anguage processing,  computer vision or machine learning. Today, the ter m AI is often used in the  generic sense of “digital technology”, but it also tends to be used to refer to  machine learning, or even deep learning.   Weak artificial intelligence:  Specialized AI, which concentrates on the  performance of a specific task (e.g. image recognit ion, playing go  or chess).  This is the type of AI used particularly in medicin e today.   Strong artificial intelligence : Artificial general intelligence (AGI), with capac ity  that is not limited to certain domains or tasks. To day, scientific and  technological developments in this type of AI do no t yet have real-world  applications.   Algorithm : in the strict sense, description of a finite and unambiguous  sequence of steps (or instructions) used to obtain a result based on initial  input data. In today’s digital world, computer algo rithms can combine multiple  kinds of data to produce a wide variety of results:  simulating the propagation  of influenza in winter, recommending books on the b asis of choices made by  other customers, comparing digital images of faces or fingerprints…   Big Data : extremely large datasets. These datasets have bec ome so large that  they are beyond the capacity of individual cognitiv e faculties alone, and  require massive computing power. The term covers in formation originating  from a multitude of sources, public or private, loc al or global.   Data anonymizatio n: outcome of the processing of personal data in suc h a  way as to irreversibly prevent any identification o f individuals. It allows  databases to be used while respecting individual ri ghts to data protection.   Pseudonymization : outcome of the processing of personal data in suc h a way  that these can no longer be linked to a specific pe rson, without drawing on  additional, separately stored, and protected inform ation.  
62   Health data (or personal health-related data): set of all avail able data  (physical examinations, biological samples, data fr om medical imaging,  genomic data) relating to the past, present, or fut ure health, physical or  mental, of a natural person. These data may be coll ected within a healthcare  framework, but also by institutions associated with  the healthcare chain  (health insurance, hospitals…) and, more recently, by a range of online and  connected tools that are unconnected with the healt h sector.   Consent : in the medical sphere, everyone must be presumed capable in  principle of receiving information and giving “free  and informed” consent to a  proposed medical procedure, unless it has been esta blished that the person  lacks this capacity. The information must be “loyal , clear, and appropriate.”  The person giving consent must be able to comprehen d (clarity of  understanding or intellect) and to decide freely (s elf-determination).   Medical confidentiality : this is a requirement for all health professional s  (medical and paramedical personnel), who must maint ain the confidentiality  of information regarding all individuals they may d eal with in the exercise of  their profession. Some information can be shared wi thin a single care team.   Confidentiality : “To protect and preserve the confidentiality of i nformation.  means to ensure that it is not made available or di sclosed to unauthorized  entities” (International Standards Organization).   Shared medical file : digital medical file, which enables authorized heal th  professionals to access information useful for the treatment of a patient and  to share the medical information relating to a pati ent with other health  professionals. The sharing of data with professiona ls who do not belong to the  same care team requires the patient’s consent.   Machine learning : capacity of algorithms to learn from datasets in order to  improve the initial performances of computer progra ms. Recent developments  in AI are linked with improvements in these new tec hniques. A distinction is  made between supervised machine learning  (where input data preprocessed  by human beings are fed to the algorithm) and unsupervised machine learning   (the algorithm processes raw data and develops its own classification).   Robot : a robot is a computer-controlled machine that mov es in physical space.  A robot acquires data using its sensors, develops a n interpretation or  interpretations of those data, in order to compute decisions relating to its  actions in physical space. A robot can also be a so ftware agent with no  physical parts (also called a bot), which acquires data and performs tasks  within a computational space. A robot can be progra mmed to interact with a  user, either physically, or via an interface. The g eneric term robotics refers to  the science of designing and studying robots.  
63 Robotization : use of robots to carry out certain tasks.   National health d ata system : a system encompassing the main existing  public health databases: Health Insurance data, hea lth institution activities,  causes of death, data on disability, and soon data originating from the  supplementary health insurance companies.

68   Appendix 3 Recommendations  of the Villani report for  healthcare      AI as the servant of  medicine   - A specific new project should be launched, connecte d with the Shared  Medical File (DMP) for the production of health dat a and information that  can be used for AI purposes in order to improve hea lthcare and healthcare  coordination, but also to contribute to AI research  and innovation projects in  healthcare. Linked to the DMP, the latter would be expanded as a secure  space where individuals could store their data, add  further data, authorize  their sharing with other parties (doctors, research ers, friends and family,  etc.) and recover them for other purposes;   - Tools and technologies should be employed to automa te the encoding of  information produced by patients in forms that can be used for medical  monitoring. This point would need to be combined wi th the task of  standardizing medical information;   - Patients should be given education on managing thei r data (data literacy  applied to health).   A shift to patient -centered  medical practices   - The channels into medical studies should be transfo rmed: firstly in order to  attract a greater diversity of candidates and to in clude more students  specializing in Informatics and AI (creation of a d ouble curriculum,  recognition of equivalents), and secondly to put an  end to the system of  competition throughout the university curriculum, w hich is counterproductive in developing transdisciplinary coordina tion and shapes the  imbalance in authority relations between doctor and  patient;   - Health professionals should be trained in the uses of artificial intelligence,  of the IoT, and of big data in health, and should b e taught skills in  coordinating, empathizing, and relating to patients  (e.g. virtual experience to  help them better see and understand the lives of pa tients). This  transformation in initial training could take place  within the ongoing reform  of the undergraduate and graduate programs in medic ine being undertaken  by the Conférence des Doyens des Universités de médecine . It could give  rise to changes to the DPF;   - The medical liability of health professionals in th e use of artificial  intelligence technologies should be clarified: at p resent, a doctor may be  held medically liable because of a mistake or becau se of an ethical violation  (generally conceived as a violation of the obligati on to inform patients and of  the patient’s right to give informed consent for a medical act). As long as the 
69 algorithm or robot is not recognized as an autonomo us legal entity, it would  be possible to hold the doctor liable for the use o f programs, algorithms, and  artificial intelligence systems, unless there is a defect in the construction of  the machine.   Establishment of a health system  platform designed for AI -related uses    - A platform should be created where data relevant to  health research and  innovation can be accessed and shared (initially en compassing medicoadministrative data, then genomic, clinical, hospit al data, etc.), with the  ultimate aim of replacing the Système National des Données de Santé  (SNDS — National Health data System). As with the S NDS, the state would  be responsible for organizing access to the system on the basis of a number  of criteria, such as the nature of the entity, the purpose of the project, and  its nature (research, marketing of a service, etc.) . It should however be  noted that a change of scale in terms of human and financial resources is  needed to organize this access efficiently and to e nsure that such a system  is effectively used and contributes to innovation. The Institut national de la  santé et de la recherche médicale  (INSERM — National Institute of Health  and Medical Research), which has particular respons ibility for ensuring that  data are made available to the research community, must be resourced to  perform this gatekeeping role and to tackle demand that is certain to  explode;   - Fluid procedures should be put in place for access to this platform in order  to develop new AI-based approaches, while closely m anaging access to the  information contained in the system for this purpos e. A one-stop shop — in  the form of a single online application form — coul d be created to handle  requests to conduct experiments. There should be a guarantee that  applications will be processed within three months,  along with a “silence  means consent” principle. In the event of a disagre ement between the  regulatory authorities and economic players on deci sions concerning access  to the sandbox, the possibility of appeal to an ind ependent mediator could  be guaranteed;   - A clear system should be developed for access to ho spital databases  (Hospital as a Platform): hospitals inherit, hold, or build their own databases  of molecules and clinical notes. It would be benefi cial to encourage  hospitals to organize “data science bowls” or chall enges around datasets  (cf. National Cancer Institute), collaborative proj ects (e.g. the USA’s  “national patient-centered clinical research networ k ” — PCORnet). Some  services (such as training AI systems on hospital d atabases) could possibly  be monetized;  
70   - The data collected by the platform should extend be yond the medicoadministrative domain: data from the France Médecine Génomique plan,  data from the big national cohorts, clinical and ho spital data. The data and  systems will need to be interoperable (from hospita ls through to the SNDS),  a project that could be linked with the development  of a technical  architecture for the Shared Medical File that is co mpatible with research  and innovation uses.   Regulation of healthcare innovation in the AI age    - New procedures should be tested for qualifying and certifying algorithms  intended for use in a medical context, like the FDA  Pre-cert program  launched in July 2017 by the Food and Drug Administ ration in the US;   - The framework of ideas and debate on bioethics shou ld be expanded to  include issues linked with AI in healthcare and to develop citizen  consultation methods that are more regular and more  in sync with the pace  of innovation.          
71 Appendix 4 Recommendations  of the Conseil national de  l’Ordre des médecins      1.  Technologies should be the servants of the individu al and society.  “A  person and a society that are free and not subjugat ed to the technology  giants ”: this fundamental ethical principle needs to be r easserted at a time  when dystopia is and utopias of the most extreme ki nd are a subject of  much media hype. The Order recommends that substant ive legal rules be  established to protect this fundamental ethical pri nciple.   2.  These protective legal rules should be internationa l in scope. France and  political Europe should make this one of their main  objectives.  Technologies exist to serve a societal purpose that  reaffirms the essential  features of our humanity.   3.  It is imperative that the progress anticipated from  artificial intelligence  technologies, big data, and robotics, should be of benefit to all and should  not exacerbate social, socio-economic, or cultural divisions. Our society, in  its democratic and republican organization, must en sure in particular that  the progress that these technologies bring in the i dentification and  understanding of disease and disease risks, should not undermine our  solidarity-based model of social protection, but sh ould contribute to  reducing inequalities and the risks of exclusion.   4.  In healthcare, technologies should first be used to  improve the capacities  of doctors and care teams to understand and treat d iseases and  epidemics better, to support the principle of the a utonomy of the  individual, to “heal sometimes, relieve often, console always” those who  are sick, fragile, dependent.43  CNOM recommends that technologies  should not be developed and used with the aim of re placing shared  decision-making between doctor and patient, which r emains a personal  undertaking.   5.  CNOM also recommends that the strengths of these te chnologies should  be extensively exploited in all fields of preventio n, both primary and  secondary, to the benefit of the individual and for  the preservation and  maintenance of the individual’s autonomy.      6.  The changes to come are set to be as profound as th ose that followed the  invention of writing, then of printing. This requir es an effort of education                                                    43  Louis Pasteur  
72   and information, and a widening of the public debat e. The debate on the  impact of artificial intelligence technologies and big data is not a matter for  experts, but concerns all of us. CNOM recommends th at the government  should organize this public debate, as this is the only way to guide  parliamentary deliberations, whether at national or  European level.   Ignorance is the first enemy to be fought, since it  can leave the door open  to the merchants of pseudo-techno-scientific illusi ons to dupe the overcredulous. The Order therefore recommends that the government should  support the emergence of the free public health inf ormation service  provided for by law, combining the outputs of scien tific organizations and  the free critical expression of “patient empowermen t” and medical blogs,  as an expression of healthcare democracy, within th e framework of an  editorial charter developed with all stakeholders.   7.  The Order recommends that care should be taken that  a sort of  technological determinism does not lead to a state of apparent passivity in  which society feels powerless to have its preoccupa tions heard. It stresses  the fact that social or professional concerns that have gone unexpressed,  unheard, or inadequately answered, could lead to vi olent opposition to  changes that are too radical, too sudden, imposed, and poorly explained.   8.  CNOM recommends that users, patients, doctors, and other health  professionals should become involved in the world o f data and algorithms,  without paralyzing fear or dogmatic enthusiasm. It is by participating in and  even contributing to the design and development of intelligent objects and  devices with the capacity to meet their needs, that  they will be able to give  useful guidance to the industrial world rather than  allowing market forces  to dominate. To these ends, the professional medica l and scientific  organizations and representative bodies should supp ort the aspiration for  a digital healthcare economy in France.   9.  Under the government backed National Health Strateg y, CNOM  recommends that the development of technical device s that employ  artificial intelligence should be encouraged to mov e in the direction of an  industrial market for decision support in medicine,  rather than algorithms  that dictate decisions to both doctor and patient, without the option of  critique or  contravention. CNOM recommends that the government should  support these priorities for the development of the  digital economy in  healthcare, in particular by activating the potenti al for consultation  represented by the recently established Conseil stratégique du numérique  en santé  (Strategic Council for Digital Technology in Healt hcare).  
73 10.  Parliamentary studies and think tanks are prolifera ting,44  for good reason,  with the primary goal of contributing to government  action. The Order is  playing its part and stresses the importance of tra nsparent information  and a wide range of ethical analyses, focusing on t he health of individuals,  on the practical needs of users of the healthcare s ystem and of  professionals, in all their dimensions: medical, me dico-social, but also  human and social. This White Paper represents a fir st step in awareness  raising that CNOM would like to see extended throug h public debate.   11.  CNOM asks that the technological tools used by both  health professionals  and patients be reliable, intuitive, and regularly updated by their  developers, and that the data they collect and proc ess should be protected  from any intrusion. It recommends that a public lab el be introduced to  offer patients and doctors these guarantees.   12.  CNOM recommends the promotion of text mining resear ch so that  observations and notes can be described simply, and  Artificial Intelligence  can be used for the purpose of evaluating, measurin g, and producing  indicators for practice. Similarly, this should be facilitated by devices able  to interface with other information systems without  the need for coding.   13.  CNOM recommends that HAS and the scientific organiz ations should  produce their recommendations in structured formats , and in French, so  that software publishers can incorporate them direc tly into the intelligent  tools that they develop as decision support systems . CNOM also  recommends that the government should promote seman tic  interoperability, by providing standard reference t erminologies in the  health and social sector.   14.  Initial training and continuing professional develo pment play a crucial role  in the anticipation of and progress towards a “medi cine of the future”.  CNOM considers it essential to begin as of now to t rain doctors for the  world in which they will practice, where technologi es — alongside clinical  practice — will play a big role.  15.  CNOM also recommends that in the initial training s yllabus, as well as  subsequently in continuing professional development , simulation using  interactive digital methods should be more widely a dopted as a way of  learning to deal with situations, to practice techn ical skills, or to conduct  an investigation.                                                     44  C. De Ganay and D. Gillot (2017). Pour une intelli gence artificielle maîtrisée, utile et  démystifiée.   Les Rapports de l’OPECST, Assemblée nationale, Séna t, 273 p.   
74   16.  Universities in general and medical faculties in pa rticular should  incorporate training in digital technology into the ir teaching programs, with  extensive emphasis on a crosscutting syllabus cover ing mathematics,  physics, computer sciences, medicine, and the human ities.   17.  CNOM recommends that, in making demographic decisio ns about the  training of different medical specialists in univer sity faculties, and about  the content of those training programs, the foresee able changes in  professional disciplines should be taken into accou nt. This concerns not  only new jobs, delegated practices, and advanced pr actices, but also the  tasks that may — within the next 5 to 10 years — be  performed by systems  that incorporate Artificial Intelligence. This proc ess of reflection needs to  be undertaken quickly. CNOM also recommends that tr aining for the health  professions should include programs for “Data Scien tists” and doctors  trained in a dual syllabus of medicine and engineer ing.   18.  Medical professions are likely to change, and knowl edge and skills to  become obsolete, at a much faster rate than in the past. This makes it  essential to organize lifelong learning without a b reak between initial  training and continuing professional development. I t also demands better  connection and the elimination of partitions betwee n disciplines. In a world  that is becoming increasingly technical and technol ogical, greater  educational emphasis is needed on ethical questions , on human relations,  on professional ethics. This adaptation has already  been undertaken in  concert, in their respective fields of expertise, b y the Conférence des  doyens de médecine  and the Conseil national de l’Ordre des médecins ,  with the inclusion of the professional national cou ncils of the training  specialties and organizations. The development of t he Université  Numérique pour l’Enseignement de la Santé et du Spo rt (UNESS) is one  aspect of this process. Efforts need to be made by all the actors and the  entire ecosystem to promote the emergence of a genu ine community of  digital literati. CNOM recommends that the governme nt should support  these orientations.   19.  It should be emphasized that in the world of data, of robots, and of  Artificial Intelligence, human intelligence and mac hine intelligence are  complementary, not antagonistic. CNOM recommends th e development of  research that anticipates the potential impact of t echnologies in the  ethical, social, and legal spheres, the promotion o f “ethics by design”,  similar to the contemporary model of “privacy by de sign”.      20.  It also recommends encouraging research into and im plementation of  systems for evaluating, monitoring, and tracing alg orithm-based methods 
75 and models, and particularly machine learning syste ms, used in  healthcare.      21.  It undertakes to examine the system of legal liabil ity: the liability of doctors  in their use of decision support tools, and the lia bility of the algorithm  designers with regard to the reliability of the dat a used and the methods of  computer processing employed.      22.  At the same time, CNOM recommends that the differen t healthcare actors  (hospitals, doctors, researchers, etc.) should be e ducated in the value of  data and in the advantage of maintaining a form of collective control over  them. They should also be aware of the GIGO (garbag e in garbage out)  principle, i.e. that the results of data-processing  depend on the quality of  the initial input data.      23.  The use of big data offers great potential, particu lar for public health. Most  of the Western countries are moving towards a princ iple of “open data”.  France is following this course with the necessary caution, supported by  CNOM through its contributions and its presence in the Institut national  des données de santé  (National Health data Institute). CNOM notes that  the protection of medical confidentiality covering personal health data  should be applied to the processing of big data and  that these data should  not be used in such a way that a person may be iden tified, with a  consequent risk of discrimination. The law has esta blished legal rules on  permissions for access to public databases and on t he handling of the  data they contain. These rules must be consolidated  through transposition  into criminal law with penalties equivalent to thos e applicable in cases of  invasion of privacy or unauthorized access to infor mation systems.      24.  Patients and health professionals whose data are ho sted on servers must  be given a guarantee that if the hosting is done ou tside French national  territory, it will meet the same requirements, in t erms of data security and  availability.   25.  Nonetheless, we think it essential that access to p ublic health databases  should be extended on the basis of a positive visio n of their use, in terms  of the cost-benefit outcomes for our healthcare sys tem, to the advantage  of all citizens. At the same time, CNOM recommends that access  permissions for research purposes should be made pu blic in the event that  there could be a risk of the people whose data they  contain being indirectly  reidentified, and that the results of the research should be published.  
76   26.  However, we observe that citizens disseminate their  personal health data,  in even larger quantities, through the use of diffe rent online applications or  objects. These personal data can be collected on pr ivate databases,  without monitoring or regulation. They could be use d for purposes, in  particular commercial purposes, other than those fo r which the users  intended them. It is possible that citizens are una ware of this, unless they  are unconcerned by it because of the services they receive. The Order  recommends that this subject should be one of the e lements of the public  debate called for above.   27.  Applicable as of May 2018, the European General Dat a Protection  Regulation imposes requirements and potentially pla ces liability on the  person responsible for data-processing .45  This should help raise citizen  awareness about the control of their personal data.  The implementation of  the European Regulation in France is an opportunity  for the government,  and CNIL, to organize the public debate that we wis h to initiate. This  debate should tell us, among other things, how much  citizens wish to  protect their health data, whether they consider th ese data to be a  common good, notably with regard to research, and u p to what limits and  under what conditions. This is what CNOM recommends .   28.  A large number of businesses in the digital world, including in healthcare,  are developing powerful applications and introducin g innovation that is  sometimes disruptive. CNOM takes the view that one should not try to  make laws about everything, or seek to regulate eve rything by ministerial  order. Instead, it recommends that qualified bodies  should produce flexible  legal rules, on the model of the “soft law” of Angl o-Saxon countries.  According to CNOM, this mode of regulation, which i s much more agile in  responding to digital disruption, maintains and sup ports capacity for agile  innovations, while guaranteeing security and the re spect for individual  rights.   29.  Since CNOM is one of the regulatory authorities to which the public and  professionals turn to obtain answers and guarantees  on these subjects, we  are ready to co-construct the necessary recommendat ions in partnership,  among others, with the Haute Autorité de Santé , the Commission  Nationale Informatique et Libertés , the Conseil National du Numérique …   30.  In order to steer future work on recommendations in  the direction of “soft  law”, CNOM also recommends the establishment of a n ational observatory  of artificial intelligence and robotics technologie s in health, to record  results and changes in practices.                                                     45  As def ined by France’s data protection act.  
77 31.  The digital transformation in healthcare, healthcar e organizations, jobs,  and practices, will not take place without the nece ssary digital investments  in all parts of the Republic, i.e. in infrastructur es. The Order notes that  there is still a digital divide, and that in territ orial terms, the expression  “medical deserts” coincides fairly spectacularly wi th other “rights deserts”  — for example the lack of public services — but als o with “digital deserts”,  areas with no access to the web or high-speed Inter net. CNOM  recommends that efforts — particularly investment i n infrastructure —  should be made to equip the entire country with acc ess to high-speed  Internet. The purpose of this is to guarantee equal  rights in the uses of  digital technology. These efforts must be accelerat ed, in particular in  vulnerable areas, in order not to create a digital divide in access to health  innovations and healthcare. Specific attention need s to be paid to the  overseas departments.      32.  Finally, CNOM draws attention to the fact that the data infrastructures, the  collection and operating platforms, constitute a ma jor priority on the  economic and scientific fronts, and in the field of  cybersecurity. The  location of these infrastructures and platforms, th eir operation, their  purposes, and their regulation represent a major is sue of sovereignty,  ensuring that France and Europe are not subjugated in the future to the  supranational digital giants.      Attentive to the respect for the principles of medi cal and professional  ethics on the part of all our members, as well as t he need to contribute to  answering the questions raised by these technologic al changes, the Ordre  national des médecins  undertakes to support the recommendations set  out here with its sister organizations in the other  EU member states and  with the Standing Committee of European Doctors, as  well as with the  general assemblies of the World Medical Association , in order that the  content of those recommendations should be widely d isseminated and  advocated.           
78   Appendix 5 The principal recommendations  of the report on   Growing the Artificial Intelligence Industry in the  UK  by Wendy  Hall and Jérôme Pesenti      Recommendations to improve access to data     1.  To facilitate the sharing of data between organizat ions holding data and  organizations looking to use data to develop AI, Go vernment and  industry should deliver a programme to develop Data  Trusts — proven  and trusted frameworks and agreements — to ensure e xchanges are  secure and mutually beneficial.     2.  To improve the availability of data for developing AI systems,  Government should ensure that public funding for re search explicitly  ensures publication of underlying data in machine-r eadable formats  with clear rights information, and open wherever po ssible.      3.  To support text and data mining as a standard and e ssential tool for  research, the UK should move towards establishing b y default that for  published research the right to read is also the ri ght to mine data.      Re commendations to improve supply of skills     4.  Government, industry and academia must embrace the value and  importance of a diverse workforce for AI, and shoul d work together to  break down stereotypes and broaden participation.      5.  Industry should sponsor a major programme of studen ts to pursue  Masters level courses in AI, with an initial cohort  of 300 students.      6.  Universities should explore with employers and stud ents the potential  demand for one-year conversion Masters degrees in A I for graduates in  subjects other than computing and data science.      7.  Government and universities should create, at a min imum, an  additional 200 PhD places dedicated to AI at leadin g universities. As  the UK trains and attracts additional academic tale nt, this number  should grow continually year on year.     
79 8.  An International fellowship programme for AI in the  UK should be  created in partnership with the Alan Turing Institu te: the Turing AI  Fellowships.      Recommendations to maximise UK AI research      9.  The Alan Turing Institute should become the nationa l institute for  artificial intelligence and data science, becoming truly national and  expanded beyond the current five universities, with  a key stated aim  that centers its mission on artificial intelligence .      10.  Universities should use clear, accessible and where  possible common  policies and practices for licensing IP and forming  spin-out companies.      11.  The Alan Turing Institute, Engineering and Physical  Sciences Research  Council (EPSRC), Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) and  Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) should w ork together to  coordinate demand for computing capacity for AI res earch, and  negotiate for the UK research community.      Recommendations to support uptake of AI     12.  Government should work with industry and experts to  establish a UK AI  Council to help coordinate and grow AI in the UK.      13.  TechUK should work with the Royal Academy of Engine ering, the Digital  Catapult, and key players in industry sectors, to d evelop practical  guidance on the opportunities and challenges of suc cessful adoption of  AI across the UK economy.      14.  Government, drawing on the expertise of the Governm ent Digital  Service, the Data Science Partnership and experts w orking with data in  other Departments, should develop a programme of ac tions to prepare  the public sector and spread best practice for appl ying AI to improve  operations and services for citizens.      15.  Government should ensure that challenges addressed by the Industrial  Strategy Challenge Fund (ISCF) and Small Business R esearch Initiative  (SBRI) are designed to attract and support applicat ions of AI across the  full range of challenge areas and set funded challe nges which use  public sector data for AI. 
80    Appendix 6 The six practical recommendations  by CNIL   concerning the ethics of algorithms      1.  All the players-links in the “algorithmic chain” sh ould receive training in  ethics: designers, professionals, citizens. Literacy training in digital  technology should enable every individual to unders tand the workings of  the machine.      2.  Algorithmic systems should be made comprehensible b y reinforcing  existing rights and by organizing mediation with us ers.       3.  Algorithmic systems should be designed to serve hum an freedom.  In  particular, to counter the “black box” effect.      4.  A national algorithm audit platform should be estab lished. This is essential  to reinforce trust in the healthcare system among a ll parties.      5.  Research on technical solutions should be encourage d in order for France  to become a leader in ethical AI.  Clearly, ethical considerations will need to  be at the heart of initiatives such as the establis hment of a future national  health data hub.      6.  The ethical function within companies should be rei nforced . Ethics are  also a factor of competitiveness, and should be bas ed on the development  of ethics committees, the dissemination of good pra ctices within business  sectors, and the construction or revision of codes of ethics.          
81 Appendix  7 Some international  comparisons of health data  protection practices      Standardization  by the United Nations   - Article 17 of the United Nations International Co venant on Civil and  Political Rights protects only privacy, without men tioning data  protection. However, on December 14, 1990, the Gene ral Assembly of  the UN adopted a resolution setting out certain gen eral principles  regarding computerized personal files.   Specific standardization  in Europe    - Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Right s  states the  necessity of protecting personal data and in partic ular health data.   - The 1981 Convention (called: Convention 108) protec ts the individual  by obliging states that are party to the Convention  to adopt certain  minimum principles of protection in their legislati on concerning the  transmission of data to other states that are party  to the Convention.   - The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European U nion specifically  establishes the protection of personal data in its Article 8.   - Directive 95 /46/CE , adopted before the Charter, deals with data  protection and sets out the main principles applica ble within the  European Union.46                                                      46  Switzerland has adopted these principles in its le gislation. With regard to personal data, the  drive for standardization comes from the EU. A Dire ctive 95/46 CE concerning the protection  of natural persons with respect to the handling of personal data and the free movement of  these data was until recently the common foundation  for the member states. It’s aim was  notably to produce a uniform definition for the not ion of sensitive data.       “The transposition of Directive 95/46/CE has the eff ect o f creating an almost entirely  uniform legal framework for sensitive data.        Directive 95/46/CE defines sensitive data and prohi bits “the processing of personal data  revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinio ns, religious or philosophical beliefs, tradeunion membership, and the processing of data concer ning health or sex life.” This prohibition  on all processing contains a few exceptions, among which are the explicit consent of the  interested party and authorisation by law, by regul ation, or by the supervising authority. With  the exception of the German law of 1977, which igno res the notion of sensitive data, all  legislation currently in force provides similar gua rantees, very close to those contained  in the Directive.      It should nevertheless be noted that the Spanish law of 1992 distinguishes between two  groups of sensitive data : those that, under the Constitution , which states that “nobody may  be obliged to declare their ideology, their religio n, and their beliefs,”, receive maximum 
82   - The GDPR provides a new formulation of data protect ion principles: the  processing of personal data must be fair and transp arent in respect of  the people concerned, which implies 5 principles: 1 . Principle of  purpose limitation; 2. Principle of data minimizati on; 3. Principle of  accuracy; 4. Principle of storage limitations; 5. P rinciple of integrity and  confidentiality.   Article 9 of the GDPR introduces two new categories  of sensitive data:   - Biometric data;   - Genetic data.     The GDPR defines health data as data relating to th e physical or mental health  of a natural person, including the provision of hea lthcare services that reveal  information on that person’s health status.   Specific standardization  in France   In legislative terms, the protection of health data  in the form of privacy  protection is governed equally by:   - Article 9 of the Civil Code: “Everyone has the right to respect for his  private life”    - The Public Health Code: Article 1110-4 (act of Marc h 22, 2004)   - The act of August 6, 2004, which transposes the 199 5 Directive                      - The Data Protection Act of January 6, 1978   - The bioethics acts   From a constitutional point of view, the Constituti onal Council has recognized  that health data must be protected under the princi ple of respect for private  life: CC, July 23, 1999, Loi portant création d’une couverture maladie  universelle , n° 99416 DC, pt. 45: it is not irrelevant to poin t out that the first  constitutional decision that includes health data a mongst data for which                                                                                                                                          protection , and those that receive intermediate protection . The processing of data in the first  group requires the express and written consent of t he interested party under all  circumstances, whereas those in the second group fo llow the general rules of the Directive.  The draft bill maintains this distinction.    The  UK Data Protection Act of 1984 did not explici tly define the notion of sensitive data. It  only stated that the Home Secretary could take regu latory measures concerning certain  groups of data (racial origin, political opinions, health…), but this power was never exercised.  It is therefore because of the transposition of Dir ective 95/46/CE that the notion of sensitive  data was introduced into British law.”    (https://www.senat.fr/lc/lc62/lc620.html)   Given the wide disparities between the legislations  of the member states, the EU initiated a  reinforcement of harmonisation through the GDPR, wh ich therefore repeals Directive  95/46/CE. 
83 disclosure may infringe privacy is also the first d ecision that links respect for  privacy with Article 2 of the Declaration of the Ri ghts of Man and of the  Citizen.   The protection of personal data in the United State s   The conception of personal data protection in the U nited States is very  different. This difference arises first of all from  the organization of the  American legal system itself. Indeed, the Fourth Am endment of the US  Constitution guarantees a right to privacy, but onl y from government.   This amendment gave rise to a first piece of legisl ation in 1973, the Privacy  Act . This law established rules for the processing of personal data collected by  the different branches of Government. It therefore only relates to  infringements of the privacy of citizens by the Gov ernment. The other  infringements of privacy and of personal data prote ction fall under the  jurisdiction of each State and its Courts, on the b asis of a 1965 ruling by the  Supreme Court.47    The Privacy Act  applies the “FIPs” (Fair Information Practices) de veloped by  the US Health Department in 1973.48  By contrast with European law, which  encompasses European data protection rules within a  single text, American  legislation is applied per business sector or categ ory of individuals. For  example, for our purposes: the “ Health Insurance Portability and  Accountability Act” 49  relates to medical confidentiality, the “ Children’s Online  Privacy Protection Act” 50  restricts the use of information collected by webs ites  from children under the age of 13.   Finally, in addition to these Federal laws, each of  the US States has adopted  laws designed to protect certain aspects of the pri vacy of their citizens: that is  the Common Law of each of the States.    There is therefore no general right to the protecti on of personal data in  American law. Beyond the sectoral nature of the reg ulations and the variation  in the level of protection from one State to anothe r, it is the consumer rather  than fundamental individual rights that American la w seeks to protect.                                                     47  Griswold c/ Connecticut , 381 U.S. 479 (1965)    48  The FIPs subsequently formed the foundation of Con vention 108 of the Council of Europe,  the OECD 1980 recommendations, and European Directi ve 95/46/CE.    49  Promulgated in 1996   50  Promulgated in 1998 and amended in 2013 in order t o clarify certain provisions, such as  those relating to children’s personal data.    
84   Appendix 8 Five keys for substantive  regulation of the spread  of AI and robotics in health care  / Ethik IA  — March 2018      Key 1: Patient information and co nsent    Patients should be informed in advance when an arti ficial intelligence device  is to be used in their healthcare program. The arti ficial intelligence device  must not override the need to obtain patient consen t. Specific procedures —  such as the availability of a trusted person, or ar rangements for obtaining  advance consent for a set of treatment options, or stronger protective  arrangements for vulnerable people — should, where needed, be developed to  guarantee that consent is genuinely obtained.   Key 2: Human Warranty of AI   The principle of a Human Warranty of digital system s in healthcare must be  followed. This guarantee should be provided firstly  by regular procedures —  both targeted and random — to verify the treatment options proposed by the  digital system and, secondly, by arrangements for a  second human medical  opinion to be sought at the request of a patient or  a health professional. This  second opinion could, where appropriate, be obtaine d through telemedicine  procedures.   Key 3: Gradations of regulation depending on the degree of sensitivity o f  the health data    There should be graduated regulation of the use of an artificial intelligence  system for the mass processing of health data accor ding to the degree of  sensitivity of these data with respect to the princ iples of bioethics law.  Standards of good practice can be developed for the  application of this  principle in specific healthcare contexts.    Key 4: Supporting adjustment in the  healthcare professions    The implementation of an artificial intelligence or  robotics system in  healthcare should not result in a failure to apply ethical principles and rules in  the practices of the health professions that use su ch systems. The effects of  the use of an artificial intelligence or robotics s ystem on the conditions of such  practices should, as far as possible, be prepared f or and anticipated. Part of  the efficiency gains achieved by the implementation  of artificial intelligence  and robotics in healthcare should be used to financ e this process of 
85 preparation and anticipation, for the initial train ing and continuing  professional development of professionals on the is sues around artificial  intelligence and robotics, and to support the emerg ence of new professions in  the health and medico-social fields.   Key 5 : Involvement of independent outside supervision    There should be independent outside supervision of the provisions made in  order to ensure that these principles are followed.  The authority responsible  for ensuring that this outside supervision is effec tively exercised should  undertake regular evaluations to assess the effects  of the implementation of  artificial intelligence and robotics in healthcare.  This authority should support  research on the regulation of the use of artificial  intelligence and robotics in  healthcare.

91 Appendix 1 0 Letter of acknowledgement               November 16, 2018      THE PRESIDENT      For the attention of Claude KIRCHNER and David GRUS ON   Joint heads of the taskforce on digital ethics and health    Dear colleagues,      At the end of March 2018, within the framework of t he National Consultation on  Bioethics, we entrusted you with the mission of hea ding a taskforce on the theme of  digital technology in healthcare in order to provid e input to CCNE on this issue. You  submitted a preliminary report to CCNE on July 5 an d 10, then on November 8 to  CCNE’s technical section, which came back to you wi th a number of comments and  ideas.      Following the final presentation of the report on d igital ethics in health, I wanted — on  behalf of the Committee — to thank you for the work  you have done to fulfil the terms  of reference of the engagement letter sent to you o n March 22 last year. I would be  grateful if you would pass on our thanks to all the  members of the taskforce, as well  as to the different experts you interviewed.      In its position paper published on September 25 las t year (position paper 129), CCNE  was able to incorporate most of the recommendations  arising from your work. Your  proposals provided valuable input into that positio n paper and opened new avenues  for exploration, such as your observation that insu fficient use of digital technology in  our healthcare system would itself be unethical, or  regarding the desirability of  introducing the principle of a Human Warranty of ar tificial intelligence in the next  Bioethics Act. However, CCNE also wished to pursue your initial observations further  by reinforcing the notion of the risk faced by peop le who lack access to digital tools,  further increasing the fragility of already vulnera ble individuals as well as of older  people.      One of your proposals concerned the possibility of a broader role for CCNE as a digital  ethics committee. On this specific point, in its po sition paper 129, CCNE preferred to  
92   propose that any intervention on its part should ta ke place within the framework of  assistance in the preparing the ground for an ethic s committee specialising in digital  matters. However, with regard to the ethical challe nges of digital technology in health,  it is essential that CCNE’s competencies and organi zation should enable it to handle  referrals on these topics, where necessary in partn ership with specific ethics  committees in this domain.      Your report also outlined further prospects, beyond  the horizon of the upcoming  revision of the Bioethics Act. That is one of the r easons why the Committee wished to  see your contribution published in order to feed in to the debate on these questions,  fundamental as they are to the future of our health care system. The symposium being  held on this theme, on November 19, 2018, in partne rship with CERNA and the  Imagine Institute, will be an opportunity to present the fi nal version of this report.
