6  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    Executive Summary   The question of technological unemployment – namely whether technological change has  the potential to cause massive job losses with robots making workers redund ant – has been  under intense scrutiny during recent years. Automation, which is an essential part of the  wider “Industry 4.0” concept and the Next Production Revolution, has the aim of enabling  production processes and procedures requiring minimal human in tervention through use of  technologies such as robotics. In turn, the field of robotics has in recent decades leveraged  on a number of breakthroughs in related technological fields, such as Artificial Intelligence  (AI) and the so -called Internet of Things (IoT), increasingly acquiring the connotation of a  pervasive technology.   This work aims to inform the discussion about developments in robotics substituting  workers or otherwise complementing human activities. To this end, we implement a natural  language a pproach to detect discussions of labour -saving (LS) intentions, effects or  outcomes of specific inventive efforts, with the latter proxied by patented technologies. To  this end, we exploit the full text of patents published by the European Patent Office be tween  1978 and 2019, and we link patent data to firm -level data from ORBIS®, to characterise  the leading actors in the robotics space and their LS innovations. Again, using a natural  language processing approach, we estimate a similarity measure associatin g different LS  patents to one or more occupations, based on the description contained in the 2008  International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO -08). This allows us to identify  the occupations that are more likely to be affected by LS developme nts. We further contrast  this with data about employment levels by occupation over time, for a set of 31 OECD  countries over the period 2011 -19.  The main findings of the analysis and their implications for policymaking are:    Despite the number of robotics patents steadily increasing since 1978, and at an  especially fast pace in the last decade, the share of labour -saving patents has been  quite stable over time, confirming that labour -saving goals behind technological  innovation are not a new phenomenon, but  rather a quite established one.    Only about a quarter of all labour -saving patents published by the EPO are filed by  firms located in European countries or in other members of the European Patent  Convention (EPC). The remaining three quarters are evenly di stributed between  Japan, the United States, and other non -EPC countries, respectively.    Overall, traditional robotics competence centres, such as Japan, the United States,  and Italy, dominate the picture, although a few emerging economies are also  present,  such as the People’s Republic of China ( hereafter  “China”), India, Turkey,  and Brazil.    Robot manufacturers, especially from Japan, account for most labour -saving  product innovations. However, labour -saving goals are found to emerge in many  industries, inc luding aerospace, mining, and retail. Also, food processing patents  incorporate labour -saving robotics technology (i.e. a process innovation), which  could lead to employment disruption once implemented.    To the extent  that labour -saving innovations are implemented in  firms’  production  processes, the o ccupations  most exposed to them  would  include not only low skilled and blue -collar jobs (e.g. vehicle drivers and cleaners), but also highly  cognitive and specialised professions (e.g. system analysts and applic ation 
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   7   © OECD 202 2    programmers). While labour displacement of these occupations may occur in the  future, a preliminary analysis does not find any evidence of such displacements  when looking at employment shares in selected OECD countries over the past  decade. Further r esearch to econometrically investigate the relationship between  labour -saving technological developments and employment would be helpful.   Overall, our findings point to the need to have a balanced policy discussion about the  possible threat posed by automation to labour. The analysis for the first time offers evidence  relying on real technological developments as compared to discussions base d on the  hypothetical automatability of different tasks and occupation. Results suggest that labour  saving developments happen in a context of stable employment levels of the same   occupations , which  these labour -saving  technologies have the potential to of fset. This  points to the existence of mechanisms, such as increased demand, triggered by lower prices  as automation unfolds, or supply diversification  strategies leading to more and diverse  goods and services being produced , that may compensate for the job s possibly lost due to  development and adoption of these labour -saving  technologies.     
8  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    Résumé   La question du chômage technologique – autrement dit si le changement technologique a  le potentiel de provoquer des pertes d'emplois massives au moyen de robots r endant les  travailleurs redondants - a fait l'objet d'un examen minutieux ces dernières années.  L'automatisation, qui est une partie essentielle du concept plus large d’ «Industrie 4.0» et  de la prochaine révolution de la production, a pour objectif de fav oriser des processus et  des procédures de production nécessitant une intervention humaine minimale grâce à  l'utilisation de technologies telles que la robotique. À son tour, le domaine de la robotique  a exploité au cours des dernières décennies un certain nombre de percées dans des domaines  technologiques connexes, tels que l'intelligence artificielle (IA) et le soi -disant Internet des  objets (IoT), gagnant de plus en plus la réputation d'une technologie omniprésente.   Ce travail vise à éclairer la discussio n sur les développements de la robotique remplaçant  les travailleurs ou complétant autrement les activités humaines. À cette fin, nous mettons  en œuvre une approche en langage naturel pour détecter les discussions sur les intentions,  les effets ou les résu ltats d'efforts inventifs spécifiques en matière d'économie de main d'œuvre (EMO), ces derniers étant représentés par des technologies brevetées. Pour cela,  nous exploitons le texte intégral des brevets publiés par l'Office Européen des Brevets entre  1978 et 2019, et nous relions les données de brevets aux données de niveau entreprise  d'ORBIS®, pour caractériser les principaux acteurs de l'espace robotique et leurs  innovations en EMO. Encore une fois, en utilisant une approche de traitement du langage  natur el, nous estimons une mesure de similitude associant différents brevets EMO à une ou  plusieurs professions, sur la base de la description contenue dans la Classification  internationale type des professions de 2008 (CITP08). Cela nous permet d'identifier le s  professions les plus susceptibles d'être affectées par les développements de l’EMO. Nous  comparons encore cela avec les données sur les niveaux d'emploi par profession au fil du  temps, pour un ensemble de 31 pays de l'OCDE sur la période 2011 -19.  Les pri ncipales conclusions de l'analyse et leurs implications pour l'élaboration des  politiques sont les suivantes:    Malgré un nombre de brevets de robotique en constante a ugmentation depuis 1978,  et cela  à un rythme particulièrement rapide au cours de la dernièr e décennie, la part  des brevets permettant d'économiser de la main -d'œuvre est restée assez stable dans  le temps, confirmant que les objectifs d'économie de main -d'œuvre derrière  l'innovation technologique ne sont pas un phénomène nouveau mais plutôt bien  établi.    Seul un quart environ de tous les brevets permettant d'économiser du travail publiés  par l'OEB sont déposés par des entreprises situées dans des pays européens ou dans  d'autres pays membres de la Convention sur le brevet européen (CBE). Les trois  quarts restants sont répartis également entre le Japon, les États -Unis et d'autres pays  non-CBE, respectivement.    Dans l'ensemble, les centres traditionnels de compétences en robotique, tels que le  Japon, les États Unis et l'Italie, dominent le tableau, bien  que quelques économies  émergentes soient également présentes, comme la  République populaire de Chine   (ci-après dénommée “ Chine ”), l'Inde, la Turquie et le Brésil.    Les fabricants de robots, en particulier au Japon, sont à l'origine de la plupart des  innova tions de produits permettant d’économiser du travail. Cependant, des  objectifs d'économie de main -d'œuvre sont susceptibles d’apparaitre dans de 
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   9   © OECD 202 2    nombreuses industries, notamment l'aérospatiale, l’extraction minière et la vente au  détail. En outre, des brev ets de transformation des aliments intègrent une  technologie robotique permettant d'économiser du travail (c'est -à-dire une  innovation de procédé), ce qui pourrait entraîner une rupture de l'emploi une fois  mise en œuvre.    Dans la mesure où les innovations en EMO sont intégrées dans les processus de  production des entreprises, les professions les plus exposées couvrent non  seulement les emplois peu qualifiés et les cols bleus (par exemple les conducteurs  de véhicules et les aides de ménage), mais également l es professions hautement  cognitives et spécialisées (par exemple les analystes de systèmes et les  programmeurs d'applications). Bien que le déplacement de la main -d'œuvre  employée dans ces professions puisse se produire à l'avenir, une analyse  préliminaire  des parts d'emploi ne révèle pas de tels déplacements au cours de la  dernière décennie  pour les pays de l'OCDE étudiés.  Il serait utile de poursuivre les  recherches par une analyse économétrique de la relation entre le développement  des technologies peu intensives en main -d'œuvre et l'emploi.   Dans l'ensemble, nos résultats soulignent la nécessité d'avoir une discussion politique  équilibrée sur la menace potentielle posée pour l’emploi par l'automatisation du travail.  L'analyse offre pour la première fois des preuves reposant sur des développements  technologiques réels par rapport à des débats basés sur une hypothétique automatisation de  différentes tâches et professions. Les résultats suggèrent que l'évolution des économies de  main -d'œuvre se produit dans un contexte de niveaux d'emploi stables pour les mêmes  professions que ces technologies liées à l’économie de main -d’œuvre pourraient  compenser. Cela indique l'existence de mécanismes, tels qu'une demande accrue,  déclenchée par des prix plus bas à mesure q ue l'automatisation se développe, ou des  stratégies de diversification de l'offre conduisant à la production de biens et de services  plus nombreux et diversifiés, qui peuvent compenser les emplois éventuellement perdus en  raison du développement et de l'ad option de ces technologies permettant des économies de  main -d’œuvre.       
10  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    Zusammenfassung   Die Frage der technologischen Arbeitslosigkeit - nämlich ob der technologische Wandel  das Potenzial hat, massive Arbeitsplatzverluste durch Roboter zu verursachen, die  Arbeitnehmer überflüssig machen - wurde in den letzten Jahren intensiv untersucht. Die  Automatisierung ist ein wesentlicher Bestandteil des umfassenderen Konzepts "Industrie  4.0" und der nächsten Produktionsrevolution. Sie versucht, durch den Einsatz von  Technologien wie der Robotik Produktionsprozesse und -verfahren zu ermöglichen, die nur  minimale menschliche Eingriffe erfordern. Eine Reihe von Durchbrüchen in verwandten  Technologiebereichen wie der künstlichen Intelligenz (KI) und dem sogenannten Interne t  der Dinge (Internet of Things, IoT) in den letzten Jahrzehnten haben dem Bereich der  Robotik genutzt, sodass er zunehmend den Ruf einer allgegenw ärtigen Technologie erlangt  hat.  Diese Arbeit zielt darauf ab, die Diskussion über Entwicklungen in der Robot ik, die  Arbeiter ersetzen oder anderweitig menschliche Tätigkeiten ergänzen, anzuregen. Zu  diesem Zweck implementieren wir einen natürlichsprachlichen Ansatz, um Diskussionen  über arbeitssparende (AS) Absichten, Auswirkungen oder Ergebnisse spezifischer  Erfindungen, repräsentiert durch patentierte Technologien, zu erkennen. Dazu werden  Daten aus Originaltexten von Patenten, die von der Europäischen Patentorganisation (EPO)  zwischen 1978 und 2019 veröffentlicht wurden, mit Daten auf Firmenebene aus ORBIS®  verknüpft, um die führenden Akteure im Bereich Robotik und ihre AS Innovationen zu  charakterisieren. Unter erneuter Verwendung natürlicher Sprachverarbeitung wird ein  Schätzwert für ein Ähnlichkeitsmaß errechnet, das verschiedene AS Patente einem oder  mehrer en Berufen laut Beschreibung der Internationalen Standardklassifikation der Berufe  2008 (ISCO -08) zuordnet. Diese Resultate ermöglichen es uns, die Berufe zu identifizieren,  die am ehesten von AS Entwicklungen betroffen sein werden. Ferner vergleichen wir sie  mit Daten über die Beschäftigungsniveaus in den einzelnen Berufsgruppen für 31 OECD Länder im Zeitraum 2011 -19.  Die wichtigsten Ergebnisse der Analyse und ihre Implikationen für die Politikgestaltung  sind:    Obwohl die Zahl der Robotikpatente seit 1978 stetig und im letzten Jahrzehnt  besonders schnell zugenommen hat, ist der Anteil der AS Patente im Laufe der Zeit  recht stabil geblieben. Diese Tatsache bestätigt, dass AS Ziele hinter  technologischen Innovationen kein neues Phänomen sind, sondern ein rech t  etabliertes.    Nur etwa ein Viertel aller von der EPO veröffentlichten AS Patente werden von  Unternehmen mit Sitz in europäischen oder anderen Ländern des Europäischen  Patentübereinkommens (EPÜ) angemeldet. Die restlichen drei Viertel verteilen  sich jeweil s zu gleichen Teilen auf Japan, die USA und andere Nicht -EPÜ -Länder.    Insgesamt dominieren die traditionellen Robotik -Kompetenzzentren wie Japan, die  USA und Italien das Bild, obwohl auch einige Schwellenländer wie die  Volksrepublik China (nach stehend  “China”), Indien, die Türkei und Brasilien  vertreten sind.    Die meisten AS Produktinnovationen kommen von Roboterherstellern,  insbesondere aus Japan. Allerdings werden AS Ziele in vielen Branchen  beobachtet, darunter Luft - und Raumfahrt, Bergbau und Einzelhand el. Auch  Patente in der Lebensmittelverarbeitung beinhalten entsprechende 
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   11   © OECD 202 2    Robotertechnologie (i.S. einer Prozessinnovation). Diese könnte nach ihrer  Einführung zu einer Unterbrechung der Beschäftigung führen.    In dem Maße, in dem AS Innovationen in die Prod uktions sprozesse der  Unternehmen integriert  werden , umfassen  die am stärksten davon betroffen en  Berufe  nicht nur gering qualifizierte und gewerbliche Tätigkeiten (z. B.  Fahrzeugführer und Reinigungskräfte), sondern auch hoch kognitive und  spezialisierte Be rufe (z. B. Systemanalytiker und Anwendungsprogrammierer).   Obwohl es in Zukunft zu einer Verdrängung von Arbeitskräften in diesen Berufen  kommen kann, zeigt eine vorläufige Analyse unter Berücksichtigung der  Beschäftigungsanteile in den ausgewählten OECD -Ländern im letzten Jahrzehnt  bisher keine Anzeichen dafür.  Weitere Forschung zur ökonometrischen  Untersuchung der Beziehung zwischen arbeitssparenden technologischen  Entwicklungen und Beschäftigung wären hilfreich.   Insgesamt weisen unsere Ergebnisse auf die Notwendigkeit einer ausgewogenen  politischen Diskussion über die mögliche Bedrohung der  Beschäftigung durch die  Arbeitsautomatisierung hin. Die Analyse bietet zum ersten Mal Fakten, die auf  tatsächlichen technolo gischen Entwicklungen beruhen, im Gegensatz zu Debatten, die auf  der hypothetischen Automatisierbarkeit verschiedener Aufgaben und Berufe basieren. Die  Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass AS Entwicklungen in einem Kontext stabiler  Beschäftigungsniveaus der Berufe stattfinden, die AS Technologien ausgleichen können .  Es scheint Mechanismen zu geben, die möglicherweise verlorene Arbeitsplätze durch die  Entwicklung und Einführung dieser AS Technologien kompensieren können. Dazu  gehören z.B. eine erhöhte Nachfrag e ausgelöst durch niedrigere Preise im Zuge der  Automatisierung oder Strategien für Angebotdiversifizierung, die zur Produktion von mehr  und vielfältigeren Gütern und Dienstleistungen führen.

LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   13   © OECD 202 2    1. Introduction   The question of technological unemployment – namely whether  technological change has  the potential to cause massive job losses with robots making workers redundant – has been  under intense scrutiny during recent years (see e.g. Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019,  2020;  Manyika, Chui and Miremadi, 2017).   “While the foundation of our economic system presumes a strong link between  value creation and job creation, the Great Recession reveals the weakening or  breakage of that link. This is not merely an artifact of the  business cycle but rather  a symptom of a deeper structural change in the nature of production.”   [Brynjolfsson and McAfee, 2011]   “Industrial robots are on the verge of revolutionizing manufacturing. As they  become smarter , faster and cheaper, they’re being  called upon to do more —well  beyond traditional repetitive, onerous or even dangerous tasks such as welding and  materials handling. They’re taking on more “human” capabilities and traits such  as sensing, dexterity, memory, trainability, and object recognit ion. As a result,  they’re taking on more jobs.”  [PwC, 2014]   Automation, which is an essential part of the wider “Industry 4.0” concept1 and of the Next  Production Revolution (OECD, 2017), has the aim of enabling production processes and  procedures requirin g minimal human intervention. The field of robotics, whose initial seeds  date back to the ancient world, has recently leveraged on a number of breakthroughs in  related technological fields, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the so -called Internet  of Things (IoT), increasingly acquiring the connotation of a pervasive technology.   This work aims to inform the discussion about developments in robotics substituting  workers or otherwise complementing human activities. To this end, we implement a natural  language approach to detect the presence of explicit labour -saving (hereafter, LS)  heuristics2 in inventive efforts, as proxied by patented technologies. We exploit the full text  of patents published by the European Patent Office (EPO) between 1978 and 2019,  and we  link patent data to firm -level data from ORBIS® IP (Bureau van Dijk)  to identify and  characterise the leading actors in the robotics space and their LS innovations.   Again, using a natural language processing (NLP) approach3, we estimate a similari ty  measure associating different LS patents to one or more occupations, based on the  occupation description contained in the 2008 International Standard Classification of  Occupations (ISCO -08). This allows us to identify the occupations that are more likel y to  be affected by LS developments, and contrast this with data about employment levels by  occupation over time, for a set of 31 OECD countries over the period 2011 -19.4  The patent -based analysis draws heavily on the methodology developed by Montobbio et  al. (2021, 202 2) and proceeds in a general -to-specific fashion, according to the following  steps. First, all patents relevant to robotics are singled out from the universe of patents filed  at the EPO since its inception in 1978 and up to 31 December 2019. Within the scope of  this paper, robotics is intended in a broad sense, in order to encompass not only core  technological advances in the field, but also closely related enabling technologies and  applications to production processes. Second, patents that ex plicitly mention a LS heuristic  in their full -text are identified by means of a text -mining algorithm, ahead of further manual  validation aimed to remove false positives. Third, LS patents are matched to their current  corporate assignee(s) via the ORBIS® IP database. This allows uncovering the identity of  underlying innovative actors, their geographic location, and their sector of economic 
14  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    activity. Finally, LS patents are mapped to job occupations through a text similarity  algorithm between patents ’ full-text and ISCO -08 4-digit definitions. The similarity score  is then used to rank occupations by relevance to the overall corpus of LS innovations.   We find that, despite the stead y increase in the number of robotics patents observed since  1978, and the especi ally fast pace characterising the last decade, the share of LS patents  has been quite stable over time.   The majority of LS patents published by the EPO are not filed by firms located in European  countries or other members of the European Patent Convention (EPC), but rather by  traditional robotics competence centres located in Japan and the U nited States (US) .  Among patents filed from companies located in EPC countries, Italy has the largest number  of LS patents, with about twice as many patents as Germany, which ranks second.   Robot manufacturers, especially Japanese conglomerates, account for most LS product  innovations, although LS heuristics are found to emerge along the entire supply chain.   To the extent that LS innovations are implemented into firms’ pr oduction processes, among  the occupations most likely to be impacted one would find both low -skilled and blue -collar  jobs (e.g. vehicle drivers and cleaners), along with highly cognitive and specialised  professions (e.g. system analysts and application pro grammers). While labour  displacement of these occupations may occur in the future, a preliminary analysis does not  find an appreciable negative effect on employment shares in selected OECD countries  during the past decade. Further research to econometrical ly investigate the relationship  between labour -saving technological developments and employment would be helpful.   The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides some theoretical  background and reviews the relevant literature. Section 3 describes our data sources and  the workflow of our methodology. Section 4 provides a firm -level characterisation of  innovative actors engaged in LS technologies. Section 5 identifies the occupations more  exposed to LS innovations. Finally, Section 6 summarises the main results of the paper and  concludes.  
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   15   © OECD 202 2    2. Framing the problem in the related literature   In the tradition of the economics of innovation, technologies are studied by means of  identification of paradigms and trajectories (Dosi, 1982, 1997) underlying the introduction,  development, and diffusion of a given a rtefact. A notable question regards the extent to  which the discovery of a given artefact occurs by chance, or it is alternatively driven by  some specific search heuristics  or focussing devices , in the sense of Rosenberg (1976),  namely the ensemble of tech nological bottlenecks, market incentives, and ultimately the  cognitive loci and the behavioural patterns of those engaged in creating these technologies  (Dosi and Nelson, 2010, 2013).   Although it is generally hard to identify invariant and ex -ante search heuristics or  inducement effects, search efforts aimed at the reduction of human inputs in production  appear to be invariant throughout the history of capitalist societies (Dosi, 1988; Rosenberg,  1976; von Tunzelmann, 1995). In what follows, we shed light on whether recent  technological innovations pursue, or are even dominated, by such heuristics.   In our framework, robotics, and indirectly AI (which sees a number of applications in  robotics, see e.g. Baruffaldi et al., 2020), are seen as pervasive general purpose  technologies  (GPTs)5, with massive potential in terms of labour substitution across a wide  range of skills, occupations, and tasks (see Bresnahan and Trajtenberg, 1995; Cockbur n et  al., 2018; Trajtenberg, 2018). Moreover, patents, as loci of explicit codified knowledge, are  generally considered as a good empirical instrument to proxy the rate and direction of  innovative activity (Pavitt, 1985; Griliches, 1990).  Although, in prin ciple, there is no  guarantee that patented innovations  are actually implemented into production processes, it  is worth noting that firms generally incur substantial  R&D and patenting expenses, and  it  is unlikely that they  would do so  unless there is a reas onable expectation to make a profit  out of them (Griliches, 1990).  By looking at the textual contents of robotic patents, we thus  aim at isolating the ones explicitly embedding a labour substituting trait.   As mentioned, our analysis is primarily based on t he methodology developed by  Montobbio et al. (2021, 202 2) which, to the best of our knowledge, constitutes the sole  contribution in the literature aimed at uncovering the presence of explicit LS heuristics  within patents’ full -text and computing a direct  measure of occupational exposure. This  paper extends the contributions of Montobbio et al. (2021, 202 2) by mapping European LS  patents to official occupational definitions and building a rank of occupations exposed to  potential labour displacement.   Contribu tions close to the spirit of the present work include Mann and Püttmann (2018),  which classifies US patents as automation or non -automation related, and links them to the  industries of their use and, through local industry structure, to commuting zones. Ac cording  to their estimates, advances in automation technologies have a positive influence on  employment in local labour markets, as manufacturing employment declines but is more  than compensated by job growth in the service sector.   Dechezleprêtre et al. (2 019) analyse the relationship between higher wages and innovative  activity in automation. They use the frequency of certain keywords in patent texts to  identify automation innovations in machinery and build a firm -level panel combining  macroeconomic data f rom 41 countries and information on geographical patent history to  build firm -specific measures of low -skill and high -skill wages. They find that an increase  in low -skill wages leads to more automation innovation with an elasticity between 2 and 4,  while a n increase in high -skill wages tends to reduce automation innovation.  
16  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    Acemoglu and Restrepo (2020) study the impact of industrial robots on US labour markets,  estimated as variations in exposure to robots, defined from industry -level advances in  robotics a nd local industry employment. They obtain robust negative effects of robots on  employment and wages, with one additional robot per thousand workers reducing the  employment -to-population ratio by 0.2 percentage points and wages by 0.42%.   Frey and Osborne (2 017) use a mix of the Delphi method and a Gaussian process classifier  to assess the probability of computerisation for a set of 702 occupations. According to their  estimates, 47% of total US employment is at high risk of potential automation over some  unsp ecified number of years.   Arntz et al. (2016) estimate the automatability of jobs for 21 OECD countries based on a  task-based approach and find that the threat from technological advances is much less  pronounced compared to the occupation -based approach of Frey and Osborne (2017). Arntz  et al. (2016) find that, overall, 9% of jobs are automatable across OECD countries, extreme  examples being 6% in South Korea and 12% in Austria.   Nedelkoska and Quintini (2018) focus on the risk of automation and its interacti on with  training and the use of skills at work for individual jobs across 32 OECD countries. They  find that close to one in two jobs are likely to be affected by automation, based on the tasks  they involve, and 14% of jobs display a probability of automati on above 70%. These are  especially concentrated in Eastern and Southern European countries, Germany, Chile, and  Japan (the upper extreme being Slovakia with 33% of jobs at high risk of automation),  while jobs in Anglo -Saxon and Nordic countries, and the Ne therlands, appear relatively  less automatable (the lower extreme being Norway with 6%).   Georgieff and Milanez (2021) employ the risk measure of automation of Nedelkoska and  Quintini (2018) to evaluate jobs deemed at high risk of automation and find that, o ver the  period 2012 -2019, employment growth had been in fact substantially lower for jobs at high  risk of automation (6%), compared to jobs at low risk of automation (18%).   Finally, building on Montobbio et al. (202 2), Staccioli and Virgillito (2021a) prov ide  empirical evidence on the history of LS innovations back to the early 19th century, tracking  their time evolution, clustering, eventual emergence of periodic behaviour, and their co movements with long -term GDP growth (see also Staccioli and Virgillito , 2021b).  Santarelli et al. (2021) extend the search to artificial intelligence patents and map the  underlying knowledge base, both as a whole and distinguishing core and related  innovations, along a 4 -level core -periphery architecture.  
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   17   © OECD 202 2    3. Data and methodolog y  Our analysis covers the entire set of 6  109 462 patent applications and grants published by  the European Patent Office (EPO) since its inception in 1978 up to 31 December 2019.  Full-texts have been downloaded from the EPAB platform6, an expert tool desig ned to  monitor European patents, offering advanced query capabilities and full -text search.   Our methodology unfolds along the lines of Montobbio et al. (202 1, 202 2). By means of  textual analysis and natural language processing, we aim at pinpointing a sub set of patents  that relate to robotics technology in a broad sense, and then look for LS heuristics therein.  Next, we match our data with ORBIS® IP (Bureau van Dijk)  firm-level database in order  to characterise the relevant innovators in LS technologies in  terms of industry and  geographic location (see Section 4). Finally, we construct a text similarity measure that  maps LS patents to ISCO -08 occupational definitions ( see Section 5; mathematical  definitions are reported in the Appendix).   In what follows, Section 3.1 shows how we reduce the universe of EPO publications to a  set of robotics -related patents, whereas Section 3.2 identifies patents, within the robotic  subset, which explicitly mention some sort of LS heuristics.   3.1. Robotic patents   We begin with restricting the universe of EPO patents to those published in English, to  avoid biases that could arise from the textual anal ysis of documents written in different  languages.7 In particular, we find 4  382 445 such documents within the EPAB database.   In order to identify the subset of robotics patents, we implement a twofold approach. First,  we leverage patent classification codes known to be relevant to robotics. Montobbio et al.  (2022) construct a list of 124 full -digit CPC (Cooperative Patent Classification) codes  associated with robotic technologies. Here, we adopt an identical scheme, except that  EPAB only allows classifi cation queries for IPC (International Patent Classification) codes.  We make use of the official CPC to IPC concordance table8 to reconcile the approach of  Montobbio et al. (202 2) with our data. The concordance table maps the 124 original CPC  codes into 109  distinct full -digit IPC codes. A patent is deemed “robotic” if it is assigned  at least one of these 109 IPC codes.   Second, we perform a keyword search across all publications, excluding the ones already  identified by the first criterion, in order to pinpo int other inventions which are closely  related or tightly complementary to robotics but were not officially classified as such by  patent examiners. A patent is deemed robotic if it contains the morphological root ‘robot’   repeated at least 7 times across it s abstract, description or claims sections. Given the low  degree of ambiguity, patents exhibiting a copious repetition of this morphological root have  been found to be tightly linked to robotics and its implementation within industrial  manufacturing proces ses. The number 7 was decided based on a sensitivity analysis  assessing the probability of false positive and false negatives obtained using a different  number of repetitions of the same morphological root.9  In total, we find 21  977 robotics patents, 13  852 of which are selected by the first criterion  and labelled ‘IPC’ , and 8  125 selected by the second criterion and labelled ‘K7’ .10 Their  evolution over time is depicted in Figure  1. 
18  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    Figure  1. Number of robotics patents by year     Note: Blue bars denote the absolute number of ‘IPC’ robotics patents, identified through relevant IPC codes.  Orange bars denote  the absolute number of ‘K7’ robotics patent s, identified through multiple occurrences (at  least 7 times) of the keyword ‘robot’  in their full texts. Overall, there exist 21  977 robotics patents, of which  13 852 ‘IPC’ patents and 8  125 ‘K7’ patents.   Source: Authors’ own compilation based on EPO data.   At a first glance, it is apparent that the overall number of robotics patents has steadily  increased over time, reflecting the general surge in patenting activity. Moreover, it is  possible to observe that the number of IPC robotics patents is consist ently greater than the  number of K7 robotic patents, in line with the relative size of the two subsets. This marks a  first difference with respect to USPTO patents studied by Montobbio et al. (202 2), for  which patents selected by the keyword criterion are twice as many as those selected by  classification codes.   A second difference with respect to American patents is given by the frequency of robotic  patents overall. While Montobbio et al. (202 2) find close to 30  000 total robotic patents in  the period from 2009 to 2018, here we find roughly one third less within a much wider time  frame, although, as we have seen, most robotic patents are concentrated in the past decade  (cf. Figure  1).  3.2. Labour -saving patents   Our second methodological challenge lies in the discovery of the set of labour -saving  patents. From the set of robotic patents identified in the previous section, we now want to  single out those explicitly claiming a LS effect of the underlying innovation. We do this by  performing a multiple word  co-occurrence query at the sentence  level, along the lines of  Montobbio et al. (202 2).  We start by pre -processing our textual corpus along the following steps. First, we  subdivid e, technically tokenise , the full text of each robotics patent (a single string  concatenating the abstract, the description, and the claims sections) into a list of  sentences.11 Second, we similarly tokenise each sentence into a list of words. Third, we  filter out a standard set of 182 stop -words, i.e. tokens that are overly common in English  (such as ‘a’, ‘the’ , ‘if’ …) and do not convey any useful information to our analysis.  Last, we reduce each word in each sentence to its morphological root, by means of a  stemming  algorithm.12  This allows us to look for the presence of specific words (actually, morphological roots)  within the whole corpus of robotics patents. We aim at eliciting heuristics, when present,  that the technology described in a patent may someho w reduce human labour requirements  
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   19   © OECD 202 2    if implemented, either in terms of labour cost, worked hours, or the complete substitution  of workers themselves, by automating one or more skills/tasks they previously  applied/performed.   Accordingly, we develop a method ology by which we scour all the identified sentences and  look for the co -occurrence of a certain verbal predicate , a direct object , and an attribute ,  which jointly convey the desired message, within the same sentence.   Figure  2. Structure of the labour -saving textual query     Note: Words in the verbal predicate , direct object , and object attribute  lists undergo the same stemming  procedure as patent full texts. If a patent full text includes one word from each of the three lists within the same  sentence, the patent is marked as potentially  labour -saving and is then manually validated.   Source: Author s’ own compilation.   Figure  2 shows the selected words that we use in our query, which are an augmented  version of those appearing in Montobbio et al. (202 2). First, we d isambiguate ‘labo[u]r’   spelled both with and without the ‘u’ in order to better capture patent documents from  British firms and inventors. Second, we add the stem ‘less’  to the predicate group,  ‘manual’  to the direct object group, and ‘effort’  and ‘interve nt’ to the attributes  group. In practice, we look for the joint occurrence of a triplet of words (which differ from  trigrams, as we do not require word adjacency), one from each set, within the same  sentence, and flag the associated patent as potentially L S if at least one sentence contains  at least one of the (640, given the Cartesian product of the three sets) triplets.   This textual query singles out 1  662 inventions, 858 of which belong to the IPC class and  804 to the K7 class. Since we cannot fully trus t the accuracy of the filter with respect to  false positives, we proceed with a manual inspection of all the potentially  LS patents, in  order to ensure that the flagged sentence actually conveys the desired message. This  conservative manual validation step  delivers 1  545 truly  LS patents (hereafter referred  simply as LS patents), i.e. approximately 7% of all robotic patents, suggesting our  methodology exhibits an accuracy of ≈93%. Of these, 814 (≈52.7%) come from the IPC  group and 731 (≈47.3%) from the K7 group.   LS patents are found to make quite sharp statements of economic relevance, which  somewhat go beyond the thorough technical description legally required for their  enforcement.  While it is possible that our selection of LS patents is a by -product of a  specific writing style of a small group of individuals, Montobbio et al. (2022) show that,  for USPTO patents, on average only a handful of patents are managed by the same patent  attorney. Although no public data on entities that have been granted power of attorney for  
20  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    EPO patents is readily available, their findings suggest that the writing style bias is likely  to be negligible.  A few selected excerpts are reported below in chronological order, along  with the publication number and year of the patent consid ered.   “Robots […] [satisfy] the demand for saving labor and rationalization of work in  view of the current rise in labor cost.” [EP0068026A1, 1980]   “The need for skilled labor, along with the attendant costs in training and  replacement is reduced and, furt hermore, if the skills involved constitute more an  art than a skill, the call for such talent is avoided.” [EP0778957B1, 1995]   “Automated machining stations can be used to manufacture large quantities of  pieces quickly and completely without human interven tion.” [EP2475501B1, 2009]   “The main function of a robot arm is to act as a substitute for human arms and do  repetitive or demanding works so as to increase productivity and reduce labor  costs.” [EP3379410A1, 2017]   These examples suggest that the economic incentives behind LS innovations pervade even  earlier waves of innovative efforts in the realm of mechanisation.   Figure  3. Number of labour -saving patents by year, as a fraction of robotics patents.     Note: Blue and orange bars denote the share of robotics patents of the ‘IPC’ and ‘K7’ types, respectively,  which are found to be labour -saving according to a search procedure entailing a text -mining query (see Figure  2) and manual validation.   Source: Authors’ ow n compilation based on EPO data.   Figure  3 shows the evolution in the number of LS patents over time, as a fraction of all  robotic patents. A substantial share of LS pat ents come from technological fields which do  not belong to the standard robotics -related IPC codes, although the first LS inventions in  early 1980s are of the latter type. No clear trend is detectable in the picture, suggesting that  the underlying LS heuri stics have remained quite stable over time , hinting at a mature and  established pattern . To sum up, we detect both an increasing innovative effort devoted to  robotics technology, and a plateaued search heuristic guided towards labour -displacement,  in relat ive terms.   
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   21   © OECD 202 2    4. Who develops labour saving technologies? A firm level analysis   In the present section, we characterise LS patents in terms of identity, geographic location,  and industrial sector of their current corporate assignee(s). To this purpose, we match our  data to the ORBIS® IP (Bureau van Dijk) database through the relevant publication  numbers. Of the 1  545 LS patents found in the previous step, 1  322 (≈85.6%) find a match  with at least one firm. In total, there are 787 firms which hold at least one LS patent  (hereafter, LS firms). Note that patents assigned to more than one firm are deliberately  double counted, since we aim at grasping the degree of dispersion of the underlying LS  heuristics. With respect to the American case, in which 1  276 LS patents are concentrated  in only 408 firms (Montobbio et al., 202 2), implying that each firm on average holds at  least three patents, the European case suggests a wider dispersion of LS heuristics, since  the average number of LS patents per firm, of about 1.7, is much lower.   We now proceed by characterising labour -saving firms by their geographic location  (Section 4.1), identity and industrial classification (Section 4.2).  4.1. Labour -saving firms’ geographic location   Montobbio et al. (202 2) show that the primary source of LS patents at the USPTO is  domestic. In other words, American LS patents are mainly produced by firms located in  the US. This does not appear to be the case for European patents. The world map in Figure  4  offers an overview of the geographic distribution of LS patents at the EPO, given the  location of their current assignee(s). Japan dominates the picture, with 400 LS patents,  followed by  the United States, with 394 LS patents. When combined together, member  countries of the European Patent Convention only account for 403 LS patents at the EPO.  Table  1 reports the number of LS patents for each member country, distinguishing between  IPC and K7. Somewhat surprisingly, Italy, with 107 LS patents, not only ranks first among  European countries, but tops the worldwide chart as the third sovereign country in a strict  sense, surpassing other traditional robotics hubs and competence centres such as Germany  (which ranks 4th) with 54 LS patents and China (5th) with 50.   Figure  4.

There are 44 countries overall which hold at least one labour -saving  patent.   Source: Authors’ own compilation bas ed on EPO and ORBIS IP data.

Focussing on a relative measure of propensity,  i.e. rescaling the number of LS patents by the  total number of robotics patents assigned to  firms in a given country, allows inference on where LS search efforts are more intensive,  compared to the ex -ante capability of producing a robotics patent. This new measure is  represented in Figure  5, where countries holding fewer than 10 robotics patents are  discarded.

Source: Authors’ own compilation based on EPO and ORBIS IP data.   Among the countries with more than 10 robotic patents, Japan again leads the ranking, with  more than 35% of its robotics patents also being LS. Second comes Israel (about 33%) and  third comes India (about 30%). The US stands at about 22.7% while China show s levels of  about 20.2%.   Domestically, robotic patents from member countries of the European Patent Convention  are also LS in approximately 10% of cases. Italy, which ranks first among them when only  the absolute number of patents is considered, is also f irst when it comes to this rescaled  measure, with a ratio of about 16.5%. Other EPO countries featuring a position above  average are Sweden (about 16.0%), Finland (about 15.8%), Turkey (12.5%), Germany  (about 12.4%), and Belgium (about 10.6%).   It is worth noting that, while it is possible to trace a patent to a certain location, given the  address of its corporate holder, it is not possible to distinguish whether the innovation is  used or generates revenues domestically or at a different location. This could  be especially  an issue for  multinational enterprises.   4.2. Labour -saving firms’ identity and industrial classification   We now proceed by revealing the identity of the top LS patents holding firms and then  characterise their sectoral dispersion. Figure  6 lists the top 15 holders by absolute number  of LS patents, while Figure  7 lists the de scription of the top 15 primary sectors, identified  as 4-digit NACE Rev. 2 assigned to the holders.

The chart is sorted by the sum of both types of patents, in decreasing order. There exist 164 4 digit NACE codes whose associ ated firms hold at least one labour -saving patent (see Figure 8).   Source: Authors’ own compilation based on EPO and ORBIS IP data.   Both pictures detail the underlying IPC and K7 composition. As expected, following the  analysis in Section 4.1, Japanese high -tech companies are prevalent, ranging from  industrial robots manufacturers (such as Fanuc, Yaskawa), to producers of heavy  machinery and transport equipment (e.g. Ka wasaki, Mitsubishi), other general purpose  machinery equipment (e.g. Fuji), semiconductors and electr(on)ic components (e.g.  Yaskawa, Omron, Hitachi), computers and peripheral equipment (e.g. Fujitsu), and  electronic domestic appliances (e.g. Panasonic). T he only US firms making it to the list are  Boeing, the aircraft manufacturer, positioned second among the top 15, and Ethicon, a  subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, positioned last.   This is not entirely surprising, as Montobbio et al. (202 2) show that Boeing  happens to be  the overall largest holder of LS patents at the USPTO. South Korea is represented by LG  
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   25   © OECD 202 2    (6th position), the consumer electronics manufacturer, and Israel is represented by  Maytronics (7th), which manufactures cleaner robots. Strikingly, Euro pean firms feature at  the bottom of the chart, with Siemens (Germany), an industrial conglomerate, raking 9th,  and ABB (Switzerland), a robots and electronics producer, ranking 11th.  In general, this picture suggests that major LS patents holders belong to  producers of robots  and related technologies, rather than adopters, who seek to implement robotics in their own  production processes. This result is also in line with the picture emerging from Figure  7,  which highlights a tight link between LS patents and manufacturing of inherently high -tech  products.   There are exceptions to this dualistic view, however. Boeing has been found to develop  robotic innovations for internal use, such as fuselage mounting platforms, and thus  constitutes a producer and adopter at the same time (Montobbio et al., 202 2). Possibly,  Kawasaki follows a similar approach, since their innovations mainly deal with welding  robots, which can be fruitfully  employed within their motor vehicles production line. Given  the conglomerate nature of many of the aforementioned Japanese groups, there may be  even more examples of in -house horizontal synergies between the R&D department and  manufacturing assembly lines .  All in all, the distinction between robots producers (i.e. the ‘upstream’ sector) and adopters  (the ‘downstream’ sector) is sharper in the case of LS patents protected at the USPTO  (Montobbio et al., 2022) and less so in the case of European patents.   Figure  8. Rank -frequency distribution of NACE codes across labour -saving firms     Note: The first 15 NACE codes, to the left of the orange vertical line, are described in better detail in Figure 7.   Source: Authors’ own compilation b ased on EPO and ORBIS IP data.   The frequency distribution of NACE codes assigned to LS patent holders, depicted in  Figure  8, is also worth noting. In particular, it rev eals that, while most of the (787) LS firms  are concentrated in a few industries (already shown in Figure  7), LS patents are overall  present in as many as 164 distinct sectors, corresponding to 54 distinct NACE 2 -digit  specifications and covering all Level 1 codes except sections S (“Other Service Activities  ”), T (“Activities of Households as Employers [. . . ]”), and U (“Activities of Extraterritorial  Organisations and  Bodies”). In other words, the distribution exhibits a ‘long tail’ across a  wide support of NACE codes. This ultimately suggests that the LS heuristics embedded in  robotic technology is quite widespread across the value chain.   
26  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    5. Occupational exposure   In the present section, we map the knowledge base embedded in LS patents to actual  employment categories. To this end, inspired by the methodology used in Montobbio et al.  (2021), we construct a similarity measure between the full -text of LS patents and  occupatio nal definitions contained in the official ISCO -08 classification13. From the latter,  we exclude group 10 “Armed forces occupations” and we focus on definitions at the 4 -digit  unit group level. Overall, we obtain a corpus of 430 definitions, which undergo th e same  text pre -processing workflow described in Section 3.2.  From a methodological point of view, we adopt the so -called bag-of-words model and  measure textual proximity between patents and occupations by means of cosine similarity   (see e.g. Aggarwal, 2018). The bag -of-words model entails the representation of text as a  multiset  of underlying words, which disregards any grammar structure  and the order in  which terms appear but keeps their multiplicity. The underlying assumption is that  occupation -patent pairs whose descriptions consist of the very same words (actually, stems,  see Section 3.2), and possibly repeatedly, are more associated to one another than pairs  which share few common words, or their frequency is negligible.   Each piece of text, either a patent or an occupational definition, is trans formed into a vector  of frequencies of the underlying words. The number of vector components reflects the  common dictionary of terms across the two whole corpuses. In other words, all vectors  belong to the same vector space, whose dimension equals the numb er of distinct words in  the common dictionary. The similarity of an occupation -patent pair is then quantified as  the cosine of the angle between the two underlying vectors.   As opposed to simply counting the occurrences of each term in each piece of text, w e adopt  the customary tf-idf (i.e. term frequency –inverse document frequency) term -weighting  scheme for computing relevant frequencies (see Definition 1 in the Appendix). The tf -idf  statistics reflects how important a specific term is to a certain document , relative to other  documents in the collection. The tf -idf value increases proportionally to the number of  times a word appears in the document and is offset by the number of documents in the  corpus mentioning that word. This helps adjusting for the fact that some words appear more  frequently in general.   Extending the reasoning to the corpus level, we construct two document -term matrices,  𝒟𝐼𝑆𝐶𝑂 and 𝒟𝐿𝑆, whose rows contain the aforementioned tf -idf frequency vectors, for each  ISCO occupation and eac h LS patent, respectively. Both matrices are based on the  dictionary of terms from ISCO definitions, namely the smaller between the two collections,  which consists of 5633 terms. Therefore 𝒟𝐼𝑆𝐶𝑂 has dimension 430 × 5633 and 𝒟𝐿𝑆 has  dimension 1545 ×  5633. To ensure that only words that are specific enough to the  underlying pieces of text are retained, we introduce an additional restriction. We require  words whose tf -idf is below a cut -off value of 0.4 not to be considered in the subsequent  analysis.14 Put simply, we substitute values below the cut -off in the document -term  matrices with zeros.   Finally, we construct a cosine similarity matrix 𝒞 - to measure how similar two documents  are, irrespective of their size  - containing the cosine similarity betw een all pairs of row  vectors from the document -term matrices 𝒟𝐼𝑆𝐶𝑂 and 𝒟𝐿𝑆 (see Definition 2 in the  Appendix):   𝒞 =cos(𝒟𝐼𝑆𝐶𝑂,𝒟𝐿𝑆).

Occupation -patent pairs to the left of the orange vertical line  (with a value of 0.1) are  discarded from subsequent analysis.   Source: Authors’ own compilation based on EPO and ISCO data.   For the sake of robustness, we discard occupation -patent pairs whose similarity score is  below a threshold of 0.1 (marked by a vertical line in Figure  9). In what follows, the  analysis is based on the remaining 2  413 pairs, corresponding to the top 0.36% of the  distribution (note that the vertical axis of Figure  9 is in logarithmic scale). However, in  separate experiments, we find that either retaining the whole set of pairs or setting a higher  threshold of 0.5 (102 pairs corresponding to the top 0.02% of the distribution), yields  remarkably similar results.   In ord er to rank the occupations by similarity score with the entire ensemble of LS patents,  we compute the row sums of matrix 𝒞 across all patents (columns) and sort the resulting  values in decreasing order.

The mean and average of the similarity distribution  across patents, and the number of underlying patents whose cosine similarity is greater than  the 0.1 threshold , are also shown.   As can be noticed, the chart includes both blue - and white -collar occupations. It should  nevertheless be considered that, since exposure is quantified by text similarity of  underlying occupation -patent pairs, our measure is able to captu re which occupations are  inherently relevant to the corpus of LS patents, while it does not distinguish between those  which will likely witness an increase or a decrease in demand. Accordingly, system  analysts (ISCO code 2511 ), data entry clerks ( 4132 ), and applications programmers ( 2514 ),  which all constitute “enabling” professions of Industry 4.0 technological artefacts and rank  remarkably high for exposure, are not likely to belong to the set of occupations threatened  by LS innovations, at least in the n ear future.   Once these are discarded, highly exposed occupations predominantly include a range of  low- to high -skill blue -collar jobs.  It is worth keeping in mind that, a ccording to some  routine intensity estimates by Marcolin et al. (2016) based on 20 OECD countries, in 2012  on average 46% of employed persons worked in non -routine (18%) or low (28%) routine  intensive occupations. Interestingly, highest levels of exposure belong to occupations in  the service sector. Hand and pedal vehicle drivers ( 9331 ), such as delivery riders, seem to  be threatened by LS innovations in the logistics sector (which also ranks first in the human machine taxonomy of Montobbio et al., ( 2022) for American patents). Vehicle cleaners  (9122 ) seem to be threatened by cleaning robots’ producers, among which Israeli  Maytronics Ltd. ranks 7th in the chart of top LS patents holders (cf. Figure  6).  Next come a group of occupational titles mainly engaged in shop floor and warehouse jobs  in a diversified range of sectors. Focussing on the top half of Table  2, these include: the  engineering and automotive industry, with motor vehicle mechanics and repairers ( 7231 ),  metal working machine tool setters and operators ( 7223 ), and sheet metal workers ( 7213 );  the clothing/garment industry, with  shoemaking and related machine operators ( 8156 ),  textile, fur and leather products machine operators ( 8159 ), and bleaching, dyeing and fabric  cleaning machine operators ( 8154 ); logistics and general warehouse workers, with packing,  bottling and labelling machine operators ( 8183 ).  Another cluster of occupations at risk of future displacement because of LS technological  developments is associated to livestock breeding and related activities, with animal  producers ( 6129 ), mixed crop and animal producers ( 6130 ), subsistence livestock farmers  (6320 ), livestock and dairy producers ( 6121 ), pet groomers and animal care workers  (5164 ), and veterinarians ( 2250 ).  In order to better grasp the employment magnitude underlying jobs exposed to LS  innovations, we aggregate the similarity data to ISCO occupations at the 2 -digit level and  match them with the ILO (International Labour Organization) employment database for 31  OECD countries (since data regarding Australia, Canada, Colombia, Japan, South Korea,  and New Zealand ar e not available). For each country, we compute the overall employment  shares associated to the top ten 2 -digit occupations by aggregate similarity. Table  3 reports  the normalised similarity scores for the first ten ISCO 2 -digit occupations, while Figure  10  shows the time evolution of the aggregate employment shares for the top ten coun tries  where this measure is highest, on average.

Source: Authors’ own compilation based on EPO, ISCO, and ILO data.   The country w ith the largest fraction of labour force exposed to LS technologies is Chile,  followed by Mexico, Hungary, and Estonia. Overall, between 2011 and 2019 (the widest  timespan available using ILO data) all employment shares have experienced negligible  changes.  An analogous dynamics also applies to other OECD countries included in the  analysis (not shown here). This may suggest that either LS technologies have yet to be  implemented into production processes in these countries, or that their effect has been  offse t, on average, by complementary labour -augmenting  technologies or by increases in  related demand (Bessen, 2019). Further research to econometrically investigate the  relationship between labour -saving technological developments and employment would be  helpf ul.  
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   31   © OECD 202 2    6. Concluding remarks   This work informs the discussion about developments in robotics substituting workers or  otherwise complementing human activities. To this end, we implement a natural language  approach to detect the presence of explicit labour -saving heuristics in inventive efforts, as  proxied by patented technologies, which exploits the full text of patents published by the  European Patent Office (EPO) between 1978 and 2019. We further link patent data to firm  data from ORBIS® IP, to characterise the leading actors in the robotics space and their LS  innovations. Again, using a natural language processing (NLP) approach, we estimate a  similarity measure associating different LS patents to one or more occupations, based on  the description contained in th e 2008 International Standard Classification of Occupations  (ISCO -08).   This allows identifying the occupations that are more likely to be affected by LS  developments, and contrasting this with data about employment levels by occupation over  time, for a se t of 31 OECD countries over the period 2011 -19.  A first result of our study is that labour -saving patents are found to make quite sharp  statements of economic relevance, which somewhat go beyond the thorough technical  description legally required for their  patent protection.   A second finding is that, despite the number of robotics patents having been steadily  increasing since 1978, and at especially fast pace in the last decade, the share of labour saving patents has been quite stable over time. This confir ms that labour -saving heuristics  behind technological innovations are not a new phenomenon, but rather a quite established  one.  A third finding is that only about a quarter of all labour -saving patents published by the  EPO are filed by firms located in Eur opean countries or other members of the European  Patent Convention (EPC). The remaining three quarters are roughly equally distributed  between Japan, the US, and other non -EPC countries. Overall, traditional robotics  competence centres, such as Japan, US, and Italy, dominate the picture, although a few  developing countries are also present, such as China, India, Turkey, and Brazil.   A fourth finding is that robots’ manufacturers, especially from Japan, account for most  labour -saving product innovations. However, labour -saving heuristics are found to emerge  along the entire supply chain. Industries such as aerospace, mining, retail, and food  processing patent labour -saving robotics technology as process innovation, which could  lead to employment disruption  once implemented.   A fifth finding is that , to the extent  that labour -saving innovations  are  implemented in   firms’  production processes, occupations most exposed to them  would  include not only  low-skilled and blue -collar jobs (e.g. vehicle drivers and cle aners), but also highly  cognitive and specialised professions (e.g. system analysts and application programmers).  While labour displacement of these occupations may  be expected to occur in the future, a  preliminary analysis does not find an appreciable neg ative effect on employment shares in  selected OECD countries during the past decade.   Overall, our findings point to the need to have a balanced policy discussion about the  possible threat posed by automation to employment. The descriptive evidence provided ,  which for the first time relies on real technological developments as compared to estimates  of hypothetical automatability of tasks and occupations (as is the case of e.g. Frey and  Osborne, 2017), suggests that labour -saving developments happen in a cont ext of stable 
32  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    employment levels of the same  occupations that these labour -saving technologies have the  potential  to offset. Demand -related dynamics as well as an expansion of production may  well explain these findings and call for future research to econom etrically investigate the  relationship between labour -saving technological developments and employment.     
LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS   33   © OECD 202 2    Endnotes 1 The term “Industrie 4.0” (shortened to “I4.0” or “I 4”), was first proposed in 2011 in a high tech strategy project of the German government, promoting the computerisation of manufacturing,  and has been widely adopted since to refer to a new production paradigm or revolution.   2  Heuristics  is a term that refers to the mental  strategies that an agent employ s to reduce the  cognitive demand associated with certain decision -making tasks.  Heuristics generally means “rules”  that people use to make judgments or estimates of probabilities and frequ encies , also in situations  of uncertainty .  3 NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the interaction between  computers and humans using the natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read,  decipher, understand, and extr act information from natural language in a manner that is valuable.   4 It is important to acknowledge that during the global COVID -19 pandemic, still ongoing  at the time of writing, robots and other autonomous systems, thanks to their intrinsic immunity to  the virus, have played a crucial role, allowing the continuation of certain pivotal economic activities,  especially in the healthcare sector, that otherwise would have been partially disrupted (Javaid et al.,  2020; Shen et al., 2020).   5 According to Bresna han and Trajtenberg (1995, p. 84) a GPT is “characterized by the  potential for pervasive use in a wide  range of sectors”. In other terms, it is a single technology that  underpins other technologies and multiply their value, with the ability of generating g eneralised  productivity gains.   6 Available here: https://www.epo.org/searching -for-patents/technical/ep full-text.html   7 The EPO publishes patent documents in either Engl ish, French or German.   8 Available here:  https://www.cooperativepatentclassification.org/cpcConcordances   9 This entailed a non -trivial effort, as we had to read a representativ e sample of patents  identified using different numbers of repetitions of the morphological root ‘robot’ , namely  between 5 and 10.   10 Duplicate publications, which can arise when an application is republished or gets granted,  are removed and only the latest version is retained.   11 We do this by means of a punctuation regular expression, which is a is a sequence of  characters that specifies a textual search pattern.   12 When running a search, it is key to find relevant results not only for the exact expression  typed but also for other possible forms of the words used. This can be achieved via two methods,  i.e. stemming  and lemmatization , both aimed at reducing the words into a common base or root.  Stemming algorithms work by means of removing the end or the beginn ing of the word, following  common prefixes and suffixes that can be found in a word. Lemmatisation conversely takes into  account the morphological analysis of the words. In the present work, we use the so -called Porter2   stemmer, an improved version of the pioneering Porter (1980) algorithm.   13 Available here:  http://www.ilo.org/public/english/bureau/stat/isco/isco08/index.htm   14 This value has been fine -tuned to maximise the a verage cosine similarity across  occupation -patent pairs.

36  LABOUR -SAVING TECHNO LOGIES AND EMPLOYMEN T LEVELS    © OECD 202 2    Annex A.  Appendix   Term frequency – inverse document frequency   Definition 1  Let 𝐷 be a collection of d ocuments 𝑑, each composed of an ensemble of terms  𝑡 from a dictionary 𝑇. The tf -idf measure  of term 𝑡 appearing in document 𝑑 is defined as  follows:   tf-idf(𝑡,𝑑,𝐷)≔tf(𝑡,𝑑)⋅idf(𝑡,𝐷) ∀𝑑∈𝐷, ∀𝑡∈𝑇  tf(𝑡,𝑑)≔𝟏𝑑(𝑡)={1        if 𝑡∈𝑑 0  otherwise , ∀𝑑∈𝐷, ∀𝑡∈𝑇  idf(𝑡,𝐷)≔log(|𝐷| |{𝑑 ∈ 𝐷∶ 𝑡∈ 𝑑 }|),  ∀𝑡∈𝑇    The associated |𝐷|×|𝑇| document -term matrix 𝒟𝐷 is the collection of tf-idf measures for  all documents in the collection and for all terms in the relevant dictionary. In other words,   𝒟𝑑,𝑡𝐷=tf-idf(𝑡,𝑑,𝐷), ∀𝑑∈𝐷, ∀𝑡∈𝑇.  Cosine similarity   Definition 2  Given two vectors 𝑋,𝑌∈ℝ|𝑇|, their cosine similarity is defined as the cosine  of the angle between them, which is also equal to the inner product of the same vectors  normalised to unit length, as fol lows:   cos(𝑋, 𝑌) ≔𝑋∙𝑌 ‖𝑋‖‖𝑌‖=∑  𝑥𝑡𝑦𝑡|𝑇| 𝑡=1 √∑ 𝑥𝑡2 |𝑇| 𝑡=1√∑ 𝑦𝑡2 |𝑇| 𝑡=1  Where 𝑥𝑡 and 𝑦𝑡 denote the components of vectors 𝑋 and 𝑌, respectively, and ‖∙‖ denotes  the Euclidean norm.   Since row vectors of document -term matrices are non -negative valued, their cosi ne  similarity is bounded by the unit interval, i.e. cos(𝑋,𝑌)∈[0,1].  Moreover, when term frequency is measured by tf -idf, the normalisation denominator in  the aforementioned equation is redundant and cos(𝑋,𝑌)≡𝑋⋅𝑌. By the same token, given  document -term matrices 𝒟𝐼𝑆𝐶𝑂 and 𝒟𝐿𝑆, and extending the cosine similarity computation  to the matrix level, it holds   cos(𝒟𝐼𝑆𝐶𝑂,𝒟𝐿𝑆)≡𝒟𝐼𝑆𝐶𝑂⋅(𝒟𝐿𝑆)′ .
