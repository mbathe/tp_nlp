Dutch Artificial Intelligence Manifesto   Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence1, The Netherlands   Executive Summary   Artificial Intelligence (AI), the science and engineering that studies and creates intelligent systems,  has become a disruptive force revolutionizing fields as diverse as health care, finance, law,  insurance, HR, communication, education, energy, transport ation, manufacturing, agriculture, and  defense.2 Driven by the increased availability of compute power, access to massive amounts of  data3, and advanced sensor technology, AI techniques -  such as reasoning, imaging processing and  machine learning algorithm s - have become powerful enablers of automation, predictive analytics,  and human -machine interaction. AI has already changed online interactions in the retail sector (e.g.,  recommender systems and chatbots) but also enable sophisticated AI -enabled user exp eriences  (e.g., AI assistants) that profoundly affect how people live, work, and play.4 To ensure these  developments are beneficial for all, we should invest in making AI highly robust, and include all  stakeholders in their development.5 The Netherlands is  well positioned to benefit from these  developments as strong enablers are in place including strong digital absorption and economic  innovation. AI research and education is also strong, but to avoid a brain drain, investments are  needed in human talent.6 In the meantime, a technology race has started with the US taking a  leading role, China closely following and heavily investing in AI7, and Europe still in the process of  formulating its AI strategy at EU as well as national levels.8 We urgently need a national agenda for  AI that provides a national strategy that is supported by academy, industry, and government. The  Netherlands must make substantial investments in high -quality Dutch AI research and innovation if it  is to compete at all.     In this manifesto the Special Interest Group on Artificial Intelligence (SIGAI) proposes a research  agenda and identifies priorities that require investments to ensure AI research in the Netherlands is                                                              1 The Special Interest Group of AI, SIGAI, is a special member of IPN, the ICT Platform Netherlands ,  representing all computing science academic institutes and researchers in the Netherlands that perform AI  research.

2 able to establish and maintain its leading role in the world. How succes sful the Netherlands will be  will depend on the Dutch government prioritising research in AI. We have defined a research agenda  that identifies (1) priorities, (2) the need to invest in AI foundational research, and (3) unique  opportunities to invest in mu ltidisciplinary challenges. Our recommendations are based on input  from all AI research institutes in the Netherlands.     The Netherlands stands out internationally in the high quality of its AI educational system but we do  not yet sufficiently exploit our c apability to increase our national AI talent pool . Dutch academia,  industry, and government should create a strong national AI alliance to promote R&D in AI ; and  should invest in a strong AI infrastructure that is needed to benefit from AI by providing acc ess to  quality data for research in, e.g., health.     In order to ensure Dutch AI research can stay competitive world -wide, it is essential to invest in the  foundations of AI research. We have analysed research on seven foundational AI areas strongly  represe nted in the Netherlands:   - Autonomous Agents & Robotics,   - Computer Vision,   - Decision Making,   - Information Retrieval,   - Knowledge Representation & Reasoning,   - Machine Learning, and   - Natural Language Processing.   Based on the strengths in each of these areas, we h ave identified research challenges that will  ensure that the Netherlands will continue to be able to conduct cutting- edge AI research that stands  out in the world. We focus in particular on how the academic AI community in the Netherlands can  contribute an d where investments are needed to ensure that the world -renowned Dutch research in  AI is strengthened.     AI is having a big impact on the world -wide society, and can be a tremendous opportunity to  increase the quality of life of humanity. We should aim for sustainable next -generation AI systems  that are human -centered. AI will provide new opportunities but will also pose several  multidisciplinary challenges that we should address. Because society is relying more and more on  decisions that are taken by or tog ether with AI systems, their role and impact on society will  increase, and there is a need for AI techniques and models for making these systems socially -aware,  explainable, and responsible. These priorities are visualized in a grid (Figure 1) composed of the  foundational AI areas and multidisciplinary challenges.     Finally, we believe It is important to educate the broader public about current AI driven changes and  developments.9                                                              9 See also Denkwerk July 2018 . 
3 Introduction   AI systems are capable of sensing their environment, learn from and reaso n about it, and change it  based on advanced decision making. AI already has had a big impact on our society ; this impact will  further  increase due to ongoing algorithmic developments, the availability of data and increasing  computational power, adv ances in sensor technology and robotics.  AI applications are becoming  ubiquitous in all areas of our society including science, industry,  health, high tech, energy, public  safety , food, retail, and education.     In order to enable and facilitate the Dutch AI  research community to have a significant impact in  these areas and increase its ability to compete internationally, we have formulated a clear research  agenda. To this end, we have identified priorities that require investments in Dutch AI research and  innovation. First of all, this includes the general priorities  of investing in AI education, a national AI  alliance, and AI infrastructure. Secondly, to ensure that next -generation AI systems are accurate,  reliable, and robust, we need to invest in foundational AI research. Thirdly, due to the enormous  impact AI has on our society, multidisciplinary challenges  are becoming increasingly important.  Figure 1 provides an overview of the relation between AI foundations and key multidisciplinary  challenges  of AI in the form of a grid structure.       Figure 1: Artificial Intelligence Grid (AI Foundational Areas and Multidisciplinary Challenges).     Foundational AI challenges include the development of algorithms that are more powerful, more  data effective, more computationally efficient, and more robust. We identified seven AI foundational  areas10 in which the Dutch AI community has made (and is expec ted to make) important  contributions:                                                               10 Based upon  amo ng others  https://ai100.stanford.edu/2016- report  and https://www.ijcai -18.org/cfp/ .  
4   ● Agents & Robotics : developing autonomous computer systems acting in (either digital or  physical) environments in order to achieve their design objectives. Challenges : (1) improving  the perception, manipulation, and na vigation capabilities of robots, (2) developing  sophisticated interaction and coordination models, and (3) integrating different techniques  into a coherent decision making architecture.   ● Computer Vision: obtaining a visual understanding of the world. Challe nges : (1) developing  novel algorithms for visual interpretation based on precise appearance and geometry  understanding, (2) design algorithms which require less expert supervision, and (3)  integrating these with techniques from machine learning, natural language, and robotics.   ● Decision Making : planning and scheduling, heuristic search and optimization. Challenges : (1)  developing uncertainty classification techniques, (2) developing algorithms to support  sequential decision -making under uncertainty and invol ving multiple parties, and (3)  combining reasoning and machine learning algorithms (as in, e.g., AlphaGo).   ● Information Retrieval : technology to connect people to information, e.g., in the form of  search engines, recommender systems, or conversational agent s. Challenges : (1) algorithmic  understanding of information seeking intent, (2) machine interpretation of information  interaction behavior, and (3) developing online and offline result generation techniques.   ● Knowledge Representation & Reasoning : representi ng information computationally, and  processing information in order to solve complex reasoning tasks. Challenges : (1) integrating  symbolic with sub -symbolic techniques, (2) robust representation and reasoning techniques  for knowledge that is large, dynamic , heterogeneous and distributed, and (3) integration of  knowledge representation and reasoning with other AI challenges, such as vision, natural  language understanding, question answering, robotics, and others.   ● Machine Learning : learning from data (using e .g. neural networks also known as ‘deep  learning’ and/or statistical techniques). Challenges : (1) integrating pattern recognition  techniques with higher level knowledge, (2) developing more efficient reinforcement  learning algorithms, and (3) developing un certainty classification techniques.   ● Natural Language Processing : Extracting information and knowledge about the world from  (large amounts of) spoken, written, and signed natural language, enabling human -machine  communication, and supporting multilingual h uman -human communication. Challenges : (1)  dealing with the rich variation and cultural differences in language use at personal and group  level, (2) achieving technological language -independence, and (3) achieving naturalness in  generated text and speech.     As a consequence of the rapid developments in these foundational areas, AI is transforming our  society by changing the nature of work and the way humans relate to machines. AI should be  human -centered: the key to using Artificial Intelligence effectively is to augment and assist humans,  not to replace them. Figuring out how humans and AI can collaborate effectively will have large  economic and societal impact. It therefore is important to research and develop algorithms that  have in -built properties that fa cilitate collaboration between humans and machines to jointly  perform advanced tasks. T o fully address this challenge, a fundamental step in  AI research is  required, that starts from the future human -AI relation.  This also introduces new research challenge s  and opportunities of a multidisciplinary nature. We identify three multidisciplinary challenges for 
5 sustainable next -generation AI systems to which the Dutch AI community can make strong  contributions in the coming decade:     ● Socially -Aware AI : Next- genera tion AI systems will become proactive and collaborate in a  personalised way with humans. Challenges : design AI systems that (1) allow for an effective  social interface with humans, (2) are able to interpret, reason about, and influence human  behaviour, (3)  are able to interact, collaborate and coordinate their behaviour with human  beings.   ● Explainable AI : Next- generation AI systems will perform sophisticated and advanced tasks  that were previously performed by humans and moreover their decisions will significantly  affect the life of humans. It is therefore utmost important that AI systems are not only  accurate, but also able to explain how the system came to its decision. Challenges : develop  new algorithms, which (1) by design can explain their rationale, (2)  do so in an intuitive,  human -understandable manner, and (3) explain why their underlying mechanisms produced  the AI’s behaviour.   ● Responsible AI : Next -generation AI systems will enable the automation of tasks that humans  used to perform and the automated p rocessing of huge amounts of data. This should  happen in a responsible manner. Challenges : (1) design AI systems which allow to integrate  our moral standards for responsible data processing, (2) integrate our moral, societal and  legal values, and (3) remai n efficient in processing the abundance of (sensory) information  available worldwide.     Finally, The Netherlands can have a high impact when next -generation AI systems are employed in  specific domains, in particular in the life sciences & health, high tech,  energy, food production, the  public sector (e.g. government and law), and education domains.11  Research and Education Agenda and Priorities   The Dutch AI research community is ideally positioned to play a key role in the development of  sustainable next -gene ration AI systems. The research agenda that we propose starts by identifying a  number of important general priorities. After that, the main priorities related to the two dimensions  of the AI grid (foundational areas and multidisciplinary challenges) are elaborated.   General Priorities   There are a number of general priorities that require investments to ensure the Netherlands can  face international competition. The Netherlands has an excellent educational infrastructure which                                                              11 In a 2017 briefing note , McKinsey notes that the “public sector, and healthcare [have] captured less than 30  percent of the potential value”  of using AI for data analytics (radical personalization,  massive data -integration  capabilities, and enhanced decision making can act as disruptive forces in these domains). It is advised to make  a more thorough analysis of the Dutch key sectors  and focus on a specific selection, a strategy also proposed in  the Villani report March 2018 . The current selection is based on high potential ( healthcare and high tech),  sustainability (energy), leading by example (government), and need to build a larger talent pool (education).  Also in line with the Villani report, it is advised to consider interdisciplinary institutes  for these specific focus  areas.  
6 offers a strong opportunity to i nvest in talent. To unlock this potential, investments are needed to be  able to maximally use and exploit this infrastructure in order to be able to educate larger numbers of  AI experts. A similar point can be made with regards to the Dutch ecosystem of ac ademic institutes,  companies and government. There is much potential but an investment is needed to shape a  coordinated effort to by means of a Dutch AI alliance to identify the needs of the Dutch economy in  particular.   Invest in AI curricula to train and sustain an AI- capable talent pool   There is a shortage of skilled AI developers. The skills required for advanced AI system development  are relatively rare at present. PhD -level expertise is currently required to understa nd AI systems and  develop novel AI algorithms but current trends such as automated AI (e.g., AutoML) will make these  available to trained AI students too. “Nations that develop education, training, and immigration  policies to recruit and train top talent –  from their country and from others –  will have an edge on  others”.12 Dutch higher education stands out in the world by the relatively large number of high  quality AI curricula. Seven universities offer programs on Artificial Intelligence and these programs   are highly ranked in the world.13 However, currently universities are not able to service the much  larger numbers of students who want to study AI (>500 applications where resources are typically  available for 120) due to resource limitations.14 Moreover, d iversity is an issue in AI as more broadly  within other disciplines.15 A large investment is needed to enable universities to educate larger  numbers of next -generation students who aim to be AI experts and to promote and implement  STEM education more broadl y, taking also diversity into account. Such an investment can also be  used to train and educate company employees in AI.   Invest in national AI alliance with academia, industry, and government   Initiatives such as ICAI and European collaborations such as CLAIRE  and ELLIS  aim at enabling the AI  community at national and European levels to enhance their effectiveness and cooperation  to do AI  research. However, we should also realize that private sector companies are playing a large role in  developing and utilizing AI.16 Many initiatives in the Netherlands are developed bottom -up, where  the US and China government initiatives play a large role. In a bottom -up fashion the Dutch robotics  community has organized itself in the Holland Robotics  community. AI more broadly has given rise to  a plethora of innovation labs in all sectors with le ss organization and structure so far. This bottom -up  organization leads to inefficiencies and does not make use of the potential for cooperation.  For the  Dutch government to effectively harness AI technology, it will need to stimulate innovation  occurring  in private companies, to adopt AI technologies itself, and to ensure that the wheel is not  reinvented by making sure expertise is shared whenever possible. VNO -NCW and MKB Nederland                                                              12 See CNAS report July 2018 .  13 The Netherlands has a relatively high number of institutes that offer AI programs compared to other  EU  countries, see e.g. for comparison http://www.aiinternational.org/universities.html . These programs are  ranked 59 -195. See also, for example, Analytics Indi a January 2017  which reports that 4 out of the 10 leading  Master’s Programs from around the world are Dutch.  14 See also this NOS July 2018 report . The Villani report March 2018  suggests to at least  triple current numbers .  15 See also the AI4All initiative  to train a new, more diverse generation of AI technologists, thinkers, and  leaders. The Villani report March 2018  also promotes Inclusive and Diverse AI.   16 See CNAS report July 2018 . 
7 have also made a recent call to action.17 It is important to organize key Dutch national players from  academia, industry as well as government in a national AI alliance. This alliance should develop a  national agenda for AI & Robotics and invest into public -private cooperation and projects.   Invest in an AI Infrastructure   “AI wil l augment the national power of those countries that are able to identify, acquire, and apply  large datasets of economic and military importance in order to develop high -performance AI  systems.”18 To this end, we need to make sure that we create access to l arge quantities of the right  type of data. New ways of producing, sharing and governing data by making data a common good  are needed.19  Part of the challenge here is how to live by our values and protect e.g. privacy as  regulated in GDPR while at the same time make e.g. healthcare data available for next -generation AI  systems to benefit from this advanced technology.20  An important challenge is to identify which  types of data are crucial at the Dutch national level (our healthcare but also scientific data s ets are  good examples) and how we can make this data accessible to exploit the benefits that AI can  offer.21  AI Foundational Priorities   Autonomous Agents & Robotics   While AI traditionally focuses on specific capabilities such as natural language processing,  planning,  machine learning, search, and vision,  the integration of various capabilities is becoming the main  research focus of the autonomous agent research field. An autonomous agent is assumed to be  capable of sensing its environment, reason to decide and perform actions that maximise the chance  to successfully achieve their objectives. Moreover, the interaction between autonomous agents and  the corresponding notion of social intelligence have become the focus of the multiagent systems  research field. E urope, with the Netherlands playing an especially large role, has been a main  contributor to the worldwide research on autonomous agents and multiagent systems. The  community of autonomous agents and multiagent systems in the Netherlands has strong  researc hers in Amsterdam, Leiden, Delft, Groningen, Maastricht and Utrecht. Key contributions have  been made to engineering autonomous agents and multiagent systems, logics for multiagent  systems, argumentation and dialogue systems, virtual and emotional agents, decision and game  theory, negotiation and teamwork, self -organisation and swarm intelligence, normative multi- agent  systems, trust and reputation, and social systems with applications in among others virtual reality,  gaming, simulation, supply -chain manage ment, traffic and transportation, energy grids, healthcare  and other branches of industry. The main challenge of the autonomous agents research field is the  software engineering issue of how to integrate various AI techniques into a coherent decision  makin g architecture and develop models for software agents that continuously and in real- time are  able to perceive their environments, reason, and perform actions that maximise the chance to                                                              17 See this NOS July 2018 report .  18 See CNAS report July 2018 .  19 Villani report March 2018 .  20 See Centre for Data Innovation March 2018 .  21 It is advised to further stimulate and invest in initiatives such as https://researchdata.nl/ .  
8 successfully achieve their objectives. The main challenge for autonomo us agents research is to  integrate AI techniques into a coherent decision making architecture, and to develop interaction  and coordination models and techniques.     The Netherlands has been a key player and actively participating in the worldwide robotics  community, both from a technical but also from an AI and human -robot interaction perspective. The  academic robotics community has always had a strong focus on a human -centered approach to  robotics. However, whereas the Dutch industry has organized itself in Holland Robotics, organizing  the academic community and connecting it better with industry requires an investment to ensure  innovations are driven by both. The main challenge for robotics is to further improve robot’s  perception, manipulation, and navigati on capabilities and research and develop sophisticated  cognition and collaboration capabilities so robots can interact socially and cooperate with  humans.   The use of advanced machine learning techniques on robots require many trials, which are often  only f easible when performed in a simulation of the robot. A key challenge is to research the  interaction between the simulation and the robot, while the robot can learn from the results of the  simulation, how do we know that the simulation is trustfully, and if  not, are will still able to learn  from this simulator? Moreover, how can the simulator be improved given data from the robot, how  can we learn to choose between data from the  simulator  (cheap) or real robot (expensive), and  how can we learn the best pol icy from the resulting dataset where the data has different levels of  trust,   Computer Vision  Computer Vision is of central importance to many fields, of which health and transportation may be  the two most visible. The world is adapting swiftly to visual c omputing, communication and  intelligence via Internet, mobile phones and other with camera -equipped devices. The inevitable  future is that the story of our life, and that of a billion others, will be told by video at home, at work,  and on the road. Making sense of visual data offers a wealth of opportunities for science, for health,  for public safety, for well- being, for transportation, and for businesses. However, at the same time  automatically understanding the full complexity of visual content presents o ne of the grand  challenges in computer science, covering topics such as color processing, semantic understanding,  3D reconstruction, interactive picture analysis, image and video retrieval, human -behavior analysis,  and event recognition required to be used  as vision system for e.g. robots and autonomous driving  systems.      The field is at the forefront of the current revolution of AI research. The superhuman image  classification performance by deep learning in the ImageNet competition is the leading example to  stress the breakthrough of AI in general. The field’s major conference, the Conference on Computer  Vision and Pattern Recognition is the highest ranked peer -reviewed publication in all of computer  science. The Netherlands has a long tradition in the fie ld with strong groups in broad and technical  universities across the country. They participate in the research school for computing and imaging  and meet at the yearly Netherlands Conference on Computer Vision. The Netherlands also plays a  role of internati onal importance, as evidenced by the University of Amsterdam’s victory in the 
9 ImageNet competition, Leiden University having developed the best edge detector,  as well as  several other image and video recognition benchmarks, the organization of the European  Conference on Computer Vision in Amsterdam in 2016, the establishment of two public -private  research labs on computer vision by learning with Qualcomm and Bosch and several successful  university spin -offs, including Kepler Vision, EUVision (acquired by Q ualComm), SightCorp, 3D  Universum, and Aiir Innovations.      Three challenges  in computer vision research are apparent. First, the analysis of images and videos  in terms of appearance and geometry have to become increasingly precise and should shift towards  interpretation. Second, the integration of core computer vision with machin e learning, natural  language, and robotics should prosper. Third, the amount of required expert supervision should be  reduced, requiring novel forms of automated visual analysis. Together, solutions to these challenges  will enable the automated understandi ng of videos in terms of interaction, behavior, context and  causality. As such, automated computer vision will provide the cornerstone for comprehensive AI  systems, used to assist multidisciplinary research in socially -aware, explainable, and responsible A I.  At the same time, there is a technology push by the Internet of Things causing massive amounts of  video cameras to become tiny, connected and live- streaming 24/7. Body worn cameras, drones and  service robots are just three examples. They may even captur e video data beyond the visual  spectrum. This is an invitation to move away from traditional computer vision domains, such as  consumer photos, television archives and social media. And, instead, emphasize hitherto non mainstream video domains like surveillance, healthcare and robotics where viewpoints are new,  labelled examples are scarce and real- time spatiotemporal 3D understanding is crucial. The key  challenge here is to develop precise automated visual understanding, which is integrated with  machine lea rning, natural language, and robotics, uses less expert supervision, and which  generalizes to novel visual domains.   Decision Making   AI research on decision making aims to design and understand fundamental properties of methods  to support intelligent decis ion making. This involves algorithms to efficiently search in general  solution spaces, and methods specifically for planning and scheduling, Game Theory, reasoning  under uncertainty, adaptive strategies, and constraint satisfaction. Historically, this is a  field of AI  where significant progress has come from the Netherlands, because of its strong base in  Mathematics and Operations Research. AI for responsible decision making requires thinking through  the consequences of decisions into the future. A key issu e here, just like in machine learning, is  reliable uncertainty quantification: a good decision -maker, whether a human, a machine or a  machine -assisted human, needs to have a good idea about the potential suboptimality of its  decisions, for example, statist ically valid bounds of the probability of a bad outcomes. The  Netherlands has strong groups in multi -objective decision analysis and optimization, both  fundamental and applied.     Responsible decisions also need to be socially -aware, taking into account the involved people and  their preferences, and the (reasons for these) decisions need to be explainable to human experts  and policy makers and be based on available data. Dec ision -making must be adaptive, as  circumstances in which decisions must be made may ch ange rapidly; moreover, adaptiveness is a 
10 necessary requirement for an automated decision -making system to be self -correcting. Although  there has been steady progress on algorithms to support automated decision making, including  reasoning about sequential decision -making under uncertainty and decisions involving multiple  parties, making these systems more socially -aware, explainable, and responsible is an important  challenge.   Information Retrieval   Information retrieval, in the form of search engines, recomm ender systems, or conversational  agents, is the most prominent manifestation of AI in practice today. Information seeking is a key  aspect of the human condition and the drive to create technology that helps us access information is  as old as the drive to c reate technology itself. Modern information retrieval technology is centered  around interactive methods that learn to assess and improve their results while interacting with  their human users. Key steps in these algorithmic processes are (1) obtaining an c omputational  understanding of people’s information seeking intent, (2) enabling machines to interpret and asses  human information interaction behavior, and (3) developing online and offline result generation  techniques that learn how to meet the user’s int ent and how to improve their results based on  observed human behavior.     In terms of obtaining a better computational understanding of people’s information seeking intent,  approaches so far have mostly focused on static snapshots of users’ state of knowledg e, either  implicitly by mining interaction logs or explicitly by modeling domain -specific intents. The key  challenge here is to integrate these implicit and explicit intent representations and track and  predict shifts in intent as users interact with infor mation retrieval technology, especially in data  sparse environments.     As to improving the ability of information retrieval algorithms to assess the success or failure of their  actions based on observing human information interaction behavior, the community  has made  significant improvements recently through the introduction of new online and counterfactual  evaluation methods. The next big challenge here is how we can setup reliable simulation methods  that enable us to evaluate personalized interactive system s.    The development of online and offline result generation techniques requires substantial research  into autonomous acting in extremely large, non -stationary state and action spaces. The key  challenge here is how we can develop effective unsupervised obje ctive functions for generating  individual responses, for sets or lists of responses, and for extended interactions that may span  multiple turns or even multiple sessions.   Knowledge Representation & Reasoning   Symbolic AI has been an important branch of stud y within AI. Nowadays symbolic AI and logical  methods are very important given the need for explainable and responsible AI, as both require  reasoning about AI systems. The Netherlands has been a strong contributor in this field with key  contributions in  ( i) investigations into agent concepts such as, knowledge, belief, time, intentions,  goals, emotions, and norms, (ii) argumentation theory, and (iii) knowledge representation and  reasoning, ontologies, and the semantic web.  Research projects aim is to unde rstand these notions 
11 better and to make them amenable to computerised treatment and processing, for example making  sense of illustrated handwritten manuscripts in combination with natural history ontological data.     It is a significant challenge how data- driven methods can be connected to knowledge -based  approaches. Research developing such connections requires innovative foundations (for instance  explaining how logical and probabilistic knowledge and reasoning go tog ether, new kinds of  algorithms (in particular allowing scalability) and the development and validation of corresponding  design paradigms. By connecting data -driven and knowledge based methods, progress can be made  in several challenges. First such connecti ons contribute to addressing the long- standing knowledge  acquisition bottleneck. Second they contribute to explainable AI by bridging the transparency of  knowledge -based methods with data -driven scalability. Third they can support a responsible AI as  knowl edge -based methods are more amenable to normative guidance than data- driven methods.  The key challenge is how to integrate symbolic and subsymbolic techniques in AI, which would  establish a major breakthrough in AI.      Recently, probabilistic modeling metho ds (in particular Bayesian networks) are gaining momentum  also in knowledge representation and reasoning, for instance in domains such as the law and  medicine where complex knowledge structures go side by side with statistical analyses. Also in  argumentati on research, originally primarily qualitative, knowledge -based in nature, there are early  attempts to make connections to probabilistic and other numeric approaches (such as expected  utility decision making). The key challenge is how to connect data -driven, often numeric methods  with knowledge -based, often qualitative methods, requiring new foundational, computational and  design research.   Machine Learning   Recent development in machine learning, and in particular deep learning and reinforcement  learning, hav e fueled enormous progress and excitement in the field of AI. Deep learning is  transforming both industry as well as science at a rapid pace due to improved image and audio  analysis tools, better natural language analysis methods such as machine translatio n, better planning  algorithms that have beaten the world champion at Go and so on. Yet, it behoves us to acknowledge  that there are many things we can not do very well yet. For instance, while deep learning is very  good at pattern recognition (‘fast thinking’), it is not yet very good at high level reasoning (‘slow  thinking’). Our models simply do not understand the world yet at a level that humans do, and this  lack of context makes it very hard for them to generalize to new situations at the same level as  humans do. For example, humans can effortly generalize from a single example, where ML  algorithms horribly fail. Humans can easily derive cause and effect by simply observing the data, ML  algorithms do not have that level of understanding. Machine learning  has not been able to perform  at the same level as humans in question -answering tasks which require high level reasoning. Upon  closer inspection, humans only achieve good performance at such tasks within domains in which  they have large amounts of reliable  background knowledge and understanding; one of the main  challenges therefore is to integrate such knowledge into machine learning algorithms. These  limitations point to interesting directions to extend machine learning: incorporating reasoning,  heuristic search, or causality and the laws of physics in our models, and incorporating the knowledge  of massive relational databases into our models. Also, making ML more data and compute efficient, 
12 perhaps by finding inspiration in natural intelligence, will const itute important progress. DeepMind’s  AlphaGo is a good example of the breakthrough that can be achieved when heuristic (Monte -Carlo)  search and deep (reinforcement) learning are combined successfully. We have the expertise in the  Netherlands that can bring these fields together and build a more comprehensive ML framework. An  important challenge in ML is to integrate pattern recognition techniques with higher level  knowledge such as reasoning, causality, knowledge graphs and simulators that model physical  constraints.     Many situations where AI will be applied in the near future, such as control of autonomous vehicles  of smart electricity grids, do not comply with the prevalent paradigm of supervised machine  learning. Notably, the ideal output (response) of th e system might not be known in all cases. Instead  a delayed, noisy reward is provided that serves as a learning signal. As such, data acquisition now  depends on the system’s own behavior, giving rise to exploration/exploitation trade- offs and the  danger of  self-fulfilling prophecies. Such problems can be modeled as reinforcement learning  problems . These problems pose two related challenges: First, data is typically only valid close to  current system behavior. Thus, as the system is learning data needs to be  collected periodically.  Learning rich behavior from small datasets is an important research challenge, that might involve  enriching this data set using simulated or virtual data. Second, to learn about regimes beyond  current system behavior, data also nee ds to be gathered using a variety of strategies besides the  best known strategy so far. Finding good 'exploration' strategies is a defining challenge in  reinforcement learning that might require optimizing such strategies in a data- driven way, while  constr aining them to satisfy constraints on safety, fairness, and explainability. Third, reinforcement  learning is currently compute and data inefficient. We need better learning algorithms that more  efficiently attribute reward to actions. A key challenge in de ep reinforcement learning is to make it  more data and computationally efficient.     A challenge that directly relates to responsible AI is uncertainty quantification. Current supervised  (deep) learning methods often provide no explicit quantification of their own uncertainty at all;  Bayesian supervised and reinforcement learning methods do, but their  quantification is often far  too optimistic: they “think” they perform better than they actually do. The challenge here is to  develop novel statistical technique s for reliable uncertainty quantification and incorporate them into  deep learning algorithms.    Natural Language Processing   The Dutch AI community includes a number of very strong NLP or more generally computational  linguistics research  (CL) groups, some o f which operate as applied technology groups in faculties of  arts and humanities, keeping a direct link to the field of linguistics and communication and  information sciences.22 Since the 1970s, Dutch computational linguistics has played a key role                                                              22 The following groups illustrate this strength: the Centre for Language and Speech Technology at the Faculty  of Arts at Radboud University, the Computational Lexicology group at the Department of Language, Literature  and Communication at VU University Amsterdam, the Language & Computation group at the Institute for  Logic, Language a nd Computation at the University of Amsterdam, the Computational Linguistics group at the  Faculty of Arts at the University of Groningen, the research group Language, Logic and Information at the  Utrecht Institute of Linguistics OTS, and the computational linguistics group at the Cognitive Science & AI  department at Tilburg University, and a special chair on Text Mining (UM).  
13 internat ionally, in machine translation, in parsing and dialogue systems, and have been pivotal in  introducing machine learning into computational linguistics. The community cannot be seen  separate from the speech technology community, working on automatic speech recognition and  synthesis, and the information retrieval and text mining community, with which it shares people,  models and history (e.g. statistical language modelling was popularised in information retrieval  through cross -pollination with Dutch CL researchers). The Netherlands has been at the forefront of   speech synthesis research in the 1980s and 1990s, and of building applications requiring automatic  speech recognition technology. Key challenges are dealing with the rich variation and cultural  differen ces in language use and communication at both the personal and group level, achieving  technological language -independence, and achieving naturalness in generated text and speech.     Development of conversational information seeking systems requires new resea rch (1) mixed  initiative search, where systems autonomously elicit from users, (2) user modeling, (3) automatically  generating information objects and descriptions of retrieval results, (4) stateful search, (5) dialog  systems capable of sustained multi- turn conversations, and (6) evaluation. Development of effective  online learning and evaluation methods requires (1) dedicated learning methods that are effective in  extremely large, non -stationary state and action spaces, (2) unsupervised objective functions  for  multi -turn retrieval, and (3) mixed methods approaches to retrieval and evaluation based on online,  counterfactual and simulation -based algorithms. In order to make such technology available to  everyone, speech interfaces are needed, for which an open  source, adaptive, language -independent  speech recognition system is required.   Multidisciplinary Challenges   Because AI systems will have a significant impact on our society, changing the way we work and the  way humans relate to machines. AI should be human -centered: the key to using Artificial Intelligence  effectively is to augment and assist humans, not to replace them. Figuring out how humans and AI  can collaborate effectively will have large economic and societal impact. It therefore is important to  rese arch and develop algorithms that have in -built properties that facilitate collaboration between  humans and machines to jointly perform advanced tasks. To fully address this challenge, a  fundamental step in AI research is required, that starts from the futu re human -AI relation. This also  introduces new research challenges and opportunities of a multidisciplinary nature. We identify  three multidisciplinary challenges for sustainable next -generation AI systems to which the Dutch AI  community can make strong co ntributions in the coming decade: These AI systems should be  socially -aware  to support collaboration, explainable  to be transparent, and responsible  so we can  account for the decisions made.   Socially -Aware AI   Technological developments over the past decades are reshaping artificial intelligence in various  ways, both concerning environments in which intelligent systems are being deployed and concerning  environments in which data is being collected. In particular, sustainable next -generation AI systems  should be able to understand and reason about their social context, allowing them to interact and  collaborate with human beings in order to achieve joint goals. Examples of systems that require this  ‘social’ ability  include smart environments (cities, buildings, rooms), social robots, wearable devices 
14 (e.g., for health tracking) and a range of handheld devices. Socially aware AI aims to leverage large scale, dynamic, continuous, and real -time sensory data as well as computational models of  physiological and cognitive processes to recognize individual behavior, discover group interaction  patterns, and support human collaboration. SInce human communication takes place primarily via  speech, natural language processing plays an important role in building socially -aware AI. Moreover  as emotions are fundamental in social interaction, this will also require modelling and the use of  artificial emotions to enable AI systems to detect and generate appropriate affective responses . The  main challenge is how to research and develop proactive and personalised AI systems that are  able to collaborate with humans.   Explainable AI  As AI systems such as robots and machine learning and decision making algorithms will significantly  affect th eir users, it is important to be able to explain how and why an AI system produced the effect  that it did. In many practical cases (e.g., healthcare) it matters how the results of a decision came  about and due to the increased complexity of AI systems some  form of explanation from such  systems will be required. It is a well- known hurdle for today's data -driven artificial intelligence that  the algorithms produced behave largely as black boxes. For instance, algorithms trained by extensive  data analysis using  state- of-the-art deep learning techniques perform well in terms of the input output function they represent, but it remains hard to make sense of the internal structure of the  learnt algorithms. In order to make progress, we believe that there is a need f or investing in  explainable AI, i.e., in data analysis and machine learning techniques that develop understanding of  the available data, e.g., in the form of complex knowledge structures. The aim is to design tools to  help make the inner workings of AI sys tems more transparent. This requires research in models that  are more open to explanation, techniques and models for generating satisfactory explanations, and  intelligible user interfaces for interacting with human users. The main challenge is how to devel op  advanced AI systems which can explain their rationale for how they perform sophisticated tasks.   Responsible AI   Today’s complex AI systems have become less predictable while at the same time their potential  impact on our society has increased. It therefo re is essential to be able to explore and assess the  real- world impact of AI and to help society to anticipate and control the effects of AI.23 In order to be  able to accept and trust these systems we will need tools and techniques to make sure these  system s will comply with our norms and standards and their operation is sufficiently transparent.  Data- driven artificial intelligence techniques are designed for, hence good at discovering patterns in  the data. Because of the aim of objective data analysis, both  wanted and unwanted patterns are  discovered. For instance, machine learning algorithms run the risk of adopting the same racial,  gender or other biases that humans have (e.g., ‘most nurses are female’). Even when such patterns  are present in the available  data, the consequences may have critical consequences for society.  What is needed is data analysis technology that can be steered normatively, so that the outcomes  meet ethical criteria. These techniques should e.g. comply with the FACT principle.24 This r equires                                                              23 See e.g. the Ethics & Society initiative  of Deepmind.   24 FACT refers to questions related to Fairness, Accuracy, Confidentiality and Transparency (see  http://www.responsibledatascience.org/ ). 
15 the balancing of objective, descriptive aims and subjective, normative aims (cf. what is common in  social sciences such as the law). Great impact can be expected from such ethical systems design  methods, also with the perspective of ever more auton omous weaponry and privacy -invading  investigative measures. New frameworks are needed that can guide us in identifying the moral  issues that arise due to the application of AI and help us determine the parameters that we as a  society want to be optimized i n these systems.  We need techniques that support verifying that the  behaviour of an AI system stays within those parameters. These techniques may also provide an  alternative when an AI system is not capable of yielding explanations.  The main challenge is  how to  process the abundance of available data in an efficient and sustainable manner and how to  develop AI systems which comply with our moral values to ensure responsible data processing.   Conclusion   Artificial Intelligence has become a disruptive force revolutionizing many fields in our economy and  society. This AI Manifesto has demonstrated the strength and potential of Dutch AI research but also  identifies the need for a national strategic AI agenda to be able to compete. If provided with  adequate reso urces, the outstanding and excellent Dutch AI educational system can provide the AI  talent we need. By creating a Dutch AI alliance, industry, academia, and government can stimulate  investments in AI nationally. By investing in AI infrastructure, the required resources for AI research  and development should be made available. Challenges in seven key AI foundational research areas  have been identified that will result in major breakthroughs. The Dutch AI research community is  well- positioned to contribute to  these challenges but faces increasing competition internationally.  Finally, three multidisciplinary challenges were identified that need to be addressed to ensure our  society is able to handle the changes brought about by next -generation AI systems.
