IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   7   © OECD 2022     Abstract   This work employs a novel approach to identify and characterise  firms adopting Artificial Intelligence (AI), using different sources of  large microdata. Focusing on the United Kingdom, the analysis  combines data on Intellectual Property Rights, website  information, online job postings, and firm -level financials  for the  first time . It shows that a significan t share of AI adopters is active  in Information and Communication Technolog ies and professional  services, and is located in the South of the United Kingdom ,  particularly  around London. Adopters tend to be highly productive  and larger than other firms, whil e young adopters  tend to hire AI  workers more intensively . Human capital appears to play an  important role, not only for AI adoption but also for firms’  productivity returns. Significant differences  in the characteristics of  AI adopters emerge when disting uishing between firms carry ing  out AI innovation, those with an AI core business, and those   searching for  AI talent .

L'analyse , centrée sur le Royaume -Uni, combine  pour la première fois des don nées sur les droits de propriété  intellectuelle, des informations extraites de sites internet , des  offres d'emploi en ligne et des données financières d’entreprises.  Elle montre qu'une part significative  des firmes adoptant  l'IA est  active dans les technol ogies de l'information et de la  communication et les services professionnels, et se situe au sud  du Royaume -Uni, plus particulièrement  autour de Londres. Les  adoptants ont tendance à être très productifs et de plus grande  taille que les autres entreprises,  tandis que les jeunes adoptants  semblent  embaucher davantage de travailleurs de l'IA. Le capital  humain parait  jouer un rôle important, non seulement pour  l'adoption de l'IA mais aussi pour le rendement de la productivité  des entreprises. Des différences significatives dans les  caractéristiques des adoptants de l'IA émergent  lorsqu'on  compare  les entreprises innovantes dans l’IA , celles qui ont une  activité principale liée à l'IA et celles qui recherchent des talents  dans ce domaine.

Die Analyse konzentriert sich  auf das Vereinigte Köni greich und kombiniert erstmals Daten zu  geistigen Eigentumsrechten, Website -Informationen, Online Stellenausschreibungen und Finanzdaten von Firmen .

Das Humankapital scheint eine  wichtige Rolle zu spielen, nicht nur für die Einführung von KI,  sondern auch für die Produktivitätsgewinne der Unternehmen.  Signifikante Unterschiede in den Merkmalen der KI -Anwender   ergeben sich, wenn man zwischen Unternehmen  unterscheidet,   die KI -Innovationen durchführen, die ein KI-Kerngeschäft haben  und die n ach KI -Talenten suchen.     
10  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     Executive Summary   Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a fast -growing technology with the potential to drive growth, to  transform the economic landscape and industries and to improve people’s lives. However,   evidence about its diffusion across firms is still relatively scant, especially beyond the United  States. This  work proposes a novel methodology based on big data allowing to identify AI  adopters and analyse s their characteristics, focusing here on data for the United Kingdom in  2019.    The approach combines different sources of large commercial and administrative microdata,  including Intellectual Property Rights, website information, online job postings, and firm -level  financials. Identification of AI adopters is based on a common set of  AI-related keywords  validated by the OECD. The data allow to focus on different margins of AI adoption,  distinguishing between firms that carry out AI innovation; companies that have an AI core  business; and other firms that require AI talent, and highlig hting the importance of using  complementary sources of information.   The analysis uncovers several stylised facts. AI adoption appears to some extent polarised,  both in terms of industry activity – with most firms operating in Informati on and Communication   Technology  and professional services – and geographical presence – with AI adopters  concentrated in the South of the United Kingdom.  Hiring of AI talent appears however more  widespread across sectors, providing evidence in favour of the general -purpose na ture of AI  technologies.   AI adopters tend to be leaders in terms of labour productivity in their industry. This may hint at  possible implications for existing divides across groups of firms – such as divergences between  leaders and laggards – as well as ac ross regions.   A coexistence of young -small and old -large AI adopters also emerges. Among different types  of AI adopters, firms that have AI at the core of their business are those with the largest share  of young -small adopters.   Exploring the intensive mar gin of AI adoption – using a proxy of AI -hiring intensity – further  highlights the role of AI professionals, for which a strong hiring demand is evident, and of young  firms, which tend to have on average higher AI -hiring intensity.   When comparing AI adopte rs with other likely non -adopting firms, significant scale advantages  emerge, with AI adopters being generally larger than other firms. AI adopters also tend to be  more productive, although these productivity premia – especially evident in market services –  do not necessarily imply a positive effect of AI on productivity. These can be rather related to  self-selection of more productive firms into AI adoption.   Human capital appears to play an important role for AI adoption. AI -related departments in  universi ties are found to increase the likelihood of using AI. Furthermore, among different  occupational groups, managers – as well as professionals – likely help translate AI use into  higher efficiency.   
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   11   © OECD 2022     Synthèse   L'intelligence artificielle (IA) est une technolo gie en plein essor avec le potentiel de stimuler la  croissance, de transformer le paysage économique et les industries et d'améliorer la vie des  gens. Cependant, les indications de sa diffusion au sein des entreprises sont encore  relativement rares, en par ticulier au delà des États -Unis. Ce travail propose une méthodologie  inédite, fondée sur les données de gros volume, visant à identifier et caractériser les adoptants  de l'IA, en se focalisant ici sur des données de 2019 pour le Royaume -Uni.    Cette approc he combine plusieurs sources conséquentes de microdonnées commerciales et  administratives, notamment sur les droits de propriété intellectuelle, les informations extraites  de sites Internet, les offres d'emploi en ligne et les données financières d’entrepr ises.  L’identification des adoptants de l'IA repose sur un socle de mots -clés liés à l'IA validés par  l'OCDE. Grâce à la complémentarité des sources d’information, les données permettent de  découper les phase d‘adoption de l'IA, en distinguant les entrepri ses innovantes en IA, celles  dont l‘activité principale est liée à l'IA et les autres entreprises qui recherchent des spécialistes  en matière d'IA.   Parmi les faits stylisés révélés par l'analyse, l'adoption de l'IA apparaît comme étant  relativement polari sée, que ce soit en termes d'activité industrielle - la plupart des entreprises  opérant dans le secteur des TIC et les services professionnels – comme en termes de présence  géographique - les adoptants de l'IA étant plutôt concentrés dans le sud du Royaume -Uni.  L'embauche de spécialistes en IA semble toutefois répartie dans tous les secteurs  économiques, signe de la polyvalence des technologies liées à l‘IA.   S’agissant de la productivité du travail, les entreprises adoptant l'IA ont tendance à être plus  performantes dans leur secteur, ce qui pourrait avoir un impact sur les clivages entre groupes  d'entreprises –entre leaders et retardataires – mais aussi entre régions.   L’analyse révèle également la coexistence de jeunes -petites et de vieilles -grandes entrep rises  parmi celles qui adoptent l'IA. Les entreprises avec l'IA comme activité principale comptent le  plus grand nombre de jeunes -petits adoptants.   La marge intensive de l'adoption de l'IA, évaluée par une approximation de l'intensité  d'embauche en IA, sou ligne le rôle des professionnels de l'IA, pour lesquels la forte demande  d'embauche est évidente, et celui des jeunes entreprises, ayant une intensité moyenne  d'embauche liée à l'IA plus élevée.   En compare les entreprises ayant adopté l'IA à d'autres entre prises susceptibles de ne pas  l'avoir adoptée, on constate des effets d'échelle significatifs, les entreprises ayant adopté l'IA  étant généralement plus grandes que les autres. Les adoptants de l'IA semblent également  plus productifs, bien que ces primes d e productivité - particulièrement prégnantes dans les  services marchands – n‘induisent pas nécessairement d‘effet positif de l'IA sur la productivité. 
12  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     Cela peut être lié au fait que les entreprises les plus productives auront davantage tendance à  adopter l 'IA.  Le capital humain paraît jouer un rôle important dans l'adoption de l'IA. On constate que la  présence de départements dédiés à l'IA dans les universités augmente la propension à utiliser  l'IA. En outre, entre les différents groupes professionnels, les  cadres - comme les spécialistes  - contribuent probablement à convertir l'utilisation de l'IA en efficacité accrue.  
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   13   © OECD 2022     Zusammenfassung   Künstliche Intelligenz (KI) ist eine schnell wachsende Technologie, die das Potenzial hat, das  Wachstum voranzutreiben, die Wirtschaftslandschaft und die Branchen zu verändern und das  Leben der Menschen zu verbessern. Allerdings gibt es immer noch relativ wenige Belege für  ihre Verbreitung in Unternehmen, insbesondere außerhalb der Vereinigten Staaten. In dieser  Arbeit wird ein e neuartige, auf großen Datenmengen  basierende Methodik vorgeschlagen, die  es ermöglicht, KI -Anwender zu identifizieren und ihre Merkmale zu analysieren, wobei der  Schwerpunkt auf den Daten für das Vereinigte Königreich im Jahr 2019 liegt.    Der Ansatz kombiniert verschiedene Quellen großer kommerzieller und administrativer  Mikrodaten, darunter Daten zu geistigen Eigentumsrechten , Website -Informationen, Online Stellenaus schreibungen und Finanzdaten von Firmen . Die Identifizierung von KI -Anwend ern  basiert auf KI-bezogene Schlüsselwörter , die von der OECD validiert wurden. Die Daten  ermöglichen es, sich auf verschiedene Bereiche der KI -Einführung zu konzentrieren, wobei  zwischen Unternehmen, die "KI -Innovationen" durchführen, Unternehmen, die ein  "KIKerngeschäft" haben, und anderen Unternehmen, die "KI -Talente" benötigen, unterschieden  wird, und zeigen, wie wichtig es ist, ergänzende Informationsquellen zu nutzen.   Die Analyse deckt mehrere stilisierte Fakten auf. Die Einführung von KI scheint zu  einem  gewissen Grad polarisiert zu sein, sowohl in Bezug auf die Branchenaktivität - die meisten  Unternehmen sind in Informations - und Kommunikationstechnologien und professionellen  Dienstleistungen tätig - als auch in Bezug auf die geografische Präsenz - die KI -Anwender findet  man besonders konzentriert im  Süden des Vereinigten Königreichs. Die Einstellung von KI Talenten scheint jedoch branchenübergreifend verbreitet zu sein, was für die allgemeine  Verwendbarkeit von KI -Technologien spricht.   KI-Anwender sind in der Regel f ührend in Bezug auf die P roduktivität in ihrer Branche. Dies  könnte auf mögliche Auswirkungen auf bestehende Unterschiede zwischen verschiedenen  Unternehmensgruppen - wie etwa zwischen Spitzenreitern und Nachzüglern - sowie zwischen  verschiedenen Regionen hindeuten.   Es zeigt sich auch eine Koexistenz von jungen, kleinen und alten, großen KI -Anwendern. Unter  den verschiedenen Arten von KI -Anwendern sind die Unternehmen, bei denen KI den Kern  ihres Geschäfts ausmacht, diejenigen mit dem gr ößten Anteil an jungen und kleinen  Anwendern.   Bei der Untersuchung der intensiven Marge der KI -Einführung - unter Verwendung eines Proxys  für die KI -Einstellungsintensität - wird die Rolle von KI -Fachkräften, für die offensichtlich eine  starke Einstellungs nachfrage besteht, und von jungen Unternehmen, die im Durchschnitt eine  höhere KI -Einstellungsintensität aufweisen, noch deutlicher.   Beim Vergleich von KI -Firmen  mit anderen Unternehmen, die wahrscheinlich keine KI  einführen, ergeben sich erhebliche Grö ßenvorteile, da KI -Anwender  im Allgemeinen größer 
14  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     sind als andere Unternehmen. KI -Anwender sind auch tendenziell produktiver, obwohl diese  Produktivitätsvorteile - insbesondere bei Marktd ienstleistungen - nicht unbedingt eine positive  Auswirkung der KI auf di e Produktivität bedeuten. Sie können vielmehr auf die Selbstselektion  produktiverer Unternehmen bei der Einführung von KI zurückzuführen sein.   Das Humankapital scheint eine wichtige Rolle bei der Einführung von KI zu spielen. Es hat sich  gezeigt, dass KI -bezogene Abteilungen an Universitäten die Wahrscheinlichkeit des Einsatzes  von KI später erhöhen. Darüber hinaus tragen unter den verschiedenen Berufsgruppen  Führungskräfte - wie auch Fachkräfte - wahrscheinlich dazu bei, den Einsatz von KI in eine  höhere E ffizienz umzusetzen.  
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   15   © OECD 2022     Artificial Intelligence (AI) is rapidly reshaping economies and societies  (OECD, 2019 [1]). It has   the potential to drive growth, to transform the economic landscape and industries , and to  improve people’s lives.    Relevantly , AI is often considered  a general -purpose technology (GPT) . As such, given  improvements over time and potential breadth and depth of its penetration, AI may significantly  affect productivity and growth over the next decades.  Furthermore, it can importantly affect  other economic outcomes. It is already changing the demand for jobs and skills, and is going to  possibly help tackle societal challenges such as  climate change. During the recent COVID -19  pandemic, AI systems have been crucial to monitor the evol ution of the outbreak and guide   policy responses.   Identifying which firms are adopting AI and studying their characteristics becomes therefore  particular ly relevant from an economic policy perspective. This may shed light on the factors  enabling or preventing this recent stage of digital transformation, help characterise AI diffusion  patterns, and better understand the implications of such diffusion for ec onomic outcomes.   However, although very recently growing beyond the United States, studies analysing the  diffusion of AI across firms are still in their infancy. This is generally due to the existence of  significant challenges in data availability and meas urement.   In this context, this work proposes and employs a novel approach to identify and characterise  AI adopters, combining different sources of large commercial and administrative microdata.    The approach is applied to data from the United Kingdom, a co untry for which, at our knowledge,  there is still limited empirical evidence1 despite the importance of AI in the UK policy debate,  highlighted for instance by the 2021 UK National AI Strategy.2   First, this work identifies AI adopters based on a common se t of AI -related keywords, developed  and validated by previous OECD work (Baruffaldi et  al., 2020 [2]), relying on and combining three  different sources of data: i) AI -related Intellectual Property Rights ( IPRs ), which c apture firms  innovating in AI or embedding AI in their goods or services ; ii) AI-related  activities as stated on  company websites ; and iii) the demand for AI -related  skills contained in online job postings by  employers .3   Second, data on AI adopters are matched with firm -level financial statements that contain   information on their characteristics , such as firm size, age, detailed sector of activity or location  of the headquarters, and that allow computing proxies of productivity .  Combining these data  sources provides a unique dataset with complementary information on  AI adoption , allowing to focus on its different margins. In particular, it allows  distinguish ing three   subgroups of AI adopters :4 those that carry out  AI innovation ; non-innovators that mentio n AIrelated keywords  on their website , which we suppose are companies that  have an AI core  business; and other firms that require  AI talent.  Based on these data, the descriptive analysis 1 Introduction  
16  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     provides interesting  stylised facts  about the characteristics of AI adopters, based on the most  recent information .  A polarisation of AI adoption emerges , both in terms of industry activity – with most firms  operating in Information and Communication Technology ( ICT) and professional servic es – and  geographical presence – with AI adopters concentrated in the South of the U nited Kingdom .  The latter is not surprising  given UK’s geographic concentration of industrial activity.  Hiring of  AI talent appears however more widespread across sectors, providing evidence in favour of the  general -purpose nature of AI technologies.   Furthermore, AI adopters tend to be leaders in their industry ( in terms of labour productivity ),  with possible implications for existing divides across groups of firms ( leaders vs. laggards ) and  regions. A coexistence of young -small and old -large AI adopters also emerges , and among  firms that tend to have AI at the core of their business, most of those identified by the current  analysis are young and small.   Exploring the intensiv e margin of AI adoption using a proxy of AI -hiring intensity further  highlights  the role of AI professionals, for which a strong demand is evident, and of young firms,  which tend to have higher AI -hiring intensity.   When comparing AI adopters with other lik ely non -adopting firms, significant scale advantages  emerge, with AI adopters generally being larger than other firms. AI adopters also tend to be  more productive  than other firms , although these productivity premia – especially evident in  market services – do not necessarily imply a positive effect of AI on productivity , i.e. cannot be  interpreted causally, but can also be related to self -selection of more productive firms into AI  use.  Human capital appears to play an important role for AI adoption. Proxim ity to AI-related  universities , i.e., universities that have AI-related keywords present on their website , seem to  increase the likelihood of using AI. Among different occupational groups, managers as well as  professionals appear to play an important role,  likely helping translate AI use into higher  efficiency.   Although largely exploratory, to our knowledge this is the most ambitious effort combining  different commercial and administrative data sources to study AI adoption in firms, overcom ing  the limitati ons imposed by  single data  sources . The approach adopted builds upon the long standing experience of the OECD in string and name matching and  can be  scaled  to other  countries  beyond the United Kingdom.   The analysis builds upon and extends ongoing and previous OECD work analysing AI  developments5 and complements analysis based on – often confidential – ICT surveys (in  particular, the ongoing cross -country OECD AI diffuse  project6).  
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   17   © OECD 2022     AI is a rapidly growing techn ology, with strong potential to affect productivity  and other economic  outcomes ,7 but it is conceptually different from other  types of  innovation. Indeed, given the depth  and breadth of its possible penetration, it is often considered  a GPT (see for inst ance  discussions in Trajtenberg (2018 [3]); Crafts (2021 [4]); Brynjolfsson  et al. (2021 [5])). GPTs are  characterised by pervasiveness, improvements over time, innovation spawning and spillover   effects  (Jovanovic and Rousseau, 2005 [6]), but require complementary investments in intang ible  assets that may take time to materialise before translating  technology use  into productivity gains  (Brynjolfsson, Rock and Syverson, 2021 [5]).   However, despite the strong potential of AI and its  relevance in economic and policy  discussions, there is still  scarce evidence about its diffusion across firms, and on the  characteristics of firms using AI. This is mainly due to the paucity of AI firm -level data.   One recent strand of the literature has b een analysing firm -level data that contain relevant  information on AI use, in particular official national ICT surveys and custom data. Official  national ICT surveys have recently started to integrate questions asked to firms concerning their  use of AI (se e for example Zolas et al. (2020 [7]) focusing on the U nited States ; Rammer et al.  (2022 [8])on Germany; Cho et al. (2022 [9]) on Korea; Calvino and Fontanelli (2022 [10]) on  France).8 Ongoing OECD work complementary to this paper is also exploiting microdata from  ICT surveys in a cross -country perspective based on harmonised statistical code ( AI diffuse   project , see Calvino and Fontanelli  (2022 [11])). This literature has suggested that the use of AI  technologies is still limited and heterogeneous across sectors and groups of firms. AI use  appears prevalent among larger firms, in line with the existence of fixed costs or with the  importance of complementary assets and economies of scale.   Custom data also contain information about selected categories of imported capital goods, a nd  may allow to identify episodes of AI investments. In this context, Domini et al. (2022 [12]) focus  on the role of AI for labour demand and highlight that adoption events are not related to  increa ses in wage inequality or gender wage gaps in France.   A different part of the literature has instead focused on analysing the process of AI diffusion  based on keywords able to identify AI developments.  In this context, Baruffaldi et al. (2020 [2])  created a detailed three -pronged keyword -based approach to identify AI developments in  science, algorithms and technologies. The list  of keywords used to search for AI -related patents  and scientific papers  includes terms  related to subject areas, such as  automated recognition of  patterns , neural networks, robotics, and autonomous vehicles  (e.g. image or speech   recognition , convolutional neural network , humanoid robot  or unmanned aerial vehicle ).9 Their  approach relies on established bibliometric and patent -based methods, complemented by  machine learning (ML) implemented on open source software data, in order to produce an  encompassing operational definition of AI.10  2 Existing evidence on AI adoption by  firms  
18  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     A related stream of work has focused more closely on analysing texts (or technology classes)  of patent documents to identify AI -related  inventions and thus AI -related firms. In fact, p atents  play an important role in the protection of innovations  and they are increasingly being utilised  to pr otect AI -related technological developments.11 Using the  United States Patent and  Trademark Office  (USPTO ) patent data, Alderucci et al. (2020 [13]) find a statistically significant  and positive relationship between a firm pat enting an AI innovation and higher employment,  better productivity (higher value -added per employee) and fewer production workers. They also  find that the strength of the relationship grows over the years following the initial innovation ,  which could be related to potential learning effects, adjustment costs, and the role of  complementary investments .   Relatedly, combining USPTO patent applications published between 2002 -19 with compa ny  accounts, Santarelli et al. (2022 [14]) map the knowledge base cent red on robotics and AI. Their  analysis shows that such knowledge base is linked to the previous technological paradigm  (see  also Igna and Venturini (2022 [15])), and that  it is highly  pervasive, highlighting that robotics and  AI are strictly related.  Damioli et al. (2021 [16]) focus instead on 5 ,257 companies worldwide that  filed at least one AI -related patent betwee n 2000 -16 and find AI patent applications to have  a  positive impact  on firm labo ur productivity, especially on smaller firms  and services industries.    Beyond patents, other IPRs may contain useful information to analyse AI activity. In particular,  trademar ks can shed light on the extent to which (new) companies and products appearing on  the market rely on, exploit or propose AI -related  goods and services. In this cont ext, Nakazato  and Squicciarini (2021 [17]) exploit trademark applications filed at the  European Union Intellectual  Property Office  (EUIPO ), the Japan Patent Office ( JPO) and the USPTO over the period 2009 18 and show that AI -related goods and services have expanded in consumer markets in recent  years, espe cially protecting  computer -related products or services , such as software or  audio visual devices . Combining AI -related patents and trademarks, Dernis et al. (2021 [18]) highlight  that developments of AI technologies, goods and services is mainly due to start -ups or large  incumbents, located in selected countries, with a majority of actors operating in ICT -related  sectors.   A different source of information to identify AI -active f irms consist in their online presence.  Some  firms indeed highlight their  AI activities by mentioning them on their websites . In this context,  Dernis et al. (forthcoming [19]) focus  on UK firms that have stated on th eir websites to be  active  in the AI space. These firms  appear  relatively small (less than 10 employees) and young (less  than 5 years old). This could indicate that companies specialis ing in AI, are more likely to be  smaller and younger start -ups compared t o the older established firms that have AI -related  patents.   A final source to identify AI activity by firms that has been more extensively exploited by recent  work is related to their d emand for AI -related skills . Indeed, in order t o develop and adopt AI  technologies firms need specialised human capital. Hence, looking at labour featuring AI -related  skills may help shed light on the use of AI technologies  (Tambe, 2013 [20]). Using tools  like ML  algorithm s and AI -related keywords, such as the ones found in Baruffaldi et al.  (2020 [2]), a  number of papers including Alekseeva et al.  (2020 [21]; 2021 [22]), Babina et al.  (2020 [23]),  Squicciarini and Nachtigall (2021 [24]) and Samek et al. (2021 [25]) identify AI -related skills and  jobs in onl ine job postings data from Lightcast™  (formerly known as Burning Glass   Technologies) . Part of this analysis focuses on job postings rather than firms and highlights  that, as AI permeates the economy, it moves into new sectors and AI skills are demanded in  relation to a wider range of occupations, firms and industries.  
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   19   © OECD 2022     More closely to this work, AI -related job postings have also been used to focus more directly on  AI-active firms. In this context, Alekseeva et al. (2021 [22]) use Lightcast™  data for the United  States  to determine the effe cts on a firm from adopting AI .12 They document a positive  association between AI adoption and a firm’s growth in sales, capital expenditures and  investments , driven b y AI skills among managers . Using both Lightcast™  job posting and  resume data from C ognism Inc., also Babina et al. (2020 [23]) find that US firms inve sting more  in AI (i.e., hiring AI -skilled labour) were more likely to see an increase in sales, employment,  and market share. Similarly to Alekseeva et al. (2021 [22]), they  do not find evidence that investing  in AI makes firms more  productive , consistently with the need of complementary investments   that may take time before fully materialising . Conversely, Bäck et al. (2022 [26]) find a positive  association between AI and productivity, observable for l arger firms only and after a sufficient  time lag , when combin ing online job postings data (from commercial job advertisement platform  Oikotie Oy's ) and firm-financials (from Orbis ©) in Finland.   This work goes beyond the existing literature by exploiting more comprehensively the potential  of methods to identify AI adopters based on keywords, taking a firm -level perspective  and  relevantly combining different sources of information  that allow  distinguishing different margins  of AI adoption . Beyond  the work of Baruffaldi et al. (2020 [2]), which however focuses on AI  developments in science, algorithms and technologies,  and to some extent of Bloom et al.  (2021[27]), which analyses the diffusion patterns of disruptive technologies in the United States,   to our knowledge  no contribution has combined  information from  several different sources  to  this extent.   Combining data  on AI activity at the firm level  with information on firm financials in order to study  AI diffusion and the characteristics of AI adopters appears particularly promising also  considering that official s urveys contain only a limited set of questions on AI use, and those  tend to be available  only in selected years . In addition, surveys and custom data are often  confidential . Furthermore, although informative, u sing IP -based  method s alone may  limit the  identification of AI activity only to a subset of AI firms , which generally represent  the mo st  innovative ones .13  Similarly, using only information on skill demand  or web scraping may allow  capturing only some aspects of AI diffusion, more related to new hires or web presence, while  combining more data sources together would offer a unique and more comprehensive outlook  about AI use by firms.   The proposed methodolog y, together with information about the different data sources, and the  details concerning the matching procedure are discussed in the next section.  
20  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     This section presents  a scalable  multifaceted approach to identify different types of A I adopters.   First, the rationale and detailed data sources are discussed. Second, the process of how the  information from each data source is linked to characterise those actors  is explained .   This work  builds upon and extends the work by Dernis et al. (2021 [18]), Samek et al. (2021 [25]),  Squicciarini and Nachtigall (2021 [24]), Nakazato and Squicciarini (2021 [17]) and Dernis et al.   (forthcoming [19]) that have  also used some of the sources of information but never combined all  of them together .   Identifying and linking AI adopters from different data sources   This work identifies UK AI adopters based on a common set of AI -related keywords, developed  and v alidated by previous OECD work, which include, for instance, machine learning, natural  language processing or neural network (Baruffaldi et  al., 2020 [2]).14 The approach relies on and  combin es three different sources of information : i) AI-related IPRs, which capture firms  innovating in AI or embedding AI in their goods or services ; ii) the demand for AI -related  skills  contained in online job postings by employers; and iii) AI-related  activities as stated on company  websites . It then links those data to company accounts in order to characterise the most recent  patterns of AI adoption.   The following paragraphs pro vide a brief overview of the different data sources used to identify   and characterise  AI adopters, with further details available in Annex A .   First, AI -related IPRs provide key information to identify  firms  carrying out AI innovation. Given  the very natur e of patents, firms applying for AI -related patents can be considered as AI  innovators since they aim at protecting AI -related technological advancements. Patents  however do not capture all AI -related innovative activity, and patentability of AI -related  technologies varies across countries.15 Using trademark data relevantly complements the  picture about AI -related innovators. Registering an AI -related trademark suggests that firms are  relying on branding strategies to signal to their customers that they prod uce or sell goods and  services embedding AI. A number of studies performed over the last decade show that  trademarks are related to different types of innovations (to process innovation in particular ), and  are generally used to signal firms’ innovativeness  to current and prospect ive customers  (see  for instance Arora, Bei and Cohen (2016 [28]); Castaldi, Block and Flikkema (2019 [29])).   Data on  AI-related IPRs are sourced from the Intellectual Property (IP) database of the OECD  STI Microdata lab, using the same methodology and building upon the work of Dernis et al.  (2021 [18]), where additional information is also available . Data refer to AI -related patent  applications (IP5 patent families) or trademarks registered at the EUIPO, JPO and the USPTO  between the early 2000s and 2018.  AI-related patents are identified  using the AI -related  keywords  identified by Baruffaldi et al . (2020 [2]) as well as the International Patent Classification  (IPC) and Cooperative Pate nt Classification (CPC) classes, while AI-related trademarks are 3 Methodology and data  
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   21   © OECD 2022     identified following Nakazato and Squicciarini (2021 [17]), who build on Baruffaldi et al . (2020 [2])  as well as other IP -based analyses.   Company websites are the second key source of information to identify f irms’ AI activity. In fact,  AI-related keywords mentioned on company websites are relevant indicators of firm activity,  and can suggest that AI may be  central to the company business model.  This work therefore  exploits web -reading data provided by GlassAI - a UK software development company - to  identify AI on websites, using the same approach used by Dernis et al. (forthcoming [19]). In  particular, GlassAI was provided with the keywords described in Baruffaldi et al. (2020 [2]) to  identify AI activity. The web -reading exercise has been conducted in 2020. Where available,  the information retrieved by GlassAI goes beyond entities’ name and website and also covers  location, company registration number, and sector.   Third, AI -related online job postings are able to capture the extent to which firms are demanding  AI talent (skills), responding to the changes in labour and skills demand brought by the diffusion  of AI.16 In order to ident ify the demand for AI -related skills, this work uses data provided by  Lightcast™ . Lightcast™  is a well -known data provider collecting online vacancy data through  web-scraping. This has been widely used in the literature, as also highlighted in the previous   section. Lightcast™  relies on over 40 000 distinct job boards and company websites and is  active in many English -speaking and European countries, notably the United Kingdom . It claims  to cover the near -universe of all online job postings and provides deta iled information on labour  and skill – including AI -skill – demand posted online. This information is then cleaned, structured  and standardised. AI -related job postings have been identified according to the methodology  described in Squicciarini and Nachtig all (2021 [24]), which builds upon the work of Baruffaldi et  al. (2020 [2]), and then aggregated at the employer level to identify firms hiring AI -related human  capital. Import antly, the data also contain information on location and international occupation  classifications , which are used in the analysis. Data used in this work span over the period  2012 -20.  Based on the information above, it is possible to identify a comprehensi ve set of AI adopters.  In particular, a firm is tagged as an AI adopter if any of the following conditions applies : i) having  applied for or registered an AI -related patent or trademark during the observed period; ii) having  at least one AI -related job pos ting during the observed period; iii) mentioning AI -related  keywords on their website at the time of web reading.17  Combining different data can not only broaden the scope of previous analyses that have  considered one source of information about AI at the t ime, but importantly provide s additional  insights about different margins of AI adoption.   In particular, based on the abovementioned sources, three (mutually -exclusive) groups of AI  adopters can be further identified: i) those that carry out AI innovation  (i.e., those that apply for  AI-related patents or register AI -related trademarks) ; ii) non-innovators that mention AI -related  keywords in their website, which supposedly are  companies that have an AI core business; and  iii) other firms that demand AI tale nt, i.e. the residual group of firms posting AI -related jobs online  (see also Figure 3.1 below for a graphical representation).18 
22  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     Figure  3.1. Different groups of AI adopters     Notes : Data sources (IPRs, Job postings , and Websites) are reported outside, whereas group names of AI adopters (AI  innovation, AI core business, and AI talent) identified in the respective data source are reported inside the Venn diagram.   Sources: Authors’ elaboration.   In order to char acterise AI adopters, the data are further combined with information on firms’  financial accounts (see Annex A  for further details).  This is sourced from Bureau van Dijk’s  (BvD) Orbis ©, a widely used commercial database that aggregates company accounts and   financial reports across countries. It covers almost 400 million companies and entities worldwide  of which around 41 million contain detailed financial information. Orbis © contains relevant  information on firm characteristics, such as size, age, detailed sector of activity, and location of  headquarters, and allows computing proxies of firm -level productivity. The same data source  has been indeed used by several OECD and academic papers focusing on firm dynamics and  productivity (e.g., Andrews et al. (2016 [30]); see also Bajgar et al. (2020 [31]) for a critical  discussion  about this data19). The latest available year with comprehensive coverage at the time  of writing is 2019 , which is the year for which the characterisation of AI adopters is carried out.    The current analysis, exploratory in nature, focuses on the United Kingdom, a country for which  all sources of relevant  data are  available and  generally of good quality and for which, to our  knowledge, limited evidence on AI adopters and their characteristics exists , despite the  importance of AI in the UK policy debate . In the future, t he analysis could be further scaled to  other countries for which relevant data are availabl e or may become available. In fact, AI -related  IPRs tend to be available across several countries; with patenting rates highest in the United  States followed by Japan, Korea and  the People’s Republic of  China  (Dernis et  al., 2021 [18]).  Information from company websites can , in principle , be retrieved beyond the U nited Kingdom   (see, for instance , Kinne and Axenbeck’s  (2019 [32]) study on innovation in firms from company  websites) whereas i nformation on AI talent from job postings is already available for a number  of Anglo -Saxon and European countries (Squicciarini and Nachtigall, 2021 [24]; Samek,  Squicciarini and Cammeraat, 2021 [25]; Pouliakas, 2021 [33]; Acemoglu et  al., 2022 [34]). Orbis  covers a wide range of countries, although the representativeness of the data differs  significantly across them  (see Bajgar et al . (2020 [31]) for further discussion).   
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   23   © OECD 2022     Matching the data in practi ce  After presenting the different data sources used in this work, this subsection briefly summarises  the actual matching of those data as well as its quality. A  detailed summary of  the data cleaning   and matching  process as well as a description of the  remaining challenges associated with the  implemented approach are provided in Annex A.   Matching all data sources together is far from being a trivial exercise and involves significant  conceptual, data and computational challenges. The matching exercise has built upon the long standing experience of the OECD in string and name matching, also using software developed  ad-hoc. This has been an iterative exercise that has involved different methods and software.   First,  organisation names are harmonised and source data cleaned, within each different  source. Then the harmonised names are compared using a series of string -matching algorithms  – mainly token -based and string -metric -based, such as  token frequency matching and  Levenshtein (1966 [35]) as well as Jaro -Winkler (1999 [36]) distances.20 Whenever possible and to  address multiple matches, websites , company  registration numbers , postcodes and/or sectoral  information have also been exploited (in the case of GlassAI, registration numbers are indeed  the primary matching criterion) in addition to names. The outcome of the matching is  represented visually in Figure 3.2 and Figure 3.3.   Figure  3.2. AI adopters across different data sources     Note s: The sum reflects the number of firms tha t have been identified as AI adopters after the harmonisation and cleaning  exercises  (6,761  firms in Lig htcast™, 2,245  in GlassAI and 1,178  in IPRs).   Source s: Authors’ own compilation based on GlassAI (January 2021), Lightcast™  (February 2021), IPR s (STI Micro -data Lab:  IntellectualPropertyDatabase, http://oe.cd/ipstats, July 2020) and Orbis © (version 2.2020 , Bureau van Dijk, April 2021) .  Figure 3.2 focuses on the composition and overlapping among the data sources identifying AI  adopters, both in absolute numbers and percentages. It is evident from the figure that the  different data sources on AI adoption  turn out to be highly complementary , being likely related  to different margins of AI adoption. This highlights the i mportance of using more than one source  of information  when shedding light on a phenomenon, like AI diffusion, that is dynamic and  multi -facete d in nature.21  
24  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     Figure 3.3 shows that matching rates with Orbis © are overall more than satisfactory, with always  more than two thirds of firm names uniquely matched to Orbis ©. Matching rates are close to  95% for GlassAI, also thanks to the availability of company registration numbers. In IPRs and  online job postings, lower matching rates can also reflect the fact that – despite the cleaning  efforts – not all private individuals (IPRs) and universities (job postings and IPRs) were removed  before matching, me chanically increasing the shares of unmatched cases. Shares of multiple  matches are very low, reflecting the extensive and iterative efforts made to try to solve those  cases as much as possible.    Before getting to the final database that will be used for a nalysis, additional cleaning steps are  implemented. Multiple matches  are excluded from the AI adopters group, taking a conservative  approach. As will be clear in the next sections, the analysis is however robust to including those  among AI adopters.  Finall y, in line with existing studies based on Orbis© (e.g. Andrews et al.   (2016 [30])), a conventional sectoral filtering is implemented, focusing on the non -farm business  economy (i.e., NACE Rev.2 division levels 5 to 8 2) in the rest of the analysis.   Figure  3.3. Matching rates with Orbis  by source of information on AI activity     Note s: The sum reflects the number of firms tha t have been identified as AI adopters after the harmonisation and cleaning  exercises (6,761 firms in Lightcast™ , 2,245 in GlassAI and 1,178 in IPR s).

As already evident  from the previous discussion, w hile the multi -perspective approach proposed  provides  comprehensive ins ights into the identification of AI actors and their characteristics,  some challenges still remain , which mainly stem from  data availability and from  the  characteristics of the databases we rely upon  (see also Annex A) .  In particular , it is clear that – despite all the efforts – it is not possible to claim that this  methodology allows to identify each and every single  AI adopter in the United Kingdom.  In fact,  not every single AI adopter  may have applied for AI -related IPRs, posted AI -related jobs online,  or mentioned AI -related keywords on its website. The set of AI adopters identified is however  considerable and the proposed methodology allows to significantly extend the scope of analysis  beyond existing work based on fewer data sources.   
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   25   © OECD 2022     Having combined data from AI -related IPRs, online job postings, and information on company  websites with firm -level financial accounts, this section now focuses on analysing the  characteristics of AI adopters.  The analysis focuses on AI adopters  for which information on  their characteristics is available in 2019, the latest available year with comprehensive coverage  in Orbis©.22 This is aimed at providing the most recent available picture about their  characteristics.23   Some b asic descriptive statistics are reported in Table 4.1 below. Those provide a starting point  for the characterisation and already highlight significant heterogeneity in age and size across  the different groups of AI adopters.24 More specifically, the table already shows that firms with  AI as their core business appear on average much smaller as well as younger, and have lower  turnover than firms innovating in AI or searching for AI talent. Albeit substantial differences in  terms of size, the latter two appear more similar in terms of age and turnover.   Table  4.1.

The remainder of the section analyses  the characteristics of AI adopters, focusing on their  sector of activity , geographical location (proxied by the location of the headquarter s), size, age,  and position along  the productivity distribution . The  aim is to provide  a set of stylised facts on  AI adoption , based on the novel data collected and matched.  4 Exploring the cha racteristics of AI  adopters  
26  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     This is done not only focusing on all AI adopters, but also distinguishing among different types  of AI adopters, using the three groups defined in th e previous section (“AI innovation”, “AI core  business”, and “AI talent”).   While the core of the analysis focuses  on the extensive margin  of AI adoption, as identified in  the previous section, two additional exploratory exercises are also carried out.   The first exercise consists in e xploring the intensive margin of AI adoption for a subset of firms ,  for which this is possible. In particular, Lightcast™  job posting data can be used to build proxies  of the extent to which firms are hiring more intensively AI talent, exploring further the  characteristics of those firms.   The second one focuses instead on analysing differences between AI adopters and other  businesses, likely non -adopters. This is carried out exploiting – in a regression framework –  other firms in  Orbis © as a comparison group for the identified AI adopters. Further details are  discussed in the following subsections.   Fact 1 - Most AI adopters are in ICT and professional services   When analysing the sectoral distribution of AI adopters, it is evident that most of them operate  in ICT and professional services. Indeed, as shown in Figure 4.1, about 40%  of all AI adopters  are in ICT ser vices sectors (ISIC Rev.4 58 -63). While this sector accounts for a relatively small  share of the economy (around 10%), AI  adopters appear particularly concentrated in this  sector.25 This is followed by professional and scientific activities  (ISIC Rev.4 69 -75), which  account for about 21% of AI adopters.   Figure  4.1. AI adopters by broad sector of activity   All AI adopters, United Kingdom, 2019     Note s: NACE classifications are constructed using the NACE2 (4 digit level) classification reported in Orbis © for the year 2019.

Focusing on different groups of adopters (Figure 4.2) provides additional interesting insights,  which are also re levant to keep in mind when interpreting the rest of this characterisation  section.   
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   27   © OECD 2022     Unsurprisingly, adopters engaged in “AI core business” and “ AI innovation”  appear m ore  concentrated in ICT sectors. Furthermore, a  larger proportion of AI innovators  is active in  manufacturing  if compared with other groups of AI adopters. This may be to some extent related  to the very nature of patent data that, together with trademarks, is the main source of information  for this group.   Adopters belonging to the group “AI t alent” are instead more spread across sectors. Although  this excludes AI innovators and AI -core businesses , which tend to be in ICT sectors, this seems  to provide further support to consider AI as a GPT.    Figure  4.2. AI adopters by type and broad sector of activity   United Kingdom, 2019      Note s: NACE classifications are constructed using the NACE2 (4 digit level) classification reported in Orbis © for the year 2019.

Fact 2 - AI adopters are concentrated in the South  of the UK , especially  around London   Focusing on the locat ion of AI adopters  highlights that they tend to be located in the S outh of  the U nited Kingdom. In fact, as evident in Figure 4.3, which shows the number of AI adopters  by travel -to-work area (TTWA),26 the large majority of AI adopters are found in and aroun d  London (e.g. , Luton, Heathrow or Reading) . Other noteworthy AI hubs appear to be  in  Cambridge and Oxford , possibly also due to proximity to universities and hence research  activities.   This does  not seem to be exclusively due to the fact that the location  information  used  refers to   firm headquarters , which may be typically located around the capital . Indeed, when replicating  the same heat map  but using job posting s’ location information available for the subset of  Lightcast™  firms,  patterns remain  qualitatively similar.27 This is also i n line with previous  findings relying solely on job postings data (Samek, Squicciarini and Cammeraat, 2021 [25]) and  is not unexpected,  considering  United Kingdom ’s concentration o f economic activity  in those  identified regions, in particular in ICT and services (OECD, 2022 [37]) and its unequal distribution  of skills across different geographical areas  (OECD, 202 0[38]).

Figure 4.4 plots instead,  for each group of AI adopters, their geographical distribution across  the United Kingdom. While all groups remain geographically concentrated in the South of the  United Kingdom and around London, a closer look at the figures shows that 43% of firms with  “AI core business” are in London, compared to only 33% of those engaging in “AI innovation”;  and 36% of the ones looking for “AI talent”.

Fact 3 – There is s ignificant heterogeneity in AI adopters’  age and  employment size  Analysing the age and size distributions of AI adopters highlights significant heterogeneity  across firms. This is already evident when focusing on  all AI adopters in Figure 4.5, which shows  a substantial co -existence of young and old adopters, as well as small and larger ones.28  This is even clearer when distinguishing among different groups of adopters. In particular,  Figure 4.6 shows that firms in the group “AI core business” are typically young and small, while  there exists a significant p olarisation between old -large AI adopters and young -small firms for  the groups “AI innovation” and “AI talent”.29 These findings are in  line with previous and ongoing  work by Dernis et al.  (2021 [18]) and Dernis  et al. (forthcoming [19]).

32  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     Fact 4 – AI adopters tend to be  concent rated at the top of the sectoral   productivity distribution   Studying the relative performance of AI adopters in terms of labour productivity suggests that  they tend to be more prevalent among firms at the top of the labour productivity distribution.  Indeed,  Figure 4.7 plots the share of firms belonging to different percentiles of sector -specific  distributions of (operating revenues) turnover over employment, a simple proxy of labour  productivity used in this exploratory work. The figure shows that more than  one third of all AI  adopters  is in the top 10% of the productivity distribution , and about a nother third is in the 60 th90th percentile .31 This is also true when considering manufacturing and services separately  (see Figure A B.4 in Annex B).   Figure  4.7. Shares of AI adopters by percentiles of the productivity distribution   All AI adopters, United Kingdom, 2019     Notes: Productivity classes are constructed within SNA A 38 sectors using a proxy of labour pr oductivity (operating revenue  turnover over number of employees ).

As shown in Figure 4.8, AI firms confirm to be productivity leaders in their sectors also when  focusing on different groups of AI adopters. This is particularly true for firms engaged in “AI  innovation” and in search of “AI talent”, while less so for firms in the “AI core business” group.  Indeed, the previous discu ssion also suggests the latter group is mainly composed of young small firms in the ICT sector that may still have to realise their full potential in terms of  productivity.

The relatively higher presence of AI adopters at the top of productivity distributions does not  necessarily mean that AI use has a positive effect on productivity. These findings are purely  descriptive and may hint at the existence of selection  dynamics, in  which already  most  productive firms select into AI use. Additional analysis on AI adoption and productivity is also  carried out in the following subsections.   These findings may have relevant implications for the evolution of productivity  divides between  most productive firms  and the rest , which have been already growing across many OECD  countries in the past decades (Andrews, Criscuolo and Gal, 2016 [30]). Furthermore, given the  geographical distribution of AI adoption outlined above and their concentration around London,  these findings may also have implications for regional disparities within the United Kingdom .  Further exploring the intensive margin of AI adoption   So far the analysis  has focused on the characteristics  of AI adopters, which were  comprehensively identified using different data sources. A related but yet underexplored  question is whether there exists some heterogeneity in the patterns of AI adoption across firms,  and whether AI adopters differ in the inte nsity with which they use AI. A first consideration of  this question is possible with a subset of the database built for the current analysis.   In particular, online job postings ( Lightcast™ ) allow observing the extent to which different firms  are demandin g AI talent, which can be a proxy of increasing specialisation in AI, possibly hinting  at higher AI intensity in the future, or longer -term commitment to AI.   In this context, a proxy of “AI -hiring intensity”  is constructed for the subset of AI adopters  identified through Lightcast™  data.32 This is defined as the ratio between their number of AI job  postings divided by  their total job postings.33 Exploiting the match with firm -level financials  (Orbis ©), it is then possible to explore some of the heterogeneity in the recent AI hiring patterns  according to firm characteristics.   
34  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     As observed in Figure 4.9 (Panel A) and to some extent unsurprisingly, firms in ICT and  professional services sectors tend to have higher average AI -hiring intensity. More interestingly,  among all AI jobs, AI professionals appear the  most demanded , especially in ICT and  professional services sectors  (Figure 4.9, Panel B).34  Figure  4.9. Average AI -hiring intensity across sectors of activity   United Kingdom, 2019   Panel A – By broad sector    Panel B – By broad sector -occupation     Notes: The sample only contains AI adopters  identified in Lightcast™  that were successfully linked to Orbis ©. AI intensity is  measured as the share of AI job postings out of all vacancies, on average for firms in each sector. AI intensity is assumed to be  zero for the years in which firms do not advertise any AI jobs that is captured in Lightcast™ . The category “other industries”  includes Mining and Quarrying, Utilities , Transport and Storage, Accommodat ion and Food, and Construction .  Source s: Authors’ own compilation based Lightcast™  (February 2021) and Orbis © (version 2.2020, Bureau van Dijk, April 2021) .  In line with the previous discussion, the South of the United Kingdom is also characterised by  higher average AI -hiring intensity with respect to the North (Figure A B.5 in Annex B). However,  patterns of AI -hiring intensity appear more spread out with resp ect to what can be observed in  Figure 4.3.   When exploring the heterogeneity of AI -hiring intensity across age and size groups (Figure  4.10), young firms (especially those with less than 6 years of age) tend to have higher average  AI-hiring intensity. This may reflect the fact that, for given size classes, younger firms may be,  to some extent, better positioned to leverage the potential of the latest developments of AI.  Alternatively, they may focus all the efforts in AI -related hiring, contrary to larger fi rms, which  need to keep a more diverse hiring portfolio.   Further analysis may extend these initial findings, which represent a first attempt to tackle a  question that has received little attention in the literature so far, mainly due to constraints in dat a  availability.

Towards  a comparison of AI adopters with  other firms   As a final exploratory exercise, the analysis compares – still focusing on 2019 – the ide ntified  AI adopters with other firms in Orbis ©, in order  to explore  differences between AI adopters and  other  likely non -adopting  businesses , both in terms of their characteristics and in terms of (a  proxy of labour) productivity.   This is complementary to ongoing OECD work exploiting different data sources , such as  administrative ICT surveys , to investigate similar issues. However, few a dditional caveats  need  to be taken into account when carrying out this analysis and interpreting its results.   As previous ly mentioned, Orbis ©’ representativeness may be more limited  for small  and less  productive firms , and selection issues may likely arise (Bajgar et  al., 2020 [31]). In particular,  when it comes to smaller firms, the most  productive ones may be better covered in the data.  Although this appears less problematic for AI adopters, which turn out to be at the top of  productivity distributions, it may be a more relevant issue when comparing those with other firms  in the economy.    Furthermore, despite the efforts carried out and the use of several data sources to identify AI  use, the c omparison group  of other firms in Orbis © may still contain  some  AI adopters .35 The  productivity analysis will be therefore carried out imposing increasingly higher size thresholds,  in order to assess how results may change and to attempt limiting those issues. Additional  robustness checks are also carried out, such as including multi ple matches in the AI adopters  group, which corroborate the results presented in this section and are elaborated on later .  As a starting point of this analysis, descriptive statistics are reported in Table 4.2 below.

These basic descriptive statistics already show that AI adopters appear on average older and   larger , vis-à-vis other firms in the database.36 However, these do not take into account several  confounding factors and compositi onal effects that may drive those differences.   The analysis therefore explores differences between AI adopters and other firms in a regression  framework, in order to take into further account relevant confounding factors, such as sectoral  composition and l ocation.   In this context, Equation 1 below is estimated using a simple linear probability model   𝐴𝐼 𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑖 =𝛼+𝑎𝑔𝑒  𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑖′𝛽1 +𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒  𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 𝑖′𝛽2  +𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡 +𝜌𝑟𝑒𝑔+𝜖𝑖 ,  Equation 1  where AI adoption  indicates a dummy variable th at equals one for firm i tagged as an AI adopter  and zero if tagged as a non -adopter; 𝛼 is a constant; age class  represents age class dummies  (reference category: < 6 years old); 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒  𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠  represents size cl ass dummies (reference  category: < 10 employees); 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡 represents 2 -digit-sector fixed effects; 𝜌𝑟𝑒𝑔 indicates TL2 regions fixed effects; and 𝜖 is the usual error  term.

Results, presented in Table 4.3 above, suggest that there appear to  be s ignificant scale  advantages  in AI adoption , even after accounting for regional and sectoral heterogeneity . This  is evident when focusing on the coefficients of the size class dummies, which increase in  magnitude with size.   Furthermore, the age coeffi cients suggest that, to some extent and after taking into account  other confounding factors, on average all AI adopters tend to be older than other firms, although  differences appear rather small in magnitude.37  Although the data at hand offer limited poten tial to focus on the characteristics external to the  firms that may affect AI adoption, one of the factors for which information is available and that  appears interesting to explore further is the role of AI universities. AI universities have indeed  been i dentified by the web -reading exercise carried out by GlassAI in the same way AI -related  companies  have , i.e., by focusing on AI -related keywords present on their websites. This allows  exploring  the role that such universities  may play  for the probability o f AI adoption, as proxied  by the AI adoption  dummy reported in Equation 1.    In this context, Equation 1 is re -estimated adding as an additional explanatory variable a dummy  that equals one if AI -related universities are present in the same TTWA, and zero o therwise.  Results, available in Table A B.1 in Annex B , suggest that the presence of AI universities is  positively related to AI adoption.38 These are in line with the idea that tertiary education plays  an important role to boost the availability of skilled  human capital needed for AI adoption.   A number of robustness checks are carried out and qualitatively confirm the findings reported  above. These include using different age and size bands, increasing the firm size threshold,  and using logit or cloglog reg ressions instead of linear probability models.39 
38  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     Beyond the role of firm characteristics for AI adoption, as discussed in the literature section, the  recent debate has been focusing more and more on the role of AI for productivity. In this context,  the data base constructed can help assess the productivity characteristics of AI adopters, as a  first step to better understand the link between AI adoption and productivity. Equation 2 is  therefore estimated using ordinary least squares. The model reads as follows :  𝑦𝑖,𝑡=𝛼+𝛽1 𝐴𝐼 𝑎𝑑𝑜𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑖,𝑡+𝛽2 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒𝑖,𝑡−1+𝛽3 𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑖,𝑡 +𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡 +𝜌𝑟𝑒𝑔+𝜖𝑖,𝑡 ,  Equation 2  where y is (the logarithm  of) turnover over employment, the simple proxy used so far for labour  productivity; AI adoption is the same dummy variable used in Equation 1; size corresponds to  the (lagged logarithm  of) number of employees; age corresponds to firm age; 𝛾𝑠𝑒𝑐𝑡 represen ts  2-digit-sector fixed effects; 𝜌𝑟𝑒𝑔 indicates TL2 -regions fixed effects; and 𝜖 is the usual error term   Equation 2 is fist estimated for different size groups and then for  manufacturing and services  separately.40   Results shown graphically in Figure 4.11 (see also Table A B.2 in Annex B ) highlight that,  especially when focusing on larger firms  (particularly those with more than 49 employees, for  which Orbis © is more representative),  significant productivity premia emerge  for AI adopters.41  When separat ing out manufacturing and services (see Table A B.2 of Annex B ), results show  that productivity premia  appear stronger in market services .   Figure  4.11. AI adoption and labour productivity   Regression coefficients  of AI adoption  dummies across different specifications   United Kingdom, 2019     Notes: The graph shows the coefficients ( 𝛽1) and error bars related to the AI adoption dummies from Equation 2, focusing on all  firms, firms with more than 49 employees, and firms with more than 249 employees.

These findings suggest that AI adopters may be more efficient than other firms, but do not imply  that AI adoption causes an increase in firm productivity. In fact, results reported indicate simple  conditional correlations. These may be  likely driven by self -selection into AI adoption by firms  that are already more productive or that have already invested in complementary assets  
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   39   © OECD 2022     required to effectively use AI, such as skills, other complementary technologies or intangible  capital.42  Addit ional robustness checks have been carried out, which qualitatively confirm the main  takeaways reported above. Those include replacing y with (contemporaneous ) turnover and  adding as an additional control (lagged) employment in a specification similar to th e one  adopted by Czarnitzki  et al. (2022 [39]), or changing the structure of fixed effects used as  controls.43  Equation 2 is then estimated focusing on different groups of AI adopters using AI adoption   dummies that equal one for firms belonging to any of the three groups, and zero for non adopters. Zooming in on larger firms, for which productivity premia are evident and financial  data are more representative (Table A B.3 in Annex B ), suggests t hat productivity premia tend  to be higher for the  groups “AI innovation” and “AI talent”, while firms with “AI core businesses”  tend to be less prod uctive than other (non -AI) firms. These firms are relatively smaller and  younger, and may be still in the initial phase of the “J curve”  (Brynjolfsson, Rock and Syverson,  2021 [5]), investing in complementary assets in view of future returns.44  Finally, the role of the intensive margin of AI adoption and its link with productivity is explored.  In particular, the measure of AI -hiring intensity discussed in the previous section – and available  for adopters identified via online job postings – is used instead of the AI adoption  dummy in  Equation 2.45  Results, repo rted graphically in Figure 4.1 2 focusing on firms with more than 49 employees   (see also Table A B.4 in Annex B for additional specifications using different firm size  thresholds ) suggest that productivity premia of  (larger)  AI adopters emerge also when focusing  on the intensive margin , as captured by the proxy used.

40  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     Furthermore, when focusing on the role of different AI -related occupations, i.e. decomposing  AI-hiring intensity into four components (focusing on managers, professionals, technicians and  other occupations), an important role of managers and – somewhat to a lesser extent –  professionals also emerge s.46  Additional robustness have been also carried out. Those include considering multiple matches  in the group of AI adopters; using different sectoral filterings; prioritising consolidated accounts  rather than unconsolidated ones; imputing labour productivity (by relying on employment and/or  turnover from the previous year when missing in 2019). Those exerci ses qualitatively confirm  the results reported.  
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   41   © OECD 2022     This work has  proposed  a novel scalable approach to  identify and characterise AI adopters,   combining different sources of large  commercial and administrative microdata , and o vercoming  significant challenges.   First, this work has identified  AI adopters based on a common set of AI -related keywords, relying  on and combining three different sources of data: i) AI -related IPRs, which capture firms  innovating in AI or embedding AI in their goods or services ; ii) AI-related activities as stated on  company websites ; and iii) the demand for AI -related skills contained in online job postings by  employers . These data sources turn out to be highly complementary, highlighting the relevance   of combining them.   Second, data on AI adopters have been  matched with firm -level financial statements that  contain  information on their characteristics , such as firm size, age, detailed sector of activity,  location of the headquarters, and that allow comp uting proxies of productivity . This has allowed  to provide a picture of AI adoption based on the most recent available data, importantly  distinguishing among different margins of AI adopters ( firms carrying out AI innovation, those  with an AI core business , and those searching for AI talent ).  A number of stylised facts have been uncovered. In particular, a polarisation of AI adoption has  emerged, both in terms of industry activity – with most firms operating in ICT and professional  services – and geographic al presence – with AI adopters concentrated in the South of the  United Kingdom. Hiring of AI talent appears however more widespread across sectors,  providing evidence in favour of the general -purpose nature of AI technologies.   Furthermore, AI adopters tend  to be leaders in their industry (in terms of labour productivity),  with possible implications for existing divides across groups of firms ( leaders vs. laggards ) and  regions. A coexistence of young -small and old -large AI adopters has also emerged, and amon g  firms that tend to have AI at the core of their business, most of those identified by the current  analysis are young and small.   Exploring the intensive margin of AI adoption using a proxy of AI -hiring intensity has further  highlighted the role of AI prof essionals, for which a strong demand is evident, and of young  firms, which tend to have higher AI -hiring intensity.   When comparing AI adopters with other likely non -adopting firms, significant scale advantages  have emerged, with AI adopters generally being  larger than other firms. AI adopters also tend  to be more productive, although these productivity premia – especially evident in market  services – do not necessarily imply a positive effect of AI on productivity.   Human capital appears to play an important  role for AI adoption. Proximity to AI-related  universities seem to increase the likelihood of using AI. Among different occupational groups,  managers as well as professionals appear to play an important role, likely helping translate AI  use into higher ef ficiency.  5 Concluding remarks and next steps  
42  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     Although largely exploratory, to our knowledge this is the most ambitious effort combining  different commercial and administrative data sources to study AI adoption in firms. This is  complementary to OECD work using other data sources, such as I CT surveys, to study AI  diffusion.   The analysis can be extended in a number of directions. Further work could focus on the role  of human capital or complementary assets in explaining differences between AI adopters and  other firms. In particular, additiona l analysis could further focus on the role of management, or  on the different set of skills required by AI adopters vis -à-vis other firms , or on collaborations  between universities and firms (rather than their physical proximity) . Furthermore, while the  current analysis focuses on the United Kingdom, a country for which underlying data are  generally of good quality and for which to our knowledge very limited evidence exists, the  approach adopted is also scalable to other countries.  Finally, future work coul d further analyse  the different implications of AI adoption on other outcomes, also depending on the specific  margin of AI adoption considered.

IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   49   © OECD 2022     Annex A.  Additional information about data  and methodology   This Annex summarises and provides additional information about the data sources used in a  complementary way in this work and the matching methodology employed to combine those.   Patent and trademarks   The OECD Science, Technology and Innovation (STI) Micro -data Lab collects administrative  micro -data on Intellectual Property Rights ( IPRs) records  (patents and trademarks)  containing  information on the owners of inventions, goods and services protected by IPR s, as well as on  their technological scope and product categories. The STI Micro -data Lab has collected,  processed and analysed such information over years, which resulted in several influential  publications, such as a joint publication of the European Commissio n’s Joint Research Centre,  the European Commission’s science and knowledge service and the OECD on the  world  corporate t op R&D investors   (Amoroso et  al., 2021 [40]), a definition of Informati on and  Communication Technology  (ICT) based on the technology classes of the International Patent  Classification  (IPC) (Inaba and Squicciarini, 2017 [41]) or a paper on defining  and measuring   patent quality  (Squicciarini, Dernis and Criscuolo, 2013 [42]).  Although IPRs are not the only mechanism to protect innovation and patentability of software based technologies across countries, combining information about AI -related patents and  trademarks already represents a signi ficant improvement in the study of AI innovators. In fact,  the existing literature has often used only one source of IPRs data to identify AI adopters.   Patent data  used in this work  are obtained from the European Patent Office (EPO)’s Worldwide  Patent Stat istical Database (also known as PATSTAT), spring 2020 edition, as available in the  STI Micro -data Lab infrastructure. AI -related patents are identified using the AI -related  keywords identified by Baruffaldi et al.’s  (2020[2]) as well as the IPC and Cooperative Patent  Classification (CPC) classes.    Trademarks instead  relate to those registered at the following three offices: the EU Intellectual  Property Office (EUIPO), the Japan Patent Office (JPO) and the US Patent a nd Trademark  Office ( USPTO ). AI-related trademarks  are identified following (Nakazato and Squicciarini,  2021 [17]), who built  on Baruffaldi et al.’s  (2020 [2]) as well as other IP -based analyses.    Although initially more than 3,500  applicants are identified  in the United Kingdom , Table A A.1  shows that this number is significantly reduced once different spellings are accounted for and,  importantly, individuals as well as universiti es are dropped as much as possible. This, to some  extent, reflects the concentration of innovative activities among relatively few firms.  
50  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     GlassAI   Information available on company websites can provide relevant indicators of firm activity. So  far these have  been exploited in a yet limited way, but offer a great potential for understanding  the most recent trends in innovation and firm dynamics (see for instance Nathan and Rosso  (2015 [43]; 2022 [44]); Kinne et al. (2019 [32]); Ragoussis and Timmis (2022 [45]); Dernis et al.  (forthcoming [19]); see also Rammer et al. (2022 [46]) for a survey) .  The analysis uses information provided by GlassAI, a UK software development web scale  intelligence company. GlassAI collected and provided experimental data on entities a ctive in  the AI space for the OECD by reading and interpreting open web text (e.g., sentences and  paragraphs) contained on websites in 2020.   Using Baruffaldi et al.’s (2020 [2]) AI-related keywords , GlassAI  identifi ed more than 2,000 firms  (see Table A A.1) and almost 200 universities active in the AI space in the United Kingdom.  Even if not all firms active in the AI space may refer to AI -related keywords on their website, at  least most of those that have AI at the core of their business would supposedly do so.   Where available, the information retrieved by GlassAI goes beyond the entities’ names and  websites and covers their location, registered company number, and sector, among others.  While industry and, by defini tion, name as well as website are available for all firms, the postal  address and the company registration number are missing for almost 4% and around 9% of  firms, respectively.   Lightcast™   Lightcast™  collects online vacan cy data (e.g. employer name, locat ion, occupation, industry,  skills, education and experience levels ) by web -scraping over 40, 000 distinct job boards and  company websites in many English -speaking and European countries.    Lightcast™  data have been extensively used in several high -level academic and policy  publications, also focusing on the role of AI in firms (Cente r for Security and Emerging  Technology, 2020 [47]; Squicciarini and Nachtigall, 2021 [24]; Samek, Squicciarini and Cammeraat,  2021 [25]; Alekseeva et  al., 2021 [22]). Indeed, there is ample evidence suggesting that Lightcast™   is well aligned with governme nt survey -based statistics  on vacancies and exhibit s good  statistical properties, making it a useful source of timely information about labour market  demand  (Carnevale, Jayasunde ra and Repnikov, 2014 [48]; Chetty et  al., 2020 [49]; Cammeraat  and Squicciarini, 2021 [50]). Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that vacancies  provide information on  the augment ation rather than the existing stock of  (AI-related ) human capital  and it is not   possible to disentangle whether such augmentation involves the replacement of existing l abour  and/or its complementation.   In this analysis, AI actors are identified based on AI -related skills (using Baruffaldi et al. ’s  (2020 [2]) AI keywords) that are listed in online job postings.47 The share of those identified jobs  has been increasing consistently  and accounted for more than 0.5% in 2020 , equalling more  than 33 thousand AI -related jobs in the United Kingdom that year.  When translating job posting  counts into organisation counts that are recruiting for AI-related  positions over the period 2012 20 we find around 7,400 organisations. Although this number is considerable, this implicitly  disregards a significant propo rtion of AI -related job postings for which organisation names are  not available. Still, most firms advertise multiple vacancies over time and hence it is likely that  the AI -active status will be captured by other AI postings  for which an employer name is  provided.  
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   51   © OECD 2022     Once names are cleaned and harmonised, and universities are excluded, a little more than  6,700 AI adopters searching for AI talent remain (see Table A  A.1). A lthough not all firms would  post jobs online, high-skilled jobs  (such as AI -related ones ) have a relatively higher chance to  be posted online (see Cammeraat and Squicciarini (2021 [50]), for a survey) since  AI arguably  “lives” and thrives in the digital space .  Orbis©   Orbis© by Bureau van Dijk is a well -known commercial database containing firm -level  information collected from company accounts. It covers almost 400 million companies and  entities worldwide of which around 41 million contain detailed financial information.  It is the  largest cross -country f irm-level database that is available and accessible for economic and  financial research  (Bajgar et  al., 2020 [31]). The analysis relies on data provided in the  Orbis ©  2.2020 vintage.   Bajgar et al. (2020 [31]) provide extensive discussion about Orbis © and its features, as well as  its representativeness. While Orbis© is known to focus relatively more on larger and more  productive firms , Bajgar et al. (2020 [31]), based  on a previous vintage, show that, when  comparing Orbis© with STAN data, its representativeness for the United Kingdom is one of the  best across countries, especially when focusing on employment. Still, smalle r and younger firms   may be to some extent under -represented in the analysis.  Moreover, despite the relatively good  coverage, not all information about firm characte ristics is available in Orbis©.   This can be seen in Figure AA1, which focuses on 2019 – the year used for the characterisation.  Coverage is very comprehensive for industry and location (headquarters) information, and very  good for age and employment, especially for AI adopters. However, a considerable share of  missing values is evident for  turno ver, which is used in the computation of the productivity proxy  in the analysis.

Orbis variable coverage   United Kingdom, 2019             Panel A: All firms             Panel B: AI adopters      Notes: The figure shows the share of firms for which the respective variable contains information. The left panel shows the s hare  among all firms in Orbis©, while the right panel focuses on AI adopters (identified through the other three sources) only.   Source: Orbis © (version 2.2020, Bureau van Dijk, April 2021).   Matching methodology   The core of the matching has been performed using the Imalinker system (Idener Multi  Algorithm Linker developed by IDE NER), which relies on country -specific ‘dictionaries’ t o first  harmonise organisations’  names and to then match those names from two different data  sources. The harmonisation process helps dealing with legal entity denomination (e.g. ‘Limited’  and ‘Ltd’), common names and expressions, as well as phonetic and l inguistic rules that can  affect the way in which names are written. Such harmonisation is based on applicant names for  IPRs (patents and trademarks), organisation names for web -reading data (GlassAI), and  employer names for online job postings (Lightcast™) . Concerning Lightcast™  data, job postings  with missing employer name were excluded at this stage.48  For financials ( Orbis ©), company names have been harmonised using the aforementioned  country -specific dictionaries, and some basic cleaning has been impleme nted. In particular, as  Orbis© has m ultiple accounts of different types available for some firms,  we followed Bajgar et  al. (2020 [31]) in removing such duplicate accounts by prioritising unconsolidated ones.   The ha rmonised names are compared using a series of string -matching algorithms – mainly  token -based and string -metric -based, such as token frequency matching and Levenshtein  (1966 [35]) as well as Jaro -Winkler (1999 [36]) distances. Imalinker calculates matching accuracy  scores for each pair matched by the different algorithms which can then be used to impose high  score thresholds and minimise the number of false positive matches. Whenever possible,  
IDENTIFYING AND CHARACTERISING A I ADOPTERS   53   © OECD 2022     websites  and company  registration numbers  are also exploited (in the case of GlassAI,  registration numbers are indeed the primary matching criterion) in addition to names.   As Imalinker solely relies on names to link data sources, multip le matches are frequently  identified and hence additional selection criteria have to be imposed. Therefore, linked firms are  prioritised if their postcodes as well as their sectoral information match, and they have some  firm-level information provided in O rbis©. Next, linked pairs among multiple matches are  prioritised if either postcodes or sectors match, and Orbis © contains at least some firm -level  information.   To confirm and possibly extend the list of identified matches, the exercise is replicated using  R  studio’s tidystringdist  and data.table  libraries. First, some basic manual string cleaning is  applied to the firm names, such as removing all punctuation, changing all characters to  lowercase, and removing words or abbreviations from the names (this is a built -in function in  the Imalinker system). Then, a table is created containing all possible combinations of the  different firm names from two datasets. Finally, similar to the Imalinker, matching algorithms are  applied to calculate the string distances and matches are confirmed based on imposed  thresholds while multiple matches are narrowed down utilising postcode and sectoral  information.   To identify and sift out universities49 (from the job postings and the IPRs data) in either of the  two matching instr uments, a keyword list containing terms, such as “university”, “college” and  “school” is employed. Universities known to be active in the AI space are also separately  searched for and tagged universities are spot -checked.   Individuals applying for patents or trademarks (in the IPR data) are also excluded from the  analysis as they cannot be matched to any firm level information. To ensure that these entities  are not false negatives, i.e., firms rather than individuals that failed to be matched to Orbis©,  the string, i.e., their name, is compared to the typical naming pattern of “surname comma first  name”. Again, spot checks are carried out to confirm tagged individuals. The final counts of AI  adopters identified in each data source are reported below in Table  A A.1.   Table  A A.1.

In particular, even after matching AI adopters with financials, not all information about firm  characteristics is available in Orb is©. Relevantly, a c onsiderable share of missing values  is 
54  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     evident  for turnover ( and hence for the p roductivity  proxy used in the characterisation, see  Figure AA1).   Furthermore, there are s light timing mismatches  among the different  data sources,  due to d ata  features and availability constraints . In particular, online vacancy data used refer to the period  2012 -20, web scraping of internet websites was carried out in 2020, and IPRs data are available  for longer time periods but only until 2018, while the la st available year in Orbis ©, for which the  characterisation is carried out,  is 2019.   Finally , it is clear that – despite all the efforts – it is not possible to claim that this methodology  allows to identify each and every single AI adopter in the United Kingdom. In fact, not every  single AI adopter may have applied for AI -related IPRs, posted AI -related jobs online , or  mentioned AI -related keywords on its website. The set of AI adopters identified is however  considerable and the proposed methodology allow s to significantly extend the scope of analysis  beyond existing work based on fewer data sources.

64  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022     Endnotes   1 A relevant exception is a recent evidence analysis and primary market research  to assess  the extent of data foundations and AI adoption conducted by Ernst & Young, which were  appointed by the governmental Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport   (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/data -foundations -and-ai-adoption -in-the-ukprivate -and-third-sectors ). The analysis is based on responses from about 400  organisations.   2 In fact, AI was already at the core of the 2017 UK Industrial Strategy. In 2021, the United  Kingdom published its National AI Strategy highlighting objectives related to investing in  the long -term needs of the AI ecosystem , supporting the transition to an AI -enabled  economy, and re gulating AI technologies  (HM Government, 2021 [61]).  3 The information on jobs is solely used for the purpose of identifying AI actors; investigating  the labour market implications of AI adoption is beyond the scope of this paper.    4 In this paper, the term “adopters” (and relatedly AI adopters) is used in a broad sense, in  reference to the different groups of firms outlined in this paragraph, based on the data  sources described in section 3.   5 These include Dernis et al. (2021 [18]); Samek et al. (2021 [25]); Squicciarini and Nachtigall  (2021 [24]); Nakazato and Squicciarini (2021 [17]).  6 AI diffuse  is a novel distributed microdata project aimed at studying the characteristics of  adopters of digital technologies, notably including AI, the role of complementary assets,  and the links between technology use and productivity,  based on ICT surveys. The analysis  is also complementary to the ongoing OECD -BCG -Insead survey on AI in business.   7 The ongoing debate discusses more and more  AI’s role in  changing labour and skills  demand (Bessen, 2019 [51]; Samek, Squicciarini and Cammeraat, 2021 [25]; Georgieff and  Hyee, 2021 [56]; Acemoglu et  al., 2022 [34]), its impact o n facilitating prediction and innovation   (Agrawal, Gans and Goldfarb, 2018 [53]; Cockburn, Henderson and Stern, 2018 [52]; Gierten  et al., 2021 [58]), and its potential to tackle societal challenges such as climate change.   These issues are beyond the scope of the present analysis.   8 A related part of the literature has instead employed previous waves of firm -level surveys  that contain information on the use of big data or predictive analytics, particularly focusing  on their  relation with firm productivity (see for instance Brynjolfsson, Jin and McElheran   (2021 [55]) for the United States or Borowiecki et  al. (2021 [57]) for the Netherlands).   9 The full li st of keywords in  Baruffaldi et al. (2020 [2]), which previous OECD work and this  study built upon, is available in their paper’s Annex Table C.1 .    
IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS  65   © OECD 2022       10 Focusing instead on a broad set of technologies, Bloom et al. (2021 [27]) identify and  document the patterns of diffusion of 29 disruptive technologies in the United States based  on textual analysis of patents, job postings, and earning calls. They document the  initial  geographical concentration of disruptive technologies, which then spread across space  over time, and the concentration of initial hiring among higher -skilled jobs, with a gradual  broadening of the types of jobs adopting a given technology. They sh ow that pioneer  locations have long -lasting benefits and those appear more likely to be located  around  areas with universities and high -skilled labour.   11 Baruffaldi et al. (2020 [2]) find that in 2017, AI -related patents made up more than 2.3% of  the total share of IP5 patent families, twice the level observed in 2010 (~1.1%).   12 This is m easured by the hiring of an increasing share of AI -skills of the total number of  skills the firm d emands through these job postings .  13 Existing studies to our knowledge do not use copyright data, which may be an additional  relevant source of information.   14 See also the discussion in the previous section and Annex Table C.1.  in Baruffaldi et al .  (2020 [2]) for additional information.   15 Patents are only one mechanism to protect innovation, and in general tend to be skewed  towards manufacturing. Furthermore, the patentability of software -based technologies, and  hence  AI technologies, varies across countries. For instance, in the United States, software  can be patented as such, while at the European Patent Office (EPO) it is only patentable if  embedded in computer implemented inventions. See Dernis et al. (2021 [18]) for further  details.   16 Job postings data proxy the demand for AI talent, as posted online and captured by the  data provider, beyond initial stocks. Some relevant challenges to keep in mind when using  this data source are further discussed in Annex A.   17 Table A  A.1 in Annex A sh ows the number of AI adopters identified based on each data  source.   18 Groups have been defined a s mutually exclusive in order to ease the presentation of  results and discussion. This also reflects the high complementarity of the different data  sources, fur ther discussed in the following section.   19 In particular, Orbis © data tend to have better coverage for larger and more productive  firms, possibly inducing selection bias. This is further discussed in the following section and  in Annex A.   20 The core of the matching has been performed using the Imalinker system (Idener Multi  Algorithm Linker developed by IDENER) , which has been complemented by additional  iterations using R studio’s tidystringdist  library.   21 The fact that a larger number of AI adopters are ide ntified through the AI talent group  and that the proportion of AI jobs among all job postings in Lightcast™  has increased  significantly over time  (Samek, Squicciarini and Cammeraat, 2021 [25]) may indicate that  firms pr epare and search for the necessary human capital to enter the AI space.   22 Future work in the context o f the OECD AI diffuse  project may allow further comparison  between the current findings and those based on data available in official ICT surveys.   
66  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022       Those data are more suitable for focusing on overall adoption rates, which are not the main  focus of the current analysis.   23 This implies that not all firms identified as AI adopters in the previous section will  contribute to such characterisation. For instance,  a firm posting AI -related jobs online in  one year, which was linked to Orbis © but exited the market prior to 2019, does not  contribute to the figures reported . This approach limits possible double -counting issues,  maximises the accuracy of the information  used for characterising adopters, and the  accuracy of the comparison across different groups of firms.    24 The distributions of employment, age and turnover are right -skewed for all three groups,  with firms looking for AI talent exhibiting the highest medi an employee count, age and  turnover.   25 This is evident when comparing Figure 4.1 with Figure A  B.1 in Annex B, which shows  the sectoral distribution of firms in the overall economy when using  Orbis© . Findings are  also similar when relying on the  OECD’s Str uctural and Demographic Business Statistics .  26 Due to diffuse commuting patterns, it is not possible to divide the United Kingdom  into  entirely self -contained labour market areas (where all commuting occurs within the  boundary of that area). Therefore, TTW As have been constructed, so that of the resident  economically active population, “at least 75% of an area's resident workforce work in the  area and at least 75% of the people who work in the area also live in the area"  (ONS,  2016 [62]). In other words, it is developed so that relatively few commuters cross a TTWA  boundary on their way to work .  27 Findings also remain qualitatively similar when showing the number of AI adopters as a  share of all firms by TTWA.  These are not report ed for brevity but the figures are available  upon request from the authors.   28 Keeping in mind that Orbis © is not ideal to study the full support of age and size  distributions, these figures identify a considerable number of small and young AI adopters.  Firm size and age distributions are however typically more skewed (see Criscuolo, Gal and  Menon (2014 [60]); Calvino et al . (2021 [54])), with e.g., more than  75% of micro (<10  employees) firms in most OECD countries. A tentative comparison in terms of age and size  with likely non -adopters is carried out in one of the following subsections.   29 Additional unreported analysis also suggests that – especially among those two groups  – being part of a foreign -owned multinational is positively associated with AI adoption.  Within those groups multinationals represent between 25% and 28% of AI adopters.   30 Additional unreported analysis focusing on age and size heterogene ity among different  groups of adopters further control ling for sectoral composition also qualitatively confirms  the main insights discussed above.  Focusing on AI adopters in digital -intensive sectors (as  defined by the top quartile of the taxonomy proposed  by Calvino et al. (2018 [59])) also  provides results that are in line with Figure 4.6 (Panel A and B).   31 Around 4% and 14% of those A I adopters in the top 10% and the 60th-90th percentile s  of the productivity distri bution , respectively are also top R&D investors (see Amoroso et al.  (2021 [40]) for details). T op R&D investors active in the AI space in the United Kingdom  operate mainly in manufacturing, and are large as well as mature fir ms.   
IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS  67   © OECD 2022       32 This corresponds to the whole “AI talent” group of AI adopters, plus the firms in the groups  “AI innovation” and “AI core business” for which AI -related job postings were identified  during the observed period.   33 The measure is calculated at the firm level. Figures presented in this subsection refer to  AI hiring intensity in 2019, for consistency with the rest of the paper. Additional unreported  analysis confirms that increasing the length of the time window considered, to, for instance,  four years fro m 2016 to 2019, provides qualitatively similar patterns.   34 Unreported analysis show s that AI professionals  are also more AI skills -intensive  compared to managers and technicians, as reflected by the largest proportion of AI skills   in their job postings.   35 This indeed appears to be particularly the case when looking at the  shares of AI adopters  in different size bins, which are especially low  for small - and medium -sized firms.   36 This is also broadly confirmed when comparing whole age, employment, and turnov er  distributions, with the first quartiles, medians, and third quartiles being higher for AI  adopters than for other firms.   37 Unreported analysis focusing on different groups of AI adopters suggests that age  coefficients’ patterns for “AI innovation” and “ AI talent” are in line with those reported in  Table 4.3, while firms in the group “AI core business” exhibit small negative coefficients for  older age bands, in line with evidence reported in the previous subsections.   38 This is true across the different groups of AI adopters, and after controlling for (broad)  regional heterogeneity.   39 Those are not reported for the sake of brevity, but are available upon request from the  authors.   40 The different size groups for which Eq uation 2 is estimated are: all firms, firms with more  than 49 employees, and firms with more than 249 employees.   41 Additional unreported analysis suggests that, when considering firms with more than 49  employees, these premia tend to be highest among forei gn-owned AI adopters.   42 Suggestive evidence indeed seems to confirm that this may be the case since, when  adding lagged productivity as additional explanatory variable in Equation 2, productivity  premia tend to disappear. This is in line with ongoing analy sis based on ICT surveys (e.g.,  Calvino and Fontanelli (2022 [10])).  43 Additional analysis has focused on average wages rather than labour productivity, in the  same framework proposed in Equation 2. Results suggest that AI ad opters tend to pay  higher wages, especially largest ones, both in manufacturing and services. Wage data are  however often missing in Orbis©. Results are exploratory and available upon request from  the authors.   44 A positive productivity coefficient is also evident for innovators in manufacturing, when  considering all firms, possibly suggesting that those innovators may be significantly  different from other firms, even within the more selected subsample of smaller firms in  Orbis ©.   
68  IDENTIFYING AND CHAR ACTERISING AI ADOPTE RS   © OECD 2022       45 Firms tagged as non -adopte rs have therefore zero AI -hiring intensity . Firms tagged as  AI-adopters based on web -reading or IPRs, but for which no information on AI -hiring  intensity is available, are dropped from this analysis.   46 Unreported regressions focusing on manufacturing and m arket services separately show  that the positive coefficient for the overall AI intensity is driven by market services, while  the positive coefficient for managers is evident in both macro sectors.   47 The number of false positives, i.e. jobs and hence firms  that are falsely identified as AI  actors, could be a concern especially among the AI talent group if employers advertise non AI jobs using AI -related keywords, e.g., to enhance the vacancy’s appeal. However, by  following Squicciarini and Nachtigall (2021 [24]), we employ a conservative approach that  significantly reduces such risk of false positives. For more details and sensitivity checks,  please see Squicciarini and Nachtigall (2021 [24]).  48 Although this share is considerable (about half of all AI -related UK job postings), most  firms tend to advertise multiple vacancies and hence it is likely that at least some of the  vacancies with missing employer name are already capture d by other AI -related jobs for  which an employer name is provided.   49 Information on AI -related universities from GlassAI is further exploited in the analysis to  explore the role of tertiary education for AI adoption by firms, which are at the centre of the   current analysis and for which data coverage in Orbis© is signi ficantly more  comprehensive.
