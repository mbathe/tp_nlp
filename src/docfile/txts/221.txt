  1   1.  INTRODUCTION – THE EUROPEAN AI STRATEGY   Like electricity in the past, artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming our world . It is at  our fingertips, when we translate texts online or use a mobile app to find the best way to go to  our next destination. At home, a smart thermostat can reduce energy bills by up to 25% by  analysing the habits of the people who live in the house and adjusting th e temperature  accordingly1. In healthcare, algorithms can help dermatologists make better diagnosis, for  example detecting 95% of skin cancers by learning from large sets of medical images2.   By making sense of vast amounts of data to offer efficient solut ions, AI improves products,  processes and business models in all economic sectors. It can help companies identify which  machines will need maintenance before they break down. AI also transforms public services.   Artificial Intelligence refers to systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their  environment and taking action — with some degree of autonomy — to achieve specific goals.  We are using AI on a daily basis, for example to block email spam or s peak with digital  assistants.   Growth in computing power, availability of data and progress in algorithms have turned AI  into one of the most important technologies of the 21st century.   The changes brought by AI also raise concerns. Workers fear they will lose their job because  of automation, consumers wonder who is responsible in case a wrong decision is taken by an  AI-based system, small companies do not know how to apply AI to their bu siness, AI start ups do not find the resources and talent they need in Europe, and international competition is  fiercer than ever with massive investments in the US and China.   To address these challenges and make the most of the opportunities offered by A I, the  Commission published a European strategy3 in April 2018. The Commission proposed  an approach that places people at the centre of the development of AI (human -centric AI)  and encourages the use of this powerful technology to help solve the world’s bi ggest  challenges : from curing diseases to fighting climate change and anticipating natural disasters,  to making transport safer4 and fighting crime and improving cybersecurity.    This strategy supports an ethical, secure and cutting -edge AI made in Europe. It builds on  Europe's scientific and industrial strengths5 and is based on three pillars: increasing public and  private investments in AI, preparing for socio -economic changes, and ensuring an appropriate  ethical and legal framework. To ensure its success,  coordination at European level is  essential .                                                              1  https://www.latribu ne.fr/entreprises -finance/la -tribune -de-l-energie -avec-erdf/cinq -objets -connectes -poureconomiser -l-energie -545571.html    2  https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/29/skin -cancer -computer -learns -to-detect -skin-cancer -more accurately -than-a-doctor    3  COM(2018) 237   4  It is estimated that around 90% of road accidents are caused by human errors, see COM(2016) 787.   5  Europe has world -class researchers and start -ups in AI, is a leader in robotics and business -to-business  software/platfor ms. Its strong transport, healthcare and manufacturing sectors should be at the forefront of  AI.  
  2   2.  THE COORDINATED PLAN ON AI – OVERVIEW   In its strategy on AI for Europe, the Commission proposed to work with Member States  on a coordinated plan on AI by the end of 2018 , with the aim to maximise the impac t of  investments at EU and national levels, encourage synergies and cooperation across the EU,  exchange best practices and collectively define the way forward to ensure that the EU as a  whole can compete globally. The proposal of a coordinated plan built o n the declaration of  cooperation on AI  launched in April 2018 at the Digital Day and signed by all Member  States and Norway6. It was endorsed by the European Council in June 20187.  Member States (as part of the group on digitising European industry and AI) , Norway,  Switzerland and the Commission prepared the plan during several meetings between June and  November 2018. Exchanges also took place during Competitiveness Council meetings under  the Austrian Presidency of the EU.   During these meetings, Member Stat es and the Commission identified a series of common  actions to increase investments, pool data – the raw material for AI -, foster talent and ensure  trust8, building on the European strategy. They prioritised areas of public interest, such as  healthcare, t ransport and mobility, safety, security and energy, as well as important economic  sectors such as manufacturing and financial services.   The result of this joint work, the coordinated plan, is the annex to this Communication.  It details actions to be started in 2019 -2020 and prepares the ground for activities in the  following years. It will be reviewed and updated annually.   This Communicat ion highlights the main objectives and initiatives of the plan.   2.1. Common objectives and complementary efforts    The coordinated plan provides a strategic framework for national AI strategies. As of today,  five Member States have already adopted a natio nal AI strategy with a dedicated budget9. All  other Member States are encouraged to develop their national AI strategy by mid -2019,  building on the work done at the European level. These are expected to outline investment  levels and implementation measures .   In the course of next year, Member States and the Commission will also agree on common  indicators to monitor AI uptake and development in the Union and the success rate of the  strategies in place, with the support of the AI Watch developed by the Joint Research Centre  of the Commission10.                                                              6  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single-market/en/news/eu -member -states -sign-cooperate -artificial -intelligence    7  https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press -releases/2018/ 06/29/20180628 -euco -conclusions -final/    8  All of these actions must comply with the EU rules on competition law and state aid.   9  France, Finland, Sweden, the UK and Germany have targeted AI strategies in place. Some countries, like  Denmark, Luxembourg, T he Netherlands, Ireland and Norway include AI related actions in their broader  digitisation strategies. Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Germany, Italy, Latvia,  Poland, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia and Spain are in the process of dev eloping strategies.   10  https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch_en  
  3   Europe is currently behind in private investments in AI11. Without major efforts, the EU risks  losing out on the opportunities offered by AI, facing a brain -drain and being a consumer of  solutions developed elsewhere. This is why the European AI strategy has set ambitious, yet  realistic, targets: in the Union, p ublic and private investments in AI must be scaled up in  order to reach the target of EUR  20 billion per year over the next decade . As a first step,  the Commission is increasing investment in AI under the research and innovation framework  programme Horizon  2020 to EUR  1.5 billion in the period 2018 -2020. This amount  corresponds to a 70% increase relative to period 2014 -2017. If Member States and the private  sector make similar efforts, total investments in the Union will grow to more than EUR  20  billion for  the period 2018 -202012, thus positioning the Union to further increase efforts over  the next decade, with investment gradually reaching EUR  20 billion per year. This would  correspond to an annual investment of EUR  7 billion by the public sector (Member Sta tes and  Commission), on par with other continents. The Commission proposed, under the next  programming period 2021 -2027, that the Union invests in AI at least EUR  1 billion per  year from Horizon Europe and the Digital Europe programmes13.   Taking these targ ets into account, Member States have agreed that ambition is required and  that national efforts need to be increased. Coordinated public efforts will help leverage more  private investments.      While public investment plays an important role, an important duty for regulators is to  eliminate the obstacles due to fragmented markets . Products and services are increasingly  interlinked and digitised. In this context, it is of utmost importance to avoid market  fragmentation in strategic sectors such as artificial  intelligence, including by strengthening  key enablers (e.g. common standards and fast communication networks). A real Single  Market with an integral digital dimension14 will make it easier for businesses to scale up  and trade across borders  and thereby further boost investments.   2.2.  Towards a European AI public -private partnership and more financing for start ups and innovative small and medium -sized enterprises15  Member States and the Commission will also reinforce cooperation with the pri vate sector.  The Commission will bring companies and research organisations together to develop a  common strategic research agenda on AI, defining priorities in line with the needs of the  market and encouraging exchanges between sectors and across borders.  This will pave the  way for a new research and innovation partnership on AI, fostering collaboration  between academia and industry in Europe . As part of this contractual partnership, the  private sector is expected to commit to specific and high investments  in AI. This partnership                                                              11  Europe totalled around EUR 2.4 -3.2 billion in 2016, compared with EUR 6.5 -9.7 billion in Asia and EUR  12.1-18.6 billion in North America. Source: 10 imperatives for Europe in the age of AI and automation,  McKinsey, 2017.   12  This may include investments from European Structural and Investment Funds. Five regions have AI related  priorities in their smart specialisatio n strategies: Lower Saxony [DE], Pohjois -Savo [FI], Łódzkie [PL],  North -West [RO] and North -East [RO]. See: http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/map    13  The proposals for the next multiannual financial f ramework, in particular the new Digital Europe Programme  and Horizon Europe, the most ambitious ever EU research and innovation framework programme, support  the European AI strategy.   14   See the Commission’s recent communication “The Single Market in a cha nging world” (COM(2018)772).   15  See section B of the coordinated plan for details on the proposed actions.  
  4   will build on existing partnerships in robotics and big data16, representing EUR 4.4 billion of  investments, of which the majority (EUR 3.2 billion) comes from the industry. Stakeholders  have already confirmed their support for sett ing up an AI partnership17.  Moreover, the Commission aims at making available resources for start -ups and innovators in  AI and blockchain to help them grow their business. EUR 100 million should be initially  mobilised in 2020, which could be further complem ented through the participation of  interested national promotional banks and other institutions. This could help prepare for  strengthening access to finance for AI under the InvestEU programme from 2021 onwards.   At the same time, the Commission is making progress in setting up the European Innovation  Council  to support cutting -edge technologies and the most innovative start -ups. In response to  the call of the European Council in June 201818, a new pilot initiative19 will be launched in  early 2019 and will in clude support for the next generation of human -centric AI technologies.   2.3.  Strengthening excellence in trustworthy AI technologies and broad diffusion20  Member States and the Commission aim to scale up national research capacities and reach  critical mas s through tighter networks of European AI research excellence centres . The  objective is to foster cooperation among the best research teams in Europe, so that by joining  forces they can tackle major scientific and technological challenges in AI more effici ently.   Bringing state -of-the-art AI applications to the market requires experimenting and testing in  real-world environments. As part of the implementation of the Digitising European Industry  strategy21 adopted in 2016, the Commission is already supporting large -scale pilots and  experiments in areas such as smart farming, smart cities and connected and autonomous  vehicles.   Lessons will be drawn from these pilots and experiments. To optimise investment and avoid  duplication of efforts, the Commission propose s that several large -scale reference test sites,  open to all actors across Europe, will be developed using up to EUR  1.5 billion  from the  AI strand of the proposed Digital Europe programme, building on the strong base of existing  centres of excellence in M ember States.  Examples of testing facilities that Member States are  putting in place include the cross -border testing of connected and autonomous driving22 and  real scale experimentation of smart hospitals. In the case of connected and autonomous  mobility, the identification of such testing facilities and the tests themselves will be  coordinated, first, by the single EU -wide platform referred to in the EU st rategy for mobility                                                              16  Public -private partnerships on robotics (‘SPARC’) and big data (‘Big Data Value’) represent EUR  1.2 billion  in public investment plus EUR  3.2 bill ion in private investment for 2014 -2020, giving EUR  4.4 billion in  total.   17  The Big Data Value Association, the private partner in the big data public -private partnership, has adopted a  position paper on AI which includes a recommendation to move towards a partnership on AI (November  2018). http://bdva.eu/sites/default/files/AI -Position -Statement -BDVA -Final -12112018.pdf   18  https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press -releases/2018/06/29/20180628 -euco -conclusions -final/    19  In 2018 alone, 74 innovative SME -proje cts and start -ups have been funded to develop AI related innovations  in the European Innovation Council pilot phase.   20  See section C of coordinated plan for details on proposed actions.   21  COM(2016) 180   22  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/cross -border -corridors -connected -and-automated -mobility -cam 
  5   of the future23 and, subsequently, by the corresponding partnership to be established under  Horizon Europe.   It is equally important to foster the broadest possible uptake of AI in the economy, in  particular by start -ups and small and med ium-sized enterprises. By raising public awareness  and sharing the latest scientific advances and tried and tested state -of-the-art technologies  developed in Europe, we can ensure that every company, small or large, high -tech or not, as  well as the public sector, can grasp these digital opportunities. The proposed new Digital  Europe programme provides for co -investment by Member States and the Commission in  digital innovation hubs  across Europe, including via the Cohesion Policy funds. The  programme will fu rther facilitate the diffusion of AI capacity in each Member State and will  link to an AI on -demand -platform24. To this end, in 2019 Member States will identify AI  digital innovation hubs in their territory.   2.4.  Adapting our learning and training programm es and systems to better prepare  our society for AI25  Rapid technological progress means that the world of work will be significantly transformed,  and sooner rather than later. In particular, technological changes will modify the skills  required of workers,  meaning that potentially very large numbers of workers will need to up skill. Thus, more focus needs to be put on life -long learning. One specific aspect of change  concerns those workers who will actually design and implement the AI solutions of the futur e.  Almost all Member States are facing shortages of Information and communications  technology professionals, and there are currently more than 600  000 vacancies for digital  experts26. Moreover, talented researchers and promising start -ups frequently receive   interesting offers from abroad. For example, in 2017 there were 240  000 Europeans in Silicon  Valley27, many of whom entered the US to fill a specific job in the tech industry. Europe must  be able to train, attract and retain talent of this kind, and encour age entrepreneurship, diversity  and gender balance.   Member States will therefore exchange best practices on how to reinforce excellence and  retain talented workers, as well as on how to step up and accelerate efforts to fully introduce  and exploit the pos sibilities offered by the current legal migration acquis, including the blue  card28, to attract talent. The blue card is a work permit allowing high -skilled non -EU citizens  to work and live in the EU. Skills should also be covered in the national AI strateg ies which  are to be published by mid -2019. The strategies should address AI -relevant skills within the  formal education cycle, including in vocational training and higher education, as well as ways  to improve opportunities for Masters and PhDs in AI.   The Commission will support Masters and PhDs in AI through the proposed closer  cooperation between AI research excellence centres and, more broadly, the EU’s research and  innovation programmes.  Interdisciplinarity  will be supported by encouraging joint degrees ,                                                              23  COM(2018) 283   24  http://ai4eu.org/   25  See section D of coordinated plan for details on proposed actions.   26  https://www.pocbigdata.eu/monitorICTonlinevacancies/general_info/   27  https://jointventure.org/images/stories/pdf/index2018.pdf   28  Council Directive 2009/50/EC on the conditions of entry and residence of third -country nationals for the  purposes of highly qualified employment. The Commissi on made a proposal to review this act - COM(2016)  378.  
  6   for example in law or psychology and AI. Moreover, digital skills that facilitate the  development and use of AI, should be included in all education and training curricula.   Given the disruptive nature of many of the technological advances, policy -makers will  develop strategies to deal with employment changes in order to ensure inclusiveness, as the  pace with which some jobs will disappear and others appear is likely to accelerate, while  business models and the way tasks or jobs are performed will change. This may make it  necessary to modify current labour market and social protection arrangements to support  transitions in the labour market. The Commission has established a high -level expert group on  the impact of the digital transformation on EU labour mar kets that will deliver a report  addressing these issues in spring 201929.   2.5.  Building up the European data space essential for AI in Europe, including for the  public sector30  Further developments in AI require a well -functioning data ecosystem built on t rust, data  availability and infrastructure31. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)32 is the  anchor of trust in the single market for data. It has established a new global standard with a  strong focus on the rights of individuals, reflecting European  values, and is an important  element of ensuring trust in AI.  This trust is especially important when it comes to the  processing of healthcare data for applications driven by AI.  The Commission would like to  encourage the European Data Protection Board to  develop guidelines on the issue of the  processing of personal data in the context of research. This will facilitate the development of  large cross -country research datasets that can be used for AI.   AI needs vast amounts of data to be developed. Machine learning, a type of AI, works by  identifying patterns in available data and then applying the knowledge to new data. The larger  a data set, the better AI can learn and discover even subtle relations in  the data.   Once trained, algorithms can correctly classify objects that they have never seen, in more and  more cases with accuracies that exceed those of humans. Hence, access to data is a key  ingredient for a competitive AI landscape, which the EU should  facilitate in full respect of  personal data protection rules.   The entry into application of the free flow of non -personal data Regulation33 in the course of  2019 will help unlock data, in particular machine -generated data, and greatly ease the cross borde r operation of businesses in the Union. Openness to international data flows will  continue to be ensured in full respect of the EU rules for the  protection of personal data and in  accordance with  applicable  legal instruments, including free trade agreement s.                                                              29   https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/appointment -members -high-level -expert -group -impact digital -transformation -eu-labour -markets   30  See sections E and G of the coordinated plan for de tails of the proposed actions.   31  "Data is the lifeline of AI" see chapter 12 of the Joint Research Centre Report on "Artificial Intelligence: a  European Perspective" https://ec.europa.eu/jrc/en/publication/eur -scientific -and-technical -research reports/artificial -intelligence -european -perspective         32  Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of  the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection  of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.   33  Regulation (eu) 2018/1807 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 November 2018 on a  framework for the free flow of non -personal data in the European Union  
  7   Agreement on the review of the Public Sector Information Directive34 will also increase the  amount of data available for innovation.   The creation of common European data spaces  in a number of areas such as manufacturing  or energy will constitute a major asset for European innovators and businesses. These  common European data spaces will aggregate data, both for public sector and for business -tobusiness, across Europe and make t hem available to train AI35 on a scale that will enable the  development of new products and services. Rapid development and adoption of European  rules such as interoperability requirements and standards is essential,. The Union must also  provide support to ensure the seamless access to, exchange and reuse of such data sets. The  identification of high -value data sets by Member States will help make them more openly  reusable. The Commission also contributes with large quantities of earth observation data and  information from its flagship Copernicus programme.   AI applications in healthcare are particularly promising. In 2020 the Commission will  support via Horizon 2020 — in coordination with Member States — the development of  a common database of health images  (anonymised, and based on patients voluntarily  donating their data). This image database will initially be dedicated to the most common  forms of cancer, using AI to improve diagnosis and treatment . The work will meet all  necessary regulatory, security, and ethical requirements.    AI tools are crucial to the future work of public administrations. Member States and the  Commission will engage in peer learning and discuss areas for joint procurement of AI  solutions, including cybersecurity , as well as specific c hallenges for the public sector. When  AI is implemented, for example, for security and law enforcement, particular legal and ethical  challenges arise, considering that public administrations are bound to act as prescribed by law,  that they need to motivate  their decisions and that their acts are subject to judicial review by  administrative courts.   Finally, computing capacity is essential to process data. The European High -Performance  Computing Initiative36 (EuroHPC) is pooling resources to develop the next generation of  supercomputers to process big data and train AI. In that context, the ongoing partnership with  Member States and industry on microelectronic components and systems (ECSEL37) as well  as the European Processor Initiative38, which aims at creating  low-power processor  technology for high -performance computing, data -centres and autonomous vehicles, are key  to developing an independent and innovative European ecosystem in high -end chip design.   2.6.  Developing ethics guidelines with a global perspective and ensuring an innovation friendly legal framework39  To gain trust, which is necessary for societies to accept and use AI, the technology should be  predictable, responsible, verifiable, respect fundamental rights and follow ethical rules.                                                              34  Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the re -use of public sector  information (recast) COM(2018) 234.   35  Links to data repositories will be made available through the AI -on-demand platform, providing services to  the AI community.   36  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/eurohpc -joint-undertaking   37  https://www.ecsel.eu/    38  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single-market/en/news/european -processor -initiative -consortium -develop europes -microprocessors -future -supercomputers   39  See sections F and H of coordinated plan for details on proposed actions.  
  8   Other wise, the use of AI may lead to undesirable outcomes, such as creating an echo chamber  where people only receive information which corresponds to their opinions, or reinforcing  discrimination, as in the case where an algorithm turned racist within 24 hours  due to  exposure to racist material40.    Crucially, humans should understand how AI makes decisions. Europe can become a global  leader in developing and using AI for good and promoting a human -centric approach and  ethics -by-design principles.   To anchor suc h principles more firmly in the development and use of AI, the Commission  appointed an independent AI high -level expert group with the task of developing draft AI  ethics guidelines. A first version will be published by the end of 2018 and the experts will  present their final version of the guidelines to the Commission in March 2019 after wide  consultation through the European AI Alliance41. The ambition is then to bring Europe’s  ethical approach to the global stage. The Commission is opening up cooperation t o all non -EU  countries that are willing to share the same values.   Further developments in AI also require a regulatory framework that is flexible enough to  promote innovation while ensuring high levels of protection and safety. The Commission is in  the pro cess of assessing whether the national and EU safety and liability frameworks are fit  for purpose in light of these new challenges or whether any gaps should be addressed. To this  end the Commission will publish by mid -2019 a report on the potential gaps i n and  orientations for the safety and liability frameworks for AI.   2.7.  Security -related aspects of AI applications and infrastructure, and international  security agenda   There is a need to better understand how AI can impact security in three dimensions:  how AI  could enhance the objectives of the security sector; how AI technologies can be protected  from attacks; and how to address any potential abuse of AI for malicious purposes.     The increasing potential and sensitivity of AI applications in many areas  of the digital  economy and society, such as autonomous mobility or avoiding power blackouts, means it is  highly relevant to establish cybersecurity requirements for AI.42  The application of AI in weapons systems has the potential to fundamentally change ar med  conflicts and therefore raises serious concerns and questions. The Union will continue to  stress that international law, including International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights  Law, applies fully to all weapons systems, including autonomous weapons s ystems, and that  States remain responsible and accountable for their development and use in armed conflict.  The EU's position further remains that human control must be retained in decisions on the use  of lethal force and built into the full life -cycle of any weapons system43.                                                              40  https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/24/tay -microsofts -ai-chatbot -gets-a-crash -course -inracism -from -twitter   41  https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/european -ai-alliance   42  This principle is set out in the Cybersecurity Joint Communication of September 2017 (JOIN(2017) 450).   43  The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs  and Security Policy will, with the support of the  Commission, build on consultations in the United Nations, the Global Tech Panel, and other multilateral fora,  and coordinate proposals for addressing these complex security challenges.   
  9   3.  CONCLUSIONS   AI is already a part of our daily lives, but its potential is much larger than we have seen so far.  For Europe to become a leading player in AI, it needs to build on its strengths and support the  development of an ethical, secure and cutting -edge AI made in Europe.   The Commission therefore invites:    the European Council to endorse the coordinated plan;    Member States to implement the coordinated plan, including the development of  national AI strategies by mid -2019, outlining investment levels and implementation  measures;    the co -legislators to swiftly adopt the remaining legislative initiatives which are  essential for the success of the European AI strategy, including the proposals put  forward in the context of the ne xt multi -annual financial framework.
