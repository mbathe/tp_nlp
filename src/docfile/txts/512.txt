6  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023     Abstract   This paper uses information collected and provided by GlassAI to analyse  the characteristics and activities of companies and universities in Canada,  Germa ny, the United Kingdom and the United States that mention   keywords related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) on their websites. The  analysis finds that  those  companies  tend to be young and small, mainly  operate in the information and communication sector, have AI  at the core of  their business, and aim to provide customer solutions. It is noteworthy that  the types of AI -related activities reported by them vary across sectors.  Additionally, although universities are concentrated in and around large  cities, this  is not necessarily reflected in the intensity of AI -related activities.  Taken together, this novel and timely evidence informs the debate on the  most recent stages of digital transformation of the economy.

IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   9   © OECD 2023     Executive summary    Artificial Intelligence (A I) has the potential to significantly affect economic growth , and to transform  the economic landscape and industries widely. However, still little is known about  the patterns of   uptake  of AI by firms , especially across countries.    This work provides a comprehensive analysis focus ing on organisations with AI -related online  presence. For the first time, it analyses the characteristics of companies and universities that  mention AI -related keywords on their websites across four countries: Canada, Germany, United  Kingdom, and United States. The analysis relies on novel in formation collected and provided by  GlassAI, a private company that reads and interprets open web text at scale .    Focusing on the characteristics of AI companies identified through web reading, the analysis  highlights that those tend to be young and small.  The large majority of these AI companies  operates in the “Information & Communication” sector.    These firms tend to have AI at the core of their business , appear often business oriented and aim  at providing solutions to their customers. Many of these solut ions appear related to Data Analysis   or the provision of specialised services, such as Cloud solutions.    Beyond the generic Artificial Intelligence terms  reported  on companies’ websites , Machine  Learning  emerges as a central topic, often co -occurring with o ther AI techniques (e.g., Artificial  neural network , Natural language processing , and Predictive analysis ). Also applications – such  as Robots  or Computer vision – are among the terms often appearing on the websites of such  companies.    The types of AI related activities reported by companies vary across sectors. While the leading  topics ( Machine learning , Artificial neural network , Natural language processing , and Computer  vision ) prevail in the “Information & communication” sector, more significant differences are  observed in other sectors.    Exploring the patenting or trademark activity of companies highlights that a low proportion ( less  than 10%) of firms that have AI -related online presence also holds these I ntellectual Property  (IP)  rights. Most pate nting companies develop technologies related to “Computer technology ”.   Zooming in on universities with AI -related online presenc e highlights the strong concentration of  universities in and around large cities . However, this polarisation  is not necessarily reflected in the  intensity with which AI -related activities take place  (proxied by the maximum number of  AI-related   topics  per location ).    This work, which is exploratory in nature, builds upon and complements a range of recent OECD  analysis focusing on th e diffusion and use of AI based on detailed micro -economic data.      
10  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023     Synthèse    L'intelligence artificielle (IA) a le potentiel d’agir  de manière significative sur la croissance  économique, et de transformer largement le paysage économique et les industries. Cependant,  les modalités d’adoption de l’IA au sein des entreprise s ne sont pas encore bien connues , en  particulier  suivant  les pays .    Ce travail propose une ana lyse des organisations affichant des activités liées à l’IA sur leur site  internet. Les caractéristiques et activités des entreprises et des universités qui mentionnent des  mots -clés liés à l'IA sur leurs sites Web sont analysées pour la première fois dans  quatre pays :  Canada, Allemagne, Royaume -Uni et États -Unis. L'analyse s'appuie sur les informations  collectées et fournies par GlassAI, une société privée qui lit et interprète les textes ouverts du web  à grande échelle.    S’agissant  des caractéristiques de s entreprises d'IA identifiées par la lecture du Web, l'analyse  souligne que celles -ci seraient plutôt  jeunes et petites. La grande majorité de ces entreprises d'IA  interviennent  dans le secteur "Information et communication".    Ces entreprises ont tendance à placer l'IA au cœur de leur activité, sont souvent tournées  vers le  commerce et visent à fournir des solutions à leurs clients. Ces solutions  semblent pour la plupart  liées à l'analyse de données  ou à la fourniture de services spécialisés, tels que les solutions de  cloud computing .   Au-delà des termes génériques d'intelligence artificielle  indiqués sur le site web des entreprises ,  l'apprentissage automatique  apparaît comme un sujet central, souvent associé à d'autres  techniques d'IA (par exemple, les réseaux neuronaux artificiels , le traitement du langage naturel   et l'analyse prédictive ). Les applications - telles que les robots  ou la vision par ordinateur  - font  également partie des termes qui apparaissent souvent sur les sites web de ces entreprises.    Les types d'activités liées à l'IA indiquées  par les entreprises varient selon les secteurs. Alors que  les thèmes principaux ( apprentissage automatique, réseau neuronal artificiel, traitement du  langage naturel  et vision par ordinateur ) dominent le secteur " Information et communication", des  différences plus significatives sont observées dans d'autres secteurs.    L'examen de l’activité  en matière de dépôt de brevets ou de marques montre qu'une faible  proportion ( moins de  10 %) des entreprises affichant des activités liées à l’IA sur leur site internet   détient également ces droits de propriété intellectuelle (PI). La plupart de  ces entreprises déposant   des brevets développent des technologies liées à la "technologie informatique".    S’agissant des  universités signalant des activités liées à l'IA, celles -ci sont massivement dans et  autour des grandes villes. Cependant, cette polarisation ne se reflète pas nécessairement dans  l'intensité des activités liées à l'IA ( évaluée  par le nombre maximum de sujets liés à l' IA par  localisation ).    Ce travail,  de nature exploratoire, s'appuie sur une série d'analyses récentes de l'OCDE axées  sur la diffusion et l’utilisation de l'IA et basées sur des données micro -économiques fines et les  complète.

Allerdings ist immer  noch wenig über die Art und Weise  der Einführung von KI  sowohl  in Unternehmen selbst also auch  im Länder vergleich  bekannt.    Die vorliegende Arbeit liefert eine umfassende Analyse, die sich auf Organisationen mit KI bezogener Online -Präsenz konzentriert. Zum ersten Mal werden die Merkmale von Unternehmen  und Universitäten , die KI -bezogene Schlüsselwörter auf ihren Webs eiten  erwähnen, in vier  Ländern analysiert: Kanada, Deutschland, Vereinigtes Königreich und Vereinigte Staaten. Die  Analyse stützt sich auf neuartige Informationen, die von GlassAI gesammelt und bereitgestell t  wurden, einem privaten Unternehmen, das offene Webtexte in großem Umfang liest und  interpretiert .    Die Analyse konzentriert sich auf die Merkmale der durch das Lesen von Webtexten identifizierten  KI-Unternehmen und zeigt, dass diese eher jung und klein s ind. Die große Mehrheit dieser KI Unternehmen ist im Sektor "Information und Kommunikation" tätig.    Bei diesen Unternehmen steht die KI im Mittelpunkt ihres Geschäfts, sie sind häufig  geschäftsorientiert und bieten ihren Kunden Lösungen an. Viele dieser Lös ungen scheinen mit der  Datenanalyse  oder der Bereitstellung spezialisierter Dienstleistungen, wie z. B. Cloud -Lösungen ,  zusammenzuhängen.    Neben de n allgemeinen Begriff en der  künstliche n Intelligenz , die auf Webseiten der Unternehmen  gennant w erden, erweist sich das maschinelle Lernen  als zentrales Thema, das häufig zusammen  mit anderen KI -Techniken auftritt (z. B. künstliche neuronale Netze, Verarbeitung natürlicher  Sprache  und prädiktive Analyse ). Auch Anwendungen - wie Roboter  oder Computer Vision  -  gehören zu den Begriffen, die häufig auf den Webs eiten  dieser Unternehmen auftauchen.    Die von den Unternehmen gemeldeten Arten von KI -bezogenen Aktivitäten variieren je nach  Sektor. Während die führenden Themen ( maschinelles Lernen, künstliche neuronale  Netze,  Verarbeitung natürlicher Sprache  und Bildverarbeitung ) im Sektor "Information und  Kommunikation" dominieren, sind in anderen Sektoren größere Unterschiede zu beobachten.    Die Untersuchung der Frage, inwieweit das Vorhandensein von KI -bezogenen Onli neSchlüsselwörtern mit der Patent - oder Markentätigkeit von Unternehmen zusammenhängt , zeigt,  dass ein geringer Anteil ( weniger als  10 %) der Unternehmen  mit KI-bezogene r Online -Präsenz  auch Rechte an diesem geistigem Eigentum besitz t. Die meisten patenti erenden Unternehmen  entwickeln Technologien im Zusammenhang mit "Computertechnologie".    Ein Blick auf die Universitäten mit KI -bezogener Online -Präsenz zeigt die starke Konzentration  von Universitäten in große n Städte n und deren Umkreis . Diese Polarisierung  spiegelt sich jedoch  nicht unbedingt in der Intensität wider, mit der KI -bezogene Aktivitäten stattfinden (gemessen an  der maximalen Anzahl von KI -bezogenen Themen  pro Standort ).  
12  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023      Diese Arbeit, die explorativen Charakter hat, baut auf einer Reihe neuerer OECD -Analysen auf,  die sich auf der Grundlage detaillierter mikroökonomischer Daten auf die Verbreitung und Nutzung  von KI konzentrieren, und ergänzt diese.  
IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   13   © OECD 2023     Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to machine -based systems that are capable of influ encing the environment  by making recommendations, predictions, or decisions for a given set of objectives (OECD, 2019 [1]). In  practice, AI consists of machines performing human -like cognitive functions, such as learnin g,  understanding, reasoning and interacting.   AI has the potential to significantly affect  economic growth  and to transform the economic landscape and  industries widely.  In fact, it is often referred to as a general -purpose technology , whose applications c an  potentially bring significant improvements to adopters . However, analyses focusing on the diffusion of AI  based on detailed data are still at their early stages, especially across countries.   Identifying which organisations  are leveraging AI and studyin g their characteristics is particularly important   from an economic policy perspective . It may shed light on the factors that may enable or prevent this stage  of digital transformation  and help better understand the implications of AI diffusion for economic outcomes.   In this context, this work provides a comprehensive analysis focus ing on organisations with AI -related  online presence. For the first time, it analyses the characteristics of companies and universities that  mention AI -related keywords on their websites1 across four countries: Canada, Germany, United Kingdom,  and United States. The analysis relies on novel information collected and provided by GlassAI,2 a private  company that  reads and interprets open web text at scale .   Focusing on the characteristics of companies provides a number of novel insights . These tend to be young,  small, with the large majority operating in the “Information & Communication” sector. The y tend to have  AI  at the core of their business , appear often business oriented and aim at providing solutions to their  customers. Beyond generic AI terms, several AI techniques and AI applications often appear on their  websites , with some heterogeneity across sectors. Zooming in on universities highlights the ir strong  concentration in and around large cities . However, this polarisation is not necessarily reflected in the  intensity with which AI -related activities take place .   This work, which is exploratory in nature, builds upon and complements a range of recent OECD analysis  focusing on the diffusion of AI based on  detailed micro -economic  data (e.g., Calvino and Fontanelli  (2022 [2]); Calvino et al . (2022 [3]); Squicciarini and Nachtigall  (2021 [4]) and Samek et al  (2021 [5]); Nakazato  and Squicciarini  (2021 [6]); Baruffaldi et  al. (2020 [7])), Dernis et al . (2021 [8]), as well as to the ongoing OECD BCG -Insead survey  on AI in business.   The rest of the analysis is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of the relevant  literature. Section 3 describes in detail the data used and the methodology. Section 4 analyses the  characteristics of companies with AI -related online pr esence, while Section 5 further focuses on the AI  activities of those companies. Section 6 zooms in on universities with AI -related online presence. Section  7 discusses the main findings , provides some conclusive remarks , and points to some  next steps for future  analysis.  1 Introduction  
14  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023     This work is related to two main different  strand s of literature. The first one is an emerging field that  analyses  the diffusion of AI across firms, the characteristics of AI adopters , and their impact for economic  outcomes. This has been reviewed more extensively in other complementary OECD analyses  (see for  instance Calvino and Fontanelli  (2022 [2]) and Calvino et al . (2022 [3])).Recent contributions to this strand of  literature  take advantage of  information available in firm -level surveys  – such   as confidential I nformation  and Communications Technology (ICT) surveys  –, Intellectual Property ( IP) rights  (patents and  trademarks ), or online job postings to identify the characteristics of AI adopters and their role of AI for  economic outcomes , such as firm growth or productivity.   More relevantly  for the current analysis , information fro m online job postings  has been extensively  exploited by recent work to measure firm s’ demand for AI -related skills . Indeed, in order t o develop and  adopt AI technologies , firms need specialised human capital. Hence , analys ing the demand of jobs   featuring A I-related skills may help shed light on the use of AI technologies  (Tambe, 2013 [9]). Using tools   like Machine Learning (ML)  algorithms and AI -related keywords, such as the ones found in  Baruffaldi et al.   (2020 [7]), a number of papers including Alekseeva et al.  (2020 [10]; 2021 [11]), Babina et al.  (2022 [12]),  Squicciarini and Nachtigall  (2021 [4]) and Samek et al.  (2021 [5])  identify AI -related skills and jobs in online  job postings data from  Lightcast™ (formerly known as Burning Glass  Technologies) .   Information for online job postings  is not however able to fully capture AI activity by firms (see also Calvino  et al. (2022 [3]) for further discussion) . Although information is comprehensive, it relates  by definition only  to changes in the demand for AI -related jobs . As firms may be active in AI – or even have AI at the core of  their business – without hiring new AI specialists , internet websites are a com plementary source of  information that is able to capture AI activity from a different perspective.   In line with the current analysis, t he second stream of literature is  more broadly  related to  the use of  information from internet website s in innovation studies.  Indeed, a  relatively new body  of research   leverages the use of data mining algorithms to derive information about firm activities from the vast amount  of unstructured web data (“web mining”).  Relevantly , data available online – e.g., on firms’ websites – may  contain detailed information about products, services, and inter -firm linkages which are usually not  recorded in standard sources. Moreover, web -mining techniques are effective in timely obtain ing granular  firm-level data with wide coverage.   A relevant example of web mining in the field of innovation  studies  is provided by  Kinne and Axenbeck   (2020 [13]). Using a free -to-use web scraping tool, the authors investigate and assess firm websites as a  data source for web -based innovation indicators. In particular, they conduct a pilot study on more than 2.4  million firms of the innovation ecosystem in Germany.3 Closely related to the current analysis, although at  a significantly smaller scale, t he authors also conduct an exploratory analysis of the AI ecosystem. Using  a simple keyword -based approach, they identify Berlin -based companies and scientific institution s  mentioning AI on their websites, building indicators of “AI engagement” (both firms directly engaged and  firms linked to an AI -engaged partner). Relevantly, for validation purposes, they compare the web -based  indicator with the 2019 Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for firms from manufacturing and business oriented services  with at least 5 employees . They  find higher shares of adoption for larger firms (both  directly or indirectly engaged) , which is in line with finding s from the CIS , and younger ones . 2 A brief  overview of related  analyses  
IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   15   © OECD 2023     Relatedly, Daas and van der Doef  (2021 [14]) develop a model based on web -scraping of firms’ websites to  detect innovative companies. In particular, they use the web addresses  included in the 2016 CIS of the  Netherlands (covering the period 2014 -16 and firms with more than 10 employees) to test various  classification algorithms . The ir model is able to reproduce the result from the CIS in terms of firms’  innovativeness  and to det ect innovative companies with less than 10 employees, such as start-ups.  In a similar vein,  Krüger et  al. (2020 [15]) analyse firm -to-firm relationships among 500  thousand  German  enterprises, using data obtained through web scraping of their websites. The authors create a “digital layer”  relating the textual content and the hyperlinks of firms’ websites, which results in a geo -located network  with over seven million hyperli nk relations. On this basis, they focus on  proximity among firms and their  relationship  with innovation. In particular, the authors show that innovative firms have more (hyperlinked)  partners and that these are on average more innovative than the partners of non -innovative firms.   With a different focus,  Nathan and Rosso  (2022 [16]) use administrative microdata  from the United Kingdom ,  as well as media and website content about small and medium -sized enterprises  (SMEs ) to derive  measures of firm innovation. They exploit a dataset developed by the data science firm Growth Intelligence  (GI) – which uses ML routines on company website s and media content to model firms’ lifecycle ‘events’  – focusing on new  products/services reported in the news. They find that past patent activities are related  to a firm’s current launch activities and that technologically -intensive SMEs are substantially more launch active than non -tech SMEs. In general, they argue that we b-based indicators are a useful complementary  measure to existing metrics.   In this context, this study significantly contribute s to the existing literature. For the first time, it provides a  comprehensive analysis identifying and characterising actors that mention AI -related keywords on their  website  – a unique source of information that has not yet been extensively exploited so far  – across more  than one coun try. This builds upon and extends the work by Calvino et al.  (2022 [3]), that has characterised  AI adopters combining information from online job postings, IP  rights, and internet websites , focusing on  the United Kin gdom only . The next section focuses on describing the data used and the methodology in  detail.    
16  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023     This section focuses on describing the data sources and methodology used t o identify AI actors  using data  from online websites . It first presents the data source  used – that are based on internet searches carried  out by GlassAI – and the n provides some descriptive statistics , which  highlight  the coverage and quality of  the data.    Overview of GlassAI  data and methodology   GlassAI is  a company that reads and interprets open web text at scale, exploiting any machine -readable  information contained on companies’ or other institutions’ websites: sentences, paragraphs, and names. It  perfor ms searches that can target specific topics and the mes (see Box 3.1 for further details on their  methodology ).   For the present work, GlassAI was asked to search the web in order to identify any entity with AI -related   online presence , i.e. companies as well as other type s of institutions (e.g. universities, research centres)   that mention AI -related keywords on their websites . To this end, GlassAI was provided with AI -related  keywords identified in Baruffaldi et  al. (2020 [7]), Nakazato and Squicciarini  (2021 [6]) and Squicciarini and  Nachtigall  (2021 [4]).These keywords identify, for instance, a var iety of AI-related methods or applications,  such as artificial  neural network , speech recognition , natural language understanding ,  image/ pattern/ feature extraction and recognition,  etc. The list of k eywords was provided in English and  translated into French and German  to improve the search on Canadian or German websites .   Searching companies’ and other institutions’ websites at scale in 2020, GlassAI provided a collection of  on-line information related to companies  and universities  that have an AI -related online presence , likely   producing or using AI in their business processes , or having AI -related teaching or research activities,  respectively.   Given the very nature of the data source, t he GlassAI sample might still include some  companies or  universit ies that mention AI -related keyworks on their website without actually developing or using AI. In  fact, AI related terms may in some cases be added as ideas or concepts , or mentioned on websites for  other reasons (e.g., marketing purposes),  while  not being  actively  implemented within a company or  university. However, considering  that for the large majority of companies and universities more than one  AI-related keyword  is present on their website, the proportion of such companies or universities  is likely to   be small.    GlassAI data  used in this study include companies and universities in a selection of countries: Canada  (1 013 companies and 75 universities), Germany (2  293 companies and 144 universities), the United  Kingdom (2 256 companies and 170 universiti es) and in the United States (8  221 companies and 1 752  universities).     3 Data and methodology

GlassAI methodology: using AI to read and interpret open web   GlassAI  developed AI -research capabilities that deep reads millions of business websites, in a continuous  mode, to understand companies and sectors. They rely on machine language “understanding”,  which aims  to give machines the power to understand entire sentence s and paragraphs . It relies on  various machine  learning (ML)  and computational linguistics approaches to create an automatic semantic layer for the web .  The key features are:   1. Semantic Analysis (Entity Recognition) : Natural language processing (NLP) models  are  implemented to detected entities from text on the open web (e.g. people, addresses, company  descriptions, etc.) with a high threshold of precision. Business descriptions, in particular, are  identified with language models that consider multiple featur es such as location on the web page,  use of specific keywords and phrases, sentence structure, etc.   2. Resource Crawling:  the extraction process was industrialised by developing an intelligent crawling  service which discards irrelevant data as above before r eturning it to storage.   3. Topics ontology:  GlassAI derived a 'topic map' for the data, allowing users to query the data by  subject classification. For example, a "virtual reality" search will suggest semantically -related  simple topics such as "augmented rea lity" and complex topics such as "Oculus Rift" - formed from  a Company and a Product.   Source: Glass AI, https://www.glass.ai/ , 2020     GlassAI data : variables and  coverage   GlassAI data provision  include s some basic information about companies, such as  their name, location,  and sector, the description of their activit ies, registered company numbers – when available  - as well as  records of members of the board  (see Table  3.1). In the case of  universities , the data extracted  were more  limited, with fewer variables available ( e.g., name, location).   Table  3.1.

18  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023     The extent to which GlassAI was able to retrieve information through reading the web is presented in   Figure  3.1. While information related to companies’ description, location and sector of activity is well  covered, other pieces of information, such as the names of key people  or compan ies’ partners , are  sometimes lacking, which makes these data  not fully exploitable. When screening website s’ content,  GlassAI was able to allocate a selection of AI -related topics to companies and universities, using an  ontology  applied on the website’s content . AI-related topics  may therefore  be exploited to better understand  the specialisation of a given company or university in specific fields of AI, as well as  to identify  interconnection s across  different AI domains.  The analysis focuses here on the data related to  organ isations, sectors, topics and universities.  Also considering the ir more limited coverage,  other sets of  information provided by GlassAI were n ot considered in the current analysis .   Figure  3.1. GlassAI  fields coverage , company level data, 2020   Share of companies featuring relevant pieces of information, by main variable  and country     Source: OECD calculations based on GlassAI data, November 2022 .  Several  firm-level characteristics, such as the economic sector in which companies operate, the date of  firms’ incorporation as well as an estimate of the number of employees, were assessed from information  featured on the company’s  webpages . GlassAI allocated the s ectors in which companies operate to 19  groups of the 4th revision of the International Standard Industrial Classification of All Economic Activities  (ISIC , rev. 4 ). Such characteristics were in turn compared with other firm -level data available (namely the  ORBIS© database licensed by Bureau van Dijk), highlighting a relatively good degree of consistency  (see  Box 3.2).      020406080100%Canada Germany United Kingdom United States
IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   19   © OECD 2023     Box 3.2. Further analysing information on firm characteristics   The records provided by GlassAI were  compared  to commercial data from  ORBIS©  containing firm -level  information (derived from their balance s heets). This was done for companies located in the United Kingdom  and in the United States. For the United Kingdom, the two sets of data (GlassAI and ORBIS©) were linked  using official registration numbers available in the two sources. For the United State s, as the registration  number data could not be exploited, the addresses of the companies’ webpages were compared to the list  of URLs provided in ORBIS© records. For both countries, complementary linkages were established using  a series of string -matching algorithms  (see the procedure described in Annex A)  and were finalised with  manual screening to map unallocated records.   Overall, 93% of the GlassAI  sample for the United Kingdom could be mapped to company level data in  ORBIS©: 2  087 out of 2  256 companies. For the United States, correspondence was found for only 49% of  the sample (4  033 out of 8  221 companies). The relatively low matching rate for th e United States is  explained by the coverage of ORBIS©  (see Bajgar et  al. (2020 [17]) for a thorough discussion on the cross country coverage of ORBIS©) . Selected fields , namely  the date of incorporation, the firm si ze (based on the  number of employees), and the industry classes of the firms , were then compared across the two sources .  The highest level of consistency  is observed for  the date s of incorporation, which are unequivocally identified  by both sources. The co mparison between the firm size bands identified by GlassAI through web reading   and that provided in ORBIS© indicate broader variations: 66% of companies in the United Kingdom and only  35% in the United States are allocated to the same size class in both  sources.  These differences may be  driven by the different levels of consolidations available in US company accounts in ORBIS©  and possible  gaps in the years for which data are available.   Differences  are also observed for sectors into which companies are assi gned. GlassAI predicted the sector  of companies and linked those to the high -level categories of ISIC rev.4 . Hence, a  company may be allocated  to one or many sectors in GlassAI data, and conversely different sectors are provided in ORBIS©  (core,  primary an d secondar ies). GlassAI sectors are similar to at least one of the classification codes provided in  ORBIS© for 56% of companies located in the United Kingdom, and for 75% of companies in the United  States .

20  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023     This section provides  a first descriptive analysis of the characteristics of companies that have  an AI-related  online presence , based on the data provided by GlassAI described in the previous section . In particular,  the section provides insights on the age, size, sector , and activit ies of such companies  across four  countries: Canada, Germany, Un ited Kingdom, and United States .   Focusing on those provides novel insights , for the first time across more than one country, about a group  of AI actors that highlight  engagement  in AI on their website. These  insights  are complementary to those   emerging us ing different methodologies (e.g., based on information from patents, ICT surveys, online job  postings) . In particular, information collected through  web reading provides unique insights about the  activity carried out by AI companies beyond sectoral classi fication . This first characterisation is   propaedeutic to digging further into the AI activities of these AI actors, which will be further explored in the  next section.   Age and size of companies  with AI-related online presence   First, the age and size class of companies with AI online presence are explored. Available data for Canada,  Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States indicate that the companies identified are relatively  young: more than three quarters of companies  were founded after 2010 ( see the top panel of Figure  4.1).  Indeed, for  three out of the four countries analysed , more than half of the companies in the sample  have  less than 5 years of age . Focusing on the  German sample, about 10% of firms active in AI were founded  more than 20 years ago. Similar proportions are observed in the United Kingdom (9%)  and the United  States (8%), while older firms represent only 3% in the C anadian sample.   As previously discussed, the sample of firms provided by GlassAI also includes information on the  company’s size class, based on the number of employees that was retrieved during the website screening.  In the four countries considered, mor e than 80% of the sample refers to micro or small firms, having 50  employees or less (see the bottom panel of Figure  4.1). In 2020, about half of the firms flagging A I activity  on their website are identified as micro -firms, with up to  10 employees: this share is the highest in Canada  (58%) and lowest in the United States (44%). In turn, about one third of the companies with AI online  engagement have between 1 1 and 50 employees in the four countries.     4 Characterising  companies with AI related online  presence

Source: OECD calculations based on GlassAI data , November 2022 .  When analysing jointly age and size characteristics, the data highlight that  these  AI firms are typically   young and small. In Canada, nearly half of the companies are identified as micro start -ups, founded after  2015 and featuring 10 or less  employees  (see Figure  4.2). This proportion amounts to 40% for Germany,  28% for the United Kingdom and 27% for the United States. On the opposite side, older and larger firms  represent between 0.4% of the sample of AI firms (in Canada) and 2.3% (in Germany).      42% 31%12%6%9%United Kingdom 51% 27%9%5%8%United States 61% 18%6%5%10%Germany 69%18%6%4%3%Canada Less than 5 years 5 to 9 years 10 to 14 years 15 to 19 years 20 years and more 57% 30%10%3%United Kingdom 44% 37%13%6%United States 51% 35%10%4%Germany 58% 33%7%2%Canada 1 to 10 employees 11 to 50 employees 51 to 200 employees more than 200 employees

Source: OECD calculations based on GlassAI data , November 2022 .  Sectors of activity  of companies  with AI -related online presence   Beyond age and size, another key characteristic about companies that have an AI -related online presence  is their sector of economic activity. In this respect, t he sample of AI firms  under scrutiny  was allocated to  sectors of activity by GlassAI . This was done on the basis of the sector of activities mentioned on the  website , when available,  or by applying an ontology on textual information provided on websites that  proxied the industries in which companies operate. Economic sectors identified were in turn converted into  19 ISIC rev.4 industries to  ease visualisation and  facilitate comparisons with other data sources.     
IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   23   © OECD 2023     Figure  4.3. Companies  with AI -related online presence  by sector , 2020   Distribution of companies by main economic sector, ISIC, rev.4     Source: OECD calculations based on GlassAI data, November 2022 .  In all four countries, a majority of AI companies operates in  the “Information & Communication”  sector   (Figure  4.3). This sector alone represents between 53% of AI firms ( in the United Kingdom) and 64% ( in  Canada). In turn, about 9% of AI firms, on average, operate in “Professional, scientific and technical  activities”, which comprises Scientific R&D as well as Ad vertising and market research activities, ranging  from 7% in Canada  to 11% in the United Kingdom. A similar proportion of AI firms  operates in the  “Manufacturing” sector , where the  share s amount to nearly 8% for the United States and up to 12% for the  United Kingdom.   Beyond sectors: additional insights on the main activities of companies   Through r eading the companies’ webpages, GlassAI captured the  descriptions of firms’ main activities,  and classified those into a non -exhaustive list of general topics. The frequency of general topics identified  within each of the four companies’ samples provides additional insights on the type of business activities  those companies conduct, beyond those provided by the sectoral classification presented above.   The top 25 general topics are listed in the form of word clouds in Figure  4.4. In all countries considered,  companies with an AI -related online presence  tend to tag AI in their business  description , suggesting they  tend to have AI at the core of their activity . In fact,  topics like Artificial Intelligence  and Machine Learning   appear highly important, especially in Canada and Germany.   Companies with AI -related online presence relevantly  appear business  oriented  in all four countries , with  a core element related to providi ng solutions to their customers. The ir activities are  indeed  often oriented  towards technology  or offering data treatment.       010203040506070 Information & communication%Top sectorCanada Germany United Kingdom United States 024681012% Other sectors

The large r the font size, the higher the number of companies featuring that topic.   Source: OECD calculations based on GlassAI data , November 2022 .  A text mining approach – topic modelling – was performed on  the description of the companies’ activities ,  to complemen t the picture presented  above . This technique  enables to uncover  different clusters of firms’  activities , building on the use of a common terminology.  Nine clusters were identified, using the  methodology described in Box 4.1 and Annex B, into which companies with AI -related online presence  could be classified . Clusters were labelled on the basis of the key terms that tend to appear  the most   frequently : Data analy sis, Marketing platform, Cloud solution, Technological innovation, Process  automation, Team management, Robotic and vision, Content services platform, Healthcare .  The categorisation of companies into clusters  inform s on the extent to which AI technology is  applied in  broad areas to solve various  business problems  (Figure  4.5): from the general technological side (e.g.  Data analysis, Technological innovation, Process automation ), to the provision of specialised services  (e.g., Cloud solutions, Content services pla tform),  or to the marketing and human resources side (e.g.  Team management,  Marketing platform ). The two clusters  Robotics and vision  as well as  Healthcare  are  areas in which  AI is now commonly applied.  The distribution of companies by clusters tends to vary across  countr ies: Canada and the United States have the largest proportion of companies for which AI is related  to Data analysis . In Germany, almost 15% of companies indicate AI activities related to Cloud solutions ,  followed by  Robotics and vision (13%).  In the United Kingdom, more than 15% of companies tend to  connect AI -related activities with Robotics and vision.  Data analysis and Cloud solutions appear  among  the top three  clusters in three out of four countries .

Taken together, the evidence presented so far highlights that the AI companies identified through web  reading tend to be  small  start-ups mainly active in ICT services sectors. These firms tend to have AI at the  core of their business, are generally business oriented and aim at providing solutions to their customers.   Many of t hese solutions are related to d ata analysis  or the provision of specialised services.

Characterising companies with ai -related online presence using topic modelling   A topic modelling exercise was performed on the companies’ description , for the four countries altogether,   using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (L DA) algorithm and Gibbs sampling methods. “Topics” are identified on  the basis of the frequency and combination of words that are included in the business description of the  firms, as provided on their websites, and the probability of firms to belong to on e or more of the topics.  This  methodology enables to classify different terms into clusters, and ultimately, to help categorise companies  according to the different clusters. The optimal number of topics was identified as described in Annex  B.   Different c lusters (topics) were labelled on the basis of the terms that are featured together in a given topic.  Only the top 10 terms for each cluster are shown in the figure, with beta values representing the probabilities  of terms to belong to the clusters .

IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   27   © OECD 2023     Information from online websites provides a unique source to analyse the activities of companies that have  an AI -related online presence. Initial insights about the company main activity have been pro vided in the  previous section, highlighting that these tend to have AI at the core of their business, are generally business  oriented and aim  at providing solutions to their customers , e.g., related to data analysis or specialised  services .  This section ex plores further the AI activities of companies with AI -related online presence, taking  advantage of the rich set of information available  on company websites. The section  first focuses on the  different AI (rather than  general) topics listed on companies’ we bsites , assessing  their frequency and co occurrences. It then analyses the sectoral heterogeneity of those topics. Finally, it provides a glimpse of  the extent to which different AI topics are related to IP activity in those companies.   AI topics  listed on companies’ websites   A key information that is unique of the data source analysed – and is central  to the identification of the AI  actors  under scrutiny – is the  list of AI -related topics that emerged from reading their websites. The list was  provided by Gl assAI and further grouped  into broader  AI terms  or techniques relying on similar concepts  (additional details about the grouping are available in Annex  C).   Figure  5.1 displays the top terms relate d to AI identified on companies’ websites: the word  cloud s refer to  the top 2 0 terms  based on their  frequency;  the top 10 words being  listed on the right -hand side  figures . In  the sample of firms under scrutiny , the  (more generic)  topic Artificial Intelligence  was flagged in most   companies: 51% of firms in the United Kingdom, 65% of firms in the United States, and 70% of companies  in Canada and Germany.  Owing to the  prevalence  of this term, it was removed from the word cloud images  to better focus on the other AI -related techniques reported  on the companies’ webpages.   Specific AI -related techniques are among the top terminology mentioned  on companies ’ websites   (Figure  5.1): Machine learning  is the most referred technique that is signalled by 27% of companies  (Germany) ranging up to 43% (Canada). Machine learning  here encompasse s a variety of techniques,  algorithms (supervised / unsupervised), and models, as presented in Annex C. Other rather “core”  techniques  for AI , namely  Artificial neural network  and Natural language processing , are referred to by 3%  to 10% of firms, dependin g on the country.   Robotics  is also frequently associated with AI on the sample companies’ webpages: the term is mentioned  by 15% of AI companies located in the United Kingdom, 8% in the United States, 7% in Germany and only  2% in Canada. A related theme, Computer vision , is reported by 6% to 7% of AI companies in all four  countries.  5 Analysing  the AI activities of  companies with AI -related online  presence

IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   29   © OECD 2023     Several AI topics can be identified simultaneously on companies’ webpages. Analysing how  different  terms  are combined may shed  further  light about  how A I is used in firms, and where interdependencies between  techniques are found. Machine learning techniques  are a central element  for AI-active firms  located in the  four countries , which  unsurprisingly  appears often with  other techniques, such as Artificial neural network ,  Natural language processing , and Predictive analysis  (Figure  5.2). Computer vision  and Robotics  are also  frequently associated and tend to be cited together  and with machine learning techniques. Firms  highlighting  activities related to Computer vision  tend also to deal with Autonomous vehicles , and  Recognition  of different types  (image , face, pattern , object , optical characters ). In turn, companies focusing   on Robotics  also engage in Autonomous vehicles , Predictive analysis , Cognitive computing , Sensor fusion ,  Virtual agent , to list only a few.      Figure  5.2.

The generic topic Artificial  Intelligence  was excluded from the calculation.   Source: OECD calculations based on GlassAI  data, November 2022 .  The extent to which AI topics are combined slightly differ s across countries . Interestingly, this may be  related to  their relative specialisation in certain AI techniques , as revealed by the information available on  companies’ website s. In Canada, the sample of firms display activities mainly oriented towards AI “core”  techniques - Machine learning , Artificial neural network , Natural language processing  - and to  Computer  vision  (see Figure  5.3). For German firms, the top connections are observed between  Computer vision  and  Robotics , which also strongly link to Machine learning , Artificial neural networks , Natural language  processing  or Predictive analysis . In the United Kingdom and in the United States, the activities of AI firms  seem to a certain extent more diversified.

While the leading topics ( Machine learning , Artificial neural network , Natural  language processing , and Computer vision ) prevail in the “Information & communication” sector,  differences are observed in other sectors.    Robotics  is one of the top 5 subject areas signalled by companies operating in the “Manufacturing” sector,  as well as those in “Wholesale & retail trade”  sectors  across countries . In Germany , the United Kingdom  and the United States , companies from these t wo sectors  also contribute to  AI developments related to   Autonomous vehicles .

IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   33   © OECD 2023     Technologies and products protected by companies with AI -related online  presence   The analysis of the IP  portfolio of c ompanies with AI -related online presence can provide further insights  into the AI activities of such companies, by characterising the type of technologies, goods and services  they develop and /or commerciali se (see Dernis et al.  (2021 [8])). With this aim, t he sample of companies  extracted by GlassAI was linked to administrative data on IP included in the STI Micro -data Lab  infrastructure of the OECD (see Box 5.1 and Annex A). IP data c onstitute a rich source of information to  assess  technological developments (patent s) and identify new  products and services introduced on the  market (registered trademarks ). Noteworthy, firms dealing with AI techniques  are likely to use other types  of IP rights to get protection on different markets, especially copyrights. However, due to lack of  comprehensive data on copyrights, the analysis focuses on patents an d trademarks . The result of the  matching exercise indicates that the  two IP assets  have  recently  been used by  less than 10% of companies  provided in the GlassAI sample , on average, for the four countries . The coverage of the patents and  trademarks portfoli os of companies  is detailed in Box 5.1.  Technologies protected by patents were mapped to AI topics listed on companies’ webpages : the  distribution of the top 10 AI topics by technology are presented in Figure  5.6. Patent data are broken down  into 35 technology domains, as described in Schmoch  (2008 [18]). Most companies develop technologies  related to “Computer technology ”, whichever the AI topic considered. Patenting c ompanies mentioning  the  generic topic Artificial intelligence  on their websites also frequently protect inventions  related to “Digital  communication ” (16%) or “Medical technologies” (15% ). Machine learning techniques  are associated with  technologies related to “Electric machinery”  (15%) and “Medical technologies”  (11%). In turn, patenting  companies featuring the topic Robotics  are active  in technolog y areas related to “Handling & logistics”  (15%), “Medical technologies” (14%), “Measurement” (9%). The topic Computer vision  is instead  associated with patents protecting “Optics”  (23%), and Autonomous veh icles with patents related to  “Measurement” (22%), “Transport”  (18%)  or “Control”  (15%).

The distribution  of AI topics of companies and trademark ed products   are presented for the top 5 AI topics in  Figure  5.7. Companies that feature the generic term Artificial  Intelligence  on their websites and applied  for trademarks mainly protected goods and services related to  “Advertising and business services ” (18%) , “Leisure and education” (13%)  and “Clothes, textiles and  accessories” (13%).  The term Computer vision  is frequently associated with “Advertising and business  services ” (28%) trademarks , while companies  claiming activities related to Robotics  tend to protect   trademarks in “ICT and audio -visual” goods and services (19%).

IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   35   © OECD 2023     Box 5.1. Uncovering the IP portfolio of companies in the GlassAI sample   The names of companies provided  in the GlassAI  sample have been matched to the names of patent and  trademark applicants, using the procedure described in Annex A. Patent data derives from the Worldwide  Patent Statistical Database maintained by the European Patent Office (EPO)’s (also known as PATSTAT) ,  in its Spring 2022  edition, as available in the STI Micro -data Lab infrastructure. Trademarks relate to those  registered at the following three offices: the EU Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO), the Japan Patent Office  (JPO) and the US Patent and Trad emark Office (USPTO). The focus on patents and trademarks provides a  partial picture of the IP portfolio of companies, as other types of IP protection, such as copyrights or trade  secrets, might be preferred by AI companies. However, because of the lack of  available data, these  additional assets are not included in the analysis.   The name matching process enabled to identify  IP data filed during the period 2010 -18 for 63 companies  located in Canada (6.2% of companies), 148 in Germany (6.5%), 213 in the Unit ed Kingdom (9.4%) and 607  in the United States (7.4%). The matching rates are lower for Germany, Canada and the United Kingdom,  as trademark filings at the national IP office are not included in the STI Micro -data Lab infrastructure .  Therefore, the tradema rk activity of AI firms presented for these three countries are likely to be partial, as,  for the European area, only trademarks registered at the EUIPO are covered.   Patent -based indicators rely on families of patents filed within the Five IP offices (IP5  patent families), namely  the EPO, the JPO, the Korean Intellectual Property Office (KIPO) and the China National Intellectual  Property Administration  (CNIPA). IP5 patent families are defined as sets of patent applications filed in  several  IP offices to pr otect the same invention, covering at least one of the IP5, provided that  another family  member has been filed in any other office worldwide , by earliest filing date observed in the family (see Dernis  et al. (2015 [19]) and Daiko et  al. (2017 [20]) for a discussion on IP5 patent families). Technology fields are  defined using the concordance developed by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) between  the International Patent Classification (IPC) and 35 technology domains (Schmoch, 2008 [18]). Trademark  indicators are based on registrations made at the EUIPO, JPO and USPTO only. Trademarks are allocated  to products using the international classification of goods and services applied for  the registration of marks ,  the NICE classification, aggregated into 13 groups (see Annex D).

36  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023     While the previous sections focused on companies, data  from online websites  offer the unique opportunity  to focus on other organisations that are central in the AI ecosystem. In this context, u niversities with AI related online presence  were identified using the same  technique as that employ ed for companies , by  searching for  AI keywords  on their websites . GlassAI  data cover 75 universities located in Canada, 144 in  Germany, 170 in the United Kingdom and 1  752 in the United States. However, the information extracted  from websites is more limit ed compared to the variables available for companies , and include the name ,  address  and a list of AI-related terms  found  on each university’s website .   This information is described  more  in detail  and visualised  graphically  in the following subsections, which   provide a unique outlook about universities with AI -related online presence, which are likely to  play a key  role for AI-related tertiary education or research.   Location of universities with AI -related online presence   Comparisons between the location of universities and the number of AI terms  identified in universities per  location indicate the concentration of AI -related (likely education or research ) activities within a given area.  Therefore, Figure  6.1 and Figure  6.2 display the number of universities active in the AI space (left-hand  side) and the maximum number of AI -related topics identified on universities’ websites  (right -hand side)   for Canada and Ge rmany, as well as the United Kingdom and the United States  (only the conterminous  states are presented on the map ). It becomes  evident that, although  universities dealing with AI are spread  all over the countries , they are concentrated in and around large cities.   In Canada  (Figure  6.1), the regions of Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec host most of the AI -related  universities, which  tackle all a similar  range of AI-related topics although the actual  topics may differ  across  universities . In the case of Germany  (Figure  6.1), the largest number of AI -related universities is located in  Berlin, Stuttgart, Hamburg and Munich . These citi es are also important hubs in which  start-ups a s well as  car manufacturers tend to agglomerate,5 which may explain the wide range of AI terms provided.   Nevertheless, AI activities are also evident more widely in other federal states ( Bundesländer ), such as   Hesse  or North Rhine -Westphalia , where  concentration (as evident by the maximum number of terms) is  similarly high , e.g., Darmstadt and Giessen  in Hesse , or Bochum in North Rhine -Westphalia .   Compared to Canada or Germany , AI-related universities are much more polarised with respect to their  location in the United Kingdom  (Figure  6.2). Although they are spread across the country and som e smaller  hubs are evident in and around Manchester as well as Birmingham,  more than 30 universities active in the  AI space are in London . Interestingly, this polarisation is not necessarily reflected in the AI intensity .     6 Zooming in on  universities with AI related online  presence

IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   39   © OECD 2023     A large variety of AI terms is in fact evident across all AI universities in the United Kingdom, suggesting  that many different AI topics are likely studie d or investigated in all parts of the country. The landscape is  similar in the United States ( Figure  6.2), with a strong concentration of universities featuring AI on  their  websites in California (about 12% of US AI universities). This is followed by New York State, Texas,  Pennsylvania and Illinois. However, the intensity with which AI -related ( education or research) activities   take place is – similarly to the United K ingdom – much more widespread across the United States. The  number of AI terms also tends to be much higher in those two countries compared to Canada and  Germany. However, this does not necessarily imply that AI universities in those countries are more AI  intensive as it could also partly reflect keyword translation issues.   AI topics listed on universities’ websites   Interestingly, t he analysis of AI activities that was carried out for companies can also be applied to  universities , uncovering th eir main AI-related topics . For consistency, the lists of AI-related topics provided  by GlassAI are also further grouped for this exercise aggregating  AI terms into AI groups relying on similar  concepts (Annex C).   Figure  6.3 presents the top AI groups  retrieved on  universities’ websites, with  the word clouds refer ring to  the top 20 topics  based on their frequency of occurrence (left -hand side) and the bar charts presenting the  top 10 topics  based on the topic share in all AI -related universities in the respective country ( right-hand  side).   Although also very prevalent on companies’ websites, t he generic term Artificial Intelligence  was featured  in almost all universities . In Canada, 100% of AI -related universities and in the United Kingdom and the  United States (note that this term was not included in the sample extracted for Germany) more than 90%  flagged this term on their website . Therefore, it was removed  from the word cloud images to allow for other  AI-related topics to appear .   Machine learning techniques  and artificial neural network  are not only  predominant on companies’ but also  on universities’ websites in all countries for which data is available. However, there are some country  specificities worth highlighting. For instance, in Canada and in the United States, applications of AI related  to computer vision  and pattern/image recognition  appear among the top listed AI topics , which potentially  signify a  wide development  of related applications . Computer vision is also prevalent among German  universities but in this case a strong focus is also on autonomous driving , which is plausible given the  strong automotive industry in Germany and the fact that autonomous cars often  leverage computer vision   technologies . Interestingly,  robotics  feature s very highly in  all the AI -related universities  but the Canadian  ones .   Overall, AI technologies (proxied by AI terms mentioned on websites) appear to be rather similar when  comparing AI activities  of companies and universities . While business and academic website profiles  differ,  they commonly refer to  machine learning techniques , computer vision  and robotics .

IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   41   © OECD 2023     To get a better understanding of the way in which different AI technologies are studied , researched  or used  at universit ies, it is important to also examine the co -occurrences of these terms  (Figure  6.4).  Across the four countries, machine learning techniques  and robotics  are often mentioned together  on  university websites ; this  pattern was  also evident among companies.  Those terms also appe ar often in  connection with  artificial neural networks  and speech recognition . Topics related to other recognition or  detection technologies are also central to the network  but appear on university websites  together  with a   large number of different technologies , rather than with the same ones  most of the time .      Figure  6.4. Co-occur rence of AI topics in universities, 2020     Note: Data relate to the top co -occur rences of AI -related topics in universitie s active in AI, using fractional counts. The generic topic Artificial  Intelligence  was excluded from the calculation.   Source: OECD calculations based on GlassAI data, November 2022 .  In general, when comparing co -occurrences of AI topics on company and univ ersity websites, it appears  that companies tend to focus on relatively fewer topics, which are also often mentioned together, possibly  implying a higher degree of specialisation. The network of topics identified on universities’ websites, in  contrast, is m uch more interconnected albeit exhibiting weaker nodes among each term, suggesting that  university websites may present a wider range of topics. Note that those are not necessarily the same  across universities within or across countries.             
42  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023     This work provides  a comprehensive analysis focusing on organisations with AI -related online presence.  For the first time, it analyses  the characteristics of companies and universities that mention AI -related  keywords on their websites across four countries: Canada, Germany, United Kingdom, and United States.   The analysis relies  on novel information collected and provided by GlassAI, a p rivate company that reads  and interprets open web text at scale .   Focusing on the characteristics of AI companies identified through web reading , the analysis highlights  that those  tend to be young  and small . In particular, for three out of the four countr ies analysed , more than  half of the companies in the sample have less than 5 years of age.  In all countries analysed,  about half of  the firms flagging AI activity on their webpages are instead  micro -firms, with less than 10 employees.   The large  majority of  these  AI companies operates in the “Information & Communication” sector, which  accounts alone for between 53% (the United Kingdom) and 64% (Canada)  of AI firms . The sector ranking  second is the “Professional, scientific and technical activities”, which  accounts for about 9% of companies  that have an AI -related online presence.   Analysing their core activity, the analysis highlights that t hese firms tend to have AI at the core of their  business . Applying  a text mining approach to online  company descriptions highlights  that these companies   appear  often  business oriented and aim  at providing solutions to their customers . Many of these solutions   tend to relate to Data Analysis  or the provision of specialised services , such as Cloud solutions.   Relevantly,  online websites provide a unique source to analyse the AI activities of companies that have an  AI-related online presence.  Beyond the generic Artificial Intelligence terms , Machine Learning  emerges as   a central topic , often co-occurring together with other AI techniques  (e.g., Artificial neural network , Natural  language processing , and Predictive analysis ). Also applications – such as Robots  or Computer vision –  are among the terms often  appearing on the websites of  such  companies . These topics appear strongly  connected especially in Germany.   The types of AI related activities reported by companies vary across sectors.  While the leading topics  (Machine learning , Artificial neural network , Natural language processing , Computer vision ) prevail in  the  “Information & communication” sector, differences are observed in other sectors. For instance , Robotics  is  one of the top 5 subject areas signalled by companies performing in the “Manufacturing” sector  across  countries , while i n Germany, the United Kingdom and  the United States, companies from this sector also  contribute to AI developments related to Autonomous vehicles .   Exploring the patenting or trademark activity of companies highlights that a low proportion (less than 10%)  of firms that have AI -related onl ine presence also holds these IP rights. Most patenting companies develop  technologies related to “Computer technology”.  Zooming in on universities with AI -related online presenc e  highlights the strong concentration of universities in and around large cities . However, t his polarisation ,  which is especially  evident in the United Kingdom  (London)  and the United States  (California ) is not  necessarily reflected in the intensity with which AI -related activities take place  (proxied by the maximum  number of AI-related topics ). While business and academic website profiles differ, the latter also  commonly  refer to machine learning techniques, computer vision and robotics .  7 Discussio n and c oncluding remarks  
IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   43   © OECD 2023     Although comprehensive along several dimensions, t he current analysis could be further extended in  different directions. First, future work could further analyse  the patterns of technology adoption over time,  e.g., by exploiting  website  information available in  the Internet Archive . This could be particularly relevant  in the context of the COVID -19 pandemic , to analyse the extent to which different companies started  mentioning specific technologies on their websites at different points in time. Future analysis could  also  aim at  combining and comparing  the current data  with additional informa tion on AI start -ups, for instance  available in other commercial databases. Finally, future work may  broaden  the scope of analysis  based on   data from  online websites , for instance extending  the country coverage or focusing  on different  technological areas that may be complementary to the one  examined in this paper (e.g., green  technologies , in the context of the twin transition ).    
44  IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTO RS USING ONLINE DATA     © OECD 2023     Endnotes 1 Given the very nature of the data source, the sample may include few organisations that feature AI related terms on their webpages while not implementing those in their main activities. This is further  discussed in Section 3, together with additional details on the data and methodology.   2 See https://www.glass.ai/ .  3 The authors first study the web address (URL) coverage across firms, finding that it varies with firm  characteristics (as derived from the Mannheim Enterprise Panel and the European Patent Office).  Patenting firms and almost all me dium to large sized firms have websites, while very young and very small  firms tend to exhibit a lower URL coverage.   4 Trademark activity is however likely not to be fully comprehensive, so findings from this exploratory  exercise should be taken with cauti on, see Box 5.1 for further details.   5 See https://startupverb and.de/fileadmin/startupverband/mediaarchiv/research/dsm/DSM_2022.pdf   and  https://www.gtai.de/resource/blob/64100/817a53ea3398a88b83173d5b800123f9/industry -overview automotive -industry -en-data.pdf

IDENTIFYING ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE ACTORS USING ONLINE DATA   47   © OECD 2023     Annex A.  Linking data using string matching  algorithms   The matching  of company names between two different sources is carried out on a by -country basis using  a series of algorithms contained in the Imalinker (Idener Multi Algorithm Linker) system developed by  IDENER ( http://www.idener.es/ ). The matching exercise was notably implemented on the whole population  of ORBIS© companies, and patent and trademark applicants included in the STI Micro -Data -Lab over a  number of key steps:   1. For each data source, t he names of companies are harmonised using country -specific ‘dictionaries’   developed internally . These aim to deal with legal entity denomination (e.g. ‘Limited’ and ‘Ltd’),  common names and expressions, as well as phonetic and linguistic rules that might affect the way  in which company  names are written. Failing to account for suc h features of the data might  mistakenly lead to excluding a company  (not considering only because its name had been misspelt  or shortened in some places), or double counting a company  (because different spellings of its  name made it appear to be different entities).   2. In a second step, a series of string -matching algorithms – mainly token -based and string -metric based, such as token frequency matching and Levenshtein (1965 [21]) and Jaro -Winkler (1999 [22])  distances – are applied  to compare the harmonised names from the different  datasets and to  provide a matching accuracy score for each pair  of names . The precision of the match, which  depend s on minimising the number of false positive matches, is ensured through a selection of  pairs of names  made on the basis of high -score thresholds imposed on the algorithm.   3. A manual post -processing stage is then  applied , consisting in:   a. reviewing the results o f the matches;   b. assessing the proportion of non -matched companies  (possibly false negatives, that is, names   that the algorithm had failed to recognise as part of the sample); and  c. identifying new matches on a case -by-case basis (e.g. allowing for lower thre sholds for a given  algorithm), by correcting and augmenting dictionaries and through manual searches.

Characterising AI-related activities  using topic modelling   While running topic modelling, the choice of the optimal number of clusters (or topics) is non -trivial:  it is typically the one after which only marginal improvements are observed in the data distribution,  that will be best suited for human interpretation of the clusters. Four different metrics were compiled  on the data to identify the optimal number of topics, as plotted below. For further elaboration and  links to the different metrics, see  Murzintcev  (2020 [23]) accessible here: https://cran.r project.org/web/packages/ldatuning/vignettes/topics.html   Figure  A B.1.
