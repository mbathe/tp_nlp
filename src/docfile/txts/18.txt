HOW IT WORKS

                        The Ethics Canvas helps you structure ideas about the ethical implications of the projects you are working on, to visualise them and to resolve them.
                    




                        Add cards with your ideas to the fields of the canvas. Drag and drop cards to different fields. Link cards to each other, for instance specific stakeholders to specific ethical concerns. The Canvas is dynamic and will adapt to your workflow.
                    

                        Youâ€™ll get an overview of the most prominent ethical concerns of your project by glancing at the canvas. No complicated setup or configuration is required; just plug and play!
                    





ABOUT THE ETHICS CANVAS
The Ethics Canvas has been developed to encourage educators, entrepreneurs, engineers and designers to engage with ethics in their research and innovation projects. Research and innovation foster great benefits for society, but also raise
                        important ethical concerns.
                    








                        The big data revolution raises important privacy concerns. Progress in automation such as self-driving cars raises responsibility issues. Sharing platforms trigger social conflicts and precarious workers protesting on the streets.
                    

                        These and other concerns need to be dealt with, but cannot be dealt with by ethicists alone. Identifying and solving ethical concerns needs a collaborative effort, with people from different disciplines and in different professional roles working
                        together.
                    

                        The Ethics Canvas responds to this need, by providing an easy to use collaborative tool that assists in the identification, analysis and solving of ethical implications in research and innovation projects. It is both suitable for offline use, as a
                        paper canvas, and for online use, as an online collaborative tool.
                    




OUR VALUES


Driven by Conviction, Not by Money
We are a non-profit organisation. We work on the canvas for the purpose of empowering people, not for making money.
                    



Inclusive Design
We believe that the Ethics Canvas should be accessible to everyone. Therefore, joining is free. Also, the Ethics Canvas has a Creative Commons license. With proper attribution, everyone is able to use, modify and reuse the Ethics Canvas.
                    



Subscribing to the Open Source Principles
The online Ethics Canvas is an open source project, which means that the code is openly available. We support and adhere to the open source principles of transparency, participation and collaboration.
                    



Responsible Use of Personal Data
As a platform that tries to promote ethics, our core priority is to focus on ethical data handling. Explicit consent for the use of personal data will always be asked, with clear and simple terms and conditions. Personal data will only be gathered
                        for research purposes and community building purposes, never for commercial purposes.
                    
No third party exchange of personal data will happen through our online platform.
                    






MEET THE TEAM
A team of researchers in the
                        ADAPT Centre
                        has developed the Ethics Canvas. It is the result of a truly multidisciplinary effort, pulling together expertise from the areas of ethics, computer science and business development.

                        Wessel is doing research in the areas of philosophy and ethics of technology in the ADAPT Centre. His main focus is on how to integrate ethics in the practices of research and innovation.
                    

                        Currently, he is working on developing a theoretical, narrative approach to understand how technologies mediate human relations. Also, he works on a practical application of his research in the so-called "ethics canvas", which is a tool for
                        researchers to explore ethical issues.
