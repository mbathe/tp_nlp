8 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT ABSTRACT Europe is a world-leader in the production of robots. This industry  is a key element of the digital transformation of our societies and  economies that, combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), will likely  have a tremendous disruptive potential. To explore further the future  of the European robotics industry and its related challenges, the Joint  Research Centre organized a Science for Policy conference entitled  “What future for European Robotics?”, bringing together recognized  specialists from industry, academia and policy. This report presents the  main conclusions that emerged from the conference. FOREWORD The European Commission’s science and knowledge service that I lead,  the Joint Research Centre, has the mission to provide independent  scientific evidence in support of the EU policy-making process. We  produce state of the art, multidisciplinary research  and in our “Innovation  and Growth” Directorate we focus on ensuring resilient, sustainable  growth for a prosper, fairer and better European society and economy. Following our mandate, we have tried always to identify those topics  where we can make the most impact and approach them in a holistic  way. The robotics sector is, clearly, a major topic to be studied. On the  one hand, Europe is a leader in the field, manufacturing one third of the  industrial robots and producing high-quality research coming both from  the European private and public sector. It brings therefore high potential  for economic growth and can be a tremendous asset to help on the  European recovery. On the other side, and as a lesson of the current pandemic, robotics,  in combination with other ground-breaking technologies like Artificial  Intelligence, can help to make a more resilient Europe. Finally, it is also  true that the massive use of robots is not exempt of challenges: from  the ethical impacts it could bring on their interaction with humans, in 
9 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective particular with children and youngster, to the impact it could have to  the labour market. The combination of all these different facets made us take the decision  to launch an international conference that could bring together the best of industry, academia and policy-makers to discuss and identify how to maximize the opportunities and minimize the risks brought by robots. The Joint Research Centre, placed at the interface of science and poli-cy, acted as a catalyser for those debates and put forward an exciting program that, during three days and under the title “What future for European robotics?”, covering many of the relevant aspect related to robotics, its impact on Europe and potential policy options. I had the pleasure to chair the last policy roundtable, where we discussed with fellow policy-makers what regulatory framework is needed for EU ro-botics, and how public intervention can maximizes benefits and mini-mizes issues in the societal uptake of the robotic technology. The pres-ent report summarizes the results of the conference and its debates. I invite you to read it carefully, as it provides insights on how to make the best of a technology that can definitively change our lives for the better.

11 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Europe is a world-leader in the production of robots. This industry is a  key element of the digital transformation of our societies and economies that, combined with Artificial Intelligence (AI), will likely have a tremendous disruptive potential. To explore further the future of the European robotics industry and its related challenges, the Joint Research  Centre organized a Science for Policy conference entitled “What future  for European Robotics?”, bringing together recognized specialists from  industry, academia and policy. This report presents the main conclusions that emerged from the conference. POLICY CONTEXT The conference was organized in the context of the European Commission’s efforts to grasp the opportunities offered by the digital transformation to improve the EU economy, where robotics is a flagship sector,  in which Europe must keep its competitive advantage while guaranteeing technological sovereignty and remaining strictly compliant with our  social and ethics values. To achieve this, the European Commission is launching several policy  initiatives to ensure an adequate legal framework. Those initiatives include a broad set of different policies and range from a review of the  Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence, in which robotics is placed  amongst the main priorities, to a horizontal regulation on Artificial Intelligence, in which conditions for high-risk use of AI are regulated; from a  revision of the Machinery Directive, including various elements like robot safety, human-machine interaction and transparency, to the Product Liability Directive, in which rules for compensation to customers  to whom damage has been caused from the use AI and robots will be  further clarified; from legislation on working conditions to the strategy  for protection of children’s rights.
12 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT KEY CONCLUSIONS As shown during the discussions of the conference but also during the  different sections of this report, robots represent both a challenge and  an opportunity for human society in general and for Europe in particular.  Robots can be used to support humans in the performance of tedious,  dangerous or hazardous tasks; they can improve efficiency and  productivity, especially if combined with AI; they can help us increase  our societal welfare and enhance the way we learn, allowing us to  develop our potential to the maximum.  At the same time, robots, once out of the “cage” of their classical industrial application and, especially, in combination with powerful AI applications, can represent a real challenge to our society. From massive  substitution of jobs to the de-humanization of the labour market, having  workers being managed “by algorithms” to their use of for mass-control  or for serious infringements of fundamental rights, especially for children. The different discussions during the conference led to one main  conclusion. The only way to ensure that a massive societal uptake of  the robotic technology maximizes benefits and minimizes issues is by  means of a decisive, agile, horizontal, coordinated and multidisciplinary  public intervention.  Additionally, and as the EU is a leading actor in the robotics industry,  producing almost one third of all robots worldwide, whatever public  intervention is launched by the European and national administration,  it would have to ensure that Europe can retain that role. Robots will be  instrumental for the successful deployment of other disruptive technologies, like Artificial Intelligence, and will also be massive producers  of data which, when used with full respect of European legislation and  EU rights, can boost the deployment of the European data economy. As  data, Artificial Intelligence and robotics are very closely interconnected  and are at the forefront of the digital transformation, a leading role in  one of them can help to accelerate the European role in the others.

13 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective MAIN TAKEAWAYS — Regarding the impact of automation and robots on employment,  policy makers should keep a balance between the job destruction  and the job creation potential of this technology. This requires a  broad portfolio of policy initiatives to ensure that no one is left behind, including the strengthening of the welfare state, investment  in life-long education and in digital infrastructure.  — Robotics technologies typically originate in research institutions and  are then exploited in tech companies. Europe, with its strong basic  research, could focus on the beginning of the robotics value chain,  to ensure competitive advantage in the making of robotic technologies.  — For service and collaborative robots, policy makers should put a  stronger focus on robotics in regionally targeted innovation and  industry policies or on developing new and targeted instruments;  create and nurture vibrant ecosystem for robotics start-ups to tackle the persistent problem of their weak upscaling; and seize the  opportunity of a stronger involvement of the public sector. — The massive adoption of robotics technology should ensure that  machines are developed to be robust, reliable, and dependable and  that their design and development should comply with human rights  values. — Policymakers should consider the negative environmental impact  that massive deployment of AI and robotics technologies could  bring. They should ensure that recycling plans, to reuse parts and  components of the deployed machines, are already considered in  the design and development phases by manufacturers. — It is important to build methodologies to keep humans in command,  for human-robot collaboration and for fusion of skills from human  and robots. Robots and AI can support decision making, but responsibility stays with humans.
14 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT — Companies and organisations should think about what could go  wrong when implementing, purchasing, or using robotics/AI technology. In this sense, an ethical technology assessment should be  carried out before deploying AI/robotics technology. — Policy makers could consider a regulatory framework to minimise  the risk to children during social child-robot interaction.

16 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT INTRODUCTION This report compiles the results of the discussions that took placeduring the “What future for European robotics?” Science for Policy conference organized by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission under the patronage of the Portugues presidency of the Council of  the European Union. The conference took place on-line between 27th  and 29th January of 2021 with the participation of several high-level  speakers coming from industry, academia and policy. Manuel Heitor,  Portuguese Minister of Science, held the opening speech on technology  and higher education that inaugurated the conference. As robotics is seen as an increasingly important area for EU economic  growth and recovery, the Joint Research Centre launched this initiative  with the aim of providing a scientific, policy-oriented, and EU-centred  analysis of the state of this pivotal technology and to provide relevant  input to the policy debate. This report, as a follow up of the conference,  also aims to contribute further to such discussions by compiling the  most relevant conclusions and take-away messages.  The conference was organized in the context of the European Commission’s efforts to grasp the opportunities offered by the digital transformation to improve the EU economy, where robotics is a flagship sector,  in which Europe must keep its competitive advantage while guaranteeing technological sovereignty. The conference brought together leading  experts from industry, academia and policy to discuss the technical,  economic, and social angles of robotics with the overarching goal of  identifying the main policy challenges to be addressed in this field, in  the short and in the long term, also in the light of the current COVID-19  crisis. Robotics, a domain of technology that produces programmable machines, is pushing the bounds of technology as we know it. Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and related technologies have enlarged the scope of what can be disrupted by robots, inducing important  socio-economic changes. Since the COVID-19 crisis, we are witnessing  how the use of robots can bring significant efficiency improvements in  protecting health and guaranteeing security. However, there have also  been concerns about the potential for cheaper and more efficient ro-Recent advances  in Artificial  Intelligence (AI)  and related  technologies have  enlarged the  scope of what can  be disrupted by  robots, inducing  important  socio-economic  changes.1

Moreover, a vibrant robotics industry should stimulate innovation, and  can act as a catalyst to overcome the medical and economic impacts  caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The benefits of robotics for European economies and societies, in particular in the context of the EU  recovery, will only be reaped if there is a joint and coordinated effort at  EU level and these actions respect European values. To achieve this, the European Commission is launching several policy  initiatives to ensure an adequate legal framework. Those initiatives include a broad set of different policies and range from a review of the  Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence1, in which robotics is placed  amongst the main priorities, to a horizontal regulation on Artificial Intelligence2, in which conditions for high-risk use of AI are regulated; from  a revision of the Machinery Directive3, incluing various elements like robot safety, human-machine interaction and transparency, to the Product Liability Directive4, in which rules for compensation to customers  to whom damage has been caused from the use AI and robots will be  further clarified; from legislation on working conditions to the strategy  for protection of children’s rights. The report is organized as follows: Sections 2 to 5 provide an overview of the different discussion panels organized during the conference. The topics discussed and the main conclusions are presented and  summarized. Section 6 includes the keynote delivered by Commissioner  for Innovation, Research, Education, Culture and Youth, Mariya Gabriel, around the impact of robots in our society and Section 7 tackles  the particular topic of robotics and foresight, which was addressed by  the keynote delivered by Vice-President for Institutional Relations and  Foresight, Maroš Šefčovič. Section 8 includes an overview of the main  conclusions of the report. Finally, Annex I includes general details of the  conference, including its detailed programme.Figure 1 The benefits of  robotics for European  economies and  societies, in particular  in the context of the  EU recovery, will only  be reaped if there is a  joint and coordinated  effort at EU level and  these actions respect  European values.

18 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT ECONOMIC IMPACT  OF ROBOTISATION ON  EMPLOYMENT, PRODUCTIVITY  AND COMPETITIVENESS The first panel of the conference discussed the topic of the impact of  robotisation on employment, productivity and competitiveness.  It was chaired by Robert Marschinski, from the Joint Research Centre,  and featured Daron Acemoglu, from the Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, Anna Salomons, from the University of Utrecht and José  Mendonça, from the University of Porto. Robotic technology has made impressive advances in recent decades.  José Mendonça, in the first presentation of this panel, showed examples from hospital logistics, harvesting of grapes or robots operating in  dangerous environments such as flooded mine shafts. This leaves citizens and policy-makers alike wondering how such technologies might  affect the future of the economy and society at large, which was the  key question addressed in this panel.  Two competing narratives have emerged: A rather dystopian future, in which highly efficient robots have crowded out all but the most  proficient human workers and wealth is concentrated in the hands of a  minority of rich robot-owners; and a more utopian one, in which workers enjoy a fifteen-hour workweek and otherwise engage in different  leisure activities as envisioned almost a century ago by the great economist John Maynard Keynes (2010). The truth likely lies somewhere in  the middle, and, more importantly, is to some extent determined by our  policies today. Regarding employment, automation seems to be a double-edged  sword, as emphasized in the second presentation by Anna Salomons:  On the one hand, it has the potential to create new jobs through  innovation and shifts in demand; on the other hand, it might also polarise the income distribution depending on where new jobs are created. One particular type of automation that has recently been studied  in detail is industrial robotics. It is crucial to acknowledge that indus-A broad policy  portfolio is  required to ensure  that no one is  left behind in  the transition  towards a more  automated  economy.2
19 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective trial robotics is a highly specialised technology that is concentrated in a  few sectors (see Fig.2) - more than one quarter of all robots in the EU  are installed in German car manufacturing - which ex ante limits their  impact on employment (Fernández et al., 2020). Some studies find that  this technology is associated with reduced employment, particularly for  low-skill workers (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2019; Graetz and Michaels,  2018). However, it appears that this outcome depends strongly on the  years and countries included in the analysis: using a wider sample of  EU countries, Klenert et al. (2020) and Anton et al. (2020) find a positive association between robots and aggregate employment, in  particular after 2005. This is confirmed by studies using firm-level  data (Domini et al. 2019, Jäger et al. 2016, Koch et al. 2019). Not explicitly discussed in the panel, but still important for the topic is  the positive effect of new technologies on productivity: Industrial robots (Graetz and Michaels, 2018; Jungmittag and Pesole, 2019),  Information and Communication Technologies (Jorgenson and Stiroh,  2008; Strauss and Samkharadze, 2011) and Software (Adarov et al.,  2020) are all key drivers of productivity. What Keynes wrote in 1930 describes current attitudes surprisingly  well: “We are suffering, not from the rheumatics of old age, but from  the growing-pains of over-rapid changes […]. The increase of technical efficiency has been taking place faster than we can deal with the  problem of labour absorption.” Today, technical change appears to  be accelerating each year, driving productivity growth and increased  living standards. Simultaneously, new jobs are being created while Figure 2 Distribution of  industrial robots by  sector and country in  Europe in 2016.

20 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT others are automated away (Autor and Salomons, 2017). As stressed  by the third speaker, Daron Acemoglu, this implies a responsibility for  policy-making to maintain a healthy balance between the two effects, since a laisser-faire approach regarding automation would pose  the risk of higher unemployment, increased inequality, and in its final  consequence social instability. Instead, a broad policy portfolio is  required to ensure that no one is left behind in the transition  towards a more automated economy: Strengthening of the welfare state, investment in life-long education, avoiding excessive wealth  concentration and investment in (digital) infrastructure. These policies  support Europe’s transition into a future Mr Keynes could only dream  of in his days.  HOW THE ROBOTICS INDUSTRY  CAN SUPPORT THE EU  RECOVERY The objective of the industry panel was review Europe’s position in  the worldwide context regarding the state-of-art in innovation,  to analyse the EU territorial hotspots and their best practices  and the future outlook. It was chaired by Ramón Compañó and included Zoltán Cséfalvay, from the Matthias Corvinus Collegium, Helge  Holm-Larsen, CEO at Syddansk Innovation A/S, Daniel Dines, Co-Founder and CEO of UiPath and Laszlo Hradszki, Senior Advisor at Hiventures. Daniel Dines presented the Bucharest-born software company UiPath,  which develops and implements an end-to-end platform for automation, combining Robotic Process Automation (RPA) with a full suite of  other technological capabilities to help organizations scale their digital business operations. RPA is different from traditional automation  or physical robots, as it emulates and integrates actions performed  by humans on their computers. In other words, these software robots  can mimic rule-based and repetitive tasks, such as copy-pasting data, 3
21 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective logging into applications, filling in forms, and performing calculations,  among others. In its early stages, UiPath received financing from European venture  capital firms. UiPath went public in April 2021 and is now the second  largest software company in Europe, after SAP, by market capitalization.  Dines emphasized his vision of (software) robots to liberate people  from repetitive tasks and the importance for Europe to embrace  RPA (UiPath 2020). He also stressed the importance for Europe to become more active in robotics to strengthen its competitiveness  and avoid being only a mere consumer (and no longer a producer) of  technological innovation. Furthermore, Dines stated that RPA is being  largely adopted in developed countries, including the US, Singapore, or  Dubai governments, which embrace automation to improve administrative efficiency and the quality of public services.  Dines presented a number of examples of how RPA contributed to combatting the current COVID-19 crisis, namely UiPath implemented automation solutions in hospitals, public administrations and businesses  worldwide. In the healthcare sector, the implementation of RPA in hospitals permitted (a) to clear a 160-day registration backlog in a single  day; (b) to provide more accurate test results in one third of the time;  or (c) to reduce the screening time of health care workers from 5 days  to 4 hours. Similarly, in public administrations, the processing time of  COVID-related applications was shortened from 45 to 5 minutes. In  banking, RPA accelerated the disbursement of grants and loans, contributing to keeping businesses alive.   Helge Holm-Larsen presented Syddansk Innovation’s experience and  lessons learnt from providing pre-seed, early stage investment to create an ecosystem of robotics companies in the Danish Odense  Region, to become a world-wide recognized “European Robotic Valley”  (see Box 1 for a detailed description of the Odense innovation ecosystem). He identified a number of success factors worth considering  for other regions that would like to embark a similar path.  First, there  shall be a collective vision amongst the stakeholders on the goals  and an agreed long-term action plan to implement it. The working  relationship within academia, industry and government must be  tight, trustful and efficient, where talents do easily move from academia to industry and across industries. Ideally, the network shall be  run by a recognized ‘orchestrator’ with suitable means and decision 
22 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT power, but no vested interest, able to provide added value to the ecosystem and able to expand it. This orchestrator must monitor regularly  previously defined Key Performance Indicators and corrective measures are taken whenever necessary; Laszlo Hradszki introduced Hiventures, a state-owned Venture Capital  firm in Budapest, whose core business is early-stage ventures investing  in Hungarian start-ups. So far, only five out of their 330 investments  were robotics-related start-ups, which could be interpreted that there  are relatively few robotics companies in Eastern Europe. While the number may be relatively low, this does not imply that there is little technological expertise nor that the quality of the start-ups is low (Cséfalvay  2021). In fact, one of the most successful Hiventures’ exit was a Hungarian robotics start-up, the Europe’s most successful scale-up, UiPath,  is based in Romania. Overall speaking Venture Capital investment in  deep tech, in general, and robotics, in particular, enjoy good health in  Europe and abroad with a notable growth over the past decade. Venture Capital investments in Europe in the deep tech industry are up by  218% from 2015 (USD 7.3 billion) to 2019 (USD 15.9 billion). Venture  Capital investments in robotics are up by 860% from 2015 (USD 160  million) to 2019 (USD 1.391 billion). In perspective, in 2019, robotics  received more Venture Capital investments in Europe than education,  HR tech or fashion, but less than fintech, medtech or energy tech.   Hradszki recalled that robotics technologies are deep tech technologies typically originating in universities and research institutions and  that Europe is very strong in the basic research needed to make robotics technologies. Being excellent in R&D, however, is not sufficient, this  knowledge needs to be exploited in tech companies. Europe’s ability to produce exploitable intellectual property was underlined also by Cséfalvay, who pinpointed to Europe’s good position  in robotics in filing patents.  Europe’s is particular strong in manufacturing, while Japan and Korea have leading positions in in-house  robotics development. Europe, however, is not a unanimous block; there  are considerable East-West disparities. According to Cséfalvay this  disparity is correlated with labour costs: the higher labour costs, the  higher degree of robot deployment. In addition to the R&D capacity, another key factor for success is that the  sector must fit the future value chains of manufacturing and services. 
23 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective In this respect, Zoltan Cséfalvay started by highlighting the differences  between industrial robots and service and collaborative robots from an  economical point of view. Industrial robots target mass production covering an essential  important, but narrow part of the economy. These kinds of robots  are dominated by few global multinationals and they operate mostly in  factories of developed economies where labour is a critical manufacturing cost. In contrast, the deployment of service and collaborative  robots is still comparatively low, but their application areas are  wide. Typically, they are locally embedded in services or small-scale  industrial settings and driven by the dynamics of global companies and  start-ups. While there are no more than one or two dozen significant industrial  robotics producers worldwide, there are several hundreds of companies producing service and collaborative robots in the world. Many of  these companies are highly innovative start-ups. These start-ups face  the challenge of finding the financial means to scale up to grow their  business. While this is a general problem for start-ups, this is particularly aggravated in Europe given the well identified funding gap. While  the number of start-ups is very similar in the US and the EU, start-up  funding is 10 times higher in the US. Better funding possibilities do not  only refer to the number of deals but also amounts, given that in the  US there are larger Venture Capitalists able to accompany scale-ups  until they arrive at an Initial Public Offering (IPO) at high valorisation.  Thus, it is not astonishing that many robotics unicorns are located in  Silicon Valley, Boston and Pittsburgh, while the only European unicorn  is UiPath.Figure 3 Global share of the  Big Five across the  robotisation chain,  2018 (%) Source: Cséfalvay,  Z. and Gkotsis, P.

24 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT Finally, Cséfalvay   mentioned a number of policy challenges for Europe  for the different types of robots (Cséfalvay and Gkotsis 2020). For industrial robots in highly robotised countries, there is a tradeoff between further job losses in manufacturing and the necessity to  strengthen their industrial base and trade, while for less robotised countries, the challenge is to climb up the added-value chain by introducing  more robots in the manufacturing chain. A more general aspect for  developed countries is to which extent industrial robots can contribute  to the reshoring of previously off-shored production processes.    For service and collaborative robots, the policy priority should be not to  miss the upcoming trend. Europe should enable targeted instruments  to create and nurture a vibrant ecosystem for robotics start-ups. One  priority is to tackle the persistent problem of weak upscaling. Another  one to seize the opportunity of a stronger involvement of the public  sector. One strategy could be to start by creating place-based innovation ecosystems in robotics in a number of European regions. For this  to happen, regionally targeted innovation and industry policies should  be implemented aligned with Industry 4.0 policies and Smart Specialisation strategies.  In the ensuing discussion, the panellists debated the question, how  the situation in Europe in will evolve in the coming 5-10 years  assuming there is no policy intervention, and what would be necessary to make a difference? For industrial robots, Helge Holm-Larsen foresees a further consolidation  of the market around the established manufacturers. In this mature Figure 4 Service robot  manufacturer, 2018 Source: Cséfalvay  based on data of IFR  (2019) for service  robot manufacturers  Industrial robots  target mass  production  covering an  essential  important, but  narrow part of  the economy.
25 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective market, he sees the role of the policy maker to defend the position of  European players. For service robots and co-bots, however, the market  is not consolidated yet. This market is expected to grow significantly  and the policymakers are urged to act in order to set a favourable  framework so that these kinds of innovative products and markets are  developed in Europe. These measures should not be focussed narrowly  on the R&D of the sector; it is equally important to invest in state-ofthe-art digital infrastructures, including more bandwidth. In the scenario that Europe is not taking an active policy intervention,  Laszlo Hradszki predicts that the robotics sector may suffer a gradual  decline similar to the European ICT sector, where a couple of decades  ago we passed from producing ICT products (e.g. mobile phones) and  components (e.g. microelectronics) in Europe to importing them from  abroad. Here, active policy intervention could influence particularly the  future of co-bots and service robots. The reason being that both the  suppliers and the main market of service robots and co-bots are SMEs.  SMEs are notoriously more fragile than larger companies because the  return investment is longer and riskier for R&D intensive products. Policy  makers can contribute to promising SME to scale-up, to consolidate  their business and to gain more market weight in a shorter time and  more sustained manner. Zoltan Csefalvay pointed out that, while in the EU it is more difficult  to scale up businesses than in the US and China due to its incomplete  internal market, different languages and diverging legislation in the  Member States, its diversity and the way Europe evolved independently  also has also some advantages. One of them being that the R&D  capacity is very high and more evenly distributed across and within  the Member States than in the USA or China.  In fact, all European  countries have numerous public and private research institutions, many  of which are conducting both excellent basic and applied research.  While Europe is good in developing technologies, it must improve how  it commercialises these technologies and brings them to the market in  a more systematic way.Europe should  enable targeted  instruments  to create and  nurture a vibrant  ecosystem   for robotics startups. 
26 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT Box 1  Case study of an Innovation   Ecosystem: The Odense Robotics Cluster The Robotics Cluster around the metropolitan area of the Danish  town of Odense is a case study of a successful regional innovation  ecosystem.   The Odense innovation ecosystem stands out due to its size and its  assets. With close to 180.000 inhabitants, it is Denmark’s third largest city and still relatively small with regard to other European innovation hotspots. Despite its relatively modest size, it has succeeded  in setting up a vibrant and promising industry structure, based upon  its pre-existing industrial base, technological capabilities and assets.  The region used to host Denmark’s largest shipyard, and when entering into decline due to fierce competition from Asian competitors,  it succeeded in keeping hold of the technological capabilities and  turn the constituents of the former shipyard industry into a prolific  sub-supplier industries serving both the domestic and international  market. In addition to the industrial tissue, additional regional assets  comprise public institutions, such as the University of Southern Denmark with 30.000 students or the University Hospital with over 1000  beds and technological and human capabilities to perform more than  1.1 million treatments annually. Odense’s industrial transition into a Robotics Hub started early when  the first signs of a declining shipyard industry appeared, and regional  decision makers took the first steps towards defining an encompassing strategy. Albeit located outside traditional innovation metropolises in Europe, it has gained considerable momentum and placed  Odense as one of the robotics hotspots in the world. The lessons  from this case study inspired the initiation of a series of dialogues,  led by Odense Seed and Venture, to mobilize all stakeholders around  a shared vision. The participants of these dialogues soon recognised  the potential of the emerging megatrend on robotics in general, and  the opportunities of building on their existing infrastructure, techno
27 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective logical capabilities and expertise to focus on collaborative robots, or  co-bots, in particular. This vision materialized into a strategic multi-annual development plan, to be put into place by an expert team  with a high degree of strategic and financial autonomy. A key element of the Odense plan was to set up a seed and venture  structure to bridge the gap between start-ups and investors. This  structure permits start-ups to benefit from a thematically targeted  incubator and accelerator programme on the one hand, and seed  money and the services offered by dense network of peers on the  other. Odense Seed and Venture acts as a facilitator taking care of  targeted measures to create a shared vision and external visibility,  such as establishing regular investment summits and developing  further the ecosystem by organizing internal seminars, generating  trust building measures or offering ecosystem access to potential  newcomers.  Currently, the Odense robotics cluster is composed by a dense network of producers (>50), integrators (>20) and component suppliers  (>12), complemented by specialized sales / distributors and automation consultancy firms. While some companies cover a range of  collaborative robots (Universal Robots, Smartshift, etc.), AI & Machine  Learning (Happtec, Norbo Robotics) or Internet of Things solutions  (Nord Modules, KK-tech, etc.), many of the companies have specialized in particular verticals, such as aerial drones, sub-sea drones,  autonomous terrestrial mobile robots, medial robots, robots for construction or for food & agriculture. In other words, the industrial landscape covers the full range of application areas, from generic mobile  service robots to robots covering a specific niche, such as bin-pickers. An important factor contributing to the growth of the ecosystem  is the collaboration of the industry with the local university, since  knowledge and new ideas are moving from the university to the  industry and vice-versa. The university provides a constant flow of  highly qualified students and is also an entry point of professionals  coming from abroad. This knowledge flow goes beyond the academia-to-industry relationship and encompasses also the intra-industry  
28 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT ones. There is a kind of “revolving doors” setting, where employees  naturally move from one company to another, which creates a positive reinforcement within in the cluster. In addition, having gained  working experience at different places, some professionals embark  on establishing their own businesses. With regard to the size of the ecosystem, € 170M were invested in  Danish robotics and automation start-ups in the period Jan 2015 to  June 2020, of which the vast majority in the Odense Cluster (Figure 5). This represents the fourth largest investment by country in  Europe.  In the same reporting period, exits in the Odense Clusters totalled an  amount of € 605M, of which most were born in two large exits. The  first one was in May 2015 when US-based Teradyne acquired Universal Robots for € 263M, the second one in April 2018 when buying  MiR for € 137M. Interestingly, the exit capital was reinvested again  into the local ecosystem and therefore reinforced it. Beneficiaries of  reinvestments were newer start-ups such as Smooth Robotics, LifeScience Robotics, Nord Modules, Kubo, OnRobot, Rokoko, or Unicontrol.Figure 5 Investment in Robotics  and Automation in  Europe in the period  01/2015 – 06/2020.  Source: Dealroom 
29 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective These exits and reinvestments are tangible key indicators of the  functioning of the ecosystem. Odense Seed and Venture, in its role  of enabler in the ecosystem, monitor these and other KPIs, communicate them, and take corrective measures when necessary. For  facilitating and enabling the work, it is indispensable to continue to  count upon a solid stakeholder support in order to maintain the focus  and implement the strategy. Only in a realm of trust and a good track  record, Business Angels are willing to co-/re-invest and enable larger  Venture Capital firms to embark in larger deals. Robotics and automation is a capital- and resource-intensive sector  where investments in research and development need to be provided  during a sustained period before returns do materialize. Similar to  other “deep tech” areas, the financing flow should not get interrupted  during the R&D period; otherwise, promising concepts do not reach  manufacturing maturity and seed investors do not get full return of  their initial investments.  In addition to the funds required to sustain the development phase,  decision makers should also guarantee an operational framework  that enables new developments.    In conclusion, the Odense robotics and automation community has  reached a global position which attracts high-potential entrepre neurs, industrial players and investors, which together create a constant output of new start-ups and collaborative activities. This community acts as a self-sustained innovation ecosystem, effectively  competing with their peers in the US and Asia.  
30 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT ASSESSING THE SOCIAL IMPACT  OF AI AND ROBOTICS  This panel looked more broadly into Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies and robots, considered as embodied forms of AI, and addressed the related social and ethical impact. The panel was chaired by  Emilia Gómez and framed in the context of the HUMAINT project she  is leading, where the opportunities and risks of AI systems are studied  together with how they impact human decision making and cognitive  and socio emotional development (Gómez et al., 2021). The discussion  was structured around three main topics: (1) the novel opportunities  brought by AI and robotics; (2) the potential risks of these technologies;  and (3) the methodologies and policies that should be implemented to  embrace the opportunities and minimize the risks. The panellists were  Susanne Bieller, from the International Federation of Robotics, Raja  Chatila, from the Sorbonne University and Aimee van Wynsberghe, Alexander von Humboldt Professor.   4.1 OPPORTUNITIES BROUGHT TO SOCIETY  BY ROBOTS Susanne Bieller outlined some benefits of industrial robots (e.g. resilience, energy efficiency), professional service robots, able to provide  improved and reliable services, and service robots for private use  such as for entertainment. She also emphasized the opportunities of  robots in manufacturing to increase competitiveness (e.g., automated production or performance optimisation).  Additionally, she referred to the future of work and quoted Paul R.  Daugherty in saying that “AI has the potential to re-humanise work,  giving us more time to be human, rather than using machines”. She  highlighted the need to reimagine work processes as a fusion  of skills between humans and robots for creating better outcomes (compared to working independently). Apart from the above,  she warned the audience not to overestimate AI/robotics technology  as today, what is simple even for children (e.g., sensorimotor and perception skills), is still difficult for machines (and vice versa). Human and  machine intelligence should therefore be considered complementary.  4
31 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective Raja Chatila emphasized the role of robots to support human  well-being when replacing people in costly, difficult, dangerous  or boring tasks. This clearly contributes to an increase of societal  well-being, productivity and sustainable economic growth. In addition,  the use of robotic technology can also bring further rights and freedom  for people who, for instance, have problems of autonomy, cannot drive,  etc. Finally, Aimee van Wynsberghe emphasised that robots are, in general,  having a strong impact on human well-being as this sort of technology  is being applied in an increasing number of ways in society. 4.2 CHALLENGES AND RISKS BROUGHT BY  AI AND ROBOTS  Raja Chatila mentioned some potential risks with respect to the  physical operation of the robotic systems. Robotic technologies imply risks as any other technology interacting with humans, so it must  be ensured that machines are developed to be robust, reliable  and dependable and that their design and development should comply with human rights values. Furthermore, any sort of delegation of  decision-making should be done in a dependable manner. He also mentioned that there are additional risks with respect to the deployment of  the system, with respect to the labour market, where he outlined that  there will surely be some level of destruction of labour-related tasks or Figure 6 Human and machine intelligence should be considered complementary. Image: © European  Union, 2020 It must be  ensured that  machines are  developed to be  robust, reliable  and dependable. 
32 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT jobs, plus some sort of substitution / transformation / creation of new  jobs. However, it is very difficult to predict accurately how the balance  will be. One of the main points mentioned by Aimee van Wynsberghe was the  negative environmental impact of both robotics and AI developments. In addition to the prevailing risk assessments, she highlighted  the usually neglected costs paid in the development and deployment  of AI systems and robots including software resources, computing  costs, (recycled) materials, waste, carbon footprints, power consumption, waste, etc. She also highlighted the need to have recycling plans  and warned about the several internalities and externalities in terms  of costs that are paid throughout the life-cycle of this sort of systems  which fall differentially on different individuals and countries and vary  in magnitude. 4.3 METHODOLOGIES THAT WE NEED TO  BUILD TRUST ON AI AND ROBOTS Susanne Bieller pointed out several focus areas to shape trust in the  use of robots at work such as building methodologies to keep humans in command, for human-robot collaboration and for fusion of  skills from human and robots; getting young people involved in STEM  subjects; inclusion and participation of the less-favoured segments of  the society. She also provided some take home messages in this respect: although robots and AI can support decision making, responsibility stays with humans/organisations developing and using the systems, the society should be aware of the risks, but also seize  the opportunities, we need to use our competences and address real  market needs, and education and skills are the most important elements to build trust. Prof Raja Chatila outlined trustworthiness, robustness, safety and  compliance with human rights as the main pillars when developing (AI) software for robots. In this regard, he pointed out that  people developing robots should significantly learn from other areas  such software engineering where there are usually very strict standards, certifications or testing tools in place concerning all the design  and development phases.  He stressed that this topic is attracting a lot  of attention from international organizations (e.g., OECD, IEEE), which 
33 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective are already working towards the definition of implementing strategies,  methodologies, and procedures for the development of trustworthy AI  systems and robotics. Aimee van Wynsberghe presented some ideas on how to identify and  address ethical risks. She suggested that companies and organisations should think about what could go wrong when implementing, purchasing, or using robotics/AI technology. In this sense, an  ethical technology assessment should be carried out before deploying AI/robotics technology. And this should be carried out by using one’s “moral imagination” to think what could go wrong in terms of  the EU values and fundamental rights such as freedom, democracy,  equality or human rights. Incorporating ethics in the design process as well as in the implementation phase of any AI/robotics-related  developments or product is nowadays a crucial part of the design  process, not as an afterthought but as something intrinsic and embodied in the design phase. This procedure needs interdisciplinary  views, incorporating ethicists in the design teams, embedded in the  organisation, performing ethical technology assessments, and asking  questions about how to align the developments with European values  and goals. She finally suggested that funding for these assessments  should come by public and independent bodies so that the exercise can  be performed with job security and impartiality. As a conclusion of the panel, the following elements can be highlighted:  the need to assess opportunities and risks from the very beginning of Figure 7 Trustworthiness,  robustness, safety  and compliance  with human rights  as the main pillars  when developing (AI)  software for robots.

34 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT the uptake process of AI and technology, and to establish the proper  mechanisms for truly human-centred and trustworthy AI and robotics.  In addition, research, beyond the risks-opportunities balance, on the  transformative power of AI and robotics in society and how they affect  EU values and fundamental rights is needed.  HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION  AND ROBOTICS IN EDUCATION This panel focused on aspects of the current state-of-the-art of research on Human-Robot interaction and included reflections about  the impact of robots on human development and education. The panel  was chaired by Vicky Charisi, who is leading the JRC’s work on child-robot interaction with a focus on the impact of embodied robotic artefacts  on child’s development (e.g. Charisi, et al. 2020; Charisi, et al. 2021a).  The discussion included perspectives of research on (i) the impact of  robots on human behaviour in human-robot joint tasks, (ii) the emerging technical challenges for the design of robots suitable to interact  with humans and (iii) the identification of policy directions in the field of  robotics in education. The panel consisted of Tony Belpaeme, from the  University of Ghent, Stéphan Vincent-Lancrin, from the OECD and Hae  Won Park, from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. A fast-growing area of application in robotics, during the last decade,  is that of robotic artefacts especially designed to interact with  humans in a socially appropriate way. More recently, we observe an  increase in robotic platforms especially designed for children,  ranging from simple robotic toys to more advanced social robots. The  scientific area that explores the emerging design principles, the corresponding technical developments in robots for children and the impact of robots’ behaviour on children’s development is framed as the  particularly multidisciplinary field of child-robot interaction. This field  is grounded on and considers two main paradigms, (i) robots that can  be used as a tool for children’s development of computational thinking 5
35 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective and programming skills and (ii) robots that can provide cognitive and  social support for children’s learning and development and are especially designed to interact with children in a socially appropriate way.  In several cases the line between these two types of applications is  blurred. The panel discussion aimed to reflect on the available scientific results and  the emerging considerations in the field of child-robot interaction and robotics in education. The specific topics of discussion were motivated by (i) the  Digital Education Action Plan 2021-2027 of the European Commission5   which aims to foster the development of a high-performing digital education ecosystem for Europe and (ii) the current global initiatives on Artificial Intelligence and Child’s rights, such as the Policy Guidance by UNICEF6   which seeks to raise awareness on child-centred approaches in the design, development and use of AI for children with a focus on children’s  fundamental rights. Around the above-mentioned axes, throughout the  discussion of this panel, several inter-connected narratives emerged.  5.1 SCIENTIFIC DEVELOPMENTS IN THE  FIELD OF CHILD-ROBOT INTERACTION First, this panel discussion sought to give an overview of the scientific  contributions in the field of human-robot interaction and robotics in education. Tony Belpaeme emphasised the fact that social robots are  highly likely to have a profound impact on children and young Figure 8 Recently, we observe  an increase in robotic  platforms especially  designed for children,  ranging from simple  robotic toys to more  advanced social  robots.

36 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT people, especially through entertainment and education. Robots, due  to features that trigger social interaction are persuasive and can have  a significant impact on human behaviour (Bartneck, Belpaeme et al.,  2020). Belpaeme mentioned examples from various contexts such as  in cardiac rehabilitation therapy, in children that are diagnosed with  diabetes and in second language learning. Even more, he referred to  one of the most well-researched areas in child-robot interaction with  robust results which highlight the effectiveness of social robots for  diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for children with autism. On a similar line, the work led by Park utilises existing theories of  social learning and highlights the fact that children’s interaction with  other agents, including robots, improves efficiency and retention  in learning (Park et al., 2019). Based on these theories, Park has been  working on developing personalised social agents for children’s learning. Personalisation in child-robot interaction can take various forms  ranging from cognitive interventions to social interaction to affective  bonding. With a personalised robot behaviour, children seemed more  engaged and showed higher learning gain than when interacting with  a robot in the role of a naive or expert. Lastly, Dr Stephan Vincent-Lancrin indicated that even though robots in specific close-ended settings  can facilitate children’s learning, the teaching practice requires the  combination of a large number of skills which is not possible for  a robot to perform yet (Vincent-Lancrin et al., 2020). He indicated  that recently there is a sharp increase in the ed-tech investment on  intelligent technologies with China leading the road into wide-spread  ed-tech adoption. 5.2 CHALLENGES AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS  FOR ROBOTICS IN EDUCATION Researchers in the field of child-robot interaction have been already  working on emerging challenges such as the protection of children’s  privacy and prioritisation of their well-being. During the panel discussion, it was agreed that practices in child-robot interaction show that  specific challenges might emerge. Tony Belpaeme highlighted that  because of the potentially strong social influence of robots protective  measures, such as a regulatory framework, should be put in place  to minimise the risk to children during social child-robot interaction. However, further research is needed, especially regarding social  reinforcement learning, which focuses on the ways robots learn from The need for  a systematic  reflection on  child-robot  interaction and  children’s rights  seems relevant  for responsible  and child-centred  developments in  robotics.
37 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective how children engage in social learning and how robots should take into  account differences on children’s engagement in learning, as mentioned  by Dr Park. To address these concerns, Dr Vincent-Lancrin proposed a  set of recommendations that can be considered by all the involved  stakeholders.  The development of any solutions should include end-users (e.g.  teachers and children) in order to ensure the usefulness of the solution. In this way, it will be ensured that these solutions improve the  learning outcome and children’s well-being by supporting interventions  that solve existing problems. This should be done in a way that promotes equity which means that all the involved stakeholders should  be aware of the existing digital divide and work towards technology  that contribute to its mitigation. Regarding the technical integration of  social robots, fairness, transparency and data protection should be prioritised in order for us to ensure that the technology which is currently  developed supports and promotes every child’s rights in educational  and play environments. The anthropologist Sherry Turkle has repeatedly reminded us through her  oeuvre that it is in our relationships with one another — not technology  — that we find our most important source of meaning (Turkle, 2017).  However, digital technology, artificial intelligence and robotics will have  an increasing role in the ways human develop and behave. For this  reason, the need for a systematic reflection on child-robot interaction  and children’s rights seems relevant for responsible and child-centred  developments in robotics (Charisi et al., 2021b). We consider this panel  discussion as an opportunity to highlight that researchers in the field  of human-robot interaction have tried to systematically investigate  the impact of social robots on human development for more than  fifteen years and with their scientific research and the emerging  evidence contribute to the design of robotic technologies that solve Figure 9 Protective measures,  such as regulatory  frameworks, should  be put in place to  minimise the risk to  children during social  child-robot interaction. Image: © European  Union, 2017
38 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT existing problems and support human well-being. In this context, the  community of human-robot interaction recognizes that there is a need  for policy support with specific regulatory actions and multi-stakeholder  synergies, including the participation of children that together with the  scientific evidence will contribute to the development of a trustworthy  ecosystems of AI and Robotics for human societies. KEYNOTE SPEECH BY  COMMISSIONER GABRIEL This section reproduces the keynote delivered by Commissioner Gabriel and it is not produced by the authors of this report. Please  check against delivery. Ladies and Gentlemen, Thank you for giving me the opportunity to address you to speak about  an important subject at the centre of a societal and economic transformations. There is no overstatement from my side recalling the big impact of  Artificial Intelligence and robotics and today, I would like to talk about  the important role that research, innovation and education already  play and will increasingly play in the domains of robotics. Robotic technology is common in industrial automation for physical tasks and represent an important support for humans to perform heavy repetitive tasks. These robots operate mainly in isolation with limited and  unidirectional interactions with humans, for the purpose of functional  control. However, this is changing, and changing fast … Powerful artificial intelligence is being embedded in robots, which increases their capabilities with more accurate sensors and actuators,  larger memory and processing capacity. As reported by the International Federation of Robotics, while industrial robotics has been one of  the prominent areas of robot applications, there is an increased 6
39 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective focus on applications requiring human-robot collaboration. There  is an important economic driver. Accounted for a meagre 3.24% of total installed robots in 2018, collaborative robots are projected to take  about 30% of the market by 2027. Europe is a global leader in the field with pioneer SMEs and we  need to develop robots for people, operating in synergies with humans  in fields in which robots and humans work together. This is very important, for instance, in the context of preparing Europe for future large  scale threats, including pandemics, where robots can, for instance,  help dealing with life-threatening situations in hospitals. Moreover, this is not the only field in which robots can contribute. In our  fight against climate change, they can lead to energy-efficiency in  industrial production. They can also support and perform experiments  in conditions that are inaccessible for humans leading to breakthroughs in science. Having this in mind and facing the global trend and the challenges  ahead of us, we have to set the conditions for a human-centred  approach and link it with the digital and green transitions for a  robust economic recovery of Europe.We have to set  the conditions for  a human-centred  approach and  link it with the  digital and green  transitions for a  robust economic  recovery of  Europe.
40 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT Evolution of robotics with socio-economic impact We expect robots to help our societies in achieving successfully these  transitions and they are expected to have a concrete and direct impact on the daily lives of all the citizens. Given the potential transformations that robots can induce in our lives, that science fiction writers explored decades ago in all sorts of futuristic scenarios, there are  growing expectations and concerns from the wider society. To take stock of this, the Commission has published a report related the  public perception of robots: Seen by many as unwanted substitutes  of humans and ‘job takers’ in the pre-COVID-19 situation, may have  changed during the current health emergency. In the post-COVID-19  context, autonomous machines are now seen as useful “operators” able to replace humans on tasks such a monitoring social distancing but also as patients controls, temperature measurements and  delivery of medications in contaminated environments. This change  in the public perception of robotic platforms in the COVID-19  context can drastically boost their adoption in many areas in the near  future. This is the perfect illustration that we need evidence-based policy  in this field to understand the impact of robot interventions on  human behaviour. The Commission in collaboration with academic  institutions, international organisations and industry is working towards  this. We need to advance in our understanding and knowhow on machine learning, artificial intelligence, computer science, computer vision,  and complex robot control systems. These foundations will have to incorporate mechanisms to adapt to a dynamic human environment with  its highly complex behaviours. To achieve this step, technological developments have to look for  knowledge in areas such as cognitive psychology, sociology, machine  learning, and develop interdisciplinary approaches to human-robot interaction. At the end of this process, the objective should be that robots operate within human environments in ways that enhance  our humanity. It is therefore important and timely to consider the possible social and ethical implications and to deepen our understanding  of the consequences of robotic technology. Simply put, robots have  to follow our common social values and goals without leaving  anyone behind.
41 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective We need to be proactive on this matter and by considering human-centred designs and developments so that we can meet the prerequisites  for Trustworthy Robots for our society and ensure that European values  are included in their design. Human sciences, underpinned by education  and culture, are essential not to leave it to a technology-centric development. Regarding this imperative, the new European Bauhaus is an important framework we are developing that could contribute to a human-centred approach in this area. By addressing in the wider context  of the Green transition of our economies and societies, and closer to  the citizens, it can provide the informed paths to introduce robots  in the daily life of citizens to support their efforts to make our life  greener while achieving the digital transition. In the context of the twin green and digital transitions, the role of  robots in society will keep expanding and diversifying, bringing  with it a host of issues surrounding the relationship between robots  and humans. Exciting scientific and technological developments are being done where robots are designed to accompany humans in artistic  expression like music improvisation, dance and painting. From another  example in the field of health, we have social robots enhancing the  diagnosis and therapy of social deficits in autistic children by mimicking  basic human facial expressions in a predictable way for the autistic  children. These examples are showing us that the impact goes well beyond  industrial productivity and it is our responsibility to make the  robots ethical and safe to be socially accepted. This is why the  Commission is currently working on setting the scene for the development of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. The High Level Expert Group  on Artificial Intelligence has identified a set of ethical guidelines which  should be taken into consideration for the design and development of  human-centred and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence. These guidelines  are also extremely relevant for robots because they embed AI in their  functioning. It is now certain that the use of robotics and AI will shape global  innovation developments and we need to be prepared. We have the  instruments to invest in new technologies and to boost advanced competences. Education plays a key role also from the user perspective 
42 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT which can benefit from advanced man-machine interfaces based on  virtual and augmented reality. The fusion of the real and artificial is a  real challenge as we can see already with the internet and it will require  skills for citizens to live in such an environment. The Commission Joint Research Centre is conducting research on  child-robots interactions to allow critical thinking from the children  while empowering them in their relation towards robots. This process  of developing trust and increasing acceptance towards robots is  key and this is an area to be further developed in the Digital Education  Action Plan. Firstly, by fostering a forward-looking digital education ecosystem including robots to help teachers for example, they will become  part of a routine for teachers and students. Secondly, by enhancing  digital skills and competences for the digital transformation, people will  have a better understanding of robots and of their capabilities. This long-term effort on education is critical. If we look at it from the  perspective of future competitiveness in the robotic-related areas, we  will need investments in R&I, as well as in large-scale testbeds  and, in parallel, to develop a highly skilled community. This is the  path to modernise our educational systems along with the shift in the  job demand. Let me recall that 45% of the created jobs in the EU until  2030 will be in sectors requiring highly skilled people and the robotics  sector is certainly one of these. Our objectives for European citizens’  digital literacy are therefore ambitious and include AI and robotics. On the other hand, we also want to keep making the EU a leader in  robotics innovation. Since December 10, Europe can now count on the  largest transnational programme ever supporting research and innovation worth more than €95.5 billion for the next seven years. This represents an increase of 30% in comparison to the previous programme at  27 Member States! As manufacturing, process and resources industries  together account for about 60% of total investments in robotics, strategic cooperation between public and private actors is necessary  to leverage all European forces to respond to the needs of Member  States and stakeholders.  Therefore, we proposed two Horizon Europe partnerships linked to  robotics. Under the pillar addressing “Global Challenges and European  Industrial Competitiveness”, the “AI, Big Data and Robotics” and the  “Made in Europe” partnerships will create opportunities for funding to 
43 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective develop and deploy next generation robotics and autonomous solutions, directly supporting our industry and our jobs. In addition, with the Communication on “A new ERA for Research  and Innovation” adopted in September, the Commission sets a renewed framework for research in Europe. This new ERA defines  concrete actions for the wider research and innovation communities  and organisations, from all disciplines, for industry, for Member States  and for Regions. In parallel, I also launched a Joint Action Plan with the Committee  of the Regions (CoR). This first Joint Action between the CoR and the  Commission is here to improve the uptake of best practices between  European regions to boost their research and innovation capacities  while fostering synergies between those facing the same issues. For the robotics sector, the new ERA and the Horizon Europe programme will help strengthen EU’s competitiveness based on  cutting-edge research and innovation activities. As an intensive  deep tech R&I sector, robotics is also covered by the European Innovation Council, in particular through the EIC Accelerator supporting  breakthrough innovations. The European Innovation Council brings  a radical new approach to support innovation Europe, funding  start-ups by taking direct equity. It has notably funded the projects  like TIMESTORM. It developed leading edge technology predicting human expectations and taking into account behaviours and psychological states to develop human-machines synergies for robots to coordinate their actions and collaborate with humans. Allow me to conclude by saying recalling Arthur C. Clarke well known  quote that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable  from magic.”. It applies to all technology and surely can see it in the  incredible advances in Artificial Intelligence and robotics. We are starting decades of proliferation of these technologies permeating  our activities and our lives. The role of robots in the society keeps expanding and diversifying,  bringing with it a host of issues surrounding the relationship between  robots and humans. While the field of Human-Robot Interaction is relatively new, there is already concrete evidence have a direct impact on  human behaviour and consequently to human society.
44 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT I strongly believe that together, we can lead making robots always  more beneficial for people while creating opportunities for our  economy. In our future, I can see an underlying infrastructure with AI  and robotics, fostering our common well-being and strictly compliant  with our social and ethics values. Thank you for your attention. KEYNOTE SPEECH BY   VICE-PRESIDENT ŠEFČOVIČ This section reproduces the keynote delivered by Vice-President  Šefčovič and it is not produced by the authors of this report. Please  check against delivery Good afternoon to you all. Thank you for inviting me to speak at this event about the future of robotics and artificial intelligence, a highly important policy area. Over the  past couple of days, you have been discussing issues mostly from the  ‘science-for-policy’ point of view; how the science you do can have  a more direct impact on policy. I would like to take a different tack and  talk about how policymakers can make the best use of technology  for society. The European Union has long been a global leader in the research  and development of robotics and AI. Through more than 120 research  projects and other coordinated action, we have worked to promote and  intensify knowledge sharing and cooperation across the entire robotics  ecosystem. Robotics can make our industry more competitive and  sustainable, while helping to solve major societal challenges. But  this field now extends well beyond industry. For example, there is a  growing emphasis on ‘co-bots’, collaborative robots, which are set to  become 30% of the market by 2027.7
45 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective The impact of robots on our societies will be enormous. This is  true both in what they can do – such as help us successfully navigate  the twin green and digital transition – but also in how people perceive  them. According to a European Commission report, robots are increasingly seen as trustworthy. Their role helping in hospitals during  the COVID-19 pandemic has no doubt boosted this. Today, I would like to outline how we can ensure a resilient EU approach to robotics, and how robotics contributes to the EU’s overall resilience. The EU finds itself at a pivotal moment. We are not  only looking to drive forward our recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, but also to build a green, digital and fair future. In other words,  we have been presented with an opportunity not just to bounce back  but bounce forward. And we have armed ourselves with the right tool in the form of  ‘NextGenerationEU’, our historic 750 billion euro recovery plan, which  we presented together with a revamped long-term budget. But making  the most of our resources is not necessarily straightforward. That is  why we are making better use of strategic foresight in high-level  policymaking. Strategic foresight is the art of developing intelligence about the  future to inform the actions of today. It is about anticipating, exploring and acting. We must consider not only what needs to be reconstructed today but also what is required to build the EU of the fu-The European  robotics sector  is already worldleading in terms  of technological  excellence. But  to make it more  resilient, and to  increase our open  strategic autonomy,  we must continue  to invest in research  and development  to advance  European interests  and strengthen  competitiveness.
46 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT ture, which we cannot expect to become less disruptive. So we need to  apply strategic foresight to resilience, which will help us maintain  Europe’s standing as a global, responsible leader, an economic  frontrunner and role model shaping the world. Resilience has become our policy compass, which is why it was the  focus of the Commission’s first annual Strategic Foresight Report,  published last September. The Report analysed the EU’s resilience capacities, vulnerabilities and opportunities in four dimensions: social  and economic; geopolitical; green; and digital. So how does robotics fit into these four categories? First, social and economic resilience. Technology has always played  a role in raising both productivity and living standards. We can see this  today with the increased use of robots in many sectors, like agriculture – where AI can assist in crop monitoring and weed control –  and healthcare, where robots assist in surgery and exoskeletons support rehabilitation.  But for many, concerns remain about how many jobs robots will  take away from humans. It is true that the rise of robotics could seriously disrupt existing business models and that millions of jobs –  most notably lower skilled ones – might be at risk. While this will vary  across sectors and regions, robotics and AI can also help create new  jobs in their stead, improved in both pay and quality. So resilience here means investing in people, in the skills and jobs of  the future – especially those linked with our green and digital transitions – while putting an increased focus on wellbeing as a barometer  for the health of our society. One concrete example: our fast-growing  battery industry. According to industrial estimates, some 800-thousand workers will need to be trained – that is reskilled or upskilled  – by 2025 to meet its labour needs. But it is not just about ensuring  the right level of technical skill. With 45% of new jobs in the EU by  2023 set to be highly-skilled, in sectors like robotics, we also need to  ensure people are equipped to live in such an environment, for  example by training children to develop critical thinking towards robots. Second, turning to geopolitical resilience, which means boosting Europe’s open strategic autonomy in an interconnected and interdependent world, in order to secure its place in diversified next-generation 
47 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective global value chains. Take again our work under the European Battery Alliance as well as the European Raw Materials Alliance. This  can both improve cost efficiency and prevent over-dependency in  strategic areas, including AI and robotics, which play important roles  in sectors such as cybersecurity, space and defence. While open to foreign investment, Europe should also seek to  safeguard its key assets, including its critical companies and infrastructures, notably through the Foreign Direct Investment Screening  mechanism. The EU’s regulatory capabilities are also important in  international cooperation. We should aim to lead the way in developing  trustworthy and human-centric technology. Ultimately, we should look  to European standards to have a significant influence on emerging global ones, through bilateral relations and action in multilateral  forums.  Third, the green dimension of resilience. This means making the most  of the green transition – for example, exploiting our urban areas to  the full by repurposing office buildings and car parks to bring nature  back to cities. But it also means utilising technology to meet our  ambitious plans to become the first climate-neutral society by 2050.  For example, industrial robots can help us reduce waste and increase  efficiency. And AI and robotics can significantly reduce the weight  of factors, such as location of production, with delivery capability,  sustainability and the carbon footprint of transport increasingly coming  into focus. In this, we must take into account the entire impact of new technologies on the environment. For example, the carbon footprint of  the production of ICT devices and the energy consumed by our digital  lifestyles throughout the life cycle of our devices. Notably, I believe  ‘science for policy’ could contribute greatly to greening the ICT  sector, and AI and robotics in particular, by supporting the development  of standards and best practices. Finally, there is the digital dimension of resilience. We must continue to  develop a strong ecosystem in Europe by investing into our digital  infrastructure, exploiting industrial data or addressing regulatory complexities. And at the same time, by fostering trust and participation. Robotics and AI will play a key role in this. The European robotics sector  is already world-leading in terms of technological excellence. But 
48 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT to make it more resilient, and to increase our open strategic autonomy,  we must continue to invest in research and development to advance European interests and strengthen competitiveness. Having funded one of the world’s largest civilian robotics programmes under Horizon 2020, the EU will maintain a strong focus  on robotics and AI research under the Horizon Europe programme  – with funding of 20 billion euros per year this decade on average,  public and private investment combined. In addition, the AI part of the  Digital Europe Program will devote over 2 billion euros to technologies  like robotics. The new Public-Private Partnership in AI, Data and Robotics will  take this to the next level. It will foster cross-pollination of research  within these three communities as well as between industry and users,  and will contribute to the overall resilience of the robotics ecosystem. Making the most of new technologies, not least in the field of AI and  robotics, is paramount if we are to overcome the challenges – and  make the most of the opportunities – which stand before us. I strongly  believe that making greater use of strategic foresight can help put  your incredible work in this field to best use. Thank you. CONCLUSIONS As shown during the discussions of the conference but also during the  different sections of this report, robots represent both a challenge  and an opportunity for human society in general and for Europe in  particular. Robots can be used to support humans in the performance  of tedious, dangerous or hazardous tasks; they can improve efficiency  and productivity, especially if combined with AI; they can help us  increase our societal welfare and enhance the way we learn, allowing  us to develop our potential to the maximum. 8
49 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective At the same time, robots, once out of the “cage” of their classical  industrial application and, especially, in combination with powerful  AI applications, can represent a real challenge to our society. From  massive substitution of jobs to the de-humanization of the labour  market, having workers being managed “by algorithms” to their use of  for mass-control or for serious infringements of fundamental rights,  especially in children. The different discussions during the conference  led to a main conclusion. The only way to ensure that a massive  societal uptake of the robotic technology maximizes benefits  and minimizes issues is by means of a decisive, agile, horizontal,  coordinated and multidisciplinary public intervention.  Additionally, and as the EU is a leading actor in the robotics industry,  producing almost one third of all robots worldwide, whatever public  intervention is launched by the European and national administration,  it would have to ensure that Europe can retain that role. Robots  will be instrumental for the successful deployment of other disruptive  technologies, like Artificial Intelligence, and will also be massive  producers of data which, when used with full respect of European  legislation and EU rights, can boost the deployment of the European  data economy. As data, Artificial Intelligence and robotics are massively  interconnected and are at the forefront of the digital transformation, a  leading role in one of them can help to accelerate the European role in  the others.  We know this decade is Europe’s digital decade, and we remain  convinced about the extraordinary potential that the robotics  industry brings to ensure that Europe is fit for the digital age. This decade  is Europe’s  digital decade,  and we remain  convinced about  the extraordinary  potential that the  robotics industry  brings to ensure  that Europe is  fit for the digital  age. 
50 JRC CONFERENCE AND WORKSHOP REPORT Box 2  Main takeaways — Regarding the impact of automation and robots on employment,  policy makers should keep a balance between the job destruction  and the job creation potential of this technology. This requires a  broad portfolio of policy initiatives to ensure that no one is left behind, including the strengthening of the welfare state, investment  in life-long education and in digital infrastructure.  — Robotics technologies typically originate in research institutions and  are then exploited in tech companies. Europe, with its strong basic  research, could focus on the beginning of the robotics value chain,  to ensure competitive advantage in the making of robotic technologies.  — For service & collaborative robots, policy makers should put a stronger focus on robotics in regionally targeted innovation and industry  policies or on developing new and targeted instruments; create and  nurture vibrant ecosystem for robotics start-ups to tackle the persistent problem of their weak upscaling; and seize the opportunity  of a stronger involvement of the public sector. — The massive adoption of robotics technology should ensure that  machines are developed to be robust, reliable, and dependable and  that their design and development should comply with human rights  values. — Policymakers should also consider the negative environmental impact that massive deployment of AI and robotics technologies could  bring. They should ensure that recycling plans, to reuse parts and  components of the deployed machines, are already considered in  the design and development phases by manufacturers.  — It is important to build methodologies to keep humans in command,  for human-robot collaboration and for fusion of skills from human  and robots. Robots and AI can support decision making, but responsibility stays with humans. 
51 What future for  European robotics? A science for policy perspective — Companies and organisations should think about what could go  wrong when implementing, purchasing, or using robotics/AI technology. In this sense, an ethical technology assessment should be  carried out before deploying AI/robotics technology. — Policy makers could consider a regulatory framework to minimise  the risk to children during social child-robot interaction.
