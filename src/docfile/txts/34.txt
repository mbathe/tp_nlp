6 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly pervades all areas of life. To seize the opportunities  this technology offers society, while limiting its risks and ensuring citizen protection,  different stakeholders have presented guidelines for AI ethics. Nearly all of them  consider similar values to be crucial and a minimum requirement for “ethically sound” AI  applications – including privacy, reliability and transparency. However, how organisations  that develop and deploy AI systems should implement these precepts remains unclear.   This lack of specific and verifiable principles endangers the effectiveness and enforceability  of ethics guidelines. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a framework specifically  designed to bring ethical principles into actionable practice when designing, implementing  and evaluating AI systems.  We have prepared this report as experts in spheres ranging from computer science,  philosophy, and technology impact assessment via physics and engineering to social  sciences, and we work together as the AI Ethics Impact Group (AIEI Group). Our paper  offers concrete guidance to decision-makers in organisations developing and using AI  on how to incorporate values into algorithmic decision-making, and how to measure the  fulfilment of values using criteria, observables and indicators combined with a contextdependent risk assessment. It thus presents practical ways of monitoring ethically relevant  system characteristics as a basis for policymakers, regulators, oversight bodies, watchdog  organisations and standards development organisations. So this framework is for working  towards better control, oversight and comparability of different AI systems, and also forms  a basis for informed choices by citizens and consumers.  The report does so in four steps:  In chapter one, we present the three main challenges for the practical implementation  of AI ethics: (1)  the context-dependency of realising ethical values , (2) the sociotechnical nature of AI usage  and (3)  the different requirements of different stakeholders  concerning the ‘ease of use’ of ethics frameworks . We also explain how our approach  addresses these three challenges and show how different stakeholders can make use of   the framework. In chapter two, we present the VCIO model (values, criteria, indicators, and observables)   for the operationalisation and measurement of otherwise abstract principles and  demonstrate the functioning of the model for the values of transparency, justice and  accountability. Here, we also propose context-independent labelling of AI systems, based  on the VCIO model and inspired by the energy efficiency label. This labelling approach is  unique in the field of AI ethics at the time of writing. 
7EXECUTIVE SUMMARY For the proposed AI Ethics Label, we carefully suggest six values, namely justice,  environmental sustainability, accountability, transparency, privacy, and reliability, based  on contemporary discourse and operability.  Chapter three introduces the risk matrix, a two-dimensional approach for handling the  ethical challenges of AI, which enables the classification of application contexts. Our  method simplifies the classification process without abstracting too much from the given  complexity of an AI system’s operational context. Decisive factors in assessing whether an  AI system could have societal effects are the intensity of the system’s potential harm and  the dependence of the affected person(s) on the respective decision. This analysis results  in five classes which correspond to increasing regulatory requirements, i.e. from class 0  that does not require considerations in AI ethics to class 4 in cases where no algorithmic  decision-making system should be applied. Chapter four then reiterates how these different approaches come together. We also  make concrete propositions to different stakeholders concerning the practical use of the  framework, while highlighting open questions that require a response if we ultimately  want to put ethical principles into practice. The report does not have all the answers but  provides valuable concepts for advancing the discussion among system developers, users  and regulators. Coming together as AI Ethics Impact Group, led by VDE Association for Electrical, Electronic  & Information Technologies and Bertelsmann Stiftung and presenting our findings here, we  hope to contribute to work on answering these open questions, to refine conceptual ideas to  support harmonisation efforts, and to initiate interdisciplinary networks and activities.  We look forward to continuing the conversation.

8 With the increasing use of artificial intelligence in all areas of life, often in the form of  algorithmic decision-making systems (ADM), discussions about AI ethics are omnipresent,  be it in the scientific community, in organisations developing or using AI, in standardsetting bodies and regulatory institutions, or civil society. Consequently, national, as well as  European institutions, are in the process of formulating frameworks for algorithmic decisionmaking in which ethics and the underlying principles and values are critical aspects. To date, well over a hundred different AI ethics guidelines have been published.1 Nearly  all of them mention values such as privacy, fairness or non-discrimination, transparency,  safety, and accountability. These seem to be considered the minimum requirements for  building and using AI applications that could be deemed ethical. The categories also form  the basis for the so-called European approach to artificial intelligence, as can be seen in  the various initiatives taken on the EU level.2 However, the way in which organisations that  develop and deploy such applications should implement these precepts is unclear.  The lack of specific and verifiable principles endangers the effectiveness of ethical  guidelines. It creates uncertainty and raises concerns about new red tape among  organisations developing AI. Lack of specificity impedes the work of oversight bodies and  watchdog organisations that cannot measure their implementation if principles remain  vague and thereby hinders the enforceability of the guidelines. It leaves policymakers  wondering how to formulate regulation that protects European values and citizens without  inadvertently hindering growth and innovation.  The solution: In bringing together this interdisciplinary group, we aimed to fill this gap by introducing a  framework that demonstrates how to put ethical principles into AI practice. This report thus  advances the discussion through multiple contributions:  •  We present the so-called VCIO (Values, Criteria, Indicators, Observables) model, an  approach for the specification and operationalisation of values. This is necessary to  make ethical principles practicable, comparable and measurable. We also demonstrate  different ways of dealing with conflicts between values. 1 These include the April 2019 report of the European High-Level Expert Group on AI, the AI4People framework  (Floridi 2018), the Beijing AI Principles (2019), or the OECD Recommendation of the Council on Artificial  Intelligence (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (2019) to name a few.

(2019), or Hagendorff (2020). 2 See the Guidelines of the European High-Level Expert Group.Implementation challenge Solution framework1 INTRODUCTION
9INTRODUCTION •  We offer practical examples for applying the VCIO model to selected values such as  transparency, accountability and justice. By operationalising selected principles in this  paper, we also identify key challenges and open questions relevant for standard-setting  and regulation, which should form the basis for future work in AI ethics. •  We propose ratings for AI ethics, as illustrated in the AI Ethics Label, inspired by the  energy efficiency label. It can offer orientation to developers trying to create ethically  sound AI systems, increase transparency and comparability of products for users, and  provide a basis for better oversight by policymakers, regulators, standards developing  associations, and watchdog organisations.  •  We present the risk matrix, a two-dimensional model for the classification of different  application contexts of AI systems. •  We show how these different approaches, i.e. the VCIO model, ethics rating and risk  matrix, work together and how the framework can be used by organisations developing  or using the systems as well as by policymakers, regulators, oversight bodies, watchdog,  and standard-setting organisations.  Our work and this paper build on previous and ongoing discussions, and we conducted  it in a science-based, interdisciplinary and participatory manner. The method is viable  on the national, European and international level. It aims to form a basis for the work of  policymakers, regulators, oversight bodies, watchdog- and standard-setting organisations  while offering orientation for self-commitment by individuals and entities developing and  deploying AI systems at a time where no official standard or regulation yet exists.Viable at multiple levels Defining AI What do we mean by artificial intelligence? AI is not  straightforward to define, so instead of a definition, we use  the following orientation for the scope considered here. In its current and most common usage, the term artificial  intelligence refers to non-symbolic machine learning  techniques or the science of getting computers to act  without being explicitly programmed. One of the bestknown techniques is deep learning. In general, we categorise  machine learning techniques as supervised, unsupervised  or reinforced learning. Supervised learning forms the basis  of many algorithmic decision-making systems (ADM). T o  take autonomous decisions, those ADM systems derive  information from considerable datasets (big data). Other typical areas of application in machine learning include  machine vision, natural language processing, and robotics, to  name a few. In this framework, we further extend our definition by all  technical approaches that rely on symbolic AI, i.e. systems  based on rules and that pursue weak AI and that comprise  techniques of machine learning, whereby this includes not  only deep learning, i.e. neural networks but support-vector  machines, typically used for regression methods, and also  Bayes algorithms. T o conclude, rather than looking on specific technical  features of AI, we look at all technical systems that whether  non-symbolic or symbolic might have an impact on humanity  through (partial) automation of decision-making processes.
10INTRODUCTION 1.1 Challenges of practically implementing AI ethics   Values that form the basis for AI ethics are open to different interpretations and may vary  depending on an AI system’s application context. Additionally, the complexity and a high  number of stakeholders involved in the development and implementation of AI systems  raises further challenges for the effective enforcement of ethical principles. Consequently,  for any AI ethics framework to have an impact in practice, the implementation needs to  address three main challenges: (1)  The realisation of values depends on the field of application and cultural context:    Values for AI systems must be fleshed out through contextualised interpretations and  their application to situations. So how we implement and prioritise values such as  justice (here includes fairness or non-discrimination) and transparency in practice,  depends to some extent on the field of application and the cultural context an AI system  operates in. A system used in the justice sector must necessarily exhibit higher levels of  privacy and fairness than a system used in the organisation of industrial production. For  application in the medical sector, reliability could be considered the most critical value.  Besides, there are often conflicts between such values, typically reframed as tradeoffs, so for example, the more transparent a system is, the lesser privacy it may protect.  Also in different cultural contexts, values are given different priorities. One culture may  prefer one value over another. 33  Any framework for the practical implementation of AI ethics must take these differences for the  realisation of values (considering value fulfilment), potential value conflicts, and heterogeneity  of application contexts into account. (2)  Multiple factors in an AI system’s development and implementation influence its impact:   AI systems are socio-technical systems. Their societal impact depends not only on the  technology (data and algorithms) but also on the system’s underlying goals and on the  way an AI is embedded in an organisational structure. The implementation of values  such as justice and transparency requires multiple measures throughout the complex  development and implementation process of AI systems. For example, transparency  might depend on the technical explainability of an AI system, which lies in the hands  of system developers, but also requires active communication and explanation of  algorithmic decision-making processes in organisations using the AI system. 33  Actionable frameworks for AI ethics need to consider the complex development and  implementation process, the socio-technical nature of AI systems, and the responsibilities   of system developers and users derived thereof.  (3)  ‘Ease of use’ of an AI ethics framework means different things for different stakeholders:    Due to the socio-technical nature of AI systems, frameworks for the practical  implementation of AI ethics need to provide tools that take into account the different  roles played by system developers and system users in providing necessary measures.  Such frameworks also need to ease external scrutiny over the implementation of these  measures (enforceability). Context-dependence Socio-technical nature of AI Ease of use
11INTRODUCTION However, the different stakeholders involved in the development, implementation  and evaluation process have different requirements when it comes to the usability of  frameworks for ethical considerations. Vendors of AI systems need an approach that makes  the implementation of such principles as easy as possible. AI developers who are generally  equipped to deal with technical challenges but not ethical dilemmas need straightforward  guidance. Organisations using AI systems need tools that provide simple comparability of  different offers when procuring the technical systems as well as guidance for embedding  these in their organisational structure. And Europeans, both as citizens and consumers,  expect AI ethics to be communicated in a way that is immediately comprehensible and  allows them to assess the quality of the systems that affect their lives. 33  As all these stakeholders have different levels of responsibility for technical and ethical  questions, it is crucial for any AI ethics framework to simplify but not oversimplify and to  provide guidance appropriate to each stakeholder’s requirement.  Combining system and process perspectives For our approach, we combine a system  perspective that defines specific ethical  requirements on AI systems themselves with a  process perspective that specifies requirements  for the design and implementation processes.  Both perspectives have their strengths and  weaknesses:  In the system perspective, a value such as  transparency is easily verifiable and, therefore,  allows for good comparability of AI systems  and enforcement of values. At the same time, a  process perspective is better suited for handling  the socio-technical nature of AI and situations where value realisations and prioritisation are  controversial and context-dependent.   A pure process perspective, however, may invite  “fig leaf behaviour” by AI vendors, especially  large companies with well-staffed compliance  departments. It also tends to place ethically  sensitive decisions with societal relevance into  internal and often non-transparent committees  and relies on the good intentions of stakeholders  which, especially from a regulatory perspective,  cannot be taken for granted. So overall, for  a practical approach to handling AI ethics, it  is necessary to use a “best of both worlds”  method that draws on both system and process  perspectives.
12INTRODUCTION 1.2  Multimethod framework as solution There is no lack of proposals for handling ethical aspects of AI. Many of these, however, do  not adequately address the challenges of context-dependency, the socio-technical nature of  AI systems and the different requirements for the ‘ease of use’ of system developers, users,  oversights bodies, policymakers, and consumers. We, therefore, introduce a framework that  focuses on the three main challenges we have identified: (1)  Our answer to the challenge of context-dependency: Combination of a contextindependent ethics rating and a classification approach   In a first step, our framework introduces an approach for the rating of ethically relevant  characteristics of an AI system (e.g. with regards to justice, accountability, transparency)  independent of the system’s application context (see VCIO approach, chapter 2). In a  separate step, it introduces a classification of different AI application contexts, based  on the risk they pose for the individuals affected and society overall (see risk matrix,  chapter 3). Our framework describes AI systems without also deciding what is acceptable  and what is not, and thus leaves those judgements in the hands of regulators and users.  (2)  Our answer to the challenge of the socio-technical nature of AI systems: Specification  of general principles both in terms of technical system requirements as well as  implementation requirements   The measurements and observables for specific values presented in chapter 2 include  both requirements for the technical system (targeting system developers) as well  as requirements for the implementation process of the system (targeting system  users). Depending on who uses our framework at which point in development and  implementation, the focus can be on either the system or process requirements.   For policymakers, regulators, oversight bodies and watchdog organisations as well   as consumers and citizens affected, both types of requirements are relevant to assess   to what extent a system is suitable for a particular application area or not. (3)  Our answer to the challenge of different needs of stakeholders concerning ‘ease of use’:  Introduction of a nuanced labelling approach    In chapter 2.3, our framework introduces the idea of a nuanced AI Ethics Label, inspired  by the well-known energy efficiency label. Labels indicating the characteristics of  a product have become well-established in many industries and have proven useful  and acceptable to consumers, industry and regulators alike. It is applicable as selfcommitment but can be used for stricter regulation as well, and therefore is workable  for all stakeholders involved. For example, it can become both a template for the work  of regulatory bodies commissioned with the enforcement of regulation and provide  orientation to AI developers and users and citizens and consumers.Framework addresses all  main challenges

14INTRODUCTION 1.3  Handling AI ethics in practice Taken together, our approach for the operationalisation of general principles (VCIO), the  context-independent rating of ethical characteristics, the proposal of the introduction of an  AI ethics label and the classification of different application contexts through a risk matrix  provides a framework for bringing AI ethics from principles to practice. While we explain  and discuss the framework’s elements in more depth in chapters 2 and 3, we here give an  overview of how different stakeholders can use the approaches: •  An organisation planning to use an AI system for a specific application follows a  simple initial checklist (e.g. drawing on the experience from HLEG pilots) to determine  whether the application is ethically-sensitive. If an application is rated as non-ethically  sensitive, the process ends at this stage. There is, for example, no need to consider  ethical requirements in purely industrial applications, that do not affect people’s lives in  a significant manner.    However, if the triage indicates that there are ethical issues to consider, then the  organisation performs a full assessment of the application context using the risk matrix.  If no regulation or official standard for their application field exists, they can then use  the VCIO approach to concretize general ethical principles for the use of AI as a basis for  self-commitments.  •  Procurement departments (both in the private and public sector) use ethics rating and  risk matrix to create clear specifications for the AI systems they plan to use. They also  benefit from market transparency through the AI ethics label. In many cases, automated  filtering for the desired ethics rating is possible, e.g. when reviewing product catalogues  or visiting AI-backed websites. •  Similarly, manufacturers of AI systems can consider the range of expected applications  using the risk matrix and decide whether to market an AI system only for applications  without ethical sensitivity, or also for higher risk classes. In the latter case, they may  gain market advantage by achieving a high ethics rating recognised worldwide for their  products. This applies in both B2C and B2B settings. •  Regulators can use the combination of the risk matrix and ethics rating to specify  requirements for different application contexts and to avoid over-regulation of  application fields that do not pose any significant ethical challenges. For application  fields that are classified in one of the higher risk levels, they may demand that an  AI system (1) must carry an ethics label that shows the rating for values such as  transparency, robustness, or justice and (2) satisfy minimum levels within the rating. •  Consumers use the ethics rating to compare AI products and services and make  informed decisions about what is acceptable to them and/or worth investing in.  Consumers are alerted to ethically sensitive applications through the risk matrix.  Moreover, consumers can trust that minimum regulatory requirements protect them.Orientation for   stakeholders to bring   AI ethics into practice
15 The VCIO model distinguishes and combines the four concepts of values, criteria, indicators  and observables for the evaluation of AI.3 The question is, however, why do we need criteria,  indicators, and observables, in short, the CIO-part of the VCIO approach? As values are  abstract, often in conflict with each other, and do not include means to evaluate their  implementation, it is essential to have other components to fulfil these tasks. This is where  the criteria, indicators and observables of the VCIO approach come into play. For example, the demand that algorithms should not discriminate finds consensus; the  debate, however, begins with the question of what is understood by discrimination (justice),  how to check whether it exists, and how to deal with conflicts between different values. Similarly, consider sustainability as a value. The fact that technologies should be  sustainable is unlikely to cause any contradiction. The dispute usually starts with what  constitutes sustainability.  The VCIO approach, therefore, fulfils three tasks: 1) clarifies what is meant by a particular value (value definition) 2)  explains in a comprehensible manner how to check or observe whether or to what extent  a technical system fulfils or violates a value (measurement)  3)  acknowledges the existence of value conflicts and explains how to deal with these  conflicts depending on the application context (balancing). To practically implement AI ethics, the VCIO approach operates on its four levels as follows:  Values formulate a general ethical concern, something that should guide our actions. They  are defined at the highest level (as justice or transparency, for example). To verify whether  an algorithm fulfils or violates specific values, we must specify Criteria that define the  fulfilment or violation of the respective value. Since it is usually not possible to directly  observe whether a criterion is met, we need Indicators (as a specific type of sign) to monitor  this. Indicators relate criteria on the one hand with Observables on the other.4  3 For the foundation of this approach, see Hubig 2016. 4 Indicators cannot be logically deduced from criteria, but rather form necessary conditions for the fulfilment of  criteria on an abstract level. They are posited and set through deliberative processes. As necessary conditions,  they cannot be weighed against or substituted for each other. By focusing on the respective observables (in  the form of quantitative or qualitative values), we gain insight into the implementation status of the indicator  in question. These values can be related across indicators with regard to amplification, compensation or  “killer” effects. The latter refers to an exceeding/undercutting of specific negotiable boundary values.Why VCIO? VCIO: values, criteria,  indicators, and observables2  VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS,  OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI  ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL
16VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL The four hierarchical levels provided by values, criteria, indicators and observables are  closely linked, where the fulfilment of the higher level depends on the lower level. However,  it is not possible to derive the lower levels from the higher ones in a straightforward, i.e.  deductive way. Instead, the normative load runs through all four levels and requires new  deliberations at all levels, in the course of which the particular instances must be negotiated  in detail.5 Note that typically, several indicators are required to evaluate the fulfilment of a criterion;  however, we can also use an indicator to assess the fulfilment of various criteria. As there  are no deductive relationships between values, criteria, indicators, and observables, as  a rule, at each stage of their determination, normative decisions should be made in a  scientific and technically informed context. To go back to the example of sustainability: when looking at ‘sustainability’ as a value,  we may use ‘resource depletion’ as a criterion. Naturally, the choice of value is already  normative to an extent, i.e. the implicit assumption that sustainability is relevant in an  ethical sense. So the choice of indicators, as well as zooming in on some observables,  depends on available data and has normative aspects. Therefore, the decision for different  5 This is also known as “indicator politics” (see Hubig 2016, cf. van der Poel 2013). Also, it is not possible to  logically deduce criteria or indicators from values but to argue for these in deliberative processes.Each level’s normative loadValues that (should) guide our actionsVALUE Criteria that define when values are fulfilled or violatedCriterion Criterion Indicators that monitor whether the criteria are meIndicator Indicator Indicator Indicator Observables that quantify or qualify in how far indicators  are metObservables Observables Observables ObservablesFIGURE 2   The VCIO model
17VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL criteria, indicators or observables is as normative as it is for specific values. It is not possible  to logically deduce criteria or indicators6 from values but to argue for these in deliberative  processes.  For further illustration, consider the problem of applying the value ‘sustainability’ to a  lake as outlined by Hubig (2016, p. 6-7). Taking the derived value ‘water quality’ and we  find two conflicting criteria: ‘drinking water quality’ and ‘quality for the food chain of  fish populations’. The populace using the lake as a drinking water reservoir stick to the  first criterion, but fisher will most likely prefer the latter. The corresponding indicator  ‘phosphate level’ demonstrates the conflict between both criteria. A lower phosphate level  is better for drinking water quality than for the fish population.  2.1  How to apply VCIO to AI ethics: Three illustrated examples In the following, we illustrate how to apply the VCIO model by focusing on three values,  namely transparency, justice, and accountability.7 The findings from the Algo.Rules project,  an initiative by the Bertelsmann Stiftung and the iRights.Lab, have been essential for the  development of the framework and this chapter in particular. Each of the illustrations shows one value with corresponding criteria, indicators,  and observables suggested. In defining these, we combine the system with process  requirements. The observables show the different levels on which we can observe the  indicator in a given system. Colour coding sorts the gradations within observables from  dark (best, high) to light (worst, low). A higher level within the observables corresponds  with a higher rating of the overall value.  Next to the values, criteria, indicators and observables, we added comments for the value  overall as well as for specific criteria, indicators or observables to explain why we have  chosen individual specifications and how they could be used or further developed.  We are aware that the examples given in the following and the illustrations here are neither  comprehensive nor detailed enough for direct application in the field. Instead, the following  illustrations are a suggestion and work-in-progress, as they would need to be further  negotiated, specified and reflected on as part of any labelling or harmonising process.  However, they may serve as guidelines for the kind of processes and discussions regulators  or users may undergo in practice. 6 Indicators thus form necessary conditions for the fulfilment of criteria on an abstract level. 7 More information on the Algo.Rules, 9 principles for the ethical development of algorithmic systems, can be  found here: https://algorules.org/en/homeOperationalising values  with indicators, observables  and potential value conflicts
18VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL Dealing with conflicting values The VCIO-approach allows measuring the  fulfilment of values using criteria, observables  and indicators. However, conflicts between  values and associated indicators may arise. A  conflict of values emerges when a value and its  indicators can’t be valid only to the extent of not  violating another value. Here, the VCIO model’s  basic principle of making values measurable  cannot be achieved. Instead, value conflicts are a  component of the approach with the assessment  and also resolving such conflicts depending on the  application context and the regulator’s or user’s  perspective on it. If conflicts exist, values and indicators that  meet an application’s requirements must be  hierarchised (see   Hubig 2007, Section 3.2). The resolve of conflicts  of values can thus happen in two places through  different stakeholders: (1)  The regulator has to hierarchise the values  concerning the context of an AI application  (also see risk matrix),   e.g. in negotiation with all parties affected. (2)  Users can solve the value conflicts for  themselves according to their preferences,  either not taking into account the  classification of application context or   going beyond the minimum requirements. T o hierarchise or manage values conflicts, there  are the following two strategies from the tradition  of wisdom ethics:1)  Bottom-up: The starting point here is a  problem’s urgency. It arises from the danger  that if the issue remains unsolved, subsequent  action at a whole would be difficult.  (Aristotle’s considerations on equity aim at  determining when the violation of values is  permitted and appropriate in a concrete case.) 2)  T op-down: Certain values are to be regarded  as higher-level because they affect further  action beyond the situation. T o decide  this, look at option values. These concern  subsequent possibilities or scope for action.  Depending on which path of action we choose,  this reduces or increases our future options  for action. Path dependencies or “constraints”  show that option values can be violated. There are also legacy values, which concern our  ability to relate to our decisions and actions in  an evaluative manner. That legacy values can be  violated becomes evident in the face of informal  techniques where we find it difficult to evaluate  our decisions and those of the technique.  In practice, where values such as privacy,  reliability or justice come into conflict with  each other, option and legacy values can act as  arbitrator values. We then assess the extent in  which a resolution of the conflict in favour of  one value (such as reliability) at the expense of  another (such as privacy) reduces or increases  our scope for action or affects our ability to place  ourselves in an evaluative relationship to our  action’s consequences.
19VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL Transparency For this rating, the value of transparency is understood as explainability and interpretability  of the algorithmic system, including the model and data used. The question is here  how or in how far transparency is being achieved. Transparency, therefore, refers to  disclosing the data’s origin and properties of the AI model in use as well as access to and  comprehensibility of the information disclosed. In this sense, we aim for transparency  in both the general operating principle and each output of the AI system. Transparency  furthermore must be tailored to the requirements of the target groups such as users and  persons affected, i.e. the system must be comprehensible to them. 2.1.1 Applying the VCIO  approach to transparency as a value (page 20/21) Justice The criteria subsumed under the value of justice in this example pertain to classic aspects  of algorithmic fairness such as bias prevention and assessment but emphasise a process  perspective to include a broader set of ethical considerations. These aspects are, for  example, inclusion, represented by criteria such as participatory procedures, or social  justice considerations, and a criterion for the assessment of trade-offs generated by the  employment of the AI system in question. In this sense, justice refers to a broader set  of ethical considerations than the often-used term fairness, which mostly focuses on  algorithmic outcomes themselves. 2.1.2 Applying the VCIO approach to justice as a value  (page 22/23) Accountability The value of accountability refers to problems that arise in connection with the complex  allocation or clarification of responsibility relationships in the use of AI. The various  dimensions of accountability range from retrospective to prospective organisational  measures for assigning responsibilities. They also include technical means or specific   ways of dealing with organisational and technical errors. 2.1.3 Applying the VCIO approach  to accountability as a value (page 24/25)Transparency as  explainability and  interpretability Justice with aspects of  algorithmic fairness and  inclusion Accountability refers to  questions of assigning  responsibility

26VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL 2.2 Values constituting the AI ethics rating In the debate on ethical and trustworthy AI, various ethical principles and values have been  put forward.8 While these contributions all have their merits, for the rating, we specifically  selected values that can be considered basic requirements for the prevention of harm  and public welfare-oriented development of AI. Building on a meta-analysis of relevant  publications, we settled on six values: transparency, accountability, privacy, justice,  reliability, and environmental sustainability. The following analysis of each value also takes into account further reaching problems  concerning normative standards that regard the social effects of AI use. These include  framework conditions, such as ensuring plurality of individual AI services, providers  and infrastructures and questions of ecological and social sustainability in the entire AI  development chain (raw material and energy consumption, click work in data farms), or  the assessment of an AI system’s resilience (reversibility of damage or more generally path  dependencies). In the following discussion, we also capture crucial aspects of AI ethics in  terms such as explainability, redress, or various tools to ensure privacy. 2.2.1 Transparency To realise the value of transparency is crucial for the fulfilment of societal goals like  participation and self-regulation (Hustedt 2019). Transparency enables people affected  by technical systems to adjust the AI’s decision-making behaviour towards them in an  enlightened manner, to identify and correct violations of rights, to engage in social debate  or to build relationships of trust. Within the debate on ethical or trustworthy AI, transparency often combines demands for  technical explainability of the algorithm itself, including requirements for the transparency  of the development and training process of the AI. Explainability has risen to prominence  in machine learning research because humans are so far not able to fully comprehend the  technical “inner workings” of deep neural networks (DNN), also in unsupervised learning.  As it is impossible to interpret exactly why deep neural networks produce individual  results, various technical methods have recently been developed to mitigate this problem,  converging under the said term of explainability (xAI). Providing explainability aims to solve attribution problems, i.e. the ability to prove why  particular errors have occurred (debugging), to increase confidence in technical systems  or to be able to acquire new knowledge from methods of machine learning. Various  other dimensions of explainability are being pursued (Mittelstadt et al. 2019) such as the  mechanistic understanding of the functioning of machine learning models (simulability).  Also, a model’s components can be made comprehensible (decomposability) or learning  algorithms be investigated (algorithmic transparency). 8 For a detailed analysis see Hagendorff 2020.Transparency to ensure  participation and selfregulation Explainability through  debugging, simulability,  decomposability and  algorithmic transparency
27VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL Regarding the development process, transparency concerns concrete questions: who  is responsible for the development of machine learning models, who has approved the  development, where does the data used to train models comes from, what quality tests have  data sets undergone, who has labelled data sets, what learning objectives are pursued, what  results are delivered by evaluations of models, what learning methods are used, how source  code is viewed and much more (Pasquale 2015; Krafft and Zweig 2019; Burrell 2016; The IEEE  Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems 2019, p. 247).  However, algorithmic processes cannot only be evaluated by checking source code, but  also by “non-invasive” techniques. These include interviewing users, extracting data from  accessible sources, systematic tests with “sock puppet accounts” used to examine certain  aspects in isolation, among other methods (Lischka and Stöcker 2017, p. 55).  2.2.2  Accountability In socio-technical environments, accountability does not necessarily refer to a causal  responsibility of actors in the sense of agency. Instead, it typically means the willingness  or obligation to assume responsibility (Saurwein 2018, p. 38; our translation). This entails  specifying the obligations as well as designating the responsible agent. Especially in  autonomous AI-based systems with unclear algorithmic selection and decision structures, it  is crucial to counteract potential so-called responsibility diffusion and responsibility flight. From a prospective viewpoint, accountable persons or institutions have to be designated,  who are then responsible for discharging the predefined transparency, verifiability and  due diligence obligations associated with the AI system. Legal requirements, certification  procedures, best practices, voluntary commitments, and other things may achieve this. As  accountable agents, these bodies must also be identifiable to all those affected and easily  accessible, i.e. for questions, complaints, or appeals. From a retrospective viewpoint, questions of financial liability must be resolved, but also  including considering non-monetary forms of redress (Floridi et al. 2018). Liability and  redress mechanisms have to be designed independently of causal legal principles, such as  negligence of action or fault in omission (e.g. AI insurance), as in some instances no clear  culpability can be assigned. Here, concepts that hold institutions, companies or individuals  liable for the operation or marketing of AI-based selection and algorithmic decisionmaking systems are necessary (risk/product liability). Concerning current codes of ethics for AI applications, accountability includes aspects of  adopting new regulations to an AI model’s verifiability and replicability. These also include  algorithmic impact assessments, the creation of monitoring bodies, the ability to appeal  against algorithmic decision-making, or remedies for automated decisions (Fjeld et al.  2020).Accountability as  willingness or obligation to  assume responsibility Accountable agents hold  responsibility Retrospective view includes  liability and redress Verifiability and replicability
28VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL 2.2.3  Privacy Safeguarding an individual’s private sphere is not only a necessary precondition for the  protection of individual autonomy and agency, but also serves vital interests in selfdevelopment, self-realisation, engaging in intimate social relations as well as participate   in democratic public deliberation.9  For the question of ethical AI, the concept of informational privacy is of particular  importance, since we often find AI applications in contexts of mass surveillance, healthcare,  marketing and many other privacy-sensitive areas. At the same time, AI applications in  themselves pose a privacy problem due to their reliance on large amounts of data. So to  ensure privacy, AI ethics should consider several methods and principles: Personal data  may only be collected and used for specific purposes. Once the purpose is fulfilled, the data  may not be further processed. The data may only be used for a purpose other than that for  which it was collected if the data subjects have given their explicit consent (specified and  legitimate purpose). In addition to the principle of consent, privacy also includes the right  to delete or rectify or the ability to restrict processing, meaning that individuals have the  power to withhold their data from use in AI applications. Furthermore learning with anonymous or pseudonymous data and using reliable  anonymisation and pseudonymisation procedures should be promoted in the development  of AI systems. In this regard, de-anonymisation potentials have to be taken into account. Privacy standards should be integrated into data processing itself, meaning privacy by  design (Nissenbaum 2019). Additionally, research on using a mathematical definition of  privacy that aims to maximise the usefulness of evaluating databases containing personal  data, while ensuring that the individual records used cannot be identified is of great  importance. The original data is obfuscated as much as necessary and then deleted; the  evaluation is only done based on the obfuscated data and expressed as differential privacy. 2.2.4 Justice  Questions of justice include problems of equal treatment and the fair distribution of certain  goods. While existing AI ethics guidelines typically focus on questions of algorithmic nondiscrimination and often frame those in terms of fairness, the VCIO approach broadens this  perspective. This includes aspects of social justice, in particular, “hidden” work, which is  essential for the operation of AI systems. Discrimination in the negative sense then refers to distinctions and classifications  that should not play a role in action because they are unjustified, i.e. they are based on  stereotyping or degrading attributions, or based on attributes that shouldn’t have a material  impact on a decision. These are often linked to categories such as gender, age, ethnic or  national origin, disability or pregnancy (Hagendorff 2019). 9 Rössler 2004, Arendt 2006, Fried 1984, Stahl 2016To ensure privacy AI ethics  must consider several  methods Informational privacy  as data is being used for  specific purposes, after  explicit consent, and with a  right to delete or rectify Differential privacy and  privacy by design Justice as algorithmic nondiscrimination and question  of fair working conditions
29VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL Concerning discrimination by AI algorithms, reasons mostly lie in the reproduction  of existing discrimination patterns that are introduced via the training data, in the  (unintended) bias of software engineers, in the absorption of biases via presuppositions  in labels, or the implementation of biases due to particular contexts of use. Other reasons  relate to a lack of due diligence and thoughtfulness in the development process and a lack  of completeness of data (bias in data selection). Such configuration flaws in software lead to  unjustified different treatment of certain groups at the application level. The aspects of social justice that the VCIO model adds to this debate focus on the said  “hidden” work that goes into the operation of AI systems. These services include  precarious, potentially health-damaging labour, particularly so-called click work required  for machine learning (Irani 2015). The training depends on the fact that large data sets are  not only created but also annotated manually with labels (Engemann 2018). This is mostly  done in specialised labelling companies, especially in Asia, which often exclude workers  from minimum-wage or other workers’ rights.  2.2.5  Reliability The consequences of erroneous outcomes, accidents or misuse of AI systems can affect  individuals, parts of a system, or an entire society. Because of the different dimensions  of harm, adequate strategies to build a reliable and trustworthy infrastructure have to be  developed (Lampe and Kaminski 2019). As reliability is not only the precondition for trust  in and/or predictability of the AI system but also a significant factor in the prevention of  individual and societal harm, it is not only a technical but also an ethical principle.  AI applications are considered reliable when they perform in intended ways as well as when  they do not possess vulnerabilities to external attackers. Reliability is akin to the concept  of predictability, meaning that systems can prevent manipulation of various kinds. AI  security problems arise when AI applications have software vulnerabilities, when they are  not resilient against cyberattacks, or when the integrity and confidentiality of personal  data are being compromised. AI applications, no different from any other intricate pieces of  software, have security vulnerabilities. In most cases, we are talking about data poisoning  attacks, adversarial examples or the exploitation of other flaws in the design of autonomous  systems.  Safety deals with the preventability of accidents and unexpected system operations.  Concerning AI systems, there are two aspects of safety: Robustness refers to the accuracy  and reproducibility of the system’s outcomes. Also, resilience gives a measurement of  an AI system’s error tolerance. This includes the ability of the technical backend to resist  interferences, e.g. through component redundancy. A thorough technology assessment has  to be implemented to reveal the most significant potential threats.  The scientific community is working to counteract these threats, also in Cybersecurity. It  is traditionally understood to include three aims concerning IT systems: confidentiality,  integrity and availability.

Availability, finally, refers to the accessibility of  information and functionality when needed. These principles as optimisation targets can  be compromised by failures, accidents or attacks from the in- and outside. Cybersecurity,  therefore, relies on not only technical means, such as data encryption standards, firewalls,  malware recognition, redundancy and disaster recovery measurements but also social  practices and training. 2.2.6 Environmental sustainability Environmental sustainability is a form of intergenerational justice and describes the  obligation towards future generations to ensure and preserve their living conditions. This  obligation is typically geared towards a careful use of natural resources, e.g., to combat  pollution and to preserve biodiversity as well as mitigate the worst effects of climate  change. Within the field of AI, this includes setting up resource-saving infrastructures for  information technology, primarily through building power-efficient data centres as well as  developing less power consuming machine learning models (Strubell et al. 2019). So far, the  more computational resources AI models have at their disposal and the more training data  they process, the more powerful and accurate the systems are. Increase in computation,  however, means an increase in energy consumption, which brings with it increased carbon  footprints. In this field, certification processes are especially useful for end-users to  evaluate the carbon footprint of a given AI application. An important criterion to arrive at  environment-friendly AI applications is the transparency regarding power consumption  and the provision of sustainability data in general. Another sustainability problem concerns the disposal of obsolete IT hardware, used to run  AI applications (Crawford et al. 2018). In this context, a right to repair can improve the  situation. While AI systems should not have a significant negative impact on sustainability and  environmental protection goals, they can also be measured or valued by the extent to which  they have positive effects on the environment. Computer vision can be used for tracking to  detect illegal fishing vessels or bush fires via satellite imagery. Or it can be used for image  and video classification, to identify endangered animals or poachers. Moreover, audio  processing can be used to detect illegal logging. Those are just a few of many examples that  show how various AI tools can be explicitly used to foster sustainability goals when taking  the context into account.Resource-saving  infrastructures to ensure  intergenerational justice A right to repair Positive effects of AI systems  on the environment
31VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL 2.3  How VCIO underpins the ratings in the AI Ethics Label By discussing the VCIO model in more depth, we have set the foundation for a  comprehensive approach towards handling AI ethics. Thereby, we demonstrated how these  values might translate into practice through examples for specifying criteria and indicators.  These can offer orientation to system developers and users alike and help regulators,  watchdog and standard-setting organisations to specify their requirements for ethical and  trustworthy algorithmic decision-making systems.  However, it remains crucial to communicate an AI system’s ethical characteristics in  a way that citizens, users, and consumers can easily understand. The same applies to  policymakers, regulators or standard-setting bodies. We, therefore, propose capturing a  core set of values in a standardised label, as shown previously. This is one among many  possibilities how our VCIO model can be used for AI regulation. How to accurately conduct  the rating and implement it in an AI ethics label is described in the following. The label includes one rating for each of the values captured with the VCIO-approach.  Letters indicate each aggregated rating with “A” indicating (close to) complete value  fulfilment. The label should include several levels, to sufficiently differentiate between  different levels of value fulfilment and correspond with the granularity of the observables.  But it should not include too many levels, as this might counteract its goal of providing an  overview of a system’s quality at a glance. Therefore, we suggest using a system with 5-7  levels (i.e. A to G). To define the levels of the system rating reached by a specific AI system, we need to  aggregate the multiple observables subsumed under a particular value into a single rating   to be displayed on the label. In principle, there are several ways in which to achieve this: 1)  Different observables can have individual metric values, which we aggregate by  computing the average value. As an example, school grades are aggregated in such a  manner: A math test with a bad mark such as D can be offset by another test with a good  mark such as a B, resulting in a final average math grade of C. 2)  We can define the minimum requirements of observables needed to reach a specific  system rating. Water quality ratings are aggregated in such a manner. A bad phosphate  level results in a lower overall rating of water quality, independently from whether the  salt level is high or low.   33  Given these two alternatives, we recommend using a minimum requirements approach when  aggregating observables into values. This is suitable as all indicators are technically equally  important and necessary for an “ethical” AI system and their effects are interrelated. As  necessary conditions, they cannot be set off against or substituted for each other.10  10 As an example, if a system is checked for biases, but possible negative biases are not addressed, the effect  would be the same as if biases had not been checked at all. Therefore, any level of rating needs a definition of  minimum requirements to be met by the indicators to reach a certain rating of the value. However, indicators  can be related to each other with regard to amplification, compensation or “killer” effects.AI evaluation that citizens,  users, and consumers  understand Levels of the ethics rating How to aggregate the  system rating Minimum requirements  aggregation as viable  approach

33VALUES, CRITERIA, INDICATORS, OBSERVABLES (VCIO) AND THE AI ETHICS LABEL IN DETAIL However, one drawback of a system using minimum requirements may be that it gives  few incentives to strive for individual indicator ratings that go beyond the minimum  requirements. For example, if a value has achieved an overall rating B, the AI system’s  provider has fewer incentives to strive for a better rating of a single indicator of said value  as the label would not reflect this. However, different mechanisms could be considered to  preserve incentives, such as indicating a certain number of higher-rated indicators with a  ‘+’ in the value’s rating. Still, to implement an AI ethics label, it is necessary to precisely set out the minimum  requirements for each level of rating, thus specifying which level on the observable level  leads to which level of value fulfilment.  We can achieve this either through a bottom-up approach, whereby each observable is  assigned a corresponding level on the value’s rating, or a top-down approach. The latter  requires to examine every level of the value rating and to define respective minimum  requirements on the level of observables. Both approaches need an extensive and  comprehensive negotiation process with all stakeholders involved. An AI Ethics label can be given to an AI system independently from its future use. For  example, a system used to determine the risk of relapse of convicted criminals receives  the same rating whether it is being used in parole hearings and court cases or to determine  reintegration measures after a convict is released from prison. We can, therefore, determine  a rating before the AI system is being put to use.  However, the level required to ensure that the AI system is ethical much depends on the  application context. For example, if an AI system is used for industrial processes it is  subject to different requirements for transparency than if the same system used in medical  procedures. In turn, the classification of the application context determines the level of  value fulfilment needed for different applications. Only both steps together – the general  description of the AI system with the Ethics Label and an assessment of the application  context – can determine whether an AI system is ethical in a given situation. We describe  the proposed methodology to classify the application context as captured in the risk matrix  in the following chapter 3.Ensuring incentives for  higher ratings despite  aggregation AI system evaluation  requires analysis of  application context

35 The AI Ethics Label provides at a glance information about the ethically relevant  characteristics of an AI system. It displays a rating for each value, yet their relevance  depends of where we apply the AI system. Take the scenario of an AI system in a specific  medical context – it requires different levels of transparency than in some industrial  applications. However, it is not feasible to consider these requirements for each application  scenario, just as it is not feasible, for example, to write a criminal law that lists prison  sentences for every conceivable case.  Therefore, a viable approach for handling AI ethics requires an additional step: a  classification of application contexts. This classification must be based on the overall  potential damage an AI system may cause in its respective social process. Decisive factors  in assessing this potential are the intensity of the potential harm of the AI system and the  dependence of the affected person(s) on the respective decision. Here we found that using  a two-dimensional risk matrix on which these factors describe the axes simplifies the  classification process without abstracting too much from the given complexity an AI system  operates in (Krafft and Zweig 2019). Particularly for the legal certainty required by companies for the use of ethically uncritical  AI systems, this classification must be sufficiently precise, but also quick to decide upon  and implement. Considering the different fields of application and social contexts in which  algorithmic decision-making systems can be used (e.g. advertising compared to medicine),  it is essential that one solution may not fit all needs when it comes to governing the risks of  ADM systems (Krafft and Zweig 2019, Saurwein et al. 2015, Van Drunen et al. 2019). We define the details of the axes in section 3.2. Even though this project has not set itself  the task of defining fixed categories, from our perspective, we can discern five classes as  defined in our recommendations in section 3.3. These range from the exemption from a  system rating for low-risk AI systems to application contexts where the use of algorithmic  decision-making systems must be prohibited. 3.1 The risk matrix The risk matrix serves to determine whether an AI system is ethically-sensitive with regard  to its application context, i.e. it shows the risk for the potential damage of an ADM system  depending on its usage. This classification also serves to determine whether and to what  degree it requires regulation or labelling.Risk measured as an AI  system’s potential harm  (vulnerability) and affected  persons’ dependence on   the decision (exposure) Risk matrix to determine  whether an AI system is  ethically-sensitive within  application context3  CLASSIFYING AN AI’S APPLICATION  CONTEXT 
36CLASSIFYING AN AI’S APPLICATION CONTEXT Using the example of recommendation systems, e.g. online searches and subsequent  targeted advertising and recommendations, it quickly becomes clear how strong the  influence of the usage scenario of ADM systems is.  Figure 6 shows ADM systems that could all be implemented based on the same IT  components, i.e. the same recommendation algorithm. The only differences are the purpose  of use, the training data used, and most likely also the system’s quality requirements.  So while there may be few severe ethical implications to consider when dealing with  personalised suggestions for clothing, for example, these implications increase with the  intensity of potential harm and a person’s dependence on the decision. Take the use of  recommendation systems for personalised suggestions for medical products, however,  and it becomes clear that these systems need to be treated differently. So if for example, a  regulatory body wants to use the proposed usage classes, these systems should be sorted  into different “regulation” classes. This risk matrix proposed by Krafft and Zweig (ibid. 2019) is an idealised scheme for  defining classes of an ADM system according to their risk potential. The horizontal axis  shows the risk depending on the intensity of potential harm. The vertical axis represents  the dependence on the decision of persons affected (vulnerability). low                              Dependence on the decision                              high low                                                                                             Intensity of potential harm (vulner ability)                                                                                          high Personalised  selection of  advertising  for clothing Personalised  selection of  search results Personalised   selection of  advertising   for jobs Personalised  selection of  advertising  for elections Personalised   access to  medicines   or therapiesFIGURE 6   Example of a risk matrix where the same technical component, i.e. recommendation algorithm, has different  risk potentials in different areas of application Source: Krafft and Zweig 2019
37CLASSIFYING AN AI’S APPLICATION CONTEXT 3.2 Dimensions of the risk matrix Applying the risk matrix is an attempt to reduce the complexity of application scenarios for  evaluation that involves considering multiple related aspects within each axis.  The two dimensions are naturally complex in their internal structure; correlations between  the dimensions arise depending on the weight of individual aspects in the internal  composition. This leads to a certain degree of vagueness in determining a hypothetically  ideal dividing line between the degrees of classification. The process of determining such  a line in practice requires the participation of stakeholders with a broad, interdisciplinary  perspective.  In addition, the concept’s complexity increases in cases of objective conflicts of values.  Such conflicts affect both the intensity of potential harm and the dependence on the  decision (x-axis and y-axis). They must be resolved in a way that takes the concerns of all  parties involved and affected into account, and that preserves their pursued values as far as  possible.  3.2.1 Intensity of potential harm (x-axis) For the x-axis, the critical aspect is potential harm, which regards the evaluation of the  intensity with which an AI system could potentially harm people, organisations, and  society. To assess this, the following issues must be regarded: •  Impact on fundamental rights, equality or social justice: Does an AI have a negative  impact on a natural, legal persons’ fundamental rights or are social justice mechanisms  (e.g. pension, health insurance) at risk for extensive demographics or might the  impact even be catastrophic and lead to loss of life (e.g. the treatment of intensive care  patients)?  •  Number of people affected: Is a high number of people affected (e.g. fair assessment for  a job application)?  •  Impact on society: Does the system bear the risk of affecting society as a whole (e.g.  personalised selection of political news), independent of directly perceivable damage? In any case, it is impossible to evaluate the intensity of potential harm by merely  multiplying the amount of damage with the probability of occurrence. To do so would  mean to equate the risk of someone leaving the house without an umbrella in case of an  impending storm (high probability of occurrence, low potential damage) with the risk of a  nuclear accident (low probability of occurrence, high potential damage). Consequently, as  potential damage increases, macro risks can arise that threaten our ability to act at all and  are, therefore, unacceptable.Risk matrix to reduce   the complexity of  application scenarios To handle underlying  complexity, stakeholders  must carefully weigh  decisions with all   affected parties  To assess the intensity of  potential harm an AI system  can have, look at the impact  on a number of people or  access to resources and  whether society as a whole  is threatened
38CLASSIFYING AN AI’S APPLICATION CONTEXT 3.2.2 Dependence on the decision (y-axis) The y-axis shows the dependence of the potentially affected parties on the algorithmic  decision, thus addressing the options to avoid the potential harm indicated on the x-axis.  The better the chances are of avoiding exposure to the potential negative consequences of  a decision or the damage caused by it, the further left on the y-axis the ADM system lands.  The three main factors that play a role in assessing dependence on the decision are control,  switchability and redress. •  Decisions and actions of an AI system additionally filtered through meaningful human  interaction (e.g. the purchase of recommended items in an online shop) imply a lower  demand for regulation than machines acting without human intermediaries (e.g. the  emergency shutdown of a nuclear power station). This is expressed as control.  •  The ability to change the AI system for another (e.g. by switching the operator) or avoid  being exposed to an algorithmic decision altogether is called switchability. A one-sided  relationship of dependence between producers or operators and users and monopolistic  (including governmental) structures lead to dependence on one or a few systems. In  the worst case, the user does not have the ability to opt-out of using specific services  without facing societal repercussions (e.g. health care, financial market).  •  The importance of the possibility of challenging or correcting an algorithmicallymade decision and the time needed to follow up on the request adequately should not  be underestimated and is known as redress. Machine-made decisions that cannot  be challenged at all increase the dependence on the decision. To rectify significant  individual harm takes more time and effort than many instances of lesser harm. This  aspect concerns damage compensation/liability, as addressed in the dependence on the  decision (y-axis). 3.3 Recommendation for classes Following the discussion of the axis, looking at the risk matrix as a whole, Krafft and Zweig  see a division into five different classes emerging, as shown in Figure 7 (ibid. 2019).  Systems that do not require any regulation at all fall into class 0. The highest class, 4 in  this case, serves to classify contexts where no AI system should be applied. For algorithmic  decision-making systems that fall between these two extremes, a subdivision of at least three  further classes seems to make sense to reflect increasing system requirements adequately.  Depending on the application scenarios, the minimum requirements for the fulfilment of  different values (later displayed on the AI Ethics Label) can differ or can be regulated as  cross-sectional specifications. For example, a condition could be that a system in class 2  must achieve at least a B in all ratings. Where necessary, the requirements for different  values of the ethic rating, e.g. privacy and transparency, might also differ depending on the  superordinate application scenarios (e.g. medicine or mobility).When assessing the  dependence on the decision,  look at control, switchability  and redress Five different risk classes  emerge which require  different degrees of  regulation
39CLASSIFYING AN AI’S APPLICATION CONTEXT The decision, which kind of application falls into which class and is therefore subject to  certain regulatory requirements, has to be made by regulators. We strongly recommend  accompanying this process scientifically. In the following, we describe the classes in more  detail. Class 0 no ethics rating required There is a multitude of AI systems for which the total damage potential, i.e. the intensity  of potential harm and the exposure to the decision, is so low that a regulating instance can  refrain from demanding a system rating.  33  In this case, we recommend not to require obligations for transparency, for example, or to install  control processes permanently. In doubtful cases, a post hoc analysis should be carried out, and  the risk assessment may have to be repeated. We expect most AI systems to fall into this class. Class 1 If the intensity of potential harm and the exposure to the decision exceed a certain  threshold, a regulatory body should make initial demands for the ethics rating.  low                              Dependence on the decision                              high low                                                                                             Intensity of potential harm (vulner ability)                                                                                          high Class 0   no ethics  rating required Class 1 Class 2 Class 3 Class 4  no AI systems  permittedFIGURE 7   Risk matrix with 5 classes of application areas with risk potential ranging from ‘no ethics rating required’ in  class 0 to the prohibition of AI systems in class 4  Source: Krafft and Zweig 2019
40CLASSIFYING AN AI’S APPLICATION CONTEXT 33  As an orientation, we recommend initial transparency obligations (Krafft and Zweig 2019),  which include an interface for analysing the system as a black box and an explanation about  how the ADM system is embedded in the social decision-making process. An AI system’s  embedded nature is also reflected in the VCIO model. Class 2 For the increasing intensity of potential harm and exposure to the decision, the input data  must be fully disclosed (to the relevant audience as determined by the regulator), and the  information regarding the ADM system’s quality must be verifiable. If individual decisions  can have a significant negative impact on individuals or groups, it is essential to ensure that  an AI system is geared towards achieving objectives that minimise the damage. 33  As an orientation, we recommend transparency concerning the values applied by the AI system  and the used training data set (Krafft and Zweig 2019). Also, there should be a possibility to  review the quality assessment without having to rely on the values communicated by operators.  They should provide the results of the algorithmic decision-making system in a form that  enables the monitoring authorities to calculate, i.e. understand, the quality measures used as  this clarifies the system’s precise objectives. Class 3 In this class fall instances where either the potential (individual/societal) damage of  decisions by the AI system is very high, the system is used without the knowledge of the  persons affected, or where it can work against their expectations about the system. The  aim must be to reduce risks as much as possible, i.e. to identify and avoid any way in which  adverse decisions could be made.  33  As an orientation, we recommend monitoring and scrutinising the training and input  data as well as the machine learning procedure (Krafft and Zweig 2019). Many machine  learning methods cannot meet the transparency and explainability requirements necessary  to allow for maximum risk avoidance. Only algorithmic decisions that are comprehensible  and understandable by humans are permitted (Rudin 2019). All information must be  comprehensible and verifiable at least for a panel of experts within a reasonable time frame.  This requires various interfaces to the input data and the results of the machine-made decision.  Class 4 no AI systems Some ADM systems have such a high total damage potential that they should not be used  with a machine learning component at all (e.g. autonomous weapon systems).  33  In these application contexts, regulators must prohibit the use of an algorithmic decisionmaking component. If a system is to be built that would fall into class 4, it needs to be adjusted  in a way which reduces the intensity of potential harm and/or the dependence on the decision  enough to justify categorisation into class 3.
41 4  CONCLUSION AND WHERE TO GO  FROM HERE This report demonstrates the transition from “what to how”, as we focused on bringing  abstract principles into technical and organisational practice.  We have shown how to apply AI ethics in a way which can help to: • support the enforcement of European values and the protection of citizens in Europe • create quality-transparency and comparability in the market •  does not impose an unnecessary burden on companies and is straightforward to  implement where necessary • is easy to communicate and understand. The diagram summarises the three major elements of the model: characterising AI systems  with an ethics rating  based on the VCIO (values, criteria, observables, indicators) approach  (left side), making the results easily understandable through the AI Ethics Label (circles on  the AI Ethics label) and classifying the application context  (right side), to determine the  necessary rating requirements for a given AI system (blue lines on the AI Ethics Label).   4.1 Putting it all together  As previewed in section 1.3, this overall approach benefits a variety of different stakeholders: •  An organisation planning to use an AI system  for a specific application follows an  initial checklist to determine the ethical risk of the application context.If an application  falls into the lowest risk level, the process ends at this stage. If there are ethical issues  to consider, then the organisation performs a full assessment of the application context  using the risk matrix. •  Similarly, manufacturers of AI systems can consider the range of expected applications  using the risk matrix and decide whether to market an AI system only for applications  without ethical sensitivity, or also for higher risk classes. In the latter case, they may  gain market advantage by achieving a high ethics rating recognised worldwide for their  products. This applies in both B2C and B2B settings. •  Regulators can use the combination of the risk matrix and ethics rating to specify  requirements for different application contexts and to avoid over-regulation of  application fields that do not pose any major ethical challenges. For application fields Our report has shown how  to apply AI ethics in practice
42CONCLUSION AND WHERE TO GO  FROM HERE classified in one of the higher risk levels, they may demand that an AI system must (1)  carry an ethics label that shows the rating for values such as transparency, robustness,  or fairness and (2) satisfy certain minimum levels within the rating. •  Consumers use the ethics label to compare AI products and services and make  informed decisions about what is acceptable to them and/or worth spending money  on. Consumers are alerted to ethically sensitive applications through the risk matrix.  Moreover, consumers can trust that minimum regulatory requirements protect them. •  Purchasers (both in private and public sector procurement) use the ethics rating and  risk matrix to create clear specifications and benefit from market transparency. As  operators of AI systems, they have a recognised way of demonstrating ethical behaviour. 4.2 Next steps What needs to be done now? While we have developed the overall framework that can be  used as a tool for organisations developing and using AI as well as policymakers, standardsetting bodies and other watchdog organisations, it is clear that several stakeholders need  to cooperate. They need to refine and complete the approach and to put it into operation. In  particular, we are aware that the VCIO examples given here are neither comprehensive nor  detailed enough for direct application in the field. Instead, they would need to be further  negotiated, specified and reflected. We do not have all the answers to pressing questions, but we offer tangible tools and models  to accelerate the discussion and to provide a foundation for the debate. Our model helps to  measure values using criteria, indicators and observables and combines the context-based  risk assessment so that nuanced AI ethics regulation is becoming an actionable course. We see roles in particular for European standards developing organisations and European  policymakers. As the authors of this report and coming together as AI Ethics Impact  Group (AIEI Group), we see our future role in supporting standardisation and policy actors,  initiating networks and activities, raising awareness, and refining the conceptual ideas.11  11 An issue that we have not addressed in detail so far is whether it is sufficient for an AI system manufacturer  to claim an individual ethics rating, or whether an independent assessment is needed. Our initial hypothesis  is a mix of both approaches, i.e. levels A to D would require independent assessment, while the manufacturer  could simply declare levels E to G. Stakeholders need to   come together

44CONCLUSION AND WHERE TO GO  FROM HERE TABLE 1   Specific Recommendations Stakeholder Recommendations Standards  developing  organisationsIndustry and regulators have, for many decades, relied on standardisation.  Established standard-setting bodies such as CEN, CENELEC and ETSI in Europe  must bring together all relevant stakeholders. The aim is to reach and formulate  consensus in such a clear and stringent way that it guides design and development  and may provide a benchmark for testing and possibly certification. Wellestablished processes and structures ensure representation from industry,  academia, and civil society and the outcome thus carries a certain weight and  legitimacy. The European CEN-CENELEC AI Focus Group is currently preparing its initial  report which covers some AI ethics issues from a standardisation perspective.  Internationally, IEC Special Expert Group 10, as well as JTC1/SC42 WG3 and the  IEEE P7000 committees, are working in this area, amongst others. Elements of the  labelling and classification approach in this report have already been discussed and  received broadly favourably in some of these standardisation committees. We propose that European standardisation committees bring together relevant  experts and stakeholders with a focus on refining and completing the VCIObased descriptions of the values in the ethics rating. These committees could  also discuss and further refine the selection and naming of values. Given the urgency of addressing ethical challenges of AI, standardisation  committees need to be well supported in this task. Policymakers,  especially  the European  Commission  and European  ParliamentThe European Commission already mentions labelling as an element for AI ethics  in the February 2020 version of its AI white paper. However, this initial version  could be interpreted as opening the doors for simple kitemark schemes which  would not be adequate.  We propose that the next version of the white paper clarifies the approach to   AI ethics labelling, drawing on the framework we have presented in this report. The bimodal high-risk/low-risk classification of AI applications in the initial version  of the white paper appears as an oversimplification.  We propose a classification of application contexts with 4 or 5 levels based on  a small number of horizontal criteria as outlined above. This makes a sectoral  approach mostly unnecessary.  It has been good practice for many years to have a “division of labour” between  standardisation and regulation. While standardisation deals with the full depth of  technical issues and builds consensus among experts, the regulation gives “teeth”  to standards by referring to them without having to specify technical details.  We, therefore, propose that the European Commission supports European  standardisation committees in their work on refining and completing this  framework for AI ethics and at the same time prepares legislation to give it   a similar status as, for example, the energy efficiency label.

48 Algorithm Accountability Lab at TU Kaiserslautern – Tobias Krafft and Marc Hauer The Algorithm Accountability Lab under the supervision of Prof. Katharina Anna Zweig at  the TU Kaiserslautern joins researchers for algorithmic decision-making systems, artificial  intelligence, and neural networks. The institute was in a prime position to contribute to this  report, primarily in the form of the risk matrix, thus adding context to any AI application  and regulation according to the VCIO model. It builds on previous research by Prof. Zweig  and Krafft, which included a regulatory proposal for AI systems from a socio-informatics  (social informatics) perspective for the Federation of German Consumer Organisations  (vzbv).  Tobias Krafft  is among the first trained “socio-informaticians” (social computer scientists)  in Germany. He received the Weizenbaum Study Award 2017 for his master thesis on the  poor quality of algorithmic prediction systems in US courts. He is currently working on his  doctorate concerning algorithmic accountability in various application contexts.  Marc Hauer  is a doctoral candidate at the Algorithm Accountability Lab focusing on  developing concepts for software development processes which help to exclude problems,  non-technical errors or, unintended side effects in algorithmic decision-making systems  that exceed moral or even legal limits as reliably as possible. Bertelsmann Stiftung | Ethics of Algorithms – Carla Hustedt and Lajla Fetic With its ‘Ethics of Algorithms’ project, the Bertelsmann Stiftung is examining the societal  consequences of algorithmic decision-making to ensure the use of these systems serves  society. The research involves work to help inform and advance algorithmic systems that  facilitate greater social inclusion and committing to what is best for society rather than  what is technically possible.  Carla Hustedt  leads the Ethics of Algorithms project of the Bertelsmann Stiftung, Europe’s  largest operational think tank. Together with partners from diverse disciplines and sectors  she and her team are conducting research on the societal consequences of algorithmic  decision-making while also working on practical solutions for putting machines in the  service of humankind. In 2019, Carla coordinated the development of the Algo.Rules, a set  of nine principles for the ethical development of algorithmic decision-making systems.  She also consulted the German parliament’s AI Enquete Commission on the issue of AITransparency. Carla holds a Master in Public Administration from the London School of 6 ABOUT THE AUTHORS
