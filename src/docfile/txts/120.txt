CDCJ(2018) 5  4 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY     We find the following trends in the Council of Europe member States:   (i) A few states (for example Bosnia -Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic,  Denmark, France, Georgia, Germany, Montenegro, Poland, Switzerland) use, or  encourage preliminary, pre -trial ADR pro cedures - however they are rarely a  mandatory pre -requisite to filing proceedings in the civil courts (with the exception, for  example, of family disputes or certain labour disputes in Croatia, or of certain  disputes in Georgia, their use in labour disputes  in Turkey or the new procedure  introduced in France which obliges the parties to make an attempt to use mediation  in certain cases, or certain family cases in Montenegro), but usually are  recommended by the judge/court to the parties. In one example the p arties had to  state on the claims form whether they had considered mediation and justify, why, if  they had not (Poland). Furthermore in a few States there may be cost penalties if the  parties do not even consider mediation (England & Wales, Ireland). Only very few of  the States have reported that these preliminary pre -trial procedures use ODR  techniques (for example in France remote communication tools similar to Skype are  used in family mediation). However in some of these states using preliminary, pre trial procedures, the mediation or conciliation is carried out by a private mediator and  these private parties may resort to ODR techniques (for example the Czech Republic  mentions the use of video -conferencing for remote meetings). In other Member  States the  mediation is done by an official body or authority (such as court -annexed  conciliation in Germany which is carried out by a judge, or in Georgia for some types  of disputes or in Switzerland). However, the majority of States do not use preliminary,  pre-trial ADR procedures.     (ii) No state has as yet implemented a separate, parallel ODR track or pathway  through a new set of procedural rules in an existing, civil or administrative, court. This  is planned for the new Online Court in England & Wales (civil disputes up to a value  of £25,000). Moreover, no state has as yet moved their civil or administrative court  procedures completely online and digitalised courts completed by creating an online  platform where court users can file and access statements, evidence and c ourt  documents online and incorporating synchronous communication channels such as  video -conferencing, thus replacing traditional courts (although the Netherlands and  Portugal have gone into this direction). Moldova is in the process of implementing  digita lised courts as a parallel track, giving the parties the choice between traditional  court proceedings and online court proceedings.     In any case, elements of ODR techniques exist in various states:   (iii) Some states have expedited or simplified procedural rules for 1) small claims,  2) consumer disputes (although these are not within the scope of this Report) and 3)  payment orders (undefended money claims to enforce debts). As regards expedited  and simplified procedures for payment orders, they are sometimes limit ed to a  maximum amount (for example the electronic Electronic Payment Order Motion up to  a limit of 1,000,000 CZK in the Czech Republic or in Portugal), or limited to B2B  claims (for example in Belgium). Furthermore, there was also an example of an  expedit ed procedure for terminating a lease (see eviction proceedings in Portugal).  Ireland has an online court platform for certain small claims and so does Hungary.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  5 (iv) Sometimes these expedited procedures are online, but normally move  “offline” into the tradition al court processes if a defence is filed (for example in  England & Wales with the Money Claim Online , or in Poland, in Portugal, or in  Switzerland). In Germany, claims for payment orders and small claims in particular  can be filed electronically.     (v) Some s tates have introduced (or are in the process of introducing) electronic  court management systems (internal electronic file management) and electronic filing  for external court users, providing for secure and authenticated filing through the use  of electron ic signatures and allowing the parties or their advocates access to their  court files after authentication (for example Denmark, Germany, Latvia, the  Netherlands, or the Citius platform in Portugal, and Slovakia). Montenegro has  created the legal framework  for this in its civil procedure and has started training its  judiciary. Moldova is also introducing electronic filing (including digital evidence) and  this is piloted in 2018. Online filing platform for administrative matters will be provided  in the near future in Finland. In the Czech Republic businesses and advocates may  communicate with the court through a secure, authenticated databox. The Czech  legal system provides an online/e - filing system for certain legal forms and a data box  system for secure co mmunication – the “ePodatelna“ system  can be used. Croatia  also has a pilot project on e -communication in the courts.     (vi) Many states have introduced video -conferencing from a remote location into  their courts, for example for the appearance of witnesses and  experts on a case -bycase basis. Some states use this for requests for cross -border evidence taking under  the corresponding Hague Convention (for example Slovakia and Switzerland). Some  states use a variety of communication channels for remote video -confe rencing, see  for example Portugal: any means of technological communication, capable of  simultaneous real -time video and audio communication – such as ‘Skype’, ‘Facetime’  or ‘Whatsapp’ -  can be used for taking testimony or statements. In December 2017  all Moldovan courts have installed video -conferencing equipment in order to use it for  online meetings and online hearings. The period of piloting the installed tools is  forecast for 2018. In Germany there is electronic filing, electronic communication and  access to the court records plus the possibility to take part in hearings by  simultaneous two way video -communication, but no full implementation of online  court platforms.     (vii) No state as yet has introduced artificial intelligence to replace human  decision -making (for example for deciding preliminary issues or for providing the  parties with legal advice through the use of extensive expert systems, although the  Netherlands Rechts wjizer system goes into this direction ).     (viii) Few states have considered the use of ODR techniques for enforcing court  judgments - some states who have introduced online platforms for document  management have extended this to enforcement (Portugal). An interes ting example  of an ODR technique for online enforcement is the online auction of seized goods in  Portugal.     
CDCJ(2018) 5  6 We recommend that states pay attention to the following issues when  implementing ODR:   (1)  A fair hearing in the courts must be guided by the “equality  of arms” principle, giving  each party an equal opportunity to present his/her own case and respond to the case  of the other.     (2) For example an assumption is normally made that technology speeds up processes  (which is true), but little regard is given the fa ct that technology also increases  information overload (which slows down information processing) - so for example  shortened and inflexible deadlines for filing statements or evidence can affect the  ability of a party to have a fair hearing (where for exampl e a micro -business litigates  against a much larger business) and the sole director cannot cope with short  deadlines.     (3) Furthermore, it is often the assumptions we make about technology (rather than the  technology itself) which may have an impact on a fair h earing. So the assumption for  example will be that technology always works (not accounting for technical glitches or  downtime) which may prejudice a party in filing their case.     (4) A different aspect is the question of open, public hearings (where virtual he arings in  the courts replace a court hearing), which is essentially a question of transparency.  This is not a real problem as a platform may in fact allow access to virtual hearings  and information in a controlled manner without the observers having to phy sically go  to a courtroom. This is more a question of designing technology in a particular way.  Thus digital courts may be open courts, if not more so than physical court buildings.     (5) The use of online courts has the ability revolutionise access to justice for litigants.  The development of new procedures to resolve disputes online can revolutionise  access to justice to persons who would usually be unable to understand court  procedures without hiring a lawyer.  The use of ODR could level the playing field of  parties who would ordinarily find it hard to access courts. It could improve the justice  system to make it more accessible for those who live far from legal centres or who  struggle to afford the costs of seeking justice, by providing cheaper, alternative  means to resolving disputes.     (6) Using technology and the internet can allow litigants to access information about how  to lay a claim, submit a claim and inform them of the process of how to go about  resolving their dispute. In fact, ODR may structure the pro cess itself for litigants. It  also means that this process can be done just about anywhere with internet access,  making the process convenient and easy for litigants. This is a massive improvement  of access to justice for litigants.     (7) An issue with ODR and  access to justice is that those who are computer illiterate or  have no access to technology might be side -lined in the process. Increased high  internet access reflects social and generational change of how people now lead their  lives, but what of the vuln erable users and those without access?  Requiring parties  to use technology to resolve disputes could inhibit access to justice if there is a great  discrepancy between the parties and their access to technology.  The move to online  and virtual justice also  threatens to significantly increase the number of  unrepresented defendants, to further discriminate against vulnerable defendants, to 
CDCJ(2018) 5  7 inhibit the relationship between defence lawyers and their clients, and, as some  argue, make justice less open.     (8) If some  litigants do not have access to, or the ability to use, technology and the  internet, these litigants will be excluded from the administration of justice. Therefore,  if ODR is implemented, there should (a) either be an alternative paper -based  traditional m eans of having a dispute resolved for parties who do not have this  access to technology and the internet or (b) a comprehensive system of legal  representation made affordable.     (9) As court are being digitalised and are going online there may be (in certain countries)  a temptation to outsource the technology and to save money by using “free”  commercial applications, who then, in return collect court users’ personal data for  online pr ofiling purposes. We have not seen this as part of our research for this study  and as far as we are aware, the ODR communication and data processing  technologies developed by the courts to date are not based on commercial tracking.  However in times of decr easing public budgets and increased pressure on  government departments to save money, this topic is not entirely irrelevant.     (10) It does appear that at some stage of this process you must have the opportunity to  have an oral hearing. Thus, for compulsory ODR , there must be the opportunity to  appeal the ODR decision which must be oral. Or, the ODR processes must have an  oral element to it.     (11) This raises the interesting question of whether “oral” hearing is to be equated with  “face -to-face” hearing? While there  is no direct authority on this it would make sense  to argue that video -conferencing where the communicators can hear and see each  other in real time (and where provision is made that, for example witnesses are not  coached from behind the screen and that w itnesses’ identity is properly  authenticated) is functionally equivalent to an “oral” hearing (provided the technology  works on both ends of the transmission and this can be protocolled).     (12) The ECtHR requires there to be some form of publicity which allows for public  scrutiny of any court proceedings, with the additional requirement of having the  decision made public. Therefore, any ODR proceeding must ensure that there is this  degree of transparency involved.     (13) In particular, if hearings were conducted enti rely online in a fully digitalized court it  would be important that the public can access the hearing - subject to specific  exceptions, court hearings must be open to members of the public (in the sense that  members of the public can follow proceedings from  a public gallery in the court  building). Functionally equivalent access would have to be provided technically in a  fully online court, allowing interested members of the public to follow the course of  proceedings.     (14) An interesting question here is a questi on of numbers. Traditionally members of the  public have been granted physical access to the court building, but many countries in  Europe do not allow public broadcasting of trials on TV for the reason that this may  influence advocates and judges who then ” play” to populist sentiments of crowd  watching which may not lead to better justice. Clearly if there is online access to  “court channels” (for example on Youtube) then a similar effect may arise.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  8 (15) It is interesting to note in this context that few Council of Europe States at present  use ODR to make the enforcement of court decisions more effective (with some  notable exceptions). We recommend that greater use of ODR could be made at this  stage.     (16) The introduction of ODR and digitalization of courts means that  court procedures  may build in several tiers into the process, where only at the last tier there is an  adjudication by judges with an oral hearing of the parties. This would correspond to  the pyramid model of dispute resolution which integrates legal advic e (the parties  informing themselves about their legal rights and their legal position through the use  of expert systems/artificial intelligence), negotiation and conflict resolution techniques  (restorative justice), facilitated negotiation and mediation, a nd adjudication  (potentially several stages, including the possibility of review and appeal). These tiers  of processes could take place all within the same digital ODR platform, integrated as  part of the court system with the relevant data being moved from  one stage of the  procedure to the next one as appropriate. The idea behind this tiered model of  dispute resolution is that most disputes are solved at the lower levels, thus being  cost-effective while at the same time giving more disputants access to just ice. Thus  ODR could also mean a reorganisation of traditional court processes by integrating  processes which currently take place outside the court system, provided by private  entities (legal advice, ADR).     (17) Generally speaking, like in other areas of digiti zation, ODR may have a negative  impact on data protection and privacy in that online justice is likely to generate a  much greater wealth of data (including metadata, for example who accessed a  particular court record when and from where), increases the pos sibilities of data  processing, searching, data mining and the use of artificial intelligence (which is the  other side of the coin of increased access to justice) and online data (including court  data) may be more mobile (easy online transfer), sticky (in t he sense that data  remains on storage devices until erased) and vulnerable to unauthorised, remote  access (computer hacking from anywhere in the world).     (18) These risks which are a concomitant risk of ODR should be counter -balanced by  data protection & priva cy training of court officials, clear data protection laws, data  protection policies and guidelines on a “need to know” basis, implementation of the  “privacy by design” principles in new ODR/court technologies, data protection &  privacy audits and criminal  laws (on computer misuse) and their effective  enforcement.     (19) Cybersecurity has to be a priority and needs to be properly resourced in addition to  just developing the systems and technology for ODR. Inadequate cybersecurity may  mean that access to the court s is effectively denied and court users’ privacy is  seriously threatened.     (20) It is of fundamental importance to any ODR system that information and data that is  uploaded, exchanged, transferred and stored in an ODR system is kept secure. All  court documents and any evidence that is uploaded onto an ODR system must be  kept free from manipulation and attack to ensure its integrity. The system requires  protection to prevent external parties from hacking the system and obtaining non public information.  Regarding  the authority to access information, there should be  internal limitations that are put in place to ensure that parties to disputes cannot 
CDCJ(2018) 5  9 access information that they are not allowed to view.  This requires secure  authentication.     (21) One issue about digital security and ODR is the establishment of the identity of the  disputants.  It is important that the parties to the ODR process are truly the correct  parties and that there is no issue of fraudulent identities.     (22) Every litigant must have the right to an effective participation in the proceedings. This  would mean that those participants who are computer illiterate, who have no access  to an online computer system, who are otherwise disabled or previously  disadvantage d must be given the chance to effectively participate in ODR  proceedings. One way in which to ensure that such persons do receive the  necessary attention is to follow the mechanisms implemented by the British Columbia  ODR system. In this system, while the backbone of the system is the use of  technology online, persons who would otherwise be side -lined from accessing the  system are given the necessary attention by the availability of alternative means to  having the dispute resolved online. Such persons may a ccess the ODR platform by  attending the CRT service centres which are located across British Columbia. Here,  the litigants can appear in person at the relevant centre and have an assistant help  them with accessing and using the ODR system.     (23) There may be a  divide between legal representatives and their knowledge of and  access to technology in ODR proceedings. Large law firms may have the financial  ability to use and understand technology in a way that will assist their clients. This  may include law firms de veloping and using systems that analyse data, information  and evidence in preparation for a case, which might place a great advantage on the  party who has access to such a system. This should be compared to a legal  representative who does not have access t o such technology and as a result of  which his/her client may be left disadvantaged. Large law firms may also have the  ability to develop specialist ODR practices wherein certain lawyers specialise in ODR  proceedings. This, again, would create a divide bet ween specialist ODR legal  representatives and legal representatives who do not have the knowledge of or  access to such technology. This in turn would create a divide between the litigants.     (24) ODR systems must therefore be developed in such a way that this i ssue of the digital  divide is adequately addressed. The currently existing divide in the quality of legal  representation cannot be further enhanced by the introduction of technology. If ODR  is to be implemented into public justice systems, these systems mu st be designed in  such a way that there is equality of arms between the litigants. Everyone, no matter  their level of computer literacy, their age, social status etc. must have access to the  ODR system and this may entail the need either to maintain a cert ain degree of  paper based systems and/or to employ assistants to assist and guide such  disadvantaged litigants. The use of pilot schemes, reach out to certain disadvantaged  groups, user -feedback and centres where court users could physically go to access  ODR systems may go some way to alleviate these concerns.      (25) Given the pressure of high caseloads and insufficient resources from which most  justice systems suffer, there is a danger that support systems based on artificial  intelligence are inappropriately us ed by judges to “delegate” decisions to  technological systems that were not developed for that purpose and are perceived as  being more ‘objective' even when this is not the case. Great care should therefore be 
CDCJ(2018) 5  10 taken to assess whether such systems can deliv er and under what conditions that  may be used in order not to jeopardise the right to a fair trial.     
CDCJ(2018) 5  11   CONTEXT AND PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH   1. The Council of Europe European Committee on Legal Co -operation (CDCJ)  commissioned the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) expert Prof Julia Hӧrnle to draw up a  Feasibility and Scoping Report (FSR) in December 2015 which contained an initial analysis  of the du e process issues connected to ODR and examined the feasibility and possible  scope of a CDCJ activity on ODR. At the CDCJ meeting on 25. February 2016, it was  concluded that the scope of disputes should be further narrowed for two reasons: 1) the  diversity of civil disputes is too great to allow for an in -depth examination of the issues  arising under Articles 6 and 13 ECHR and 2) the need to avoid duplication of existing  international activities on ODR.  As a consequence Proposal for an Activity on ODR was  drawn up in July 2016 and approved by the CDCJ at the meeting in November 2016. After  the recruitment of two research assistants, Matthew Hewitson and Illia Chernohorenko, the  project commenced in June 2017. A second expert was also appointed, Petra Jurina who is  Head of Service for Civil Procedure Law, Commercial Law and Alternative Dispute  Resolution at the Ministry of Justice in Croatia who helped to produce the Dra ft  Questionnaire . The questionnaire was drafted and revised with the invaluable input from the  state members an d was finalised in October 2017.     2. After the expiry of the deadline for responses from the CDCJ expert members ( 28.  February  2018) we had responses from  23 Council of Europe Member States: Belgium,  Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Cz ech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Georgia,  Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Moldova, Montenegro, Netherlands, Poland,  Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey. This Report reflects the Responses.     3. The activity is a Study conducted  by independent experts with the following aims:     i. To analyse the compatibility of Online Dispute Resolution with the right to a fair trial  both in terms of the challenges to the right of a fair trial as well as opportunities  afforded by Online Dispute Resolution to provide greater access to justice and  enha nced due process.   To examine whether online dispute resolution could open  new avenues of redress for  infringem ents of ECHR rights.   We would like to thank the experts of the States of the Council of Europe who kindly  completed the Questionnaire for their co untry and the independent experts who kindly gave  their time for interview and shared their expertise with us.     METHODOLOGY  OF THE RESEARCH   4. The research contains three distinct elements 1) literature review on Online Dispute  Resolution and the right to a fair trial; 2) interviews with experts in the field of Online Dispute  Resolution; 3) responses to a Questionnaire by the experts in the Council of Europe Member  States.     5. We obtained answers to survey questionnaires from 23 Council of Europe Member  States: Belgium, Bosnia Herzegovina, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland,  France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Latvia, Moldova, Montenegro,  Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey.

In this Report we have summarized our review of the literature, and the expert views  formed the background for our critical analysis. We analysed the responses from the 23  questionnaires and set them out in summary in this Report. We prese nt our  analysis and the   findings as to the ODR techniques used in the Council of Europe States and the fair trial  issues arising therefrom in this Report.     DEFINING AND EXPLAINING THE CONCEPT OF  ODR   8. While it is always useful to set out a clear definition of the subject matter of a  research topic, this has proven particularly difficult for ODR , as ODR is not clearly defined or  widely understood. ODR  is a relatively new field, encompassing a broad range of concepts  and involving a variety of procedures and m ethods. It is a growing field that is constantly  developing, with many pe ople having a view of what it entails and how it should develop.     9. ODR is defined by UNCITRAL , as “a mechanism for resolving disputes facilitated  through an IT based platform and facil itated through the use of electronic communications  and other information and communications technology”.1 Essentially, it is dispute resolution  that is carried out through the use of computers and the internet.2    10. ODR involves dispute resolution at a dista nce. Documents ( statements, pleadings,   evidence , court documents ) can be directly uploaded on to an ODR platform hosted in the  cloud. Remote asynchronous communication (for example discussion boards, blogs, email ;  various forms of secure and authenticated d ataboxes guaranteeing the authenticity and  integrity of a communication ) or synchronous communication (chat, instant messaging,  audio - and video -conferencing tools) can be used to maximise the flexibility and  convenience of communication and to hold online  hearings. Court users can access the  court file online from a remote place. ODR  means that the parties, witnesses and                                                              1 UNCITRAL Working Group III (Online dispute resolution) Thirty -third session, New York, 2016, Online  dispute  resolution for cross -border electronic commerce transactions, A/CN.9/WG.III/WP.140, accessed via  https://documents -dds-ny.un.org/doc/UNDOC/LTD/V1 5/089/59/PDF/V1508959.pdf?OpenElement  on 26 June  2016.   2 See also further J Hornle Cross -border Internet Dispute Resolution (Cambridge University Press 2009)

Automation  can range from diary  management (for example filing deadlines/organising virtual meetings) to tailored legal  advice for the parties on aspects of their dispute to forms of automated negotiation  assistance or decision -making. Automation may be based on repeating patterns of factual  scenarios and the legal categorization of disputes.     12. ODR is therefore leading to greater auto mation, greater speed of information  processing, more efficiency and lower costs of dispute resolution. This in turn means more  disputes can be solved, leading ultimately to greater access to dispute resolution  and cost  savings .3    13. In addition to classifyin g disputes as ‘online’ vs ‘offline’, it may also be useful to  develop a typology of disputes, in which it can be ascertained what types of disputes could  be resolved through ODR mechanism s and what type of disputes might still require the  traditional court  process.     14. The role of courts in general is to produce enforceable decisions.4 These decisions  come about through the courts fulfilling specific roles: (1) title provision, (2) notarial role, (3)  settlement, and (4) judgment.5 Within these roles, informati on is used by the courts in   particular ways to reach the outcome, and it is the type of dispute that may determine the  role of the court and the decision that is ultimately made.6    15. Two factors affect the way in which a court makes a decision: (1) the uncertainty of  the outcome, and (2) the relationship between the parties.7 In terms of game theory, the  outcome is either zero -sum or win -win.8 Zero-sum describes a situation in which a  participant’s gain or loss is exactly matched  by the losses or gains o f the other participant.9  The relationship between the parties is irrelevant to the outcome.10 In win -win, parties can  achieve the best result by cooperating. In this case, cooperation can affect the quality of the  outcome.11    16. In disputes where there is a zero-sum game and a certain outcome, all the court is  tasked with deciding is the issue of title , and providing that title . These are disputes where  the case is cut and dried, such as an undefended money claim.   17. In disputes where there is a win -win and the  outcome is certain, the court is required  to produce an affirmation, formal declaration etc. in what is called a ‘notarial role’. The courts  also play a relatively straight forward role in this process and there is a rather certain  outcome to which the pa rties have co -operated to achieve.                                                               3 J Hornle Cross -border Internet Dispute Resolution (Cambridge University Press 2009)   4 Dory Reiling, ‘E -justice: experiences with court IT in Europe’ at pg. 1 0.  5 Ibid..   6 Ibid..   7Ibid.   8 Ibid.   9 Ibid.   10 Ibid.   11 Ibid.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  14 18. Where the outcome is uncertain but the parties co -operate, the court plays a role in  leading and affirming the parties’ settlement. Very complex information, needed to help the  parties to reach agreement, can be the objec t in this process.     ODR TECHNIQUES -TOOLS USED   19. As has been explained above in respect of the definition of ODR, ODR is not a  clearly defined concept and consists in practice of a range of techniques using various  software tools.  As has been stated above, th is Study has examined both civil and  administrative procedures in the c ourts of the Council of Europe  Member  States. In this  context, f or the purpose of this Study we have distinguished between the following  five ODR  techniques  (see also the Questionnaires in the Annex) :    i. Online filing systems/platforms directly accessed and used by the parties and/or  their advocates for the filing of statements and procedural documents (such as  claims, counterclaims, responses);     ii. The use of onl ine syst ems for storing, processing, assessing  and presenting   evidence  in electronic format ;    iii. The use of artificial intelligence, big data analysis techniques and automation to  reach decisions which traditionally have been made by judges and which  traditio nally have been dependent on human judgment;     iv. The use of platforms for communication, including online meetings and online  hearings, for example by audio - and video -conferencing, including the giving of  oral testimony of witnesses and experts;     v. The use of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, expert and legal advice  systems for the purposes of negotiation, mediation, narrowing of issues or legal  advice, including such systems as bli nd-bidding. In other words this covers the  use of artificial intellige nce in preliminary processes before  adjudication takes  place. However such processes are only part of the Study to the extent that they  are part of the civil  or administrative  procedure of the country concerned ( ie  mandatory or ordered by a judge or someho w annexed or integrated into the  official civil /administrative  justice system).  Purely voluntary, out -of- court  Alternative Dispute Resolution processes are excluded from the scope of this   Study.       
CDCJ(2018) 5  15 STAGES IN THE CIVIL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS IN WHICH ODR IS USED     20. The Survey covers the Online Dispute Resolution techniques mentioned in the  preceding section. In addition to distinguishing between different ODR techniques it is  necessary to distinguish between different stages of the civil or administrativ e process es and  the different fora in which  ODR techniques may be used.  For the purposes of the Study we  have identified the following possible stages  in court procedures  and variations of legal fora:    i. Preliminary pre -trial processes which under the law co nstitute a mandatory  prerequisite to institute proceedings before a public court (such as, in some  jurisdictions, mandatory pre -trial alternative dispute resolution mechanisms);     ii. Preliminary processes (including alternative dispute resolution mechanisms su ch as  arbitration, negotiation or mediation) which are not mandatory as such, but can be  recommended by the court/judge. Furthermore, if the parties refuse to engage in  them there may be penalties in the award of costs;     iii. Special online dispute resolution t ribunals for some particular types of claims (e.g.  Administrative Tribunals  in the social security field , online dispute resolution for  parking offences and administrative fines, or for social housing disputes, or for small  claims disputes in the civil courts, or for neighbourhood or family disputes);     iv. Litigation before a civil, commercial or administrative court under the ordinary  procedural rules;     v. Parallel tracks: claimants can choose whether they opt for the ordinary, “traditional”  court procedures ( not using Online Dispute Resolution) OR a special Online Dispute  Resolution Court which has its own, separate procedure and uses some of the  Online Dispute Resolution techniques mentioned above;     vi. Use of Online Dispute Resolution in the enforcement of judic ial decisions;     vii. Out-of-court alternative dispute resolution mechanisms which the parties are required  to use by law and which result in binding decisions not subject to judicial review.     21. This distinction between different ODR techniques on the one hand and between  different stages of procedure and different fora provides the matrix for our examination of  existing ODR in the Council of Europe Member States.  The next section summarizes the  ODR currently existing in the Council of Europe Member States as appeared from the  answers to our Questionnaires kindly provided by experts in the States.     
CDCJ(2018) 5  16   SUMMARY OF ODR IN THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE MEMBER STATES   Belgium       Q.A.1: there are no mandatory preliminary pre -trial processes in Belgium.   Q.A.2: Belgium introduced an online process for the recovery of business  to business debts (undefended money claims) by Articles 1394/20 to  1394/27 of the Judicial Code in force since 2. July 2016. Although non mandatory, there could be cost -penalties at the stage of the cost recovery,  if the creditor does not use the least burdensome process. This process  revolves round a central registry (an online database) for such  uncontested business to business claims and i f the debtor does not react  within a month a judge can make the title enforceable - this leads to  expedited debt recovery for uncontested claims - the process is further  explained here .   Q.A.3: under Belgian Law family disputes are dealt with by the Family  Tribunal and the Justice of the Peace deals with neighbourhood disputes  and other minor disputes - but there are no specific ODR  processes/techniques for these special tribunals other than those used in  the ordinary civil courts.   Q.A.4: Belgian civil courts make use of several online database schemes  which support the courts internally:   -first certain legal documents (“conclusions, mémoires et pièces en  matière civile et pénale”) are stored and hosted in the “e -deposit” scheme  and secondly there is a “e -box” scheme for secure electronic  communication. This system is governed by Art. 32ter of the Judicial Code  and several executive orders passed on 16. June 2016.   -secondly there is a central insolvency registry, a database which contains  all relevant data and legal documents in insolvency cases since 1. April  2017 (see https://www.regsol.be )   This is governed by articles 5/3, 5/4 and 5/5 of the Insolvency Act of 8.  August 1997 and the implementing orders. This has been further been  reformed with effect from 1. May 2018 by a new law on insolvency (Articles  XX.15 to XX.19 Business Act) which will govern the central insolvency  registry.   Q.A.5: No ODR tracks or pathways in the courts in Belgium   Q.A.6: No ODR elements to enforcement   Q.A.7: No obligatory ODR procedure s outside the courts   The Belgian Questionnaire did not contain any answers to the questions  concerning the administrative courts.       Bosnia Herzegovina        Q.A.1: Alternative Dispute Resolution procedures with judicial involvement  exist in Bosnia Herzegovina, but they are not mandatory. In Bosnia and  Herzegovina there are several preliminary pre -trial processes envisaged  and recognized by the Law on Civil Pro cedure Before the Courts of BiH 
CDCJ(2018) 5  17 (BiH Official Gazette No. 36/04, 84/07 and 58/03).     Pre-trial or trial processes are stipulated by the State Law on Civil  Procedure Before Court of BiH. First Mediation can be used in pre -trial  phase of the procedure, but a lso in the trial phase. The court may, if it finds  appropriate with regard to the nature of the dispute and the circumstances,  propose to the parties the resolution of the dispute through mediation  proceedings. Mediation can be initiated at the preparatory  hearing at the  latest. Mediation proceedings can be also prescribed by a separate law.  Bosnia and Herzegovina has adopted the Act on Mediation Procedures at  State Level in 2004.     The second pre -trial or trial procedure prescribed by the State Code of  Civil Procedure is Judicial Settlement. At any time during the proceedings  the parties may settle their dispute. The court shall persuade parties in all  phases to conclude Judicial Settlement. The only requirement is that  settlement is reached in a way that d oes not compromise its impartiality. A  Judicial Settlement may pertain to the whole claim or to a part thereof. It is  also important to note that a Judicial Settlement is enforceable.     Bosnia and Herzegovina’s civil procedures also envisages arbitration  proceedings as one of the alternative settlement disputes mechanisms. An  arbitration agreement may be concluded in respect of an existing dispute  or future possible disputes that could stem from certain legal relationships.  Arbitration is an important extraj udicial settlement mechanism in BiH.      Unfortunately, there are no preliminary pre -trial processes that use Online  Dispute Resolution techniques. However, in near future it is realistic to  expect that Bosnia and Herzegovina authorities shall start procedu res with  aim to implement these mechanisms in the legal system of BiH.     Q.A.2: There are no cost -penalties for not engaging in ADR and none of  these procedures use ODR yet.   Q.A.3: There are no special tribunals using ODR.   Q.A.4: No ODR is used in the civil  courts.   Q.A.5: There are no special ODR tracks or pathways.   Q.A.6: ODR is not used in the enforcement of judicial decisions.   Q.A.7: No mandatory ODR procedures with res judicata effect   Q.B.1: On 12 November 2000 the Law on the Court of Bosnia and  Herzegov ina was promulgated, and in 2002 The Court of Bosnia and  Herzegovina was officially established. There are three divisions of the  Court of BiH: Criminal, Administrative and Appellate Division.     Due to this specific court organization in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the  fact that there is no lex specialis law that establishes a freestanding  Administrative Court as special institution there is no preliminary pre -trial  processes which under the law co nstitute a mandatory prerequisite to  institute proceedings before a public court.   Furthermore there are no Online Dispute Resolution techniques in the  legal system of Bosnia and Herzegovina at this moment.        
CDCJ(2018) 5  18 Croatia       Q.A.1: Article 186.a  of the Civil Procedure Act (OG, No. 53/91, 91/92,  58/93, 112/99, 88/01, 117/03, 88/05, 02/07, 84/08, 123/08, 57/11, 148/11,  25/13, 89/14) states that any person intending to sue the Republic of  Croatia shall first, before lodging a complaint, address the state attorney's  office, that has subject matter and territorial jurisdiction for representation  at the court where an action against the Republic of Croatia is to be taken,  with a request to settle the dispute amicably, with the exception of cases in  which special regulations determine a time limit for lodging a complaint.  Such request to settle the dispute amicably shall include everything that  must be included in a complaint. This provision shall apply mutatis  mutandis in cases where the Republic of Croa tia intends to sue a person  with legal residence or habitual residence in the Republic of Croatia.     Also, The Family Act (OG No. 103/15) states that if the spouses have a  mutual minor child, when seeking for divorce, they have to obtain a report  of mandato ry family mediation and proof of participating in the first meeting  of family mediation.     Article 206. of the Labour Act (OG No. 93/14) states that in case of dispute  which could result in a strike or other form of industrial action, the  mediation procedur e must be conducted as prescribed by that Act, except  when the parties have reached an agreement on an alternative amicable  method for its resolution.     These processes do not use Online Dispute Resolution techniques.     Article 186d of the Civil Procedure Ac t states that the court may during the  entire court proceedings propose to parties to resolve the dispute through  a court mediation procedure. Where parties jointly propose or agree to  resolve their dispute amicably before the court, a hearing to attempt  mediation shall be set without delay and parties, their legal representatives  or authorised agents, if any, shall be invited to such hearing. The court  mediation process shall be conducted by a mediator judge designated  from the list of mediator judges that  is established by the president of the  court with the annual schedule of responsibilities. A settlement entered into  before a mediator judge shall be a court settlement and is enforceable.     Article 288a of the Civil Procedure Act states that the court shall during the  preliminary hearing propose to parties to resolve the dispute through a  court mediation procedure, or warn the parties of the possibility of a court  settlement. If the parties refuse to engage in a court mediation procedure  there are no sa nctions prescribed for the parties involved. These  preliminary processes do not use Online Dispute Resolution techniques.   Q.A.3 There are no special tribunals using ODR.   Q.A.4 On December 12, 2017, at the Commercial court of Bjelovar has  started an e -Commu nication pilot project. The project refers to electronic  communications between attorneys and commercial courts. Advocates are  obliged to file statements (claims, counterclaims, responses and all other  submissions) using the system of electronic communicat ions. Courts will  also submit court judgments using the e -communication system to  attorneys. By the end of January 2018 e - Communication should be 
CDCJ(2018) 5  19 applied to all commercial courts in the Republic of Croatia. The parties will  also have accesses to the elect ronic communications system once  implemented.   Q.A.5 No parallel ODR tracks or pathways in Croatia   Q.A.6 No ODR in enforcement   Q.A.7 No mandatory ODR processes   Q.B.1 -6 No ODR in the Administrative Courts     Cyprus       Q.A.1: in Cyprus there are no mandatory pr e-trial processes.   Q.A.2: in Cyprus there are no ADR pre -trial processes which can be  recommended by judges or which give rise to cost penalties if not used in  appropriate circumstances.   Q.A.3: there are no special tribunals for small claims or other civil  disputes  using ODR.   Q.A.4: The civil procedure rules in Cyprus provide for the taking of witness  evidence by video -conferencing at the discretion of the judge. The  following apply regarding the use of platforms for online meetings and  online hearings, for  example by audio - and video -conferencing, including  the giving of oral testimony of witnesses and experts (4):   Evidence Law, Cap. 9 , Amd. 122(I)/2010 – section 36A     1. If any criminal or civil proceedings, the Court may – if it  considers that justice requires so – to allow a witness who is abroad,  to give his/her testimony via videoconference.   2. For the purposes of this, “videoconferencing”, means the  use of video and audio transmission technology or other  arrangement by which the witness, despite his /her absence from the  chambers of the Court can see and hear the persons whο are in the  courtroom and vice versa, the persons in the courtroom to see and  hear the witness.  It is considered that, for the purposes of this sub section, “persons who are in the  courtroom” mean  the Court, the  accused concerned, the lawyers of the parties, the interpreter or  other persons appointed to assist the witness or the accused  concerned.   3. The Court may impose any terms it may consider necessary  regarding the admission o f evidence, but these terms should not be  inconsistent with commitments undertaken by the Republic of  Cyprus in bilateral or international conventions governing the matter  in issue.     Q.A.5 There are no parallel tracks of pathways for ODR in Cyprus.   Q.A.6 O DR is not used in enforcement   Q.A.7 There are no mandatory ODR or other out -of court dispute  resolution mechanisms   Q.B.1 -6 ODR is not used in the administrative courts in Cyprus .       
CDCJ(2018) 5  20 Czech Republic       Q.A.1 There are no mandatory pre -trial processes using ODR in the Czech  Republic.   Q.A.2 The Czech legal system regulates arbitration and mediation.  Arbitration is frequently used in the Czech Republic, but it is always  consent/agreement based, ie agreed between the parties based on a  voluntary agreement, not r ecommended by a judge. However judges can  recommend or order mediation. The judge can recommend or order to the  parties to attend the first meeting with mediator if he/she finds it effective  and convenient. The law states only general and fundamental rules  for  these procedures. Therefore parties can use various online dispute  resolution techniques. It is presumed that typically the audio - and video conferencing tools could/should be used, so that meetings can be  arranged at a distance.   Q.A.3 No special ODR tribunals for small claims or other civil disputes in  the Czech Republic.   Q.A.4 The Czech legal system provides an online/e - filing system for  certain legal forms and a data box system for secure communication.   The “ePodatelna“ system  can be used   (https://epodatelna.justice.cz/ePodatelna/epo1200new/form.do ).  The system enables easier communication between parties/their attorneys  and court. The system can be used only with qualifie d electronic signature.  It serves only as a communication tool from parties/their attorneys to  courts (but not vice versa). The system offers a universal form that enables  users to create a motion/petition/document. A special form is available only  for a f ew types of motions (e. g. Electronic Payment Order). The system  enables to upload enclosures/attachments in permitted file format (PDF,  DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, TXT and RTF). Generally, if there is a special  form available, it is obligatory to use it (e. g. form for registration in Public  Registers). Some forms are not available in the above mentioned system  but on different websites managed by relevant authority. They can be also  filed via the “ePodatelna“ system.     Also, all attorneys at law obligatorily hav e to have a data box (see the  definition below). The data box system enables easier communication  between parties/their attorneys and the courts. If a party has a data box, a  court is obliged to use the data box as the primary form of communication.     Cour ts have also online access to various registers which contain  information that can be used as evidence in court.      The law explicitly envisages that courts may also use video -conferencing  tools if it is found convenient.     A data box is an electronic stora ge site, intended for delivery of official  documents and for communication with public authority bodies. Data  boxes are established and managed by the Ministry of Interior. A data box  is not obligatory for citizens and private individuals who carry out bus iness  activities. Establishment of a data box is obligatory for legal entities  (including attorneys) and public authority bodies (state administration).    
CDCJ(2018) 5  21   A document (data message), which is delivered to a data box, is delivered  at the moment the authoris ed individual logs into his/her data box. The  fiction of delivery applies similarly to letter mail: if you do not log -into your  data box within a time limit of 10 days from the day the document was  delivered to the data box, this document is considered del ivered on the last  day before the lapse of this time limit. Fictitious delivery of the document  has the same legal effects as personal delivery. A data box is not an e mail box; you cannot use it to communicate directly with individual clerks,  only with th e whole office. And you also cannot use the data box to  communicate with another private individual, private individual carrying out  business activities or legal entity. There is more information.     Q.A.5 There is no parallel track online dispute resolutio n procedure.  However, the Electronic Payment Order is close to that. If a claim  concerns pecuniary payment not higher than 1.000.000 CZK , a plaintiff  can file the Electronic Payment Order Motion instead of filing a standard  motion. The Electronic Payment Order Motion has to be filed in on an  electronic form and has to be signed by a qualified electronic signature.  Then the court issues the Electronic Payment Order. However, the whole  procedure does not have to be electronic. It depends on the fact whether  the defendant has a data box or not.      Q.A.6 ODR is not used in enforcement in the Czech Republic.   Q.B.1 Administrative complaints: there always must be administrative  proceeding completed before the proceeding of administrative court is  initiated. In pri nciple, use of audio - and video -conferencing tools in the  framework of administrative proceedings is possible, even though the law  does not state it explicitly.     Q.B.2: there are no special administrative tribunals using  ODR in the  Czech Republic.   Q.B.3: the same online filing (“ePodatelna“ system) and online messaging  (Databox system) techniques are applicable to the administrative courts -  see answers to Q.A.4   Q.B.4: there are not parallel ODR tracks or pathways in the administrative  courts   Q.B.5 and 6: O DR is not used in the enforcement or there are no  mandatory ODR procedures for administrative matters in the Czech  Republic.     Denmark     Q.A.1 In Denmark there are no preliminary pre -trial processes which are  mandatory   Q.A.2 All courts except the Supreme Court, are obliged to offer settlement  activities and mediation services when a claim is brought in the court. This  is regulated in the Administration of Justice Act, chapter 26 and 27. The  services are not mandatory but  may be recommended by the judge or  requested by the parties. Participation in the services are voluntary and no  penalties apply if the parties refuse to engage in them. Finally, these  services are not available as an Online Dispute Resolution technique.   Q.A.3 In Denmark there are no special ODR tribunals for small claims or 
CDCJ(2018) 5  22 other minor civil claims   Q.A.4 Yes, during 2017 Denmark has implemented an online filing  systems/platforms directly accessed by the parties and/or their advocates  for the filing of stat ements (such as claims, counterclaims, responses). The  platforms are also used for online meetings and online hearings, for  example by audio - and video -conferencing, including the giving of oral  testimony of witnesses and experts.   Q.A.5 There are no parall el ODR tracks or pathways.   Q.A.6 ODR is not used in the enforcement processes.   Q.A.7 There are no mandatory out of court processes with res judicata  effect.   Q.B.1 -6 Denmark did not complete this part of the Questionnaire.     Finland       Q.A.1 In Finland there  are no preliminary pre -trial processes which are  mandatory   Q.A.2 There are no preliminary ADR processes which can be  recommended by the judge and/or give rise to cost penalties   Q.A.3 In Finland there are no special ODR Tribunals .  Q.A.4 In Finland there ar e no systems for online evidence, nor artificial  intelligence.   If a civil claim relates to a debt of a specific sum and the plaintiff states that  the matter is not under dispute, the application for a summons may be sent  to the registry of a district court using an online filing system. The  application of such a summons may also be sent as an electronic  message transmitted through a technical link which the plaintiff has been  granted license to install and use.     Witnesses, experts and parties may be he ard in court proceedings using  audio - and videoconferencing equipment.   Q.A.5 In Finland there are no parallel ODR tracks or pathways   Q.A.6 ODR is not used in the enforcement of decisions   Q.A.7 There are no mandatory out -of-court processes with res judicata   effect.   Q.B.1 There are no mandatory preliminary processes in the administrative  courts using ODR   Q.B.2 In Finland there are no special ODR tribunals for administrative  matters.   Q.B.3 Online filing platform for administrative matters will be provided in  the near future in Finland. The administrative and special courts will  transition to the electronic work method in 2019 -2020. A uniform case and  documentation management system will be available and facilitate the  computerization of all functions. At the mo ment there is only an internal  online system that is used for transferring data between the administrative  courts and the immigration authorities. However, oral hearings in the  administrative and special courts can already be held using video  conferencing.  At present no introduction of artificial intelligence is planned.   Q.B.4 No parallel ODR tracks or pathways exist in the administrative  courts.   Q.B.5 ODR is not used in the enforcement of administrative decisions in 
CDCJ(2018) 5  23 Finland   Q.B.6 There is no binding ADR wi th res judicata effect for administrative  matters.     France       Q.A.1 and Q.A.2 A 2016 Act (La loi n° 2016 -1547 du 18 novembre 2016  de modernisation de la justice du XXIème siècle) has introduced into  French Law an obligation to attempt mediation/conciliatio n led by a judicial  mediator, when the submission of the case to the trial court is envisaged  by statement to the court registry. This preliminary mediation attempt is  mandatory in the sense that without it the case may be inadmissible and it  must take pla ce face -to-face (not using remote communication at a  distance).The same Law of 2016 has introduced in certain Court Districts  in France (Tribunal de Grande Instance) an obligation to conduct  preliminary pre -trial mediation in family matters, in various pil ot projects.  Some of these family mediations can be conducted at a distance, using  electronic communication (similar to Skype).   The French government has installed a working group on the simplification  of the French civil procedure in October 2017 whose Re port was submitted  on 15. January 2018 to the Garde des Sceaux. This Report recommends  the creation of a public service of Online Dispute Resolution. Furthermore,  it recommends the expansion of mandatory pre -trial mediation attempts.  These developments are  now subject to the political process for reform.   Q.A.3 Currently, there are no special ODR tribunals - however the above mentioned working group on the simplification of the French civil  procedure recommends the creation of a new separate ODR track or ODR  jurisdiction for small claims. France may therefore see new developments  in this field.   Q.A.4 ODR is currently not used in the ordinary civil court procedure.   Q.A.5 There are currently no ODR tracks of pathways in France.   Q.A.6 ODR is also not used in the enforcement of decisions.   Q.A.7 There are no mandatory out -of-court processes with res judicata  effect   Q.B.1 -6 France did not reply to the questions on administrative  procedures.     Georgia       Q.A.1 In Georgia there are  no mandatory preliminary pre -trial processes.   Q.A.2 In Georgia there is a process of judicially recommended mediation  for certain types of disputes. The Civil Procedure Code of Georgia  contains articles regarding mediation, but it is not a mandatory  prerequisite.   According to the Civil Procedure Code, Judicial Mediation may apply to the  following types of disputes:   1. matrimonial disputes (except adoption, annulment of adoption,  restriction and deprivation of parental rights, violence agains t women  and domestic violence),  
CDCJ(2018) 5  24 2.inheritance disputes;   3. neighbourhood disputes   4.with consent of the parties, to any other type of disputes. After a  claim has been filed with the court, a case that falls within the  jurisdiction of a judicial mediation may be transferred to a mediator  based on the decision of the judge. A judgement on refer ring the  case to a mediator may not be appealed. Legislation does not  provide any Online Dispute Resolution techniques for the  abovementioned process.     Q.A.3 In Georgia there are no special ODR tribunals for small claims and  other minor disputes.   Q.A.4 The re are provisions in the procedural rules for ODR. Georgia has  Common Court system where there are special chambers (civil, criminal  and administrative) in the Supreme Court and Appellate Courts; special  panels in District (City) Courts.     Georgian legisla tion provides for the possibility of applying the following  Online Dispute Resolution techniques in litigation:   • Online filing systems/platforms for the filing of statements (such as  claims,  counterclaims, responses) accessible online for the parties.   • According to Article 127(3) and Article 148(6) of the Civil Procedure  Code of  Georgia, examination of a party or interrogation of a witness  may be conducted remotely from another court or administrative  body by using a telephone, video equipment  or other te chnical  means, on the discretion of a judge.   • According to Article 205(1) of the same code a preliminary first  hearing or a  phone interview or videoconference with the parties as  well as a phone interview or videoconference with a judge may also  be conduc ted.    Parties may choose whether they want to file claims, counterclaims,  responses in   electronic form or physical hardcopies. Other documents shall be  submitted to the   court as hardcopies.     Q.A.6 The National Enforcement Agency uses an electronic  communic ation system with other state institutions and partner companies  but there is no online dispute resolution mechanism for private individuals  in respect of enforcement.   Q.A.7 There are no compulsory ADR procedures with res judicata effect.   Q.B.1 Article 178  of the General Administrative Code deals with the  administrative body authorised to review administrative complaints: the  administrative body issuing the administrative act shall review and resolve  the administrative complaint if there is an official at t he administrative body  superior to the official or to the structural sub -division having issued the  administrative act. However in administrative complaints the use of online  filing, electronic evidence and so on is not regulated by the law.   Under the Arti cle 2 (5) Administrative Procedure Code of Georgia, the  party is obliged to appeal the disputed administrative decision and lodge  an administrative complaint with the higher administrative body (unless  otherwise specified by law) in accordance with the pro cedure laid down in  the General Administrative Code of Georgia. This administrative  complaints process is a mandatory pre -requisite before a claim is 
CDCJ(2018) 5  25 admissible in the court.   Thus the claimant must have used the possibility of escalating their  administrati ve complaint at first. Here ODR could be used (?).   Q.B.2 There are no special tribunals for administrative cases using ODR.   Q.B.3 Use of ODR in the administrative courts - same as in the civil courts -  see replies to Q.A.4   Q.B.4 There are no special ODR trac ks of pathways in the administrative  courts.   Q.B.6 There are no compulsory ADR procedures with res judicata effect  for administrative matters.       Germany       Q.A.1 As to preliminary pre -trial processes, including ADR mechanisms,  there is no general legal obligation for the parties to participate in  mediation before going to court. However, pursuant to Section 15a para. 1  of the Act Introducing the Code of Civil  Procedure (Gesetz betreffend die  Einführung der Zivilprozessordnung, EGZPO), a federal state (Land) can  require by law that an action regarding specific civil disputes shall only be  brought before a court once an attempt to achieve consensus has been  made  at an officially recognized conciliation office (mandatory conciliation  process). However there is no legal basis for using Online Dispute  Resolution techniques by a recognized conciliation office (staatlich  anerkannte Gütestelle) and the hearings are bas ically face -to-face.     Q.A.2 The German civil procedure rules require all courts to set up  mediation programmes with judges who have trained as mediators  (Güterichter). A Güterichter acts as a mediator with no decision -making  power, using methods of ADR, Se ction 278 Para.5 Civil Procedure Rules.  The case is normally referred to the Güterichter by the court. He or she  does not handle the conciliation hearing on an online basis or by using  online filing systems/platforms. However, the parties are fully entitle d to file  their statements electronically online under the same conditions as are  applicable to claims and petitions in civil cases in general (see below  Q.A.4).     Q.A.3 There are no special ODR tribunals for small claims or other minor  disputes in Germany.     Q.A.4   In payment order processes (Mahnverfahren, Sections 688 ff. of the Code  of Civil Procedure, Zivilprozessordnung - ZPO) and small claims  proceedings (§§ 1097 ff. ZPO) electronic forms have been used for certain  actions (at the parties’ option). The y, however, do not constitute „online  filing platforrms/systems“ in the sense of the question.     Furthermore, with effect from 1. January 2018, the law provides for the  possibility of granting access to the court files by providing the content of  the files for retrieval in a so -called "file access portal"  ("Akteneinsichtsportal", § 299 ZPO in its new version). The court may 
CDCJ(2018) 5  26 permit the parties and their attorneys, or witnesses or experts to stay at  another location in the course of a hearing or an examination  and to take  actions in the proceedings from there. In this event, the images and sound  of the hearing or the examination shall be broadcast in real time to this  location and to the courtroom simultaneously (§ 128a ZPO).     Germany is taking a uniform approa ch to implementing electronic  communication systems in all proceedings under equal conditions. Since 1  January 2018, all courts of the "Länder" and at the Federal Level (Regional  and Federal Courts) are open for filing electronic documents via secure  elect ronic paths. However, this mere possibility to access the court  electronically (electronic communication) does not constitute full „online  filing platforms/systems“ in the sense of the question. The same is true for  the possibility granted by law to keep t he court records of the dispute as  electronic files (§ 298a ZPO).      So in Germany there is electronic filing, electronic communication and  access to the court records plus the possibility to take part in hearings by  simultaneous two way video -communicatio n, but no full implementation of  online court platforms.     Q.A.5 In Germany there are no parallel ODR tracks or pathways in the civil  courts.   Q.A.6 German civil enforcement law does not provide for a closed online  filing system/platform.     However, a creditor in possession of an enforceable title, may file his or  her petition for enforcement measures to the enforcement court  electronically, online under the same conditions as are applicable to claims  and petitions in civil cases in general. The same conditions apply to  instructions for enforcement that are transmitted directly to a court appointed enforcement officer by the creditor. Additionally, petitions and  instructions for enforcement can be transmitted exclusively electronically  without  a need to transmit a paper copy of the title if the title is a writ of  execution and the monetary claim due that is set out in the writ of  execution does not amount to more than 5,000 euros.     Regarding the use of platforms for online meetings and online h earings, for  example by audio - and video -conferencing, the court -appointed  enforcement officer must endeavour to achieve an amicable termination of  the matter in all situations of the proceedings. Any contact with the parties  (particularly the debtor) requ ired can also be achieved by using image and  sound transmission systems.     Q.A.7 There are no mandatory out of court ADR procedures with res  judicata effect.   Q.B.1 The rules of adminstrative  court procedure provide for preliminary  proceedings before instituting proceedings before the court by lodging an  objection (“Widerspruch” under Section 68 of the Code of Administrative  Court Procedure, Verwaltungsgerichtsordnung – VwGO and Section 78 of  the Social Court Act, Sozialgerichtsgesetz – SGG; “Einspruch” under  Section 347 of the Fiscal Code, Abgabenordnung - AO). These objections  can be launched electronically (§ 70 VwGO, § 84 SGG, § 357 AO); they,  however, do not constitute “online filing syste ms/platforms” in the sense of  the question.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  27   Q.B.2 There are no special online dispute resolution administrative  tribunals for some particular types of claims in Germany.     Q.B.3 With effect from 1. January  2018, the law provides for the possibility  of gra nting access to the court files by providing the content of the files for  retrieval in a so -called "file access portal" ("Akteneinsichtsportal", cf. § 100  VwGO, § 78 FGO, § 120 SGG in their new versions).     The court may permit the parties and their attorne ys, or witnesses or  experts to stay at another location in the course of a hearing or an  examination and to take actions in the proceedings from there. In this  event, the images and sound of the hearing or the examination shall be  broadcast in real time to  this location and to the courtroom simultaneously  in a two way broadcast (§ 102a VwGO, § 110a SGG, § 91a FGO).       Apart from that, there are elements of electronic procedure in the course of  the ordinary proceedings none of which, however, constitute sys tems or  platforms in the sense of the question, such as:     - Documents may be conveyed to the court electronically under certain  conditions (§ 55a VwGO, § 65a SGG, § 52a Finanzgerichtsordnung - FGO  (Tax Court Code)).     -The procedural files may be kept in e lectronic form (§ 55b VwGO, § 65b  SGG, § 52b FGO).     Q.B.4 There are no separate ODR tracks or pathways in the administrative  courts in Germany.     Q.B.5 Enforcement of judicial decisions in administrative matters is  governed by the rules for the enforcement of civil titles (as is e.g. the case  for enforcement sought against public authorities, cf. § 167 VwGO, § 198  SGG, § 151 FGO) - see the response to Q.A.6     Q.B.6 There are no mandatory out of court administrative processes with  res judicata effect.     Greece       There are no ODR or ADR processes which would fall within the scope of  the questionnaire, thus the answer to all questions is “no”.       Hungary       Q.A.1 There are no mandatory preliminary pre -trial ADR processes in  Hungary.   Q.A.2 There are no preliminary p re-trial processes recommended by a 
CDCJ(2018) 5  28 judge or subject to cost -penalties.   Q.A.4 Hungary has an online filing procedure for small claims below a  value of ca. Euro 10,000, which can be accessed directly by the parties  and their advocates.   Online filing systems  directly accessed by the parties and their advocates  for the filing of statements.   The use of platforms for online meetings and online hearings: by audio -  and video -conferencing, including the giving of oral testimony of witnesses  and experts   Artificial intelligence is used in the online, anonymous judgment database  (searchable records).   Q.A.5 Claims [from (min.)10.000, - EUR  to (max) 33.000 EUR] in which  online filing system directly accessed by the parties and their advocates is  used for the filing of s tate claims.   - traditional court procedures   - notary procedure   Q.A.6 ODR is not used in the enforcement of civil judgments   Q.A.7 In Hungary there are no mandatory ADR processes with res judicata  effect.   Q.B.1 In Hungary there are no mandatory preliminary p retrial processes in  the administrative courts.   Q.B.2 There are no special administrative ODR tribunals   Q.B.3 ODR is not used in the administrative courts in Hungary   Q.B.4 There are no parallel ODR tracks or pathways in the administrative  courts in Hungary   Q.B.5 ODR is not used in the enforcement of administrative decisions.   Q.B.6 There are no binding, out -of- court ADR dispute resolution  mechanisms in administrative matters.     Ireland       Q.A.1 There are no mandatory pre -trial preliminary ADR processes in th e  civil courts in Ireland.   Under Order 56A (Mediation and Conciliation) of the Rules of the Superior  Courts, the High Court, on the application of any of the parties or of its own  motion, may, when it considers it appropriate and having regard to all the  circumstances of the case, may order that proceedings or any issue in the  proceedings be adjourned for such time as the Court considers just and  convenient and   (i) invite the parties to use an ADR process (viz. mediation,  conciliation or another dispute re solution process approved by the  Court, but not including arbitration) to settle or determine the  proceedings or issue, or   (ii) where the parties consent, refer the proceedings or issue to such  process,   and the court may, for the purposes of such invitatio n or reference, invite  the parties to attend such information session on the use of mediation, if  any, as the court may specify.     Where the parties decide to use an ADR process, the court may make an  order extending the time for compliance by any party wit h a time limit set  by the rules of court or an order of the court.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  29   The court may, where it considers it just, have regard to the refusal or  failure without good reason of any party to participate in any ADR process  when awarding costs as between the parti es.    Similar rules of court are in place for the other first instance jurisdictions.     The ADR process would not however, ordinarily involve the use of an  online system/platform.     However, in the case of consumer claims with a cross -border element,  under the European Union (Online Dispute Resolution for Consumer  Disputes) Regulations 2015, responsibility is conferred on the European  Consumer Centre Ireland to host the Irish ODR contact point and carry out  the functions set out in article 7 of the ODR Regul ation. These functions  include providing information on the functioning of the ODR platform and  facilitating communication between the consumer, trader, and competent  ADR entity, if requested.     Q.A.3 Ireland has a special online platform system for small c laims:   Q.A.3  A small claim    (viz. (a) a claim for goods or services bought for private use from someone  selling them in the course of a business (consumer claims) (for example,  claims for faulty goods or bad workmanship)   (b) a claim for goods or services bought for business use from someone  selling them in the course of a business (business claims)   (c) a claim for minor damage to property (but excluding personal injuries)   (d) a claim for the non -return of a rent deposit for certain kinds of rented  properti es. For example, a holiday home or a room / flat in a premises  where the owner also lives.     not exceeding €2,000 in value, may be lodged online on an online  platform, which allows a party/advocate to    • create a small claim application online   • pay the a ppropriate small claim application fee and   • check the status of your online small claim.   (Editorial comment: this platform seems to allow for the filing of claims and  viewing the status of the claim, but does not seem to be a fully online  dispute resolution platform?)   Q.A.4 There are no ODR techniques in the ordinary civil court processes.   Q.A.5 There are no ODR parallel tracks of pathways in the civil courts  other than the special filing and viewing process for small claims described  under Q.A.3   Q.A.6 ODR does not play a role in the enforcement of civil judgments.   Q.A.7 Ireland there are no mandatory out of court processes with res  judicata effect in civil cases.   Q.B.1 There are no mandatory preliminary pre -trial processes in the  administrative cou rts.  Q.B.2 In Ireland there are no special ODR tribunals for administrative  matters   Q.B.3 In Ireland there are no ODR administrative procedures   Q.B.4 There are also no special ODR tracks or pathways in the  administrative courts   Q.B.5 ODR does not play a ro le in the enforcement of administrative  decisions of the courts  
CDCJ(2018) 5  30 Q.B.6 In Ireland there are no mandatory ADR procedures with res judicata  effects in administrative matters.     Latvia       Q.A.1 Generally speaking there are no mandatory preliminary pre -trial  procedures using ODR in Latvia. However some civil procedures such as  injunctions, orders securing evidence in civil trials can be carried out using  electronic communication:   There are some procedures in the Civil Procedure Law, for example, the  securing of a claim, securing the evidence, provisional remedies in IP  cases, which can be used before bringing an action in a court –here  submission of documents may be done electronically (if using an electronic  signature, documents have legal force according to law).Communication  by the court in such procedures may be received electronically (if a party  agrees), or within the special online system (for example, communications  addressed to sworn advocates).     Q.A.2 No. A court can, for example, recommend the partie s to use  mediation, however it is not mandatory, and there are no cost penalites  and no ORD is used.   Q.A.3 There are no “Special online dispute resolution tribunals for small  claims” (But submission of documents in small claims procedures may be  done elect ronically (if using an   electronic signature/documents have legal force). Communication by the  court received   electronically (if a party agrees), or within the online system (for example,  with regards to sworn advocates).     Q.A.4 Videoconferencing can be use d in civil procedures. Each court in  Latvia is equipped with at least one video conference room and EVERY  court room is equipped with an audio equipment. A judge decides on the  requests of participants in the case regarding participation of persons in  the trial of the case by using a video conference. This can be beneficial in  cases where, for example, a person is in a location not close to the court  adjudicating the case, and cannot attend the hearing.     All court hearing protocols are made in an audio for mat using the audio labelling system (TIX). TIX eases audio recording of court sessions,  combining the written information with the audio record in one interactive  protocol of PDF format, corresponding with the standard of the industry.  The protocol of PDF  format consists of the general information of the court  session, audio record of the court session and course of the court session,  organised pursuant to statements or issues to be adjudicated that are  linked with the particular place in audio record. Pre paration of the protocol  does not require a lot of time, because the recorder has to record only the  issues to be adjudicated. Full information on the course of the court  session is provided by audio record. While, the place of interest in the  audio record  is to be found fast in the interactive protocol by pressing on  the relevant issue to be adjudicated.     In general, submission of documents may be done through the court 
CDCJ(2018) 5  31 portal:  www.manas.tiesas.lv     As mentioned be fore, submission of documents may be done  electronically (if using an electronic signature documents have legal force),  and communication by the court received electronically (if a party agrees),  or within the special online system (for example, documents addressed to  sworn advocates).     Q.A.6 Some communications related to enforcement may be  communicated electronically: Generally no, however, for example,  procedures (communication) in Approval of a Statement of Auction are  done electronically.     Q.A.7 No, th ere are no Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms which  the parties are required to use by law, and which use ODR techniques.     Q.B.1 -3 In relation to administrative disputes, in general submission of  documents could be done through the court portal www.manas.tiesas.lv     As mentioned before submission of documents may be done electronically  (if using an   electronic signature documents have legal force), and communication by  the court received  electronically (if a p arty agrees), or within the special  online system (for example, documents addressed to sworn advocates).     Videoconferencing can be used in administrative processes before the  court. A judge can decide that video conference can be used in specified  procedu ral actions if the participant in the proceedings, the witness or  expert are in different places and cannot appear at the court hearing.     There are no online dispute resolution administrative tribunals in Latvia.   Q.B.4 There are  no special ODR tracks or pathways before the  administrative courts in Latvia.     Q.B.5 The Enforcement Case Register is accessible to the parties online.   Q.B.6 There are no out -of- court ADR procedures with res judicata effect in  Latvia.     Moldova       Q.A.1 T here are no mandatory preliminary pre -trial processes in Moldova.   Q.A.2 There are no pre -trial ADR processes which can be recommended  by judges or are subject to cost penalties in Moldova.   Q.A.3 There are  no special ODR Tribunals for small claims or other minor  disputes in Moldova .    Q.A.4 According to the law, in the Republic of Moldova are functioning  courts of general jurisdiction. The 2 specialised courts (military court,  commercial court) ceased its ac tivity starting with April 2017, according to  the law no. 76 from 21.04.2016 about court reorganization.     In 2017 the e -File solution for courts was developed , which allows the 
CDCJ(2018) 5  32 creation and administration of the electronic file with the access of the  parties, the uploading of the evidence, the visualization of the materials  attached to the electronic file, the electronic summoning of the parties, the  coordination of the court sessions agenda by the judge with the  participants in the trial, payment of state  tax/fees through government e services (Mpay), etc.  The period of piloting for the developed tools is  forecast for 2018.     The application is expected to be implemented in all Moldovan courts. The  pilot does not include: (1) the use of artificial intellig ence, big data analysis  techniques and automation to reach decisions (which traditionally are  adopted by judges and which traditionally have been dependent on human  judgment) and (2) the use of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, expert  and legal a dvice systems for the purposes of negotiation, mediation,  narrowing of issues or legal advice, including such systems as blind bidding.     In December 2017 in all M oldovan courts have installed video conferencing equipment in order to use it for online meeti ngs and online  hearings. The period of piloting the installed tools is forecast for 2018.   Q.A.5 There are PARALLEL TRACKS or PATHWAYS before the same  court which allow claimants to choose between the ordinary, “traditional”  court procedures (not using Onli ne Dispute Resolution) AND a special  Online Dispute Resolution Procedure.   This option is available for all types of cases and for all courts. The option  (PARALLEL TRACK) does not include the use of artificial intelligence, big  data analysis techniques and automation to reach decisions which  traditionally have been made by judges and which traditionally have been  dependent on human judgment and the use of artificial intelligence, big  data analysis, expert and legal advice systems for the purposes of  negotiat ion, mediation, narrowing of issues or legal advice, including such  systems as blind -bidding.   Due to the recent development of the option it will be piloted in 2018 and  then it is expected to be implemented in all Moldovan courts as well as the  video -confe rencing equipment recently installed.   Q.A.6 ODR is not used in the enforcement of judgments   Q.A.7 There are no mandatory ADR out -of-court processes which have res  judicata effect   Q.B.1 There are preliminary pre -trial processes which under the law  constitut e a mandatory prerequisite to institute proceedings before a public  court, but these preliminary pre -trial processes do not use  Online Dispute  Resolution techniques listed above.   Q.B.2 There are no special online dispute resolution administrative  tribunal s for some particular types of claims in Moldova   Q.B.3 The answer is the same as to Q.A.4 - Moldova has introduced e filing, access to online evidence and video -conferencing as described  there.   Q.B.4 For the administrative cases as well for the civil cases there are  PARALLEL TRACKS or PATHWAYS before the same court which allow  claimants to choose between the ordinary, “traditional” court procedures  (not using Online Dispute Resolution) AND a special Online Dispute  Resolution Procedure. This option (PARALLEL TRACKS) is available for  all types of cases and for all courts. The option does not include the use of  artificial intelligence, big data analysis techniques and automation to reach  decisions and the use of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, expert  and 
CDCJ(2018) 5  33 legal advice systems for the purposes of negotiation, mediation, narrowing  of issues or legal advice, including such systems as blind -bidding.   Q.B.5 ODR does not play a role in the enforcement of decisions of the  administrative courts.   Q.B.6 There are  no out -of- court ADR procedures with res judicata effect in  the Republic of Moldova.     Montenegro       Q.A.1 In Montenegro there are several preliminary pre -trial processes  envisaged by the Law on Civil Procedure. Generally speaking, they are not  mandatory a s such: they are an optional choice of the parties, not an  obligation. Mediation may not only be used in the pre -trial phase of the  procedure, but also in the trial phase Only mediation in family cases is  obligatory for the parties. Mediation proceedings a nd judicial settlement  can also be prescribed by a separate law. In the Montenegro legal system  the parties may choose to use arbitration proceedings as one of the  alternative settlement disputes mechanisms. Arbitration is governed by a  separate Law on Arb itration. But there are no preliminary pre -trial  processes that use ODR techniques, however.   Q.A.2 The preliminary pre -trial ADR processes can be recommended by  the court/judge. It is actually the role of the court or the judge to encourage  the parties to  reach an agreement in a pre -court decision phase. However,  there is no penalty if the parties refuse to engage in them. These  preliminary processes as we have mentioned earlier do not use Online  Dispute Resolution techniques.   Q.A.3 There are no special tr ibunals using ODR for small claims or other  minor disputes in Montenegro.   Q.A.4 Pleadings can be delivered electronically in accordance with  separate Law on Electronic Administration, as described in the Rules of  Civil Procedures - thus the legal framework for this is in place. Furthermore  a new strategy for the judiciary was adopted, setting directions for the  development of judicial information; basic infrastructure was set up,  accelerated training was delivered to the end users and it is now possible  for all the judicial bodies to make entries and oversee the work on cases  electronically. Given the importance of the judiciary for the society as a  whole, as well as the rapid development and pervasiveness of information  and communication technologies in the past two decades, a logical  conclusion may be drawn that further development of ICT for the judiciary,  and of administrative affairs in particular, will depend on the level of  implementation of information and communication technologies in these  institutio ns.   In regard to Civil and Commercial Courts there is not any Online Dispute  Resolution techniques in legal system of Montenegro in this moment.   However, in the near future it is realistic to expect that Montenegro  authorities will start procedures with t he aim of implementing these online  communication and filing mechanisms as part of the legal system of  Montenegro.   Q.A.5 There are no special tracks or pathways using ODR in the same  court.   Q.A.6 ODR is not used in the enforcement of judicial decisions.   Q.A.7 There are no out -of-court ADR processes with res judicata effect.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  34 Q.B.1 Montenegro have Administrative Court as special institution.  However, there is no preliminary pre -trial processes which under the law  constitute a mandatory prerequisite to insti tute proceedings before a public  court in administrative cases.   Q.B.2 There are no special online dispute resolution administrative  tribunals in Montenegro.   Q.B.3 The administrative courts do not use ODR techniques.   Q.B.4 There are no alternative ODR track s or pathways in the  administrative courts.   Q.B.5 ODR is not used for enforcement of decisions of the administrative  courts.   Q.B.6 In Montenegro there are no out -of-court ADR processes in the  administrative courts with res judicata effect.     The Netherland s       Q.A.1 and Q.A.2 In the Netherlands there are no preliminary pre -trial ADR  procedures.   Q.A.3 There are no special ODR tribunals for small claims or other minor  disputes.   Q.A.4 In 2013 the Ministry of Security and Justice in cooperation with the  Council  for the Judiciary started a modernization program for the judiciary.  One important part of the program is the mandatory digital procedure (for  professionals) in civil and administrative cases. For citizens without legal  aid the digital pathway will not be  mandatory. For this modernization new  legislation (civil and administrative procedure) was adopted by the  Parliament in July 2016. The ambition is that in all kinds of civil and  administrative procedures the digital procedure is the standard (and that  paper will be banned). As discussed with the Parliament it is very  important that the process of implementation of the legislation is not a  matter of a ‘big bang’ but a process of phased entry into force, in  cooperation with all the users of the digital syste ms (e.g. bar association,  government bodies, bailiffs). The first part of the new legislation entered  into force in February 2017 for civil procedures (claims) at the Supreme  Court. The second step was in June 2017: In all asylum -cases  (administrative law)  from this month the process is fully digital. In  September 2017 the legislation entered into force for civil procedures with  mandatory legal representation in two districts courts only. The process of  implementation will last still several years. Importan t to mention: the new  digital procedure is, first of all, a way of electronic communication with the  judiciary. The parties get access to some files of the judiciary. So strictly it  is not a form of online dispute resolution.     In response to the questions above:   1. Under the new legislation (partly entered into force) every court  procedure starts with a digital ‘process startdocment ’ at the digital portal of  the judiciary. In all cases there is a digital file. Parties concerned are given  24/7 access to court -files. Access is only possible with a digital  authentication key. Every next step – except for the hearing – is done  electronic ally. Parties receive a notification by e -mail for new documents.  The decision is done electronically (also electronic signature). All court  files are stored (archived) centrally. Court of Appeal (cassation) can 
CDCJ(2018) 5  35 download the documents from the district cou rt (not available yet).   2. Under the new legislation the evidence must be made available  (uploaded) in the online portal of the judiciary (PDF -format, and also audio  and video documents)   3. Under Dutch law the use of AI and automatic decisions is not poss ible  4. Video -conferencing, including the giving of testimony of witnesses and  experts, is possible but rarely used in civil and administrative proceedings   5. Is not possible. The Judiciary is interested in new technology and  investigates the possibilities  to make use of for example Artificial  Intelligence.     Q.A.7 There are no binding out -of-court ADR procedures with res judicata  effects in civil and commercial matters.   Q.B.1 There are no preliminary pre -trial processes in the administrative  courts.   Q.B.2 T here is an online filing platform in respect of traffic offences  (including all evidence)   Q.B.3 see the answer to Q.A.4   Q.B.5 ODR is not used for the enforcement of administrative decisions.   Q.B.6 There are no mandatory out of court ADR procedures with res   judicata effect.     Poland       Q.A.1 In Poland, the Civil Procedure Code requires that the initial claim  (the document initiating the proceedings) should contains a section which  mentions whether there has been a mediation attempt or an explanation  why the mediation has not been possible. Otherwise, the Code does not  specify a legal obligation to undertake pre -trial mediation. Such mediation  is considered to be an out -of-the court procedure. Some private mediators  offer online (electronic or telephone) media tion. As this procedure is not  regulated by law, no statistics are available.   Q.A.2 In Poland, the Civil Procedurę Code contains a general duty of the  court to promote conciliatory dispute settlement (Art. 10). In particular, Art.  210 § 22 requests the Cou rt to inform the parties about possibility to settle  the case directly among them, including through mediation. Also, at any  stage of trial, the court may request parties to undertake mediation (Art.  1838). However, the mediation does not take place, if ei ther party, within  one week from receiving the court order, has not agreed to mediation. The  trial president may call on the parties to attend an information meeting on  mediation. As in the case of Q.A.1 we have only anecdotal information  about the use of electronic, online mediation offered by private bodies.   Q.A.3 Not answered.   Q.A.4 1.The procedure for payment orders is fully electronic. The claim is  submitted through an individual account opened in a dedicated IT  system/IT platform. All acts and documents are available online. This  applies also to the electronic enforcement order. Decisions may be taken  by the court clerk. Opposition to the payment order (editorial comment:  filing of a defence?) results in the case being transferred to ordinary  proceedings before the territorially competent court.   2. As regards all other civil disputes the Civil Procedure Code provides for  the possibility to file the case electronically, if the technical conditions so 
CDCJ(2018) 5  36 allow. For the time being, this has not been im plemented.   3. There are no videoconference platforms. In the context of international  co-operation (MLA) in civil matters, Poland’s central authority receives  from  abroad and executes app.4 -5 requests per month for the taking of  evidence through videoconf erence with Polish court (under EU regulation  on the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters).   Q.A.5 -Q.B.6 not answered.     Portugal       Q.A.1 and Q.A.2 In Portugal there are no preliminary pre -trial processes  which under the law constitute a manda tory prerequisite to institute  proceedings or which are recommended by a judge/lead to cost penalties.   Q.A.4   Q.A.5   i) Order for payment proceedings   An order for payment proceedings, through which a claimant may claim an  amount up to 15.000 EUR or any amoun t emerging from a commercial  transaction arising out of a contract, can be initiated over an online  mechanism at http://www.bna.mj.pt (‘Balcão Nacional de Injunções’), using  a standard form (in word or pdf formats). The application does not need to  be made  through a lawyer. In case of opposition by the defendant (editorial  comment: when a defence is filed?), the order for payment proceeding is  converted into standard judicial proceedings.     Legislation: Decree -Law no. 269/98, ELI: http://data.dre.pt/eli/dec lei/269/1998/09/01/p/dre/pt/html , Decree -Law no. 62/2013, ELI:  http://data.dre.pt/eli/dec -lei/62/2013/05/10/p/dre/pt/html ; all related decrees  are listed at https://goo.gl/2GSF1S     ii) Eviction proceedings   Eviction proceedings, meant to enforce the termination of lease contracts,  can be initiated over an online platform at https://bna.mj.pt (‘Balcão  Nacional de Arrendamento’), using a standard form (in word or pdf  formats). The application does not need to be made through a lawyer but  the same does not hold true for the defendant’s  response (which requires  legal representation)     Legislation: Decree -Law no. 1/2013, ELI: http://data.dre.pt/eli/dec lei/1/2013/01/07/p/dre/pt/html     Paragraphs 1 and 2. The Portugues e Ministry of Justice has developed an  online platform – named ‘Citius’, accessible at www.citius.mj.pt – to  dematerialise proceedings by treating electronically all information  belonging to the proceedings (such as claims, counterclaims, responses  and rel ated documents), thus reducing their physical form to a minimum.  The system is composed by several applications, databases and services  that communicate with each other: computer applications for public  prosecutors, judges and court staff, as well as for l awyers and solicitors,  complement each other in order to achieve full electronic pleading.    
CDCJ(2018) 5  37 Paragraph 4. Since 2016, any means of technological communication,  capable of simultaneous real -time video and audio communication – such  as ‘Skype’, ‘Facetime’ or ‘Whatsapp’ -  can be used for taking testimony or  statements.     Legislation: Article 502 of the Civil Procedure Code, Law no. 41/2013, ELI:  http://data.dre.pt/eli/lei/41/2013/p/cons/ 20170616/pt/html     Paragraphs 3 and 5.No artificial intelligence is used.     Q.A.6: If the claimant has appointed a lawyer, the enforcement application  must be filled online, through the use of the ‘Citius’ platform. In any case,  proceedings are always manage d electronically through the platform.     While ‘Citius’ is managed by the Ministry of Justice, enforcement officers  use an application managed by their professional association (‘Ordem dos  Solicitadores e dos Agentes de Execução’) which interconnects with  ‘Citius’.     In 2015, this same professional association developed the website ‘e leilões.pt’ for the sale of goods by means of an electronic auction (which is  currently the preferred sales method for seized goods).     Legislation: Articles 132 and 712 of the C ivil Procedure Code, Law no.  41/2013, ELI: http://data.dre.pt/eli/lei/41/2013/p/cons/20170616/pt/html ;  Ordonnance no. 280/2013, ELI:    http://data.dre.pt/eli/port/280/2013/p/cons/20170606/pt/html     Q.A.7 Portugal does not have any mandatory and binding out -of-court  ADR procedures with res judicata effect   Q.B.1 Portugal does not have any mandatory preliminary p re-trial ADR  procedures.   Q.B.2 There are no special online dispute resolution administrative  tribunals.     Q.B.3 Paragraphs 1 and 2. As for civil courts, the Portuguese Ministry of  Justice has developed an online platform designed for administrative  courts – named ‘SITAF and accessible at www.taf.mj.pt – to dematerialise  proceedings by treating electronically all information belonging to the  proceedings (such as claims, counterclaims, responses and related  documents), thus reducing their physical form to a mi nimum.     Paragraph 4 (audio - and video -conferencing). As in civil proceedings, any  means of technological communication (namely ‘Skype’, ‘Facetime’ or  ‘Whatsapp’ ) can be used for taking testimony or statements.

Q.B.6 Portugal does not  have any out -of-court alternative dispute  resolution mechanisms which the complainant is required to use by law  and which result in binding decisions not subject to judicial review and with  res judicata effect in administrative matters     Slovakia       Q.A.1 Slovakia has no mandatory preliminary pre -trial ADR processes in  the civil courts.   Q.A.2 There are  no preliminary pre -trial ADR processes which can be  recommended by the judge or are subject to cost penalties.   Q.A.3 There are no special ODR tribunals for small claims or other minor  civil disputes.     Q.A.4 Claims can be filed online with an electronic au thorised signature. If  a person does not have it, he can still file a claim online but has to be  additionally served by post.   Videoconferencing is used especially in proceedings involving a  witness/expert living abroad. We have electronic file management for  judicial files and parties are enabled to request access to their file online  and, if approved, to have access to the content of the judicial file online.     Q.A.5 There are no parallel ODR tracks or pathways in the civil courts in  Slovakia.   Q.A.6 There is no ODR in the enforcement of civil judgments.   Q.A.7 There are no mandatory out -of-court procedures with res judicata  effect in civil matters.   Q.B.1 In Slovakia there are no preliminary pre -trial processes which under  the law constitute a mandatory prere quisite to institute proceedings before  a public court.   Q.B.2 There are no special ODR tribunals for administrative matters.   Q.B.3 In Slovakia there are no ODR techniques in the administrative  courts.   Q.B.4 There are no parallel ODR tracks of pathways in t he administrative  courts.   Q.B.5 ODR is not used in the enforcement of administrative court  decisions.   Q.B.6 In Slovakia there are no out -of-court alternative dispute resolution  mechanisms which the complainant is required to use by law and which  result in binding decisions not subject to judicial review and with res  judicata effect.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  39 Sweden       Q.A.1 and Q.A.2 In Sweden there are no mandatory preliminary pre -trial  processes in the civil courts nor are there such processes which can be  requested by a judge or are subject to cost penalties.   Q.A.3 In Sweden there are no special ODR tribunals for small claims or  other minor disputes.   Q.A.4 There are no ODR techniques in the civil courts.   Q.A.5 There are no parallel ODR tracks or pathways in the civil courts.   Q.A.6  ODR is not used in the enforcement of civil judgments   Q.A.7 In Sweden there are no out -of-court alternative dispute resolution  mechanisms which the parties are required to use by law and which result  in binding decisions not subject to judicial review and  with res judicata  effect.   Q.B.1 There are no mandatory preliminary pre -trial processes in the  administrative courts   Q.B.2 In Sweden there are no special online dispute resolution  administrative tribunals.   Q.B.3 In Sweden the administrative courts do not u se ODR techniques.   Q.B.4 In Sweden there are no parallel ODR tracks or pathways in the  administrative courts   Q.B.5 ODR is not used in the enforcement of decisions of the  administrative courts   Q.B.6 There are no mandatory out of court processes in administr ative  matters.     Switzerland       Q.A.1 and Q.A.2 There is a mandatory pre -trial conciliation procedure  before the official conciliation authority. But there is a great diversity in  terms of how the canton authorities are structured in our federal system,  no-one has established formal procedural rules for any of the ODR  techniques stated in the Questionnaire. Some authorities provide for an  online claim form. But this form has to be printed out and filed “offline”.  There is a possibility to replace the pre -trial conciliation proceedings before  the civil court with a privately agreed mediation. However, there is no  public (or, to our knowledge, private) infrastructure provided that would  allow for the application of any of the above mentioned ODR techniques.  However, parties would, in principle, be free to agree to an online  mediation procedure using some of these ODR techniques (probably  limited to online filing and online platforms) if so provided for by private  mediation entities (in the future - we are not awa re of this currently being  used).   Q.A.3 and Q.A.5 In Switzerland, there are simplified procedures applicable  to proceedings before the ordinary civil courts as well as the possibility to  have the conciliation authority authoritatively decide small claims. But  there is no such thing as particular ‘small claims tribunals’. Where the  conciliation authority plays such a role (exceptionally), none of the above  mentioned ODR techniques is available.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  40 Q.A.4 Only some courts (depending on the canton) accept  online filings  (technique 1).   None of the other techniques (2 to 5 online platforms, artificial intelligence,  video -conferencing) is used, except for very rare cases of online -hearings  (4) in the context of requests for cross -border evidence taking under  the  corresponding Hague Convention.   Q.A.6 In Switzerland, the enforcement of payment obligations can be  made through an online enforcement request. However, the online  enforcement proceeding only covers the first steps of enforcement  (request for initiati on, transmission of the answer, request for continuation).  Service of the documents to the debtor as well as any judicial proceedings  (triggered by a refusal of the debtor to pay) must be initiated “offline”. It is  therefore not actually a “dispute resolut ion” technique but a mere technical  structure for transmitting documents and declarations. As of 2017, around  45% of the proceedings for enforcement of payments were initiated online.  This is mainly due to “big debtors” (tax authorities, insurance companie s,  debt collection entities) making use of the tool in question (“eSchKG”).   Q.A.7 In Switzerland there are no out -of-court alternative dispute  resolution mechanisms which the parties are required to use by law and  which result in binding decisions not sub ject to judicial review and with res  judicata effect.   Q.B.1 There are no mandatory preliminary, pre -trial processes in the  administrative courts.   Q.B.2 In Switzerland there are no special online dispute resolution  administrative tribunals for some particul ar types of claims.   Q.B.3 Only very few cantonal administrative courts allow for the electronic  filing of statements (1). The rest of the cited techniques is not available.   Q.B.4 There are no parallel ODR tracks of pathways in the administrative  courts.   Q.B.5 Administrative judgments for payment of a sum of money are  enforced under the same proceedings as civil decisions. Under those  proceedings, a part of the enforcement (submission of the request for  enforcement, request for continuation, information on s tatus) can be made  online. As per 2017, about 45% of enforcement requests for payment were  made using the corresponding tool (“eSchKG”). However, all substantial  legal questions (in case of an opposition to enforcement) that may arise  are submitted to the courts and therefore initiated and conducted “offline”.  It is therefore not actually a “dispute resolution” scheme but a mere  technical structure for transmitting documents and declarations.   Q.B.6 There are no mandatory, binding, out of court dispute resol ution  processes with res judicata effect in administrative matters.     Turkey       Q.A.1 and Q.A.2 In Turkey, in the scope of preliminary pre -trial processes  which under the law constitute a mandatory prerequisite to institute  proceedings before a public court , mediation practice as a trial requisite is  provided for in accordance with the Law on Labour Courts No. 7036. In the  mediation practice, the parties who intend to institute proceedings before a  public court in relation with labour disputes in the scope o f the practice  firstly try the mediation practice and, if it fails, then apply to the court.  Where the mediation practice is concluded because of non -attendance of 
CDCJ(2018) 5  41 one of the parties to the first meeting without an excuse, the party who has  not attended in  the meeting is specified on the report and even though this  party prevails partly or completely as a result of the proceedings, it shall be  responsible to cover the costs of the proceedings. Moreover, counsel fee  is not rendered in favour of this person.     The proceedings for the mediation are carried out through UYAP (National  Judiciary Informatics System). ADR// mediation practices in Turkey are  carried out through the recommendation of a judge or the individual  application of the parties. The infrastructu re of UYAP system is used for  this purpose. The system is operated through mediation offices  established in 108 court houses in Turkey. In the UYAP system, the party  applies to the mediation office and if the application is accepted, the  mediation office a ssigns a mediator to the party. This mediator specifies a  date for mediation and thereby initiates the mediation process. The last  report drawn up by the mediator at the end of the mediation negotiations is  submitted to the Department of Mediation of the M inistry of Justice  Directorate General for Civil Affairs.   Q.A.3 •  It is governed under article 66 of the Law on the Protection of  Consumer No 6502 that at least one committee for consumer problems  shall be established in the province centres and in the di strict centres of  which competence requirements are defined under the bylaws in order to  settle the disputes arisen from the consumer transactions and the  practices intended for the consumers.   • Article 68 of the same Law states that, reserving the rights  of the  parties under the Law on Execution and Bankruptcy, it is mandatory to  bring the disputes valuing under four thousand Turkish Lira before the  district committee for consumer problems and the disputes valuing under  six thousand Turkish Lira before th e provincial committee for consumer  problems, and in the metropolises, to bring the disputes valuing from four  to six thousand Turkish Lira before the provincial committee for consumer  problems.   • The disputes over the mentioned values may not be brought b efore  committees for consumer problems.   • The mentioned monetary limits are increased and applied, valid  from the beginning of that calendar year, according to the revaluation rates  determined and declared each year in accordance with article 298 bis of  the Tax Procedure Code dated 04/01/1961 and numbered 213.   • And this article does not prevent the application of the consumers  to alternative dispute resolution authorities under the related legislation.   • Arbitration Committee for Consumers implements, wi th regard to  the settlement of the disputes,  the provision for proving such as witnesses  and experts governed by Civil Procedure Code No. 6100.   • There is no online filing system/platform directly accessed by the  parties and/or their advocates for the fi ling of statements (such as claims,  counterclaims, responses) examined by the Arbitration Committee for  Consumers or online system for storing, processing and assessing  electronic evidence.     Q.A.4 In Turkey the civil courts do not use ODR techniques.   Q.A.5  There are no parallel ODR tracks of pathways in the civil courts in  Turkey.   Q.A.6 ODR is not used in the enforcement of civil judgments in Turkey.   Q.A.7 There are no mandatory, binding out -of-court dispute resolution  processes with res judicata effect.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  42 Q.B.1   • Tax payers may carry out their transactions online in relation with  tax disputes through the program called VEDOP (Tax Department Full  Automation Project) in the Tax Department.   • Any judgement of both administrative and tax courts may be reached  through UYAP   Q.B.2 Otherwise, there are no special online dispute resolution  administrative tribunals for some particular types of claims in Turkey.   Q.B.3 ODR techniques are not used in the administrative courts in Turkey.   Q.B.4 There are no parallel ODR tr acks or pathways in the administrative  courts in Turkey.   Q.B.5 Online Dispute Resolution is not used in the enforcement of judicial  decisions of the administrative courts in Turkey.   Q.B.6 There are no out -of-court alternative dispute resolution mechanisms  which the complainant is required to use by law and which result in binding  decisions not subject to judicial review and with res judicata effect in the  administrative courts in Turkey.       TRENDS FOR THE USE OF ODR IN THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE MEMBER STATES     22. We find the following trends in the Council of Europe Member States:     23. A few states  (for example Bosnia -Herzegovina, Croatia,  Czech Republic,  Denmark ,  France, Georgia, Germany , Montenegro, Poland , Switzerland ) use, or encourage   preliminary, pre -trial ADR pr ocedures - however they are rarely a mandatory pre -requisite to  filing proceedings in the civil courts (with the exception, for example , of family disputes or  certain labour disputes in Croatia, or  of certain disputes in Georgia,  their use in labour  disputes in Turkey  or the new procedure int roduced in France which obliges the parties to  make  an attempt to use  mediation  in certain cases , or certain family cases in Montenegro ),  but usually are recommended by the judge/court to the parties. In one example the parties  had to state on the claims form whether they had considered mediation and justify, why, if  they had not  (Poland) . Furthermore in a few States there may be cost penalties if the parties  do not even consider mediation (Eng land & Wales , Ireland ). Only very few of  the States   have  reported that these preliminary pre -trial procedures use ODR techniques  (for example  in France remote communication tools similar to Skype are used in family mediation) .  However in some of these s tates using preliminary, pre -trial procedures , the mediation or  conciliation is carried out by a private mediator and these private parties may resort to ODR  techniques (for example the Czech Republic mentions the use of video -conferencing for  remote meetings ). In other Member States the mediation is done by an official body or  authority (such as court -annexed conciliation in Germany which is carried out by a judge , or  in Georgia for some types of disputes  or in Switzerland ). However, t he majority of States do   not us e preliminary, pre -trial ADR procedures.     24. No state has as yet implemented a separate , parallel  ODR track or pathway through  a new set of procedural rules in an existing, civil or administrative, court. This  is planned for  the new Online Court in England & Wales (civil dis putes up to a value of £25 ,000)12.                                                              12 https://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/feb/16/online -court -proposed -to-resolve -claims -of-up-to-25000  
CDCJ(2018) 5  43 Moreover, n o state has as yet moved their civil or administrative court procedures  completely online  and digitalised courts completed  by creating an online pla tform where  court users can file and access statements, evidence and court documents online and  incorporating synchronous communication chann els such as video -conferencing, thus  replacing traditional courts (although the Netherlands and Portugal have gone into this  direction).  Moldova is in the process of implementing digitalised courts as a parallel track,  giving the parties the choice between traditional court proceedings and online court  proceedings.     25. In any case,  elements of ODR techniques exist in vari ous states:     26. Some s tates have expedited or simplified procedural rules for 1) small claims, 2)  consumer disputes (although these are not within the scope of this Report) and 3) payment  orders (undefended money claims to enforce debts) . As regards expedited  and simplified  procedures for payment orders, they are sometimes limited  to a maximum amount  (for  example the electronic Electronic Payment Order Motion up to a limit of 1,000,000 CZK in  the Czech Republic  or in Portugal ), or limited to B2B claims (for ex ample in Belgium).  Furthermore, there was also an example of an expedited procedure for terminating a lease   (see eviction proceedings in Portugal) . Ireland has an online court platform for certain small  claims and so does Hungary.     27. Sometimes these expedit ed procedures are online, but normally move “offline” into  the traditional court processes if a defence is filed (for example in England & Wales with the  Money Claim  Online13, or in Poland, in Portugal, or in Switzerland ). In Germany, claims for  payment orders and small claims in particular can be filed electronically.     28. Some states have introduced  (or are in the process of introducing)  electronic court  management systems (internal electronic file management) and electronic  filing for court  users, providing for secure and authenticated filing  through the use of electronic signatures  and allowing the parties  or their advocates  access to their court files after authentication (for  example , Denmark, Germany , Latvia,  the Netherl ands, or the Citius platform in Portugal,  and  Slovakia) . Montenegro has created the legal framework for this in its civil procedure and has  started training its judiciary. Moldova is also introducing electronic filing (including digital  evidence) and this is piloted in 2018.  Online filing platform for administrative matters will be  provided in the near future in Finland. In the Czech Republic businesses and advocates may  communicate with the court through a secure, authenticated databox. The Czech legal  system provides an online/e - filing system for certain legal forms and a data box system for  secure communication – the “ePodatelna“ system  can be used. Croatia also has a pilot  project on e -communication in the courts.     29. Many states have introduced video -conferencing from a remote location into their  courts, for example for the appearance of witnesses and experts on a case -by-case basis.   Some states use this for requests for cross -border evidence taking under the corresponding  Hague Convention (for example Slovakia and Switzerland).  Some states use a variety of  communication channels for remote video -conferencing, see for example Portugal: any  means of technological communication, capable of simultaneous real -time video and audio  communication – such as ‘Skype ’, ‘Facetime’ or ‘Whatsapp’ - can be used for taking  testimony or statements.  In December 2017 all Moldovan courts have installed video                                                             13 https://www.moneyclaim.gov.uk/web/mcol/welcome  
CDCJ(2018) 5  44 conferencing equipment in order to use it for online meetings and online hearings. The  period of piloting the installed tools is forecast for 2018 . In Germany there is electronic filing,  electronic communication and access to the court records plus the possibility to take part in  hearings by simultaneous two way  video -communication, but no full implementation of online  court platforms.     30. No state as yet has introduced artificial intelligence to replace human decision making (for example for deciding preliminary issues or for providing the parties with legal  advice  through the use of extensive expert systems, although the Netherlands Rechtswjizer  system goes into this direction14).    31. Few states have considered the use of ODR techniques for enforcing court  judgments - some states who have introduced online platforms for  document management  have extended this to enforcement (Portugal). An interesting example of an ODR technique  for online enforcement is the online auction of seized goods in Portugal.     ODR AND THE COURTS : CIVIL AND COMMON LAW SYSTEMS COMPARED     32. Existing ODR  procedures (such as those that ar e developed by private companies)  are not focu sed on procedural safeguards but are rather focused on having a dispute  resolved  in an effective manner in a cost -efficient way.15 This is true for almost all currently  existing  ADR - ODR mechanisms. This is a challenge which this report must attemp t to  tackle: how to ensure that, if ODR mechanisms are developed and implemented into the  court systems  of EU Member States, these ODR systems are compliant with the right to a  fair tri al: a right that imposes procedural safeguards onto the justice system, and which  would impose procedural safeguards onto the ODR systems.  This must be done in a way  that does not destroy the efficiency savings and access to justice gained through ODR. The   fair trial standards to be developed foc us on the following challenges i ) due process in a  narrow sense (equality of arms, impartiality, transparency etc), ii) access to justice and the  digital divide,  iii) issues inherent in the technology itself, for example prejudice issues  embedded in artificial intelligence and iv) cybersecurity (authenticity, identification and  integrity) and data protection. These challenges will be discussed in the text below.     33. Another interesting point to note is the difference in approach to the development and  implementation of ODR between common law and civil law countries. What seems to be the  case in civil law countries is that introducing ODR into the court system will require   significant changes to the procedural rules  and legal framework, particularly in respect of  formal requirement . This may be because civil law jurisdictions have less inherent  jurisdiction, as do courts in common law countries. This may be an impediment – but a minor  one at best .16                                                                14http://www.hiil.org/data/sitemanagement/media/Online%20legal%20advice%20and%20conflict%20support _UTwente.pdf    15 Colin Rule interview – 2 October 2017.   16 Interview with Shannon Salter – October 2017.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  45 ADDITIONAL INITIATIVES (NOT BASED ON THE QUESTIONNAIRES): THE CIVIL  COURTS IN ENGLAND & WALES AND THE PARALLEL TRACK IN BRITISH COLUMBIA   Proposal for Online Courts in England & Wales   34. The Judiciary in England & Wales is currently consulting on whether small claims  (under a dispute value of £10,000) should be heard by Online Courts. The Civil Justice  Council formed an Online Dispute Resolution Advisory Group reporting in February 2015  and recommending that there should be a new, Int ernet based , court service, known as the  HM Online Court. Under this recommendation it would be envisaged that there are three  stages (and disputes may be settled/decided at any of the three stages). Stage 1 would  involve legal advice and evaluation of the  dispute. Stage 2 trained online facilitators would  provide advice and information and support the parties through negotiation and mediation. At  Stage 3 Online Judges (members of the Judiciary) would decide cases on an online basis.  Lord Justice Briggs has  been tasked in July 2015 to review the structure of the civil courts in  England & Wales with a view to their modernisation and is currently consulting on the  possibility of online courts for lower value disputes.   Civil Resolution Tribunal in British Colum bia  35. In 2012, the British Columbia government passed the Civil Resolution Tribunal Act,  “with the goal of using technology and ADR to increase access to justice for British  Columbians with small claims and condominium property disputes.”17      36. The Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) is Canada’s first online tribunal, and currently the  only ODR system in the world that is fully integrated into the justice system. The CRT allows  the public to resolve their condominium property disputes fairly, quickly, and affo rdably. In  the near future, the CRT will also be able to resolve small claims disputes in the same  manner. The CRT provides the public with access to interactive information pathways, tools,  and in a tiered structure,  a variety of dispute resolution method s including negotiation,  facilitation and, if necessary, adjudication.18    37. The CRT works in the following way19:    i. Before beginning a claim with the CRT, a person with a dispute can access a free  online tool called the Solution Explorer, which uses guided pathways to help a person  learn more about their dispute so that they can make informed choices about how to  resolve it. The Solution Explorer asks a series of questions about the dispute, and  then provides information and resources tailored to that disput e… At the end of the  pathway, the Solution Explorer provides a summary of the person’s claims, as well as  recommended resources and next steps.     ii. If someone is not able to resolve their dispute using the Solution Explorer, the next  step is to start a CRT cl aim, using the online intake process. A key design feature of  the CRT is that wherever possible, a user should only have to enter information once,  and the system should carry this information forward to other stages of the CRT                                                              17 Shan non Salter, ‘ODR and Justice System Integration: B.C.’s Civil Resolution Tribunal’ (2017)  at pg. 8.   18 Shannon Salter, ‘ODR and Justice System Integration: B.C.’s Civil Resolution Tribunal’ (2017) at pg.  3.

Finally, the CRT pr ocess incorporates relevant parts of the tribunal’s rules  on an as -needed, when -needed basis, to avoid overwhelming parties with  inapplicable  (not-yet applicable)  rules.     iii. After serving the others in the dispute with notice of the claim, the parties have a brief  opportunity to negotiate directly with each other. While the parties will be given some  resources to help them do this, this is a low intervention area for the CRT.     iv. If negotiation is not successful, the parties will enter a facilitation phase where an  expert facilitator will help the participants to reach a consensual agreement. The  facilitator can use a variety of communications channels to work with the parties,  including the CRT platform, email, text, phone, video conferencing, fax and mail.  Despi te being online, the CRT is a very human driven process. Leveraging  technology, the CRT democratizes access to dispute resolution services by  connecting the public, wherever they may live, with expert facilitators and tribunal  members. Settlement communica tions in the facilitation phase are confidential, and  are not disclosed to tribunal members. If the parties reach an agreement, the  facilitator can ask a tribunal member to convert the agreement into a binding order of  the tribunal, which can be enforced i n court, without the parties having to sue for a  breach of the agreement.     v. If no settlement is reached, “the dispute is then transferred to a tribunal member, a  lawyer with specialized expertise in small claims or condominium property matters,  who hears th e parties’ arguments (usually in written form), considers the evidence,  and then issues a binding decision of the tribunal, which is emailed or mailed to the  parties. If an oral hearing is necessary, due to credibility issues for example, this is  conducted  though telephone and video -conferencing. The CRT’s adjudicative  process is very similar to that of other large administrative tribunals, and of course,  tribunal members are subject to the same procedural fairness requirements which  govern administrative t ribunals generally.20    38. From beginning to end, the CRT process is intended to take 60 to 90 days for most  cases, and the average total cost to the parties is roughly the same as in Small Claims  Court, or about $200.21    ODR AND ACCESS TO JUSTICE (ARTICLE 6 AND  13)    39. This part of the Report describes the requirements of the right to a fair trial set out in  Article 6 (1) of the European Convention on Human Rights and ODR’s compatibility with  these requirements. In particular, this part of the Report considers requ irements that are  relevant to ODR; requirements that could be enhanced or impeded through the use of ODR  to resolve commercial disputes.     40. As has been noted above, ODR has the ability to revolutionise the public justice  system. If designed and implemented c orrectly, it has the ability to drastically enhance                                                              20 Shannon Salter, ‘ODR and Justice System Integration: B.C.’s Civil Resolution Tribunal’ (2017) at pg.  13.  21 Shannon Salter, ‘ODR and J ustice System Integration: B.C.’s Civil Resolution Tribunal’ (2017) at pg.  13. 
CDCJ(2018) 5  47 access to justice for persons who would ordinarily be outcasts in the justice system.  However, if developed in the wrong hands it may have an opposite effect and actually  reduce access to justice by placi ng technological barriers to persons who do not ordinarily  have the capacity to use technology.     41. If ODR is the future of justice, which it seems is the case, then it is of fundamental  importance to develop standards for ODR; standards by which ODR can be d eveloped and  implemented and under which justice can be carried out. To ensure that disputes are  resolved fairly, there is a need to develop appropriate and adequate standards.      42. Article 6 (1) of the ECHR states:   “In the determination of his civil rights  and obligations (…) everyone is entitled to a  fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial  tribunal established by law. Judgment shall be pronounced publicly but the press  and public may be excluded from all or part of the trial in the interests of morals,  public order or national security in a democratic society, where the interests of  juveniles or the protection of the private life of the parties so require, or to the extent  strictly necessary in the opinion of the cou rt in special circumstances where  publicity would prejudice the interests of justice .”  43. Article 13 of the ECHR states:   “Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated  shall have an effective remedy before a national authori ty notwithstanding that the  violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”   44. From the wording of these Articles, the following requirements for a fair trial are  evident:      Fair hearing    Public hearing    Within a reasonable time    Heard by  an independent and impartial tribunal established by law    Judgment pronounced publicly, with some justifiable exceptions    The right to effective recourse for a violation of this right and other rights in the  Convention.     45. These requirements are expressly sta ted. As will be seen further on in this section of  the report, there are additional requirements that are implied in Article 6(1) and which give  effect to these requirements.     46. Each one of the expressed requirements, as well as the implied principles which  give  effect to the right to a fair trial will be discussed below. These requirements are discussed  and analysed in light of ODR, and in -depth analysis and discussion is given to requirements  that are (or may become) relevant to ODR.     47. The right to a fair t rial cannot be waived for processes which the parties have not  agreed to, including formal processes in the courts which by their nature are coercive and  not consensual and which lead to binding decisions with res judicata effect.    
CDCJ(2018) 5  48 48. One view to approaching  the issue of compulsory ODR is what McGregor calls the  ‘substantive distinction test’. This essentially states that if disputes must be resolved through  alternative means, there may be a need to differentiate between different types of disputes,  with some  disputes, due to their nature, not being capable of being resolved through  alternative means. For mandatory engagement with both agreement -based and adjudicative  ADR and ODR (binding and non -binding), a second approach of the ECtHR could be read  as prohib iting formal diversion to ADR and ODR based on the subject matter of the  dispute22.Therefore, some disputes due to their subject matter may not be capable of being  resolved through alternative means. They would have to go through the traditional court  proce sses.     49. It is apparent that the requirements of Article 6 do apply,  in one way or another to  binding alternative dispute resolution and that they would most certainly apply to binding  ODR mechanisms. The extent to which ODR mechanisms should comply with the  requirements of Article 6(1) is rather unclear. There would certa inly be a higher standard  expected for compulsory ODR mechanisms, including in the courts, and arguably such  compulsory ODR mechanisms should comply fully with the requirements of Article 6(1).  What is important to note is that the right to a fair trial is  not an absolute right; exceptions do  exist and depending on the circumstances of the case and the type of dispute, certain  elements of the right may be relaxed. For example the ECtHR has previously accepted that  the initial decision -making body does not h ave to conform to the requirements of Article 6(1)  of the ECHR provided the applicant has the possibility of appealing the decision to a court of  law.    50. This is important in the context of court -annexed ADR, although in our survey of the  Council of Europe M ember States we have not found any examples of compulsory  ADR/ODR.     THE CONTENT OF THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL: ARTICLE 6   51. The most important judgment of the ECrtHR in relation to the civil aspect of Article 6  stems from the Golder v. United Kingdom  case, as it defined the significance of the right.23    52. The Golder  decision essentially set out the basic requirements of Article 6(1) and  provided an interpretation of the article, which has proved influential to this day. In deciding  whether an individual has had a fair trial, it is necessary to examine the proceedings in light  of the other three main elements of Article 6(1). These elements are: (i) the right to a public  hearing, (ii) the right to a trial within reasonable time, and (iii) the right to an i ndependent and  impartial tribunal established by law. Certainly, the realisation of each of these elements is  fundamental to ensuring that right to a fair trial has been achieved.24     53. In addition to these explicitly stated requirements of the right to a fai r trial, there are  also fundamental principles that are implied into the fairness requirement. These include the                                                              22 Pg. 625 -626.   23 Schiavetta, ‘The Relationship Between e -ADR and Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights  pursuant to the Case Law of the European Court of Human Rig hts’, (2004) 1 The Journal of Information, Law  and Technology  at para 3.2 .  24 Para 3.4  
CDCJ(2018) 5  49 right of access to court, equality of arms, transparency, duty to give reasons, the right to be  given notice, prepare a case and to argue it.     54. To realise these elements of a fair trial, it is quite obviously essential that persons  have the right of access to court, for without access to justice there cannot be justice. This  principle will be discussed first.     55. The essence of Article 6 (1) is the right of effective access to a court. This right must  not only be theoretical but also effective in practice25. A private dispute resolution procedure  which is binding with res judicata effect does bar the disputants’ access to a court. But as  has been outl ined above, if the arbitration is voluntary in the sense that it is based on a  contract voluntarily entered then this counts as a waiver of the right to access. If the  arbitration is compulsory, then this means that the procedure must fully comply with Art icle 6  or be subject to review by a court.     56. A fair hearing in the courts must be guided by the “equality of arms” principle, giving  each party an equal opportunity to present his/her own case and respond to the case of the  other.     57. Technology may impact th is principle in both negative and positive ways.     58. For example an assumption is normally made that technology speeds up processes  (which is true), but little regard is given the fact that technology also increases information  overload (which slows down inf ormation processing) - so for example shortened and  inflexible deadlines for filing statements or evidence can affect the ability of a party to have a  fair hearing (where for example a micro -business litigates against a much larger business)   and the sole di rector cannot cope with short deadlines .    59. Furthermore,  it is often the assumptions we make about technology (rather than the  technology itself) which may have an impact on a fair hearing. So the assumption for  example will be that technology always works ( not accounting for technical glitches or  downtime) which may prejudice a party in filing their case.     60. A different aspect is the question of open, public hearings (where virtual hearings in  the courts replace a court hearing), which is essentially a questi on of transparency. This is  not a real problem as a platform may in fact allow access to virtual hearings and information  in a controlled manner without the observers having to physically go to a courtroom. This is  more a question of designing technology i n a particular way.  Thus digital courts may be open  courts.     61. Moreover, ODR can have various implications for the right of access to court (or  access to justice). There are both advantages and disadvantages for how ODR may impact  the right of access to court for parties involved in a dispute.                                                                  25 Airey v Ireland (App. 6289/730) Decision of 9. October 1979.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  50 62. The use of online courts has the ability revolutionise access to justice for litigants.  The development of new procedures to resolve disputes online can revolutionise access to  justice to persons who would usually  be unable to understand court procedures without  hiring a lawyer.26 The use of ODR could level the playing field of parties who would ordinarily  find it hard to access courts. It could improve the justice system to make it more accessible  for those who liv e far from legal centres or who struggle to afford the costs of seeking  justice,27 by providing cheaper, alternative means to resolving disputes.     63. ODR processes may be able to facilitate access to justice in that, if designed and  developed correctly, ODR s ystems can be economically viable, efficient, fast and flexible.28  This is quite an obvious characteristic of online systems. Using technology and the internet  can allow litigants to access information about how to lay a claim, submit a claim and inform  them of the process of how to go about resolving their dispute.  In fact, ODR may structure  the process itself for litigants.  It also means that this process can be done just about  anywhere with internet access, making the process convenient and easy for litigants. This is  a massive improvement of access to justice for litigants.   Disadvantages   64. An issue with ODR and access to ju stice is that those who are computer illiterate or  have no access to technology might be side -lined in the process. Increased high internet  access reflects social and generational change of how people now lead their lives, but what  of the vulnerable users and those without access?29 Requiring parties to use technology to  resolve disputes could inhibit access to justice if there is a great discrepancy between the  parties and their access to technology.30 The move to online and virtual justice also  threatens to  significantly increase the number of unrepresented defendants, to further  discriminate against vulnerable defendants, to inhibit the relationship between defence  lawyers and their clients, and , as some argue,  make justice less open.31    65. Given the discussion  about advantages and disadvantages above, it is important to  note that parties must always have the right of access to justice. Although ADR is  permissible and parties are allowed to waive their right to access a court, when certain  means of resolving a d ispute become compulsory, it must be guaranteed that such means  give the parties the right to access justice. Thus, if ODR is implemented into the court  system or used in a compulsory ADR process, the right of the parties to access justice  cannot be violat ed.    66. As noted above, one of the disadvantages of ODR and access to court is the issue of  the digital divide , further discussed below . If some litigants do not have access to, or the  ability to use, technology and the internet, these litigants will be exclu ded from the  administration of justice. Therefore, if ODR is implemented, there should  (a) either  be an  alternative paper -based traditional means of having a dispute resolved for parties who do not  have this access to technology and the internet  or (b) a c omprehensive system of legal                                                              26 J Rozenberg QC, ‘Justice Online: Just as Good?’ (2017).   27 L Tickle, The Guardian, ‘Online Justice: why co urts should explore emerging digital possibilities (2017).   28 Ziemblicki, B (2016) ‘Going Online – is the world ready to replace litigation with online dispute resolution  mechanisms?’  at pg. 43.   29 Robert Thomas, ‘Current Developments in UK Tribunals: Challe nges for Administrative Justice’ (2016).   30 O Bowcott, The Guardian, ‘Government’s £1bn plan for online courts ‘challenges open justice’ (2017).   31 O Bowcott, The Guardian, ‘Government’s £1bn plan for online courts ‘challenges open justice’ (2017).  
CDCJ(2018) 5  51 representation made affordable (for example through legal aid) . The issue of the digital  divide will be discussed further on in this report.     INDEPENDENCE AND IMPARTIALITY     67. Article 6(1) of the ECHR explicitly states that the co urt and/or tribunal must be  independent and impartial. The tribunal and the decision maker must be both independent  (no undisclosed conflict of interest) and impartial (not subjectively biased).     68. The term “independence” refers to the independence of the d ecision -maker vis -á-vis  the other powers (the executive and the legislature) and also vis -á-vis the parties.  In  assessing independence regard should be had to the following criteria: (i) the manner of  appointment of the members; the duration of their term  of office; (iii) the existence of  guarantees against outside pressures; and (iv) whether the body presents an appearance of  independence.     69. This requirement is as important for ODR processes as it is for other dispute  resolution processes. In fact, it is e ven more important for ODR processes as such  processes may entail a process where the adjudicator is unknown or not physically present  and trust issues may arise as a consequence . Therefore, neither the third party neutral nor  the ODR institution must have  an interest in the outcome of the case. One potential issue to  be examined here  in relation to ADR/out -of-court processes  is whether systemic bias is  introduced if one of the parties (for example the business in B2C e -commerce disputes)  always pays for th e dispute resolution procedure. Similar questions arise where ODR is  undertaken by an e -commerce platform/marketplace/social media provider: to what extent  do these internet service providers have an interest in the outcome of the case?     70. In relation to ODR  used i n the courts the question of independence and impartiality  as such is no different than for offline courts. However where the question may arise is in  relation to the use of artificial intelligence to replace human decision -making. Additionally,  other serious concerns include how algorithms are coded, if they are used in an ODR  process, and whether this may impact a decision that is reached and therefore impair the  independence and impartiality of the decision -maker. This will be discussed further be low  (under artificial intelligence) .     71. Another area where the independence and impartiality of the courts may be affected  is the area of data protection. Many commercial, “free” online services  (such as social media  networks) rely on the collection of personal data from their users and commercially exploit  this data through online tracking and profiling - this data is then aggregated and sold to third  party entities for marketing and potentially for more sinister purposes (such as differential  pricing, risk management). These tracking activities have potentially serious impacts on  users’ personal freedom and autonomy and may lead to prejudice and discrimination (for  example in the area of credit r ating or insurability or provision of public services).     72. As court are being digitalised and are going online there may be (in certain countries)  a temptation to outsource the technology and to save money by using “free” commercial  applications , who then, i n return collect court users’ personal data for online profiling  purposes. We have not seen this as part of our research for this study and as far as we are 
CDCJ(2018) 5  52 aware, the ODR communication and data processing technologies developed by the courts  to date are n ot based on commercial tracking. However in times of decreasing public  budgets and increased pressure on government departments to save money, this topic is not  entirely irrelevant.     73. An argument of some experts within the field of ODR is that organisations  that  develop ODR systems may have an ulterior motive for developing such systems and  processes: access to valuable information which can be used and sold. This may have an  impact on the way in which ODR systems are designed and there may be undue influenc e  placed on the administrators of the ODR system to retrieve such information at the expense  of the distribution of justice. This concern about organisations that develop ODR processes  may violate the criteria of ‘the existence of guarantees against outsid e pressures’. If there is  outside pressure to have a dispute resolved in a particular way in order to retrieve certain  information or have a particular outcome, this could certainly violate the right to a fair trial.     74. There is therefore most certainly a n eed for not only ensuring that the ODR system  has an appearance of independence, but that it is guaranteed not to be subject to outside  pressures.     PROCEDURAL FAIRNESS / EQUALITY OF ARMS     75. The principle of equality of arms32 requires a fair balance between b oth parties.33  However, this does not mean that all pre -existing inequalities of the parties (for example in  terms of resources to litigate) must be compensated for. So, for example a party who has no  resources who is sued by a party with substantial wealth  need not be brought to the same  level of resource by the provision of legal aid.34 At the same time if legal aid is necessary to  help a party to achieve effective participation and general equality of arms to defend their  freedom of expression right then a  Member State has an obligation to grant legal aid and  ensure effective representation of that party.35 The ECtHR has held that it is central to the  concept of a fair trial that a litigant should not be denied the opportunity to present his or her  case effe ctively and should enjoy equality of arms with the opposing side.36 The institution of  a legal aid scheme was one way of guaranteeing those rights.37 In the context of ODR there  may be less of a need for representation - but this again will depend on the com plexity of the  dispute and the need for expert legal advice and representation.  Furthermore, as will be  discussed further below, the speed of technological innovation means that differential access  to and penetration of technology exists between different parties, different age groups and  small and large firms of lawyers (with the latter more prepared to innovate, having the  resources to buy in the latest technology and train their employees to implement and use it).     76. For ODR systems that are used as an int egral part of resolving a dispute, i.e. ODR  going beyond  mere e -filing and data boxes , there is a genuine risk that the use of ODR                                                              32 Neumeister v Austria (1979 -80) 1 EHRR 91 .  33 B Rainey et al, Jacobs White & Ovey The European Convention on Human Rights (6th Edition OUP 2014) 263 .  34 Steel and Morris v UK (2005) 41 EHRR 403 para 62 .  35 Ibid para 59; Dombo Beheer BV v the Netherlands  (1994)  18 EHRR 213.   36 Ibid.   37 Ibid.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  53 processes may create major issues for this principle. Along similar lines to the argument  regarding access to (and the skills  to use technology) under the section dealing with access  to courts, if litigants do not have access to, or the ability to use technology, whereas other  litigants to the same dispute do, then there would most probably be a violation of the  principle of equ ality of arms and therefore a breach of the right to a fair trial. At the same  time this risk can be managed if there is investment in training and public access points for  litigants who do not have the requisite skills.     77. Equal treatment of the parties is regarded as one of the major principles of  successful ODR.38 Without this principle, ODR cannot addressed the concerns of fairness.  Those with access to the relevant technology (and the skills to use it) which is used in  resolving the dispute would quite ob viously be at a massive advantage in having the dispute  resolved in their favour, at the expense of the parties who do not have such access and  skills.     78. One author argues that the move to online and virtual justice threatens to significantly  increase the n umber of unrepresented defendants, to further discriminate against vulnerable  defendants, to inhibit the relationship between defence lawyers and their clients, and to  make justice less open.39 This is most certainly a point that deserves attention. If tech nology  is used (or allowed to be used) in a way that does not address concerns relating to access to  justice and fairness, then those persons who are in a vulnerable position and who have less  access to resources could be even more prejudiced than they alr eady are, at the hands of  technology.     79. Litigants who are unable to use or access the relevant technology to use an ODR  process would most certainly be placed into a different position to another party who does  have access and the ability to use the techno logy. The question is whether it amounts to  complete inequality between the parties. If no alternative means to resolve the dispute exist  (i.e. all disputes must be resolved online and no traditional paper based methods are used)  then there would most cert ainly be discrimination between the parties. However, if  alternative means do exist, such as in the British Columbia CRT, then it is arguable that this  would suffice and that there would be equality of arms.  However there are concerns for  example in Englan d & wales, that in order to finance the digitalization of the courts, many  court buildings will have to be closed, meaning that those who still want to use the (physical)  courts have to commute further and further in order to do so.40    80. A question does remai n about whether, even if alternative means do exist, there is  equality of arms between the parties? What if the use of technology by the one party places  it into a superior position to that of the litigant who is not using the technology? The EctHR  has bee n clear that: (i) equality of arms does not mean that all pre -existing inequalities of the  parties must be compensated for; and (ii) what is required is for there to be a general   equality of arms to ensure that both parties have the opportunity to effectiv ely participate in  advancing or defending their respective case. Thus, there does not need to be exact  equality, and pre -existing equalities do not need to be compensated for. Therefore, the fact  that one party either does not have access to or the ability  to use technology should not be                                                              38 Ziemblicki, B (2016) ‘Going Online – is the world ready to replace litigation with online dispute resolution  mechanisms?’  at pg. 43.   39 O Bowcott, The Guardian, ‘Government’s £1bn plan for online courts ‘challenges open justi ce’ (2017).   40 https://law -tech -a2j.org/odr/online -courts -in-england -and-wales -six-proposals -to-see-of-a-gathering -storm/   
CDCJ(2018) 5  54 considered a pre -existing inequality that requirements accommodation. Rather, effort does  need to be made to ensure that the more vulnerable party does have some opportunity to  make or defend his/her case, but it does appea r to be acceptable that there is not perfect  equality of arms.     ADVERSARIAL PROCESS AND DISCLOSURE OF EVIDENCE     81. One of the elements of the right to a fair trial requires that the party concerned is  given notice in good time of the claim brought against him/her. This party should have  enough time to peruse the relevant claim and have a chance to respond to the allegations. If  left unchallenged, the decision -maker may make an adverse finding against the party.  Essentially, each party must be given a fair a nd equal opportunity to argue his or her case as  to both matters of fact and law and each party should have a right to react to and rebut the  submissions of the other party.  Evidence and relevant material must be disclosed to both  parties  in an accessible  and adequate way so that they can obtain informed notice of the  case, and the arguments against them .     82. Fairness, however is a flexible principle and the precise meaning must be  ascertained on a case -by-case basis. Whether proceedings are fair can only be  adjudged by  looking at the proceedings as a whole.  The detailed requirements vary according to the  nature of the tribunal and the court’s appraisal of what is appropriate in the circumstances. 41    83. Under the Convention jurisprudence some procedural rights are regarded as  absolute whereas others can be limited or qualified to a certain extent dependent on the  particular facts of the case at issue.     84. Under the common law, the right to a fair hearing does not necessarily mean that it  involves a right to make r epresentations orally and in person, hence the parties may be  limited to written submissions.  Under the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human  Rights, the right to a hearing requires an oral hearing, certainly in proceedings of first or only  instanc e.42     85. There is some case law from the European Court of Human Rights that suggests that  there are exceptions to the requirement to be afforded an oral hearing. This appears to only  be permitted in exceptional circumstances.43  The exceptional character of the  circumstances that may justify dispensing with an oral hearing essentially comes down to the  nature of the issues to be decided by the competent national court.44 Accordingly, unless  there are exceptional circumstances tha t justify dispensing with a hearing, the right to a  public hearing under Article 6(1) implies a right to an oral hearing at least before one  instance.45                                                              41 See J.

CDCJ(2018) 5  55   86. It does appear that at some stage of this process you must have the opportunity to  have an oral hearing . Thus, for compulsory ODR, there must be the opportunity to appeal  the ODR decision which must be oral. Or, the ODR processes must have an oral element to  it. This raises the interesting question of whether “oral” hearing is to be equated with “face to-face” hearing? While there is no direct authority on this it would make sense to argue that  video -conferencing where the communicators can hear and see each other in real time (and  where provision is made that, for example witnesses are not coached from behi nd the  screen and that witnesses’ identity is properly authenticated) is functionally equivalent to an  “oral” hearing (provided the technology works on both ends of the transmission and this can  be protocolled).     TRANSPARENCY: PUBLIC HEARINGS AND PUBLIC JU DGMENTS     87. The right to a fair trial in Article 6 (1) requires that court hearings are public and that  the judgments/decisions are made available to the public (subject to exceptions).46   Transparency and publicity are important for three reasons (1) to ensur e informational  equality between the parties, (2) to ensure decisions can be scrutinized and (3) to guide the  development of the law.47     88. ADR (both the hearing and award) as a private form of dispute resolution are  normally treated as confidential and the p arties may have waived their right to a public  hearing. This was recognized in the case of Nordström -Janzen v Netherlands.48     89. “Civil proceedings on the merits which are conducted in private in accordance with a  general and absolute principle, without the l itigant being able to request a public hearing on  the ground that his case presents special features, cannot in principle be regarded as  compatible with Article 6 § 1 of the Convention; other than in wholly exceptional  circumstances, litigants must at leas t have the opportunity of requesting a public hearing,  though the court may refuse the request and hold the hearing in private on account of the  circumstances of the case and for pertinent reasons.”49    90. “The Court reiterates that the public character of proc eedings before the judicial  bodies referred to in Article 6 § 1 protects litigants against the administration of justice in  secret with no public scrutiny; it is also one of the means whereby confidence in the courts,  superior and inferior, can be maintain ed.”50 “By rendering the administration of justice visible,  publicity contributes to the achievement of the aim of Article 6 § 1, namely a fair trial, the  guarantee of which is one of the fundamental principles of any democratic society, within the  meaning of the Convention.”51                                                              46 Werner v Austria  (1998) 26 EHRR 310,349 ; Scarth v UK (1999) 27 E.H.R.R.

CDCJ(2018) 5  56 91. “Moreover, the Court has held that exceptional circumstances relating to the nature  of the issues to be decided by the court in the proceedings concerned (see, mutatis  mutandis, Miller v. Sweden , no. 55853/00, § 29, 8 February 2005) may justify dispensing  with a public hearing (see, in particular, Göç v. Turkey  [GC], no. 36590/97, § 47, ECHR 2002 ‑V). It thus considers, in particular, that social security proceedings, which are highly  technical, a re often better dealt with in writing than in oral submissions, and that, as  systematically holding hearings may be an obstacle to the particular diligence required in  social security cases, it is understandable that in this sphere the national authorities  should  have regard to the demands of efficiency and economy (see, fo r example, Miller and  Schuler -Zraggen, cited above). It should be pointed out, however, that in the majority of  cases concerning proceedings before “civil” courts ruling on the merits in which it has arrived  at that conclusion the applicant had had the opportunity of requesting a public hearing.”52    92. The transparency of court proceedings is of fundamental importance to a public  hearing. Thus, any ODR process must comply with this transparency requirement to fully  comply with the right to a fair trial. In fact, some authors argue that one of the disadvantages  of ODR is that there are various transparency concerns.53 For ODR to be compatible with the  right to a public hearing, which e ncompasses a requirement of transparency, the ODR  process must embody some form of transparency in its process. Parties who are party to the  ODR process would want to be sure that they are dealing with a trustworthy institution that is  independent (as rega rds to politics, race, gender, etc.).54    93. Transparency could pertain to a wide variety of things and is a rather broad concept.  Trust in a justice system is vital to its legitimacy and success.55 If the public cannot scrutinise  cases and decisions that are ma de, then there may no public approval of the justice system,  which leads to it illegitimacy and failure.     94. Transparency of proceedings also feeds trust through in -person interaction.56 Trust is  a major issue that deserves consideration in assessing ODR proce sses.57 In-person  interactions have been seen as necessary, or at least better than electronic communication,  for building trust between litigants, law enforcement, and the court.58 Non-verbal cues, such  as facial expressions and tone of voice, are important  to both a litigant’s perception of the  fairness of proceedings and a judge’s decision -making process.59 The absence of such face to-face interactions from existing versions of online case resolution systems may cause a  litigant to perceive a particular jud icial process as unfair or produce negative emotional  feelings toward court officials, as compared to traditional, in -person court proceedings.60                                                                 52 Martinie v.

CDCJ(2018) 5  57 95. Moreover, in  order for a process to satisfy the requirement of a public hearing, that  there should be transpa rency of procedural rules  and outcomes .61 Thus, the parties should  be aware and have the ability to access information pertaining to the rules of procedure for  resolving a dispute online. This is similar to how current procedural rules are transparent –  any party to a dispute can access the procedural rul es of a court . Importantly, and in addition  to the transparency of rules , the outcomes of the proceedings should be transparent. At the  very least this could mean that the result must be made transparent to the parties. This  suggestion of the outcome being transparent is at odds with traditional ADR practices,  wherein confidentiality of the proceedings is often a fundamental foundation of an ADR  process.     96. It was held in the case of Nordström -Janzen v Netherl ands  that the parties to an ADR  process may waive their right to a public hearing, and thus treat the proceedings as  confidential.62 Thus, if an ODR process is conducted in a way similar to ADR, in that the  parties enter an agreement to refer their dispute to ADR and in doing so waive their right to a  public hearing, this would be permissible in terms of the jurisprudence of the ECtHR.  However, it must be pointed out that this is a form of voluntary reference to ODR. If the  parties were obliged to refer thei r dispute to ODR, as a compulsory means of resolving their  dispute, then it is submitted that this would be impermissible with the right to a public  hearing. A compulsory reference of a dispute to ODR would require that there be some form  of transparency.     97. As noted above, public hearings allow for public scrutiny of judicial decisions and  proceedings. Making proceedings transparent in this way is a form of accountability that  enhances fairness. Thus, as has been held by the ECtHR, if a party is denied acces s to a  public hearing, Article 6 of the ECHR will be violated.63     98. Thus, it is apparent that the ECtHR requires there to be some form of publicity which  allows for public scrutiny of any court proceedings, with the additional requirement of having  the decis ion made public. Therefore, any ODR proceeding must ensure that there is this  degree of transparency involved.     99. In particular, if hearings were conducted entirely online in a fully digitalized court it  would be important that the public can access the hea ring- subject to specific exceptions,  court hearings must be open to members of the public (in the sense that members of the  public can follow proceedings from a public gallery in the court building. Functionally  equivalent access would have to be provided  technically in a fully online court, allowing  interested members of the public to follow the course of proceedings.     100. An interesting question here is a question of numbers. Traditionally members of the  public have been granted physical access to the court building, but many countries in the EU  do not allow public broadcasting of trials on TV for the reason that this may influence  advocates and judges who then ”play” to populist sentiments of crowd watching which may                                                              61 Ziemblicki, B (2016) ‘Going Online – is the world ready to replace litigation with online dispute resolution  mechanisms?’  at pg. 43.   62 Nordström -Janzen v Netherlands  Admissibility (App. 28101/95) Decision of 2 7.

CDCJ(2018) 5  58 not lead to better justice. Clearly if th ere is online access to “court channels” (for example on  Youtube) then a similar effect may arise.     EFFECTIVENESS AND ENFORCEMENT OF ODR   101. Connected to the principle of effective access to the court is the principle that a final  court decision should be enf orced. 64 Article 6(1) applies to all stages of legal proceedings  regarding the determination of civil rights and obligations and thus the execution of a  judgment given by any court must be regarded as an integral part of a trail for the purposes  of Article 6.65 Every litigant has a right to enforcement of a judgment, and a delay in the  execution of a judgment must never be such that it impairs the litigant’s right to  enforcement.66    102. It is interesting to note in this context that few Council of Europe States at presen t  use ODR to make the enforcement of court decisions more effective (with some notable  exceptions).     THE DUTY TO GIVE A REASONED DECISION     103. The right to a fair trial under Article 6 (1) includes a duty to give reasons by a court,  as an element of the fairness requirement.67 A justification for this requirement is that a  reasoned decision shows the parties that their case has truly been heard.68 A domestic court  is obliged to justify its decision by giving reasons.69 This ties in with the requirement that  decisions and reasons should be published and accessible. In the context of ODR, the  digitalisation of court proceedings makes decisions more accessible and is likely to improve  court reporting, as court records are digitalized to start with and digital re cords in databases  can be more easily accessed, searched and analysed through the use of artificial  intelligence tools (as one of the state experts has pointed out in the answers to the  questionnaire).     104. The extent of the duty to give reasons depend on the nature of the decision and the  decision -maker.70 In determining the reasons, it is necessary for the court to take into  account the diversity of the submissions that a litigant brings before court and the differences  that may exists in the Contracting State s with regard to statutory provisions, customary rules,                                                              64 B Rainey et al, Jacobs White & Ovey The European Convention on Human Rights (6th Edition OUP 20 14) 262 .  65 European Court of Human Rights, Guide on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (2013) ;  Hornsby v.

CDCJ(2018) 5  59 legal opinion and the presentation and drafting of judgments.71 Where a party’s submission  is decisive for the outcome of the proceedings, it requires a specific and express reply.72    105. It is thus apparen t that with regard to mandatory ODR the decision -maker will be  obliged to give reasons for the decision in order for the process to comply with the right to a  fair trial. The extent of the reasons will depend on the circumstances of the case, but at the  very least the parties’ submission that are decisive for the outcome of the proceedings  should be addressed and the parties should reasonably feel that their case has truly been  heard.     106. With regard to voluntary ODR, it would be advisable for a reasoned decis ion to be  given, but if reasons were not given for a decision because the parties agreed that this need  not be the case, then the decision -maker would not be obliged to give reasons.     THE RIGHT TO AN APPEAL AND/OR REVIEW     107. The relevance of a right to appea l is that, in addition to the duty to give reasons and  transparency discussed above, an appeal helps to eliminate bad judgments and mistakes  occurring at first instance and thereby contributes to a fair outcome , and it also leads to  accountability of the d ecision -maker .     108. The right to a fair trial must be interpreted in the light of the rule of law, which  requires, in terms of the principle of legal certainty, that where courts have finally determined  an issue their ruling should not be called into question .73 A final decision may only be called  into question when this is necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling  character such as a judicial error.74    109. Appeals lead to an increase in cost and add further significant delay. It should  therefore be  used sparingly and in the most exceptional of cases.     110. In the context of ODR appeals and reviews may take on a more important  characteristic. It has been stated that a litigant must have the right to be heard, i.e. to make  oral representations at some poin t during proceedings. This does not necessarily need to be  at the court of first instance. Thus, if ODR proceedings are conducted in a manner in which  there is no oral hearing, this may be permissible provided that the litigants have the right to  have an o ral hearing at a later stage if so required. This oral hearing may take the form of a  review or an appeal of the decision. In this light, such ODR mechanisms must be subject to  a review or appeal, depending on the circumstances.                                                                 71 European Court of Human Rights, Guide on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (2013) ;  Ruiz Torija v. Spain , § 29; Hiro Balani v. Spain , § 27.   72 European Court of Human Rights, Guide on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (2013);  Ruiz Torija v. Spain, § 29 ; Hiro Balani v.

Ukraine , § 148.   74 European Court of Human Rights, Guide on Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights (2013);   Ryabykh v. Russia , § 52 . 
CDCJ(2018) 5  60 111. If and ODR mechanism encom passes an oral hearing and otherwise fully complies  with the right to a fair trial, then the proceedings should be subject to the same appeal and  review considerations as any other matter. I.e., a final decision may only be called into  question when this i s necessary by circumstances of a substantial and compelling character  such as a judicial error.     112. The introduction of ODR and digitalization of courts means that court procedures  may build in several tiers into the process, where only at the last tier there is an adjudication  with an oral hearing of the parties. This would correspond to the pyramid mod el of dispute  resolution which integrates legal advice (the parties informing themselves about their legal  rights and their legal position) , negotiation and conflict resolution techniques (restorative  justice), facilitated negotiation and mediation, and ad judication (potentially several stages,  including the possibility of review and appeal). These tiers of processes could take place all  within the same digital ODR system as part of the court system with the relevant data being  moved from one state to the n ext as appropriate. The idea behind this tiered model of  dispute resolution is that most disputes are solved at the lower levels, thus being cost effective while at the same time giving more disputants access to justice. Thus ODR could  also mean a reorgani sation of traditional court processes by integrating processes which  currently take place outside the court system, provided by private entities (legal advice,  ADR).75    DATA PROTECTION / PRIVACY /  INFORMATIONECURITY  / CYBERSECURITY     113. A detailed discussion of  data protection law and its application to civil and  administrative justice systems is beyond the remit of this research. Instead we only point to  some pertinent issues of ODR, civil and administrative justice and data protection.  Differences exist betwee n the degree of ano nymiz ation of court reporting in the different  Council of Europe Member States and the degree to which the court record is publicly  accessible  and to what extent one litigant can prevent the reporting of court cases .76     114. Data protection law in the EU provides for the lawfulness of processing of personal  data where “processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public  interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller” .77 Thus in a nutshell,  provided the processing of personal data is necessary (not excessive, proportionality test)  for providing justice to litigants and running a justice system  it is lawful under data protection  law.78     115. Generally speaking, like in other areas  of digitization, ODR may have a negative  impact on data protection and privacy in that online justice is likely to generate a much                                                              75 J. Hornle “Encouraging Online Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in the EU and Beyond ” (2013) 38 (2)  European Law Review 187-208 discusses this in relation to ADR, but the same principles hold true for ODR in  the courts.   76 In England & Wales see the dis cussion surrounding the topic of super -injunctions and anonymity orders:   77 Art 6 (1) (e) EU General Data Protection Regulation  2016/679, effective 25. May 2018 in the Member States  of the EU   78 To the extent that the data processing falls outside the scope  of EU law there may also be an argument that  data protection law is not applicable see Art 2  
CDCJ(2018) 5  61 greater wealth of data (including metadata, for example who accessed a particular court  record when and from where), increas es the possibilities of data processing, searching, data  mining and the use of artificial intelligence (which is the other side of the coin of increased  access to justice) and online data (including court data) may be more mobile (easy online  transfer), st icky (in the sense that data remains on storage devices until erased) and  vulnerable to unauthorised, remote access (computer hacking from anywhere in the world).     116. These risks which are a concomitant risk of ODR should be counter -balanced by  data protecti on & privacy training of court officials, clear data protection laws, data protection  policies and guidelines on a “need to know” basis, implementation of the “privacy by design”  principles in new ODR/court technologies, data protection & privacy audits an d criminal laws  (on computer misuse) and their effective enforcement.     117. One specific data protection issue already mentioned above (under 12.) would arise  if private companies who provide ODR systems (for example software systems or storage  capacities in t he cloud) collect court user data and exploit this data through online tracking  and online profiling activities.     118. Furthermore as far as cybersecurity is concerned, digitalised courts are not only  vulnerable to hacking (data protection & privacy implication s) but also vulnerable to other  forms of malicious attack, affecting the integrity of data and the functioning of the justice  system (one only needs to remember the large -scale Ransomware Wannacry attack of last  year as an example of the impact79). Such att acks are of course not limited to indivi dual and  organised criminality but are also perpetrated by states as a form of cyberwarfare. This is a  real risk, which the courts would also be more vulnerable t o the more they are digitalized and  hence cybersecurit y has to be priority and needs to be properly resourced in addition to just  developing the systems and technology for ODR. Inadequate cybersecurity may mean that  access to the courts is effectively denied and court users’ privacy is seriously threatened.     119. It is of fundamental importance to any ODR system that information and data that is  uploaded, exchanged, transferred and stored in an ODR system is kept secure. All court  documents and any evidence that is uploaded onto an ODR system must be kept free from   manipulation and attack to ensure its integrity. The system requires protection to prevent  external parties from hacking the system and obtaining non -public information.  Regarding  the authority to access information, there should be internal limitations that are put in place  to ensure that parties to disputes cannot access information that they are not allowed to  view.  This requires secure authentication.     120. One issue about digital security and ODR is the establishment of the identity of the  disputants. It  is important that the parties to the ODR process are truly the correct parties  and that there is no issue of fraudulent identities.                                                                  79https://www.zdnet.com/article/wannacry -ransomware -report -nhs-is-still-not-ready -for-the-next -big-attack/    
CDCJ(2018) 5  62 ARTICLE 13 – THE RIGHT TO AN EFFECTIVE REMEDY     121. Article 13 provides “Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this  Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority  notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official  capacity”.     122. Article 13 therefore imposes an obligation on Convention States to gi ve persons  whose Convention rights have been violated a means of redress whereby these persons can  obtain relief at the national level. Therefore, for example, if a person’s right to a fair trial has  been infringed that person must be able at the national level to have recourse to some form  of effective remedy. For example , in a case of statutory, compulsory arbitration where one  party has no opportunity to put her case or respond to the other party’s submissions, that  party should have access to  some sort  of complaints mechanism providing for an effective  remedy. While this process need not be judicial, it does need to be effective and provide for  some procedural guarantees such as the independence of the complaints reviewer.80   Ombudsmen schemes and other non-judicial reviews may be considered, as long as they  are effective.  Therefore, ODR mechanisms might be considered for this purpose.     123. Insofar as infringements of ECHR rights are concerned, the use of ODR mechanisms  can indeed open up new avenues of redr ess for infringements of ECHR rights. It can be an  effective and convenient tool for litigants who may have a claim of such an infringement. In  order for such a mechanism to be effective and in order to comply with Article 13, the ODR  mechanism should idea lly comply with the requirements of Article 6, where practical and  necessary. These issues have been elucidated above in the section dealing with ODR and  issues of compatibility with the right to a fair trial.     124. One of the more important issues, given the fact that Article 13 deals with alleged  infringements of ECHR rights is that of independence. The ODR mechanism must be  independent from any authority that may have allegedly committed the infringement.     125. Standards have been developed by various organisatio ns and bodies, and this  Report read together with the literature review and research outcomes within this Report,  borrows from these standards.81     APPLICABILITY OF THESE STANDARDS TO ODR     126. There is no doubt that while the application of these standards may be necessary to  ensure that the development and implementation of an ODR system complies with the right  to a fair trial, they may nonetheless prove burdensome to the development and  implementation of an ODR system within the justice system. For example, th e requirement  to hold an oral hearing (or at least have the availability of one) at some stage in the                                                              80 Khan v UK  (2001) 31 EHRR 1016 .  81 Online Dispute Resolution Standards of Practice as developed by the ICANN available at  https://www.icann.org/en/system/files/files/odr -standards -of-practi ce-en.pdf  
CDCJ(2018) 5  63 proceedings may prove quite foreign to current providers of ODR who see one of the  purposes of ODR as cutting down on the time -consuming and costly tradit ional court  hearings. Another example is the standard of transparency. Many current ODR providers  may not emphasize  the need of being transparent about the  development on their system  and the administration of it  since confidentiality is an integral part o f arbitration and  mediation . The only aspect of transparency which they may consider important is the  handing down of decision.  Furthermore, issues of data protection and cybersecurity are  difficult and costly to implement.     127. Having said this, there has been an acknowledgement by the EctHR that the initial  decision -making body does not have to conform to the requirements of Article 6(1) of the  ECHR provided the applicant has the possibility of appealing the decision to a court of law.82  As discussed above, this argument pertains to the idea of compulsory ODR; where the  disputant must submit their dispute through alternative means. Thus, there may be a way in  which the ODR system can be developed with the overarching purpose of ef ficiency and  effectiveness w ith some standards being  relaxed. This, however, is subject the caveat that  there must be the availability of an appeal before the traditional court system. This will  ensure that the parties have a public hearing and the other A rticle 6 rights are given effect to.     THE DIGITAL DIVIDE   128. The issue here (and this is issue is by no means confined to ODR) is that technology  is developing extremely fast and that the person who is constantly using an implementing  (and training their staf f in the latest technology) is likely to have a competitive advantage  over the person who uses older technology (including cybersecurity). This is partly a  question of costs and resources.     129. Hence a  first digital divide may be created simply by access to t echnology resources.  Secondly,  the digital divide may appear inter -generational as digital natives who have grown  up with gaming and social media find it easie r to adapt to new technologies in other spheres.     130. A third  digital divide may exist in respect of people with visual impairments or other  disabilities (but this divide already exists  in the offline  and it is not clear whether ODR  improves it or makes it worse).     131. But one could  also argue that technology empowers, for example litigants in person  to have access to legal information and less need for legal representation. The practical  answer is to provide as much options as possible - ie to provide for support for individuals  who have no access to technology (for example in libraries or other public places) and invest  in enabling technologies  and to make technology as user -friendly as possible .    132. The issue of the digital divide is a serious one. It is a broadly phrased concept that,  for the purposes of this Report, entails the idea that the use of technology, particularly online  technology, to resolve disputes might disenfranchise certain portions of the population from  access to justice. Quite simply put, many people do not have access t o a computer and the  internet and many people are computer illiterate. ODR systems are dependent on                                                              82 ECtHR, Albert and Le Compte v.

CDCJ(2018) 5  64 technology. The absence of simple, affordable, and appropriate access to computers, the  internet, and other technological tools will limit the possibilities  of utilising ODR mechanisms.     133. This statement must be taken with some salt, however. It is a generalised statement,  that while may be true for some states is certainly not true for very developed states.  Nonetheless, it would be difficult to argue against  the point that there will be some people in  every society in the world, no matter how developed, that will not have access to or the  ability to use the technology that ODR is re liant upon or will be seriously disadvantaged in  doing so.     134. If one is to devel op a public justice system that improves access to justice then such  a system cannot come to be implemented if it will effectively deny certain persons access to  justice.     135. One can foresee a range of issues within the digital divide: computer illiteracy, lack of  access to a computer  or broadband connection , access to the internet, physical and mental  disabilities, socially disadvantaged individuals, and the elderly. It is quite apparent, and does  not require much analysis, to understand that persons of the se categories may be left  disadvantaged and side -lined by a judicial system that embraces ODR, if ODR systems do  not make space for such individuals.     136. Furthermore it must be emphasized that the digital divide is not just a black and white  issue of “haves” and “have -nots” (at least in developed countries), but an issue of relative  access to technologies in the sense that the party who can afford the latest computer and  internet technologies will be at a substantial advantage over the party who is using  techn ology which is, say five years old. There will be a different not just between individuals,  but also between attorneys and law  firms (for example small and big law  firms).      137. Having said the above, one author makes the point that not everyone within a socie ty  will always have access to technology, and that reason should not stop governments from  implementing ODR systems.  A similar argument about literacy could be made as follows:  not everyone within every society can read and write but that does not mean go vernments  prevent people from accessing justice through written proceedings.      138. The digital divide also applies to the difference in access to justice between  developed and developing states.  This is an international issue, when comparing the  resources of  two different states, and raises questions about the use of ODR when a dispute  arises between persons from different states of different development statuses. This is  beyond the scope of this Report but this is an issue that deserves consideration.      139. The issue of the digital divide is linked to the fair right principle of equality of arms. As  noted above, the law requires that people be treated equally when having a dispute  resolved. While this does not mean that all pre -existing inequalities of the parti es must be  dealt with, it does mean that there must be some form of effective participation of both  parties who are subject to a dispute. This usually means the effective participation of a  litigant through a legal representative. In the context of ODR, an d the issue of access to and  use of technology as raised above, the principle of equality of arms raises interesting  questions.     140. Firstly, every litigant must have the right to an effective participation in the  proceedings. This would mean that those parti cipants who are computer illiterate, who have 
CDCJ(2018) 5  65 no access to an online computer system, who are otherwise disabled or previously  disadvantaged must be given the chance to effectively participate in ODR proceedings. One  way in which to ensure that such person s do receive the necessary attention is to follow the  mechanisms implemented by the British Columbia ODR system. In this system, while the  backbone of the system is the use of technology online, persons who would otherwise be  side-lined from accessing the system are given the necessary attention by the availability of  alternative means to having the dispute resolved online. Such persons may access the ODR  platform by attending the CRT service centres which are located across British Columbia.  Here, the liti gants can appear in person at the relevant centre and have an assistant help  them with accessing and using the ODR system.     141. Secondly, there may be a divide between legal representatives and their knowledge  of and access to technology in ODR proceedings. L arge law firms may have the financial  ability to use and understand technology in a way that will assist their clients. This may  include law firms developing and using systems that analyse data, information and evidence  in preparation for a case, which mig ht place a great advantage on the party who has access  to such a system. This should be compared to a legal representative who does not have  access to such technology and as a result of which his/her client may be left disadvantaged.  Large law firms may al so have the ability to develop specialist ODR practices wherein  certain lawyers specialise in ODR proceedings. This, again, would create a divide between  specialist ODR legal representatives and legal representatives who do not have the  knowledge of or acc ess to such technology. This in turn would create a divide between the  litigants.     142. ODR systems must therefore be developed in such a way that this issue of the digital  divide is adequately addressed. The currently existing divide in the quality of legal  representation cannot be further enhanced by the introduction of technology. If ODR is to be  implemented into public justice systems, these systems must be designed in such a way that  there is equality of arms between the litigants. Everyone, no matter thei r level of computer  literacy, their age, social status etc. must have access to the ODR system and this may  entail the need either maintain a certain degree of paper based systems and/or to employ  assistants to assist and guide such disadvantaged litigants . The use of pilot schemes, reach  out to certain disadvantaged groups, user -feedback and centres where court users could  physically go to access ODR systems may go some way to alleviate these concerns.     THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN THE COURTS     143. AI can be used in different ways which has different impacts on due process. First of  all, AI, big data analysis and expert systems can be used to support dispute resolution  processes, for example as more and more evidence is produced in electronic form, AI c an  help in the process of discovery /disclosure  (in common law jurisdictions)  or the finding of  relevant evidence.83     144. Secondly AI, big data analysis and expert systems can be used to guide the parties  in respect of the legal issues, providing legal advice a nd narrowing down the issues or                                                              83 http://inspiredthinking.dehns.com/post/102ddze/first -use-of-artificial -intelligence -in-legal -case  
CDCJ(2018) 5  66 helping the parties to focus on the most relevant issues particularly in negotiation and  mediation processes.     145. Thirdly AI, big data analysis and expert systems can be used to replace human  decision -making and human judgment . The most serious impact of AI would occur in this last  use of AI, as it would affect human discretion. However, it is unlikely that AI would be used  for this purpose in the immediate, foreseeable future (ie to replace human judgment).     146. Fourthly AI, big d ata analysis and expert systems are currently being used to analyse  judicial reasoning and the use of precedents and legal reasoning. This use may well a  precursor for the third use (ie replacing human decision -making).84    147. This raises the question of why AI  is problematic from the viewpoint of Article 6  ECHR and more generally for the idea of justice. AI relies on mining large quantities of data  for patterns and by developing algorithms from these patterns which are then applied to new  sets of data to reach decisions  (and further algorithmic learning)) . In doing so AI relies  heavily on correlation (if x and y then z seems a recurring pattern, then z must be the correct  answer if x and y are present) without formulating causation.     148. Currently no AI exists whic h would be sophisticated enough to automate judgments.  Several barriers present themselves: (1) the role of discretion in judicial decision -making , (2)  legal interpretation is complex and multi -facetted and not limited to a rule -based system, (3)  the adapt ability of human language to new situations and how “relevance” can be adapted to  new situations.     149. However the use of AI in policing (for example Predpol - used to prioritize police  resources based on existing crime spots) or within the criminal justice sys tem (for example  to decide on matters of whether a suspect is released on bail) have been criticized for being  (racially) prejudiced and creating new types of discrimination.85 The concern here is that  computer based decisions are inflexible and are not abl e to create exceptions or use human  discretion. This may go to the very core of our notion of access to justice and lead to a denial  of justice.     150. AI is increasingly used in the context of the civil and criminal justice systems where  artificial intelligenc e is being developed to eventually support or replace decision -making by  human judges. Such systems are currently being tested to identify decision outcomes with a  view to detect patters in complex judicial decision -making. Thus far, the reliable predictio n  rate is relatively low at 79%. It is therefore considered premature at the current time to  imagine such systems replacing judges.86 Nevertheless, it is suggested that such systems  can support or assist judges (and lawyers).87 Given the pressure of high cas eloads and                                                              84 J Zeleznikov, D Hunter “ Reasoning p aradigms in legal decision support system ” (1995) 9 (6) Artificial  Intelligence Review 361-385; D.Carneiro et al “ODR: an Artificial Intelligence Perspective”(2014) 41 Artificial  Intelligence Review  211-240  85 Council of Europe Study on the Human Rights Dim ension of Automated Data Processing Systems (2017)  https://rm.coe.int/study -hr-dimension -of-automated -data -processing -incl-algorithms/168075b94a    86 Nikolaos Altreas et al “Predicting judicial decisions of the European Court of Human Rights: a Natural  Language Processing perspective” PeerJ Computer Science  Open Access (Published 24.

CDCJ(2018) 5  67 insufficient resources from which most justice systems suffer, there is a danger that support  systems based on artificial intelligence are inappropriately used by judges to “delegate”  decisions to technological systems that were not developed fo r that purpose and are  perceived as being more ‘objective' even when this is not the case. Great care should  therefore be taken to assess whether such systems can deliver and under what conditions  that may be used in order not to jeopardise the right to a fair trial. This is particularly the case  when such systems are introduced mandatorily, as is the case for parole decisions in the  United States. Concerns about judicial bias around parole decisions have led to the  mandatory introduction of software to pre dict the likelihood of offenders reoffending in many  U.S. states.88 However independent investigation of this software suggests that the “software  used […] to predict future criminals […] is biased against blacks”89     CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS     151. As has b een discussed in this Report ODR is a relevant field of law that is growing in  its importance. It therefore deserves real attention about how it should be regulated  and  introduced . In addition to developing online court systems, attention needs to be given  to  issues of data protection (especially in respect of commercial companies involved in the  process).     152. ODR techniques adopted in the courts in Council of Europe Member States fa ll in the  following categories i ) pre -trial ADR processes (which may or may not use ODR) such as  mediation; ii) e-filing of statements, court documents via secure and authenticated systems  (databoxes, e -communication); iii) online access to court files for the relevant court users  (again  it has to be ensured that such access is authenticated and secure); iv) digitalisation of  courts, creating an online platform which allows for e -filing, but also evidence production and  a complete digital record; v ) the use of video - (or audio -) conferenc ing in the courts, for  example for witnesses, including experts; vi) a parallel, online track (for example for small  claims, payment orders or other specific disputes in the civil and administrative  courts ); vii)  the use of artificial intelligence to repla ce human decision making. We have found ODR  techniques were adopted in the catego ries i) - v), bu t we have found no examples of vi ) or  vii).    We recommend that states pay attention to the following issues when implementing  ODR:   (1) A fair hearing in the courts must be guided by the “equality of arms” principle, giving  each party an equal opportunity to present his/her own case and respond to the case  of the other.     (2) For example an assumption is normally made that technology speeds up  processes  (which is true), but little regard is given the fact that technology also increases                                                              88 See: https://gcn.com/articles/2013/11/01/prison -analytics -software.aspx   89 Angwin, Julia, Surya Mattu, and Lauren Kirchner. 2016. ‘Machine Bias: There’s Software Used Acro ss the  Country to Predict Future Criminals. And It’s Biased Against Blacks.’ ProPublica. Retrieved 31 August 2016  (https://www.propublica.org/article/machine -bias-risk-asse ssments -in-criminal -sentencing)  
CDCJ(2018) 5  68 information overload (which slows down information processing) - so for example  shortened and inflexible deadlines for filing statements or evidence can affect th e  ability of a party to have a fair hearing (where for example a micro -business litigates  against a much larger business) and the sole director cannot cope with short  deadlines.     (3) Furthermore, it is often the assumptions we make about technology (rather tha n the  technology itself) which may have an impact on a fair hearing. So the assumption for  example will be that technology always works (not accounting for technical glitches or  downtime) which may prejudice a party in filing their case.     (4) A different aspe ct is the question of open, public hearings (where virtual hearings in  the courts replace a court hearing), which is essentially a question of transparency.  This is not a real problem as a platform may in fact allow access to virtual hearings  and informati on in a controlled manner without the observers having to physically go to  a courtroom. This is more a question of designing technology in a particular way. Thus  digital courts may be open courts , if not more so than physical court buildings .    (5) The use of o nline courts has the ability revolutionise access to justice for litigants. The  development of new procedures to resolve disputes online can revolutionise access to  justice to persons who would usually be unable to understand court procedures  without hirin g a lawyer.  The use of ODR could level the playing field of parties who  would ordinarily find it hard to access courts. It could improve the justice system to  make it more accessible for those who live far from legal centres or who struggle to  afford the costs of seeking justice, by providing cheaper, alternative means to  resolving disputes.     (6) Using technology and the internet can allow litigants to access information about how  to lay a claim, submit a claim and inform them of the process of how to go abou t  resolving their dispute. In fact, ODR may structure the process itself for litigants. It also  means that this process can be done just about anywhere with internet access, making  the process convenient and easy for litigants. This is a massive improvemen t of  access to justice for litigants.     (7) An issue with ODR and access to justice is that those who are computer illiterate or  have no access to technology might be side -lined in the process. Increased high  internet access reflects social and generational ch ange of how people now lead their  lives, but what of the vulnerable users and those without access?  Requiring parties to  use technology to resolve disputes could inhibit access to justice if there is a great  discrepancy between the parties and their acces s to technology.  The move to online  and virtual justice also threatens to significantly increase the number of unrepresented  defendants, to further discriminate against vulnerable defendants, to inhibit the  relationship between defence lawyers and their c lients, and, as some argue, make  justice less open.     (8) If some litigants do not have access to, or the ability to use, technology and the  internet, these litigants will be excluded from the administration of justice. Therefore, if  ODR is implemented, there should (a) either be an alternative paper -based traditional  means of having a dispute resolved for parties who do not have this access to  technology and the internet or (b) a comprehensive system of legal representation  made affordable.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  69   (9) As court are bein g digitalised and are going online there may be (in certain countries)  a temptation to outsource the technology and to save money by using “free”  commercial applications, who then, in return collect court users’ personal data for  online profiling purposes.  We have not seen this as part of our research for this study  and as far as we are aware, the ODR communication and data processing  technologies developed by the courts to date are not based on commercial tracking.  However in times of decreasing public bud gets and increased pressure on government  departments to save money, this topic is not entirely irrelevant.     (10) It does appear that at some stage of this process you must have the opportunity to  have an oral hearing. Thus, for compulsory ODR, there must be the opportunity to  appeal the ODR decision which must be oral. Or, the ODR processes must have an  oral element to it.     (11) This raises the interesting question of whether “oral” hearing is to be equated with  “face -to-face” hearing? While there is no direct authority on this it would make sense to  argue that video -conferencing where the communicators can hear and see e ach other  in real time (and where provision is made that, for example witnesses are not coached  from behind the screen and that witnesses’ identity is properly authenticated) is  functionally equivalent to an “oral” hearing (provided the technology works on  both  ends of the transmission and this can be protocolled).     (12) The ECtHR requires there to be some form of publicity which allows for public scrutiny  of any court proceedings, with the additional requirement of having the decision made  public. Therefore, an y ODR proceeding must ensure that there is this degree of  transparency involved.     (13) In particular, if hearings were conducted entirely online in a fully digitalized court it  would be important that the public can access the hearing - subject to specific  exceptions, court hearings must be open to members of the public (in the sense that  members of the public can follow proceedings from a public gallery in the court  building ). Functionally equivalent access would have to be provided technically in a  fully o nline court, allowing interested members of the public to follow the course of  proceedings.     (14) An interesting question here is a question of numbers. Traditionally members of the  public have been granted physical access to the court buildi ng, but many countr ies in  Europe  do not allow public broadcasting of trials on TV for the reason that this may  influence advocates and judges who then ”play” to populist sentiments of crowd  watching which may not lead to better justice. Clearly if there is online access to “ court  channels” (for example on Youtube) then a similar effect may arise.     (15) It is interesting to note in this context that few Council of Europe States at present use  ODR to make the enforcement of court decisions more effective (with some notable  exception s). We recommend that greater use of ODR could be made at this stage.     (16) The introduction of ODR and digitalization of courts means that court procedures may  build in several tiers into the process, where only at the last tier there is an adjudication   by jud ges with an oral hearing of the parties. This would correspond to the pyramid  model of dispute resolution which integrates legal advice (the parties informing 
CDCJ(2018) 5  70 themselves about their legal rights and their legal position  through the use of expert  systems/ar tificial intelligence ), negotiation and conflict resolution techniques  (restorative justice), facilitated negotiation and mediation, and adjudication (potentially  several stages, including the possibility of review and appeal). These tiers of  processes cou ld take place all within the same digital ODR platform, integrated  as part  of the court system with the relevant data being moved from one sta ge of the  procedure  to the next  one as appropriate. The idea behind this tiered model of dispute  resolution is tha t most disputes are solved at the lower levels, thus being cost -effective  while at the same time giving more disputants access to justice. Thus ODR could also  mean a reorganisation of traditional court processes by integrating processes which  currently tak e place outside the court system, provided by private entities (legal advice,  ADR).     (17) Generally speaking, like in other areas of digitization, ODR may have a negative  impact on data protection and privacy in that online justice is likely to generate a much  greater wealth of data (including metadata, for example who accessed a particular  court record when and from where), increases the possibilities of data processing,  searching, data mining and the use of artificial intelligence (which is the other side of  the coin of increased access to justice) and online data (including court data) may be  more mobile (easy online transfer), sticky (in the sense that data remains on storage  devices until erased) and vulnerable to unauthorised, remote access (computer  hackin g from anywhere in the world).     (18) These risks which are a concomitant risk of ODR should be counter -balanced by data  protection & privacy training of court officials, clear data protection laws, data  protection policies and guidelines on a “need to know” ba sis, implementation of the  “privacy by design” principles in new ODR/court technologies, data protection &  privacy audits and criminal laws (on computer misuse) and their effective enforcement.     (19) Cybersecurity has to be  a priority and needs to be properly r esourced in addition to  just developing the systems and technology for ODR. Inadequate cybersecurity may  mean that access to the courts is effectively denied and court users’ privacy is  seriously threatened.     (20) It is of fundamental importance to any ODR syst em that information and data that is  uploaded, exchanged, transferred and stored in an ODR system is kept secure. All  court documents and any evidence that is uploaded onto an ODR system must be kept  free from manipulation and attack to ensure its integrit y. The system requires  protection to prevent external parties from hacking the system and obtaining non public information.  Regarding the authority to access information, there should be  internal limitations that are put in place to ensure that parties to  disputes cannot  access information that they are not allowed to view.  This requires secure  authentication.     (21) One issue about digital security and ODR is the establishment of the identity of the  disputants.  It is important that the parties to the ODR proc ess are truly the correct  parties and that there is no issue of fraudulent identities.     (22) Every litigant must have the right to an effective participation in the proceedings. This  would mean that those participants who are computer illiterate, who have no ac cess to  an online computer system, who are otherwise disabled or previously disadvantaged 
CDCJ(2018) 5  71 must be given the chance to effectively participate in ODR proceedings. One way in  which to ensure that such persons do receive the necessary attention is to follow t he  mechanisms implemented by the British Columbia ODR system. In this system, while  the backbone of the system is the use of technology online, persons who would  otherwise be side -lined from accessing the system are given the necessary attention  by the ava ilability of alternative means to having the dispute resolved online. Such  persons may access the ODR platform by attending the CRT service centres which  are located across British Columbia. Here, the litigants can appear in person at the  relevant centre a nd have an assistant help them with accessing and using the ODR  system.     (23) There may be a divide between legal representatives and their knowledge of and  access to technology in ODR proceedings. Large law firms may have the financial  ability to use and unde rstand technology in a way that will assist their clients. This may  include law firms developing and using systems that analyse data, information and  evidence in preparation for a case, which might place a great advantage on the party  who has access to suc h a system. This should be compared to a legal representative  who does not have access to such technology and as a result of which his/her client  may be left disadvantaged. Large law firms may also have the ability to develop  specialist ODR practices where in certain lawyers specialise in ODR proceedings. This,  again, would create a divide between specialist ODR legal representatives and legal  representatives who do not have the knowledge of or access to such technology. This  in turn would create a divide be tween the litigants.     (24) ODR systems must therefore be developed in such a way that this issue of the digital  divide is adequately addressed. The currently existing divide in the quality of legal  representation cannot be further enhanced by the introduction of technology. If ODR is  to be implemented into public justice systems, these systems must be designed in  such a way that there is equality of arms between the litigants. Everyone, no matter  their level of computer literacy, their age, social status etc. m ust have access to the  ODR system and this may entail the need either to maintain a certain degree of paper  based systems and/or to employ assistants to assist and guide such disadvantaged  litigants. The use of pilot schemes, reach out to certain disadvant aged groups, user feedback and centres where court users could physically go to access ODR systems  may go some way to alleviate these concerns.     (25) Given the pressure of high caseloads and insufficient resources from which most  justice systems suffer, there i s a danger that support systems based on artificial  intelligence are inappropriately used by judges to “delegate” decisions to technological  systems that were not developed for that purpose and are perceived as being more  ‘objective' even when this is not the case. Great care should therefore be taken to  assess whether such systems can deliver and under what conditions that may be used  in order not to jeopardise the right to a fair trial. This is particularly the case when such  systems are introduced mandat orily.   
CDCJ(2018) 5  72 ANNEX 1   QUESTIONNAIRE SENT OUT TO COUNCIL OF EUROPE MEMBER STATES     INTRODUCTION AND EXPLANATION     Online Dispute Resolution combines the information processing powers of computers with  the networked communication facilities of the internet in dispute resolution processes. This  Survey is in aid of important research to understand how Online Dispute Resolution impacts  on the right to a fair trial.     The purpose of the Survey is to obtain a comparative picture of the civil, commercial or  administra tive procedure rules and practices in respect of Online Dispute Resolution in the  Council of Europe Member States.     This Survey focuses on Online Dispute Resolution and the Courts. It does not cover the use  of purely internal case management and filing sys tems, nor the use of IT in the courts  generally.     The Survey also does not cover alternative dispute resolution outside the court system.  Alternative dispute resolution (for example, arbitration and mediation) is only relevant if (1) it  is used in conjunct ion with court proceedings as a preliminary procedure or (2) if it leads to a  decision binding on the parties with res judicata effect (other than arbitration based on the  voluntary agreement of the parties).     The Survey does not cover the use of Online Di spute Resolution in the context of consumer  disputes, such as the disputes solved by the EU Online Dispute Resolution Platform.     The Survey covers specific Online Dispute Resolution techniques such as:     (i) online filing systems/platforms directly accessed  by the parties and/or their  advocates for the filing of statements (such as claims, counterclaims, responses);     (ii) the use of online systems for storing, processing and assessing electronic  evidence;     (iii) the use of artificial intelligence, big data analysis techniques and automation to  reach decisions which traditionally have been made by judges and which  traditionally have been dependent on human judgment;     (iv) the use of platforms for online meetings and o nline hearings, for example by  audio - and video -conferencing, including the giving of oral testimony of witnesses  and experts;     (v) the use of artificial intelligence, big data analysis, expert and legal advice systems  for the purposes of negotiation, medi ation, narrowing of issues or legal advice,  including such systems as blind -bidding, only to the extent that they affect court  processes.     
CDCJ(2018) 5  73 Section A concerns civil and commercial disputes, and Section B concerns administrative  disputes. Some of the questi ons may be repeated in each section but it was felt that it is  clearer if the Survey contains two separate parts, one on civil and commercial courts and the  other on administrative courts.     8. The Survey covers the Online Dispute Resolution techniques ment ioned above  under  6. for the following possible stages and variations of legal processes before the courts:     i) preliminary pre -trial processes which under the law constitute a mandatory  prerequisite to institute proceedings before a public court (such as,  in some  jurisdictions, mandatory pre -trial alternative dispute resolution mechanisms);     ii) preliminary processes (including alternative dispute resolution mechanisms such  as arbitration, negotiation or mediation) which are not mandatory as such, but can  be recommended by the court/judge. Furthermore, if the parties refuse to engage  in them there may be penalties in the award of costs;     iii) special online dispute resolution tribunals for some particular types of claims (e.g.  Administrative Tribunals, onli ne dispute resolution for parking offences and  administrative fines, or for social housing disputes, or for small claims disputes in  the civil courts, or for neighbourhood or family disputes);     iv) litigation before a civil, commercial or administrative co urt under the ordinary  procedural rules;     v) parallel tracks: claimants can choose whether they opt for the ordinary,  “traditional” court procedures (not using Online Dispute Resolution) OR a special  Online Dispute Resolution Court which has its own, separ ate procedure and uses  some of the Online Dispute Resolution techniques mentioned above under  6;    vi) use of Online Dispute Resolution in the enforcement of judicial decisions;     vii) out-of-court  alternative dispute resolution mechanisms which the parties are  required to use by law and which result in binding decisions not subject to judicial  review.     Since the Survey by its very nature explores what forms of Online Dispute Resolution are  availabl e in different states, many of the questions may not be applicable in every state.         
CDCJ(2018) 5  74 THE COUNCIL OF EUROPE ACTIVITY     The activity is a study with the following aims:     - to analyse the compatibility of Online Dispute Resolution with the right to a fair tr ial both in  terms of the challenges to the right of a fair trial as well as opportunities afforded by Online  Dispute Resolution to provide greater access to justice and enhanced due process;     - to examine whether online dispute resolution could open up new  avenues of redress for  infringements of ECHR rights (Article 13).     This study is conducted by the independent expert, Prof Julia Hörnle, School of Law, Queen  Mary University of London, j.hornle@qmul.ac.uk .    INSTRUCTIONS     Kindly complete the questionnaire. Please note that only some of the questions will be  applicable to your legal system. Please email the completed form to the Council of Europe  Secretariat ( DGI-CDCJ@coe .int) no later than Friday 12 January 2018 .

CDCJ(2018) 5  82 ANNEX 2  EXPERT INTERVIEWS     Arno R. Lodder  - Professor of Internet Governance and Regulation, Department  Transnational Legal Studies, Center for Law and Internet, VRIJU University Amsterdam.   I. INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND EXPLANATION  CLARIFYING THE FIELD OF   RESEARCH   QUESTIONS     What is your personal experience of Online Dispute Resolution and your personal view on  whether Online Dispute Resolution should be used (more widely) in the courts?     Professor of Internet Governance and Regulation, Department Transna tional Legal Studies,  Center for Law and Internet.     The research is mainly concerned with three aims regarding internet governance and  regulation. Publication in ODR https://research.vu.nl/en/persons/arno -r-lodder/publications/     II. ODR OVERVIEW   1. Do you have any ODR mechanisms in your jurisdiction?     In Netherland court proceedings are so complicated. The situation can be improved trough  the implementation of ODR. If you can design the system, it will positive impact of fair trial.  And we can also have a monitoring of the process, particularly to fix the information.      Overall, ODR will bring only benefits from ODR.     2. Do you know any other ODR mechanisms outside your country?     I don’t know the situation in every state. But, ODR is developed in the United Kingdom and  Netherlands (family cases). For instance, in the UK we’ve got MoneyClaim platform. In the  Netherlands, we have Rechtwijzer.       3. Are ODR techniques used within the cou rts in your country?     There is now sort of initiative. It’s only for the exchange of documents. So, it’s quite  restrictive. They expected to launch system for exchanging the documents online, but they  delayed and postponed it to 2018.      Overall, the proce ss of implementation of the ODR mechanisms in court proceedings should  be improved.       4. What is your prediction as to the ODR development in your country/ in general (5 or  10 years)?     Nowadays, ODR mechanisms are being used mostly is alternative dispute re solution.   Maybe, if courts are using more and more technologies, it could work.     What is very striking is that 10 years ago we expected more from ODR. But not all such  expectations have been met.     
CDCJ(2018) 5  83 Thus, one has to be careful with the predictions as to t he ODR mechanisms.   III. GENERAL QUESTION AS TO FAIR TRIAL ISSUES     1. In your opinion, what are the main issues regarding ODR’s influence on fair trial  considerations (Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights)?     It technically possibly to ensure fairness safeguards in ODR. I don’t see how it might  negatively influence on fairness of the proceedings.       2. Do you think ODR processes and procedures work? Do they help resolve disputes  fairly, efficiently and effectively?   Yes. In the Netherlands, the process is so complicated. So, we can make it simpler using  online technologies. You can design the system convenient for people. It will improve access  to justice and accordingly fair trial.     Only benefits.         3. Do you think that ODR processes and procedures could work within the civil justice  system? I.e. within the court system?   Yes.    IV. ODR AND IMPARTIALITY  OF THE TRIBUNAL   1. Do you think there is a risk the ODR will have negative influence on tribunal’s  impartiality and independence?     The thing is that the judges will be the same in ODR procedures. So, it is not the issue of  ODR, but of the bias of judges in general. So far, decision offered by private organization via  ODR are high quality solutions. Thus, online decision offered by judges will be good enough,  but it will depend on case -by-case basis.     The technologies won’t cause the difference in this regard.     2. In which sce nario ODR may be or may be not conducted in accordance with the  requirement of Article 6 as to the ‘public hearing’ (Article 6)?      To be honest, the courtroom is a limited space. So, using ODR we can ensure public hearing  for unlimited number of people. F or instance, we could use YouTube video link to ensure  public hearing unless we have some privacy issues at hand.     V. ODR AND DIGITAL ILLI TERACY/DIGITAL DIVID E/ACCESS TO THE COUR TS  1. Will ODR have negative influence on the right for a fair trial considering the level of  digital illiteracy/digital divide in Council of Europe member states/your state?     Maybe, this problem could have been actual 10 years ago. But not nowadays.     More people would have problems using ordinary courts because of distance. So, in thi s  case, people have to travel to the court from different towns etc.     2. Could you suggest a solution on how individuals affected can get access to ODR?     If you have online dispute resolution not necessarily everything has to be online.     So, the idea is th at the level of digitalisation might differ depending on the level of digital  illiteracy of population.    
CDCJ(2018) 5  84   VI. ODR AND ARTIFICIAL I NTELLIGENCE   1. Do you think AI nowadays exists in ODR mechanisms?     No, I don’t think so.     2. Do you think AI will be introduced in the COURTS in the near future?     It has been introducing everywhere, so it will be introducing in ODR as well.     Particularly, regarding the analysis of the information.     3. Do you think it might affect the right to a fair trial?     It depends on the level of ac cess to the technology. In civil cases, for instance in the UK,  people with more money have more options. If you could effort lawyers, you have an  advantage.     As to the concern that AI one day will substitute human being in dispute resolution process, it  won’t. Definitely, it won’t.        4. Do you think automation might affect the independence and impartiality of judges and  is there a risk that the removal of discretion and human judgment will lead to prejudice  and stereotyping?     No. On the contrary, it could  help to enhance the independence and impartiality of the judges.     Moreover, judges remain the same in dispute resolution regardless of its form: online or  offline.     VII. ODR AND SECURITY   1. To what extent are ODR mechanisms in your country protected from cyber -attacks?     There is definitely an issue here. The internet is not secured. What is important, it’s  technically not possible to prevent 100 % attracts.     So, it always be a problem. At t he same time, governments should ensure an appropriate  level of digital security.       
CDCJ(2018) 5  85 Judge Dory Reiling .  I. INTRODUCTION, BACKGR OUND AND EXPLANATION  CLARIFYING THE  FIELD OF RESEARCH     QUESTIONS     What is your personal experience of Online Dispute Resolution and your personal view on  whether Online Dispute Resolution should be used (more widely) in the courts?     Judge with rich, varied, international experience in judicial reform and information technology  for courts, from a long, diverse career in IT for courts, judicial reform at the World Bank, and  independent consulting.     Worked on judicial reform in Georgia,  Nepal, Benin, Romania, Macedonia, Gambia, Sri  Lanka, Kazakhstan, Jordan, Singapore, Australia, Croatia.     Teaching experience at Dutch Judicial Academy (SSR), universities of Utrecht, Leyden,  Amsterdam, Delft Technical University, Canberra and University o f Victoria (Australia),  German Judicial Academy, World Bank Institute, International Development & Law  Organization (IDLO), Lee Kuan Yew School of Management (Singapore),T.M.C. Asser  Institute, The Hague.     Member of Editorial Board of Computerrecht (Kluwer ), Hague Journal for the Rule of Law,  and Springer Law, Technology and Governance Series.     Specialises on Strategic advice, knowledge sharing, developing court IT, publishing on IT for  judicial reform.     I. ODR OVERVIEW   5. Could you please give brief overview  of ODR mechanism in court proceedings in your  country?     The ODR is considered to be a form of alternative dispute resolution. So, usually if we speak  about ODR it means we speak about ADR (mostly privately run) and not about court  proceedings.     What I do  try is to look at these experiments to understand whether they may provide some  indications to what my court system could do using ODR mechanisms.     As to examples of ODR in court proceedings in the Netherlands. In administrative  proceedings courts handle  appeals from administrative decisions and these appeals can be  filed online.     However, there is no complete ODR court proceedings (like UK pilot or British Columbia Civil  Tribunal) we do not have.       6. What is your prediction as to the ODR development in your country/ in general (5 or  10 years)?     My own court system is aware of the necessity of using more ODR mechanisms.   It is something we are working on, but it’s really hard to predict exactly when we are going to  implement it.     II. GENERAL QUESTION AS TO FAIR TRIAL ISSUES    
CDCJ(2018) 5  86 In your opinion, what are the main issues regarding ODR’s influence on fair trial  considerations (Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights)?     If we are talking about fair procedure it means we discuss  the way the resolution of the  dispute is being organized. If we do it online, the design needs to take into account the  exchange of information. Such exchange must comply with fair procedure standards, such as  equality of arms and transparency.     III. ODR AND  IMPARTIALITY OF THE TRIBUNAL   3. Do you think there is a risk the ODR will have negative influence on tribunal’s  impartiality and independence?      If the system has been designed properly, it doesn’t have to.     4. In which scenario ODR may be or may be not conducted in accordance with the  requirement of Article 6 as to the ‘public hearing’ (Article 6)?      It’s very hard to give a general answer to this question. Because court hearings as a rule are  public. It means there is a lot of public attention for some hearings and less for others.     But the point we are really struggling at the moment is that our decisions also have to be  public. On the other hand, there is Article 8 of the ECHR – the right to privacy, which m eans  that personal information can’t be public.     So, considering above -mentioned, we need to find balance and a solution.       IV. ODR AND DIGITAL ILLI TERACY/DIGITAL DIVID E/ACCESS TO THE COUR TS  3. Will ODR have negative influence on the right for a fair trial considering the level of  digital illiteracy/digital divide in Council of Europe member states/your state?     Step 1. It should not.     For instance, the Dutch legislation on digital procedure says that is should be equal access  for those who are not digital il literate. So, parties are allowed to use papers for the filing.       4. Could you suggest a solution on how individuals affected can get access to ODR?     Things are not that simple. People who can’t use digital technologies shall be assisted. We  can offer as a solution support kiosks in courts buildings or in legal aid bureau in some other  public places to help people to file suits digitally.     And, of course, we have to design simple and user -friendly interface to enable as many  people as possible to use the te chnology.       V. ODR AND ARTIFICIAL I NTELLIGENCE   5. Do you think AI nowadays exists in ODR mechanisms?     Not, I am aware of current AI in ODR.        
CDCJ(2018) 5  87 6. Do you think AI will be introduced in the COURTS in the near future?     I have no concrete information about whether it will be introduced.     7. Do you think it might affect the right to a fair trial?     As to the concern AI will substitute human being in DR.   AI can help a person to decide whether to take the case to the court. So, if I have an issue  and I can put it before a  legal bot or robot and it will tell me whether I have chances to win the  case. That is a different question.   Accordingly, the bot can predict chances and I can decide now whether to go or nor go ahead  with my suit.     If you look at Supreme Court jurisprud ence it is usually when the Supreme Court says well  until now we had been adopted one position, however the circumstances in society have  been changed and we have to apply different position now.     So, the jurisprudence is dynamic.     Thus, AI can adopt prev ious court position, but not generate the new one.      I know there is a tool which can predict ECHR decision with 60 % accuracy, but I am not sure  it can predict (generate) changes in jurisprudence.       At the same time, AI can be helpful to judges when de aling with data analysing. In some  cases, it can analyse data in a more efficient way the person does.      VI. ODR AND SECURITY   2. To what extent are ODR mechanisms in your country protected from cyber -attacks?     My impression and my experience is that the main concern is identification.     The general rule is that only someone who needs to have access should have access to this  information.     Since we can’t see parties online, ODR requires digital authorisation.     For instance, we can use credit card identification.     So, this is the main problem.         
CDCJ(2018) 5  88 Pablo Cortes , Prof in Civil Justice at Leicester Law School.     I. INTRODUCTION, BACKGROUND AND EXPLANATION  CLARIFYING THE  FIELD OF RESEARCH     1. What is your personal experience of Online Dispute Resolution and your personal  view on whether Online Dispute Resolution should be used (more widely) in the  courts?     Pablo is a chair in Civil Justice at Leicester Law School. He has been invited to speak in  many international c onferences and expert meetings, particularly on ODR. He is a fellow of  the National Centre for Technology and Dispute Resolutions (University of Massachusetts)  and a member of the Online Dispute Resolution (ODR) Taskforce of the International  Mediation Ins titute and of the ODR Advisory Group of the Civil Justice Council. The ODR  should and will be used in the courts.     II. ODR OVERVIEW   7. Do you have any ODR experience and do you know of mechanisms in your  jurisdiction?     Yes, I do. For instance, I have been involved as an adjudicator for CIDR. It is ODR platform,  designed by MODRIA to resolve aviation complaint from passengers. I receive complaints  online through the platform, I revise them and then take the decision.     That what I will be doing after this interview. It operates in the UK.     As to the Spain, there is one domain names disputes system, which is equivalent to Nominet  in the UK ( the link ).     8. Are ODR techniques used within the courts in your country?     The ODR system in England and Wales is currently being implemented, as part of online  court pilot. Also, we have a MONEYCLAIMS online. Also, we have traffic tribunals, which  deal with claims betwe en citizen and councils that have put a fine. So, the citizens can  challenge this fine via online tribunal.     Spain is less developed. As far as I know there is nothing. There one pilot (but it restricted to  e-filling only).        9. What is your prediction as to the ODR development in your country/ in general (5 or  10 years)?     It is difficult to predict. But it might be an online court with mandatory jurisdiction, which  expects to capture a majority of civil claims.     Online court might be used as a default by 2022.     So, in the next 5 years we are going to see significant development.     Also, we have to activate private initiatives in ODR.       As to the Spain, it’s a matter of political choices. Particularly, the question of support from 
CDCJ(2018) 5  89 government. Perhaps, in  5-10 years it will be developing in gradual manner.         III. GENERAL QUESTION AS TO FAIR TRIAL ISSUES     4. In your opinion, what are the main issues regarding ODR’s influence on fair trial  considerations (Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights)?     The main issue is an access to technology. Especially, for those who are without lawyers.  This group of people may be disadvantaged. Cleary, there is problem.     It is a challenge for undeveloped countries.     It might be an issue in regard to authorisation in terms how to identify a person while logging  in to a system.     5. Do you think ODR processes and procedures work? Do they help resolve disputes  fairly, efficiently and effectively?     Yes. Definitely, it will e nhance access to justice in case the mechanism has been designed  properly.     6. Do you think that ODR processes and procedures could work within the civil justice  system? I.e. within the court system?     It not just could. It should.       IV. ODR AND IMPARTIALITY  OF THE TRIBUNAL   5. Do you think there is a risk the ODR will have negative influence on tribunal’s  impartiality and independence?     No. There is no major challenge. The perception may change via online, but there is no  problem at all.       6. In which scenario ODR may be or may be not conducted in accordance with the  requirement of Article 6 as to the ‘public hearing’ (Article 6)?      I think the problem is minor. If you want face -to-face, you can opt for this. Even video link is  less time -consuming. But the door must be open for those who want to do it face -to-face.  That doesn’t mean the other party should do the same. So, we can ensure the public hearing  by using technologies. Face -to-face should not be the default provision.     7. How will ODR affect the fairness of civil and administrative procedures - please give  some examples…?     The quality of ODR decisions may be lower. It will be cheaper for low value disputes. And it  can be justified by the possibility to review the decision. In general, it ’s not a problem, it’s an  access to justice.         V. ODR AND DIGITAL ILLI TERACY/DIGITAL DIVID E/ACCESS TO THE COUR TS 
CDCJ(2018) 5  90 5. Will ODR have negative influence on the right for a fair trial considering the level of  digital illiteracy/digital divide in Council of Europe  member states/your state?     Yes. It is a major problem. It could be a problem for some individuals with low level of digital  literacy.     6. Could you suggest a solution on how individuals affected can get access to ODR?     We have to create system which will be  assisting these individuals. We can provide  computers in public libraries. So, in England, we have a citizensadvise service.   Also, we have McKenzie friend , when a person does not need to be le gally qualified.           VI. ODR AND ARTIFICIAL I NTELLIGENCE   8. Do you think AI nowadays exists in ODR mechanisms?     No. But, for instance, in the UK pilot it will be a tree of answers.     We have AI in Amazon dispute settlement mechanism.     Sometimes it’s better to provide the solution which might be no so accurate, but it works.     We have AI in law firms – ROSS, for instance.     9. Do you think AI will be introduced in the COURTS in the near future?     It will take time. But, we have computer assistance when we need information on basic level.     10. Do you think it might affect the right to a fair trial?     No. I wouldn’t think so. Going to Amazon example, if do not like a ODR solution, you can  escalate it. If  it is a final decision, it might be a problem.     11. Do you think automation might affect the independence and impartiality of judges and  is there a risk that the removal of discretion and human judgment will lead to prejudice  and stereotyping?     At the basic l evel, maybe yes. But, in general no.     VII. ODR AND SECURITY   3. To what extent are ODR mechanisms in your country protected from cyber -attacks?     Frankly, I have no idea.     TTPS protocol can be used. There is some level of security.     4. In your opinion, what are the main concerns in ODR in terms of digital security?      No. The one that the court use is quite robust. We pay taxes online. So, I don’t think it will be  challenging for the court.         
CDCJ(2018) 5  91 Pavel Loutocky - Masaryk University     I. BACKGROUND AND EXPLA NATION CLARIFYING TH E FIELD OF RESEARCH  LD OF RESEARCH   QUESTIONS     What is your personal experience of Online Dispute Resolution and your personal view on  whether Online Dispute Resolution should be used (more widely) in the courts?     I am doing my PhD in ODR. I have some publication about ODR and consumer claims. I also  went through the ODR systems to check how does it work. I worked with Colin Rule, who has  designed Ebay system and MODRIA. And again, as I am teaching at the university , I showed  the students ODR mechanism.     II. ODR OVERVIEW   10. Do you have any ODR mechanisms in your jurisdiction?     Yes, we do. For instance, we have Youstice in Czeck Republic.      11. Do you know any other ODR mechanisms outside your country?     I don’t know the situation in every state. But, ODR is developed in the United Kingdom and  Netherlands (family cases). I don’t know about other states.     12. Are ODR techniques used within the courts in your country?     We have possibility to file a complainant online. To pay fee. To get basic information about  the case. So, pretty elementary things. In e -justice Czech Republic is in a low position. As a  rule, a paper work has been used. We have also governmental email. So, we have e -filing,  but don’t have ODR as  such.     There is some exclusion in the case of bankruptcy. It works more electronically. But, in other  cases it is so hard to get online.     13. What is your prediction as to the ODR development in your country/ in general (5 or  10 years)?     I am trying to be opt imistic. ODR helps people to overcome the distance. It will help the  parties to submit electronic documents and courts won’t disappear. So, simple questions  should be resolved online. We have to give access to justice online to people in villages.    III. GENERAL QUESTION AS TO FAIR TRIAL ISSUES     7. In your opinion, what are the main issues regarding ODR’s influence on fair trial  considerations (Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights)?     Perhaps, one of the issues is that witnesses can be influe nced while resolving a dispute  online. However, I don’t see much differences. In general, ODR will have positive influence  on dispute resolution process.     8. Do you think ODR processes and procedures work? Do they help resolve disputes  fairly, efficiently and  effectively?   Yes.    9. Do you think that ODR processes and procedures could work within the civil justice 
CDCJ(2018) 5  92 system? I.e. within the court system?   Yes.    IV. ODR AND IMPARTIALITY  OF THE TRIBUNAL   8. Do you think there is a risk the ODR will have negative influence on tribunal’s  impartiality and independence?     The thing is that the judges will be the same in ODR procedures. So, it is not the issue of  ODR, but of the bias of judges in general. So far, decision offered by private organization via  ODR are high quality solutions. Thus, online decision offered by judges will be good enough,  but it will depend on case -by-case basis.     The technologies won’t cause the difference in this regard.     9. In which scenario ODR may be or may be not conducted in accordance with the  requirement of Article 6 as to the ‘public hearing’ (Article 6)?      To be honest, the courtroom is a limited space. So, using ODR we can ensure public hearing  for unlimited number of people. For instance, we could use YouTube video link to ensure  public hearing unless we have some privacy issues at hand.     V. ODR AND DIGITAL ILLI TERACY/DIGITAL DIVID E/ACCESS TO THE COUR TS  7. Will ODR have negative influence on the right for a fair trial considering the level of  digital illiteracy/digital divide in Council of Europe member states/your state?     There is an issue is here. How many people use modern technologies? In some countries  more, in some less.      8. Could you suggest a solution on how indi viduals affected can get access to ODR?     But, we have to balance by way of creating supportive programmes for the disadvantaged  people.   At the same time, ODR shall be a matter of choice. People with restricted level of digital  illiteracy should remain a choice between ODR and ordinary court.      In general, we have to introduce ODR gradually while educating people.     VI. ODR AND ARTIFICIAL I NTELLIGENCE   12. Do you think AI nowadays exists in ODR mechanisms?     Answering the question, we have to define what AI is. We can observe machine learning on  eBay.  There was a project in Soviet Union aimed to create machine justice – computer that  was supposed to resolve disputes. But, it failed.     13. Do you think AI will be introduced in the COURTS in the near future?     Perhaps no. Or on the very basic level.     14. Do you think it might affect the right to a fair trial?   No.     15. Do you think automation might affect the independence and impartiality of judges and  is there a risk that the removal of discretion and human judgment will lead to prejudice  and stereotyping?  
CDCJ(2018) 5  93   AI won’t substitute human being. But, in any case, any decision taken by AI shall be  evaluated and assessed.     VII. ODR AND SECURITY   5. To what extent are ODR mechanisms in your country protected from cyber -attacks?     Cyber security is not only a problem of ODR. The situation really depends on national level of  awareness.  In Czeck Republic the personal data is secured.   6. In your opinion, wh at are the main concerns in ODR in terms of digital security?      Possibility of influence of the third parties       
CDCJ(2018) 5  94 Dr Stefaan Voet  - Institute for Procedural Law - the University of Leuven   I. BACKGROUND AND EXPLA NATION CLARIFYING TH E FIELD OF RESEARCH  LD OF RESEARCH     What is your personal experience of Online Dispute Resolution and your personal view on  whether Online Dispute Resolution should be used (more widely) in the courts?     Stefaan Voet  is an associate professor at the University of Leuven and a host professor at  the University of Hasselt in Belgium. Before that he was a doctoral research and teaching  assistant at Ghent University. Stefaan teaches national, European and international civ il  procedure.     Publication in ODR https://www.law.kuleuven.be/pub/en/staff/00103885       II. ODR OVERVIEW   14. Do you have any ODR mechanisms in your jurisdiction?      There is one platform in ARD – BelMed  (Belgium mediation). It was established in 2010 -2011  by the government. As a consumer, you can go to platform and the system will send your  dispute to ADR entity. For instance, second hand car – commission on second hand vehicles  (online process).     Anothe r aspect is that statistics says that not a lot of people use the ODR platform tool. But,  what you see is that BelMed offers a lot of information. And there are thousands of people  who use this information.     The second platform – consumer ADR platform. So , there are two platforms, which is crazy  and stupid.      15. Are ODR techniques used within the courts in your country?     In 2001 the Minister of Justice had a plan – Phoenix system – online dispute resolution. Now,  the policy to use the platform for publishing  decisions and track the statistics.     But this week, the Minister of Justice announced the new system – JustOn. Unique system  for the consumer and civil justice system. If I want to pay fine I can go to JustOn. Lawyers will  communicate with court          16. What is your prediction as to the ODR development in your country/ in general (5 or  10 years)?     It is an evolution we can’t stop. The fact that it’s technically possible. First of all, we have to  create TRUST in these systems. Secondly, we have enough safe guard in regard privacy,  impartiality etc.     III. GENERAL QUESTION AS TO FAIR TRIAL ISSUES     10. In your opinion, what are the main issues regarding ODR’s influence on fair trial  considerations (Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights)?     I don’t think it will be an issue.   We need similar policy like in ODR in consumer ADR.    
CDCJ(2018) 5  95   11. Do you think ODR processes and procedures work? Do they help resolve disputes  fairly, efficiently and effectively?   Yes.    12. Do you think that ODR processes and procedur es could work within the civil justice  system? I.e. within the court system?   Yes.    IV. ODR AND IMPARTIALITY  OF THE TRIBUNAL   10. Do you think there is a risk the ODR will have negative influence on tribunal’s  impartiality and independence?     Judges remains the same, so no problem at all. But we can change the delay in proceedings.  ODR will make the processes much effective, speedy and cheaper.       11. In which scenario ODR may be or may be not conducted in accordance with the  requirement of Article 6 as to the ‘public  hearing’ (Article 6)?      I think it is a very narrow view. If one of the cases will come before ECHR, they will give a  current interpretation of ‘public hearing’.   If one of the parties really want  to do this, we should provide this party with the option to have  this ordinary hearing.     We can also use YouTube. In Belgium, everything in writing. In Sweden, for instance civil  cases are in oral.     So, as long as you offer the option of ordinary meanin g you comply with Article 6 in any case.   V. ODR AND DIGITAL ILLI TERACY/DIGITAL DIVID E/ACCESS TO THE COUR TS  9. Will ODR have negative influence on the right for a fair trial considering the level of  digital illiteracy/digital divide in Council of Europe member states/your state?     Yes, it might be an issue. It depends on the country.       10. Could you suggest a solution on how individuals affected can get access to ODR?     Public libraries. Assisting programmes.     11. Do you see risks that certain individuals (with physical or mental disabilities/sight  problems/ socially disadvantaged/the elderly) will find it more difficult to obtain access  to justice?     No! On the contrary, in will be helpful for people who can’t travel because of disability.     The system will have to adapt itself. You can use a part of public environment.         VI. ODR AND ARTIFICIAL I NTELLIGENCE   16. Do you think AI nowadays exists in ODR mechanisms?     It exists. But, you have to make a distinction between court settings and non -court settings.   Amazon, Ebay – we can see elements of AI there so far.    
CDCJ(2018) 5  96 17. Do you think AI will be introduced in the COURTS in the near future?     I think, the AI will be use for the facilitation of data bases. I don’t think it will be acceptable to  replace humans except from the smal l disputes.     For instance, the Minister of Justice presented the plan to introduce AI court for dispute in  regard to fines for illegal parking.      18. Do you think it might affect the right to a fair trial?     Not really.     VII. ODR AND SECURITY   7. To what extent are ODR mechanisms in your country protected from cyber -attacks?     I am not a specialist in cyber security. But, the government shall address this concern.     One of the reasons why Phoenix has failed is that government did not create enough  safeguards, particularly in digital security.     So, we need TRUST and SAFEGUARDS.         
CDCJ(2018) 5  97 Darin Thomson  - Council of Europe Project on ODR   Interview roadmap   I. BACKGROUND AND EXP LANATION CLARIFYING THE FIELD  OF RESEARCH LD OF RE SEARCH    Interview about Online Dispute Resolution and the Courts (not  Alternative Dispute Resolution). Looking at civil litigation and the  administrative courts (not the criminal courts and criminal justice system)   Two aspects: 1) use of ODR techniques in the COURTS and 2) possible  interface between the courts and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)/  Online Dispute Resolution (ODR).   1) Use of IT/network technologies in the courts (specific to the cou rts and  litigation processes):   -e-filing  -online hearings   -online adjudication   -online techniques for the preparation and presentation of the evidence  (including electronic evidence; for example in the common law context,  e-discovery)   -online platforms   -online adjudication   -moving from physical courts to virtual courts   -use of artificial intelligence/automation to:    Refine issues    Analyse issues    Decision -making   2) Interface/interoperability (?) between ADR/ODR and court procedures,  for example (and this may vary between jurisdictions):    Enforcement of online arbitration under the New York Convention    Recognition of an online mediation settlement by a consent order or  a notary public (meaning it has the same legal status as a judgment,  ie it is enforceable)    Court -annexed pre -trial ODR (ie the parties must attempt some form  of online ODR before allowing to proceed) or cost penalties if they do  not attempt (online) mediation      10 minutes   QUESTIONS     2. What is your personal experience of Online Dispute Resolution  and your personal view on whether Online Dispute Resolution  should be used (more widely) in the courts?     I have been personally involved and have led multiple ODR  initiatives in BC, including:    Development of Consumer Protection BC ODR consumer  pilot in 2011 with Modria    Development of Property Assessment Appeal Board (an  administrative tribunal) ODR initiative beginning in 2011  with Modria    Development of the Civil Resolution Tribunal (CRT) (an  online administrative tribunal with civil jurisdiction) in 2011    Instructed the drafters on legislation to make ODR part of  the body of law in BC and to create the authority for the  
CDCJ(2018) 5  98 CRT in 2011 -2012    Participated in the design for the technology and  processes for the CRT beginning in 2012 (ongoing)    Drafted the CRT rules of procedure 2015 -2016    Led the knowledge engineering work for the CRT Solution  Explorer ODR expert system (similar to phase 1 of the  proposed online courts for Eng & W)    Former CDN delegate to th e United Nations Commission  on International Trade Law ODR working group    Instructed Legal Information Technology law school  courses at the University of Victoria and Osgoode Hall  (York U) law schools, including a multi -week ODR  simulation involving student s from Canada, the US and  England    Currently co -instructing knowledge engineering courses at  Thompson Rivers University and University of Ottawa Law  Schools    Participated in one of the Civil Justice Council ODR  Working Group meetings in London, provided on a nd off  consultation with individual members, HMCS  representatives and judiciary.    Consulted with Lord Justice Briggs leading up to his  reports on ODR    Part of a team developing new ODR initiatives for BC that  touch on other areas for administrative tribunal s, family  justice other administration of justice issues       More: http://darinthompson.ca/about/       II. ODR OVERVIEW    17. Are you aware of any ODR procedures and processes within your  jurisdiction (nationally or regionally)?   - Yes, many detailed above. The CRT may be the only public system based ODR tribunal of its kind in the world   - Ontario is planning to create a new “Condo Authority” that is  apparently going to include ODR   - There is also a low volume small claims O DR pilot led by the  Vancouver -based Justice Education Society   - The Vancouver -based Legal Services Society currently offers  “MyLawBC” which is based on the Rechtwijzer and Modria  platforms.   18. Are you aware of any ODR processes and procedures which have  been integrated into the civil and administrative justice procedure? If  so, do you think that ODR works in this regard?   - The Property Assessment Appeal Board and the CRT, each  mentioned above, are both deeply integrated into the civil/admin  justice context. They  are both achieving very positive results.   19. Do you have any tribunals which use ODR mechanisms?   - Yes, the CRT is a leader in this respect.   - The Property Assessment Appeal Board initiative recently faced  an interruption when the ODR platform provider ended their  service agreement. We’re working on onboarding the tribunal  onto a new platform.  20 minutes  
CDCJ(2018) 5  99 20. Are you aware of any other ODR mechanisms outside yo ur country?   - Yes – but none that your group wouldn’t already know about   21. Are ODR mechanisms used within the courts in your country?   - No.   - I heard that the Quebec Court of Appeal was using video for  mediations a few year ago. Unfortunately, I have no informati on  or contacts on this anecdotal example.   22. What type of ODR techniques/online filing/e -filing/other IT &  networking technologies are used in your country?   - I’ll limit my answer to BC:   - We started e -filing in 2005   - We have online court file access (since 2005 )  - I don’t consider e -filing or online court file access to constitute  ODR unless there are actual dispute resolution activities involved  in the system.   23. Do you have a distinct ODR procedure (in the civil or administrative  procedure system) or are there pla ns to introduce one?   - I think this Q is answered above, but will be happy to provide  more detail if necessary.   24. What is your prediction as to the ODR development in your country/  in general (5 or 10 years)?   - I continue to be amazed at the inaction among lead ing justice  stakeholders when it comes to conceptualizing and piloting ODR  initiatives, let alone implementing them.   - I can’t confidently say any new initiatives will reach the stage of  piloting or implementation in the next 5 hears.   - However, I know in BC  that ODR has become “normalized” very  deeply in a relatively short amount of time (5 years).   - We had to “break the ice” and actually use ODR – even small  scale initiatives – to make this happen. But it led to the current  situation where BC has multiple OD R initiatives involving multiple  organizations.     *I’ll use this spot to personally offer to assist and/or lead any new ODR  initiatives in any other jurisdiction. I have taken several from the concept  phase to the implementation phase, covering the tech, legislation, rules,  workflows, user -focused design work, evaluation and more, and am firmly  convinced that ODR is an effective response to many of the challenges  facing justice systems everywhere.       III. GENERAL QUESTION AS TO FAIR TRIAL ISSUES      13. In your opinion, what are the main issues regardi ng ODR’s influence  on fair trial considerations (Article 6 of the European Convention of  Human Rights)?   - In a relative sense, I haven’t come across any specific ODR  issues that have a more significant impact than those already  found in the current court process.   - I believe the “digital divide” is narrower than the gap in access to  justice for most people. Tha t said, I consider the digital divide to  be a very important issue.   - I think many of the potential fairness issues come down to  process design, and aren’t uniquely a result of technology.   - I am not persuaded that the court practice of assessing the  credibi lity of witness evidence is actually effective or supported 15 minutes  
CDCJ(2018) 5  100 by independent scientific evidence. In fact, it’s my understanding  that in addition to believing we are good “lie detectors” we are  actually very bad lie detectors. I believe this is a dangerous  combination of circumstances.   - I believe that concerns about varying levels of literacy are  important, but that over -romanticized conceptions of court that  suggest people get to walk in and “tell their story” to a judge  completely mischaracterize the actual  court process, with its  mountains of difficult forms, long and complicated rules of  procedure and the 98% chance (actual number) that you won’t  have your dispute resolved in a trial.   - On the positive side, I believe that ODR can effectively  incorporate pr ocedures into the platform to reduce the impact on  procedures on outcomes for non -experts, including self represented litigants.   14. Do you think ODR processes and procedures work? Do they help  resolve disputes fairly, efficiently and effectively?   - I know they  work.   - Merely doing ODR doesn’t guarantee success. Design,  resources and effective administration are critically important.   15. Do you think that ODR processes and procedures should be made  mandatory if introduced into court procedures? If so, at what stage of  the dispute and why?   - I believe that the appropriate way to handle this issue is to make  ODR the main channel, but not the only channel. People should  still be able to use other communication channels including  telephone and paper. But there should be in centives to use the  ODR channel (e.g. fee discounts).   - If the system were primarily used by lawyers, I’d consider making  ODR mandatory in an attempt to overcome the cultural  resistance to new ways of interacting.   16. Do you think that ODR processes and proced ures could work within  the court system?   - Yes, provided the system was designed well.   - Merely automating existing court procedures in an ODR platform  may be unsuccessful.   - Making an ODR system voluntary, secondary to another system,  uncertain, etc can also set it up for failure.   17. Do you think it may be more difficult to implement ODR techniques in  the civil law court system (compared to the more flexible common  law system)? If you think so, why?   - I’m not an expert in civil law. But in my experience, most issu es  are not unique to ODR – but tend to boil down to design and  implementation.     IV. ODR AND IMPARTIALITY  OF THE TRIBUNAL    12. Do you think there is a risk the ODR will have negative influence on  the tribunal’s impartiality and independence?   - I can’t imagine any objective reasons why this would be true,  merely based on the reliance on ODR.   13. In which scenario ODR may be or may be not conducted in  accordance with the requirement of Article 6 as to the ‘public  hearing’ (Article 6)?    - If hearings are conducted asynchronously (e.g. on the  documents) then it shouldn’t be a new issue.  10 minutes  
CDCJ(2018) 5  101 - If hearings are held synchronously, they can be streamed live, as  well as archived for viewing at any time. I’d suggest this  arrangement would increase publ ic access and openness.   14. How will ODR affect the fairness of civil and administrative  procedures - please give some examples…?   - ODR can reduce the procedural burden on parties by building  procedure into the platform   - ODR can make it easier for non -experts to think about their  interactions, avoid having to respond immediately, and  expressing more emotion than they would if they had more time   - ODR can make it much easier for non -experts to get help from a  lawyer, trusted friend or family member   - ODR can make it ea sier for people who don’t use the language  of the proceedings as their first language, particularly if they can  get help from a family member or trusted friend.   - Poorly designed ODR platforms will indeed some people at a  disadvantage if they are struggling  with the technology while they  should be focusing on their disputes   - I commented above on the common concern expressed about  the perceived need to assess the credibility of witnesses in  person   V. ODR AND DIGITAL ILLI TERACY/DIGITAL DIVID E/ACCESS T O  THE COURTS    12. Will ODR have negative influence on the right for a fair trial  considering the level of digital illiteracy/digital divide in Council of  Europe member states/your state?   - It certainly could   - Design of processes would determine the scale of impact.   - Allowing people to participate remotely and asynchronously  would open new opportunities for getting (affordable) support  and could result in a net positive influence on the right to a fair  trial  - In my experience, setting up a multi -channel system is an  effective way to respond to this concern   13. Do you have civil or administrative trials where the litigant appears in  person?   - Yes  14. In your opinion, do legal representatives suffer from digital illiteracy  and will this affect the outcome of cases and have an impact on  fairness?   - If a legal representative isn’t researching his/her area using  electronic tools, I’d question whether (s)he is meeting ethical  obligations to act in the best interest of client   15. Do you see risks that certain individuals (with physical or mental  disabilities/sight problems/ socially disadvantaged/the elderly) will  find it more difficult to obtain access to justice?   - Depending on the design of any ODR system, it’s a definite  possibility. Bu t in the system we designed and implemented in  BC, we actually do much more checking and customization than  courts do. In addition, we offer free telephone interpreters for  different languages.   - We have also consulted extensively with advocates who tend to   serve traditionally disadvantaged and marginalized groups   16. What impact will ODR and automation have on access to justice?   - It can be both positive and negative  10 minutes  
CDCJ(2018) 5  102 - Careful user -focused design, user testing, consultation, ongoing  user feedback collection, contin uous improvement, etc. can all  contribute to making an ODR system superior to a traditional  court or tribunal – but there’s not guarantee that this will happen  merely by deciding to “do ODR”     VI. ODR AND ARTIFICIAL I NTELLIGENCE    19. Do you think AI nowadays exists in ODR mechanisms?   - I have participated in the creation of an expert system that  provides problem diagnosis, information, self -help and streaming  functions – all using “1st wave AI” (i.e. handcrafted, rule -based  knowledge)   - I also wrote a book on the methodology for doing this. It’s still in  the editing stages – but I’d be happy to send a copy anyway   20. Do you think AI will be introduced in the COURTS in the near future?   - I’m not sure if COURTS is a reference to a specific body – but it  we’re r eferring to courts and tribunals generally, I don’t think  many will even adopt 1st wave AI anytime soon   - The “Tier One” planned for the online courts in Eng & W. may  use some AI similar to the type we’ve implemented in BC   21. Do you think it might affect the r ight to a fair trial?   - Yes it might. But it isn’t an inevitability. I believe AI can be  “audited” to respond to potential biases in ways that human  decision makers never are   22. Do you think automation might affect the independence and  impartiality of judges an d is there a risk that the removal of discretion  and human judgment will lead to prejudice and stereotyping?   - I’m not sure what this question is asking specifically – but it may  be addressed in my answer immediately above   - It’s certainly possible to “code” b iases and prejudices into an  algorithm. But it’s also possible to remove them. This is  something that’s much harder to do in humans, as far as my  understanding goes in this area.  15 minutes   VII. ODR AND SECURITY    8. To what extent are ODR mechanisms in your country protected from  cyber -attacks?   - We have conducted Privacy Impact Assessments and Security  Risk Threat Assessments for our current system   - We also rely on the commercially reasonable (or better) security  nativ e to the platform we’re using – which we believe to be used  by large organizations handling a much higher volumes of  transactions in other areas that also touch on serious issues and  large sums of money   9. In your opinion, what are the main concerns in ODR in  terms of  digital security?    - I know many people question how you establish identity in an  ODR system. I think there are ways to discourage fraudulent  abuse of these platforms, but recognize that it’s difficult to make  them truly “fraud proof”. I hold this  same belief with traditional  court and tribunal processes. I also note that I’ve never asked to  provide ID in a courtroom in any appearances I’ve made.    5 minutes   VIII.

CDCJ(2018) 5  103 ODR MECHANISMS IN THE CO URTS - THIS SECTION  RELATES TO THE 2ND P ART OF THE RESEARCH:  THE  INTERFACE BETWEEN TH E COURTS AND ADR   1. Do the courts in your jurisdiction recognize and enforce an arbitration  award which was made through online arbitration (using an onl ine  platform, remotely)? Is there any jurisprudence in this respect?   - I’m not sure. Presumably they would if it met our legislative  requirements as to the validity of an arbitral award in all other  respects (i.e. I’m not sure the form of interaction is rele vant). But  I’m no expert in this area. If it’s held to be critically important, I  can direct you to an expert.   2. Do the civil procedure rules in your country recognize mediation  settlements as enforceable “consent orders”, is there a procedure  whereby a med iation settlement would be recognized and enforced?  If yes would this also apply to an online mediation settlement?   - As far as I’m aware, an agreement resulting from a mediation is  not directly enforceable in my jurisdiction. You would have to  “sue on the a greement” in a new court proceeding   - When we created the legislation for the online Civil Resolution  Tribunal we (i.e. the legislature of BC) specifically and  deliberately gave it the authority to convert agreements reached  through its facilitation (mediati on-like) process into enforceable  orders.   3. Do the rules in your country provide for any form of mandatory ADR,  ordered by the courts?   - Yes.   4. If so could this mandatory form of ADR be conducted through ODR  (for example: online mediation)?   - Not that I’m aware of.  10 minutes       
CDCJ(2018) 5  104 Angie Raymond   16 NOVEMBER 2017 - ODR RESEARCH   Your personal experience with ODR?   Angie has been involved in international commercial law and arbitration for some time.  Through this sh e came across new cutting -edge mechanisms and technology within this  field, and naturally online mechanisms and ODR. Angie has been involved in ODR trade law  with the UN and has attended numerous conferences on this subject. She has also been  involved with the US State Department. Angie writes extensi vely on ODR.   ODR Overview   Using ODR in courts is well past due date. While ODR is hard to define, it should be used  more within the justice system. The current system is burdensome, and we should do more  to ensure that there is access to justice and fairne ss. ODR can be used to achieve this. But  there is a difference between using simple ODR mechanisms such as e -filing and truly  having disputes resolved online.   One issue with having a whole dispute resolved online is the effect it may have on  populations a cross the world. If resolving a dispute online is the only opportunity that one  has, then you will disenfranchise a very large part of the population. Many people do not  have the skills to have a dispute resolved online; they may be digitally illiterate or  not have  access to such technology. This is the opposite of what we want. It is a similar issue when  the EU tried to get rid of cheques; many people could not cope with a system which was not  paper based – they did not have access to / or the ability to u se technology. Thus, if ODR is  implemented, there will be a period of time where one must operate a manual system.   Another question to ask is whether systems operate in an equal way? Does the person who  has access to technology and the skills to use it ha ve better access to justice than another  person who does not have access to such technology?   Bandwidth issue will not be quickly overcome. Rural populations in developed countries  have issues with accessing the internet.   Another important issue is when ODR  systems are designed by private entities. The way in  which the system designed could colour the way people see things. The system could  change an outcome and lead to an outcome depending on the way in which it is designed.  There might also be too much tru st in digital technology? Should there be oversight of this?   How does the state regulate the way in which technology is developed for ODR for courts?  Who develops the technology – private companies. Information is a commodity. Most people  do not understan d this. But information is very powerful. Money is in the information. System  is a sinkhole of money and time. Sell process but keep information. Information has  tremendous value. Companies can gain a massive competitive advantage by using  information. The re is a rise of information Power brokers. Government needs to consider  whether we need to have this information system, and also who the people are who have  power over it. How do we know that these companies with power over information will not  use this i nformation against us? This view is not widely shared. Government must keep an  eye on this. Information might not be a good steward for justice.   We could find out 10 years down the line, after an ODR system has been implemented, that  companies who develop ed the platforms and software have used the system to gain an  advantage through their control over information, and which has negative implications for the 
CDCJ(2018) 5  105 justice system. Money is in the information. Use information they way the Power broker  wants to use it. Keep an eye out ahead of time.   Canada has a good system, which is under a government structure. There has not been  private control over the system. Government has control. This is different to private  companies who create ODR systems, such as Amazon, w here it is all based on agreement  and the ODR mechanisms contained within the terms and conditions of the agreement. So,  Canada does have some oversight. If there is an issue with the system one can challenge  the government.   Court system beginning to use m ore ODR for simple ODR things such as e -filing, tickets etc.  Justice based kiosks. Automated disputes – being used in ODR. Drop down lists. Movement  and development here.   In court room – videos, e -filing. Videos – recreation videos? – technology behind thi s. Will  come up in ODR. There is an issue with how the video is created, and the inherent biases  within that system.   In the USA, ODR is otherwise mainly used to resolve private disputes.   While we are not at the point of fully implementing ODR into the jus tice system, the process  has begun.   Within the next 10 years there will be a lot of automation of disputes, which can be done  through an app. Simple. E -filing.  The introduction of technology into the justice system will  not happen within the next 10 years, particularly in the USA. There is a culture in the US that  disputes should be resolved in person – this is the understanding of justice. Older  generation. Inh erent bias – should be face to face.   Fair Trial considerations   By using ODR we may have to jeopardise an individual’s right to a fair trial by not requiring  the individual to be in person, in order to find out whether it does truly harm the overall right  to fair trial. This needs to be tested. It could be beneficial in the long term. In the USA one  has the right to face the accuser. Face -to-face in is imbedded in the justice culture. Only  slowly moving to video testimony. It won’t work in US. Does have iss ues. Waiving that right?  – part waiver. Arbitration provides a good opportunity to create own justice system.   Right to present a case should be fine in civil cases. Long past days where we cannot do  things online. No need to be in person.   If a civil dispute is resolved online, through compulsory means, there shouldn’t be an issue  (assuming that the system has been developed and programmed in a fair way, and all  persons have access to and the skills to use technology). There is no reason why  someone  sitting in front of computer cannot resolve a dispute, except for the issue of ‘open hearings’.  This could be an issue. How would one accomplish having an open hearing through online  mechanisms? This may be a technology based issue. It is an issue  of transparency. Perhaps  one could have an open broadcast. One could have an open court room – but not so open  that anyone can access it. Close streams. Password. Etc.   AI is already being used. The issue within AI is the debate between having a structured   learning AI system or an unstructured system. An unstructured system would have  boundaries for what the system can learn. If you let AI learn what it wants – it will learn some  bad things about us. An example of this is when our bad language is picked up.  With  structured learning – humans still have control – teach it what we want it to learn. 
CDCJ(2018) 5  106 Automation is basic AI. In justice system? – already is to some extent – law firms use it to  determine settlement points, to think through information. AI already pa rt of decision making  process even if person appears. It is part of a larger tree.   Design system to include advice on what legal rights are? Then could use it.   Judges being replace by AI – yes, this is possible. However, judges serve multiple roles.  They are not just decision makers. They also act as umpires over the court process. AI can  thus be used for decision -making but maybe not for the judges’ other roles such as being an  umpire. If AI is used, it must be used carefully. It will take more than a lif etime to get to that  point, however.   An example of using AI in decision -making could be with regard to sentencing. Essential,  through court mandated sentencing rules, sentencing is like a drop -down menu.   Technology can help resolve issues pertaining to d ecision -making and judge biases and  errors. AI can be used as part of process but maybe it should not be the decision maker  itself.   ODR processes through ODR or other alternative dispute resolution means enforced by  courts in the USA? Are there issues with  courts enforcing this? This has probably not been  challenged yet. Regular process – probably enforced through normal arbitral awards. Hidden  clauses – agreement. Court would probably enforce arbitral award unless it is challenged by  someone based on the g round of ODR not being arbitration, or unfair etc.       
CDCJ(2018) 5  107 Colin Rule : 18h30 – 19h00 , 2 OCTOBER 2017   ODR RESEARCH   Your personal experience with ODR?   Colin has been in dispute resolution for 27 years. He came across this while at College and  furthered his intere st and understanding in dispute resolution by undergoing training in  mediation. Colin thereafter worked within the field of dispute resolution as a graduate. Being  interested in technology, Colin combined his expertise in dispute resolution and technology  and became the General Manager of the organisation “mediate.com”, a platform where  dispute resolution could take place via the use of technology.   Colin thereafter founded the company, Online Resolution, and authored a book on issues  pertaining to ODR. Col in was thereafter approached by E -Bay, where he pioneered their  resolution centre, and at which he for 8 years.   In 2011 Colin moved from E -Bay to – modria.com. Here, Colin used the technology which he  developed at E -Bay and used it for a wider client base . Modria.com was sold to Tyler  Technology, which develops and markets court case management systems. Here, Colin  Integrated the technology developed at E -Bay and Modria.com into the court management  system.   Colin is a currently the co -chair of the Advisor y Board of the National Centre for Technology  and Dispute Resolution. This centre is involved with developing field of ODR. Developing the  field of ODR and ethical standards therein.     1. ODR OVERVIEW     ODR is not a centrally managed process. It is therefore important to develop yardsticks and  standards for its operation.   Colin has played a pivotal role in the International Council for Online Dispute Resolution  (“ICODR”). ICODR is at the forefront of dev eloping ethical standards for ODR processes and  mechanisms. http://icodr.org/index.php/standards/   Regarding ODR procedures, generally, existing ODR procedures are not really focused on  procedural safeguards. They are focused more on the efficiency of resol ving disputes.  Almost all disputes that are brought before ODR processes are small claims. At E -Bay, the  average claim was about $75. Such claims would not typically be brought before traditional  courts. Resolving disputes before courts is very costly and time-consuming, and in cases  with small claims, the costs far outweigh the benefits.   There has therefore been a move away from traditional court processes. Litigants therefore  either avoid approaching court to resolve the dispute, or seek alternative mean s to resolve  them.   Thus, ODR mechanisms evolved to resolve these smaller disputes efficiently and effectively,  without the procedural safeguards in the traditional court system, which are costly.   ODR processes were also developed for algorithmic disputes – dispute that arise out of  software programmes.      
CDCJ(2018) 5  108 2. FAIR TRIAL ISSUES     To ensure that disputes are resolved fairly, there is a need to develop standards. ICODR is  playing an important role in this regard, particularly in the USA.   There is also a need to verify standards. Government intervention? Who verifies this? Hotly  debated. In the EU there would probably be more government intervention. In the USA this  would not be the case as the government is traditionally quite hands off.   ODR should be jurisdiction independent. It may not be possible at this stage to have a  worldwide set of ethical standards for ODR but it is important to develop standards for  private use. This would involve self -verification and self -regulation.   An issue with this is if there is self -regulation and no government intervention and regulation  there may be a proliferation of standards.   Colin says that at Tyler Technology this issue of mandatory ODR processes before court is a  hot topic. How can you integrate O DR processes into the court process? E -filing of a  dispute, then how is it resolved? Tyler Technology has developed a procedure by which a  dispute is filed, and a hearing is scheduled. Thereafter, the parties are guided towards ODR  procedures in the meanti me. Parties decide – can opt out of this.   Colin is of the view that even though the parties can opt out of the process, they will make  use of tool. Parties will probably engage in back and forth dialogue and will seek to achieve  a settlement agreement. Co urt certifies settlement agreement. Thus, ODR is used as a first  step in the resolution process. It is not the absolute determinant of the dispute. Parties still  have access to the traditional court system and can opt out of the process.   In British Columbi a, there is a compulsory ODR process that has developed and has been  implemented. Here, certain disputes must be resolved through ODR mechanisms and  procedures and the parties to these disputes can no longer go to traditional court. No in person hearing. E valuative process.   In the UK, compulsory ODR procedures are being introduced through HM Online court.   Colin is of the view that compulsory ODR procedures can be fair. ODR will become definitive  way these disputes are handled. What is required to achieve t his is sequencing and change  management.   ODR can be fair. It can be transparent, fair and parties can be heard. There is a need for  ODR to be confidential. Courts have enshrined this. Good faith negotiation. Not others to  see. Negotiation and mediation nee ds to be confidential. Evaluation can be transparent.  Awards and decisions can be redacted, they can show the decision but not the negotiation  phases to achieve it.     
CDCJ(2018) 5  109 Fernando Esteban de la Rosa:  14H00 – 15H20  - 4 DECEMBER 2017   ODR RESEARCH   Personal exper ience with ODR   Fernando is a Professor in Private International Law at the University of Grenada. Within the  realm of Private International Law Fernando came across Alternative Dispute Resolution  (“ADR”), in particular to issues concerning international consumer contract s and disputes.  Fernando has written various books and articles on this field.   Within the area of consumer protection and ADR, Fernando found that the rules appeared to  have no application at all; only few consumers actually had the ability of submitting claims  and of enforcing their rights. There was a need to form effective entities that could provide  consumers with and ADR solution. Fernando subsequently wrote a paper on consumer  arbitration and online arbitration. He worked with Pablo Cortes wherein th ey share  experiences with ADR and ODR. This led to developments within the field. Fernando has  also worked with Julia Hornle, wherein they have assessed ADR and ODR within the EU  and have developed proposals which have found their way into the drafts for D irectives and  Regulations on consumer protection and ADR. A lot of work has come from this research  and as such Fernando has been involved with projects from the Spanish Ministry of  Economy, which has led to the adoption of ADR legislation in Spain. Fernan do’s research  had an impact on this new legislation. Fernando is in the process of publishing a new book  on ADR and ODR. He is also conducting further research in ADR to be used as a reference  point to spread new knowledge.   ODR overview   There are big oppor tunities within the field of ODR. The first set of work that should come  from this is the development of consumer protection principles for ODR. Fernando has been  involved in drafting consumer protection principles for ODR within the EU. This was one of  Fernando’s first papers in ODR.   There would need to be experimental projects with regard to the use and implementation of  ODR. Initially, there was not much work with regard to ODR and consumer protection. There  was no regulation. Therefore, there was a nee d to develop principles for good quality ODR.  Therefore, the aim should be to develop principles for ODR. This should not only be general  but also regard should be had to special needs within the private international law system. A  new treatment for ODR in  the EU ODR platform in cross border situations should also be  considered.   With regard to ODR, what Fernando has found is that the treatment of consumers in the  ODR is not satisfactory. When consumers file claims on an ODR platform it is not  guaranteed that the consumers are aware that that they are renouncing their right of acce ss  to court. This is because such a waiver is not always available in the consumer’s own  language. It is very important that the party who is going through an ADR/ODR process is  aware of their waiving this right. Thus, EU Regulations need to be modified.   General Risks and Principles of ODR   Information for the parties about the ODR process is important. It may not be possible to  oblige people to use online courts as this could impede the parties’ right of access to court.  There should always be the possibil ity for parties to access courts outside of technology.  Otherwise issues may arise regarding access to justice. Not everyone has the knowledge to 
CDCJ(2018) 5  110 use nor the access to technology. Technology must make it easier but not to hinder access  to justice.   There wi ll be an embrace of technology more and more. People must be allowed to use  technology to make life easier. This can be made simple. There is a need to adapt our  processes and procedures in order to fit to ODR systems. They can help to resolve conflicts.  But there is a long way to go. But need for development and adaptation. Discover what the  mission is for ODR? Will it help?   ODR and the Right to a Fair Trial   ODR and having an online court could assist parties in having their dispute resolved in  advance. If  online court grants parties access to legal advice wherein they may know their  rights and how to go about solving dispute, before going to court, this could be  advantageous. Robot decision making, in which AI is used to give advice and perhaps a  proposal before the parties head to court is a good thing. Most parties do not want to go to  court. This should be the first mission for ODR in courts. Offer a solution to the parties. Get  parties to agree. Judge can then affirm this. Automated negotiation could al so be useful.   If whole process is ODR, then this poses a different question as it leads to a substitution of  traditional court proceedings. What changes are needed? It is not a bad idea, but there is a  need to maintain the normal system. There could be th e possibility of creating a special  online court for people who want to follow this, while also maintaining the normal court.  People should not be obliged to use the ODR system. But could be a good idea if law offers  it. Benefit to society – speedy justice .   Canada use – UK proposed – need to have a look at this. We have technology. Must look at  it and assess how it can be beneficial to us.   ODR and Enforcement   Fernando does not foresee a problem for courts enforcing awards that are made online. The  Electron ic character of an award should not be an issue.   ODR and change to the current justice system   Impression on civil law jurisdiction embracing change to justice system by implementing  ODR? There is a need to come with support from all stakeholders – judges, attorneys,  politicians  – have their say – is it good for justice? This could be possible. With regard to  technology and changes in law, in 2015, in Spain, there was a change to how administrative  files can be managed and resolved using electronic means. T here is now a law of general  application in Spain wherein all administrative files are required to be managed and resolved  by electronic means if a citizen requests this.   Changes are happening – new laws are being embraced. All stakeholders need to think  about how to embrace it.   It does not make a difference in the change is happening within a civil law jurisdiction or  within a common law jurisdiction, what matters is the political will. In order for change to  happen, it is important for people to get fam iliar with ADR processes, this will help people to  become more familiar with ODR processes. There needs to be proposals and input from  academics.   Mandatory ADR?  
CDCJ(2018) 5  111 There is mandatory ADR for disputes involving social services in Portugal. Here, parties  must g o to arbitration to have the dispute resolved. In Spain this is different. Mandatory  arbitration is not recognised as a general rule. There have been judgments by the  Constitutional Court in Spain – which considered problems relating to mandatory ADR. In  one case it was held to be unconstitutional to have a party agree to go away from arbitration.   In the Legislation dealing with electrical suppliers and the like in Spain, traders are obliged to  attend either mediation or arbitration in order to have their dispute resolved. Not against  access to justice – adhere to this, not obliged to arbitrate can mediate.     
CDCJ(2018) 5  112 John Zeleznikov : 12H30 – 13H15  - 1 DECEMBER 2017   ODR RESEARCH   ODR Overview   John is an expert in Mathematics and Computer Science. He currently teaches ODR and  computer science.   He came across ODR when doing his PhD in mathematics. Over 20 years ago, John  decided to move over to computer science and he made the choice of looking at AI and law.  John was interested in showing how machine learning could be used in law. John helped  build an ODR system in family law, where technology could be used to help resolve  disputes. John is not concerned with how ODR can be used to give legal advice. He is  instead interested in how ODR can be used to support negotiations to resolve disputes. He  used aspects of Game Theory and notions of fairness and justice to develop these concepts  about ODR.   John primarily approaches issues in ODR through an academic perspective, by considering  principles of ODR. These principles that John considers include pri nciples pertaining to  governance and ethics. When is it appropriate to use ODR? How to provide technology that  can resolve disputes?   ODR Overview: Biggest issues in ODR   One of the major issues in ODR is people who are looking to make a quick buck through  developing and using ODR mechanisms. Some of these systems look at how ODR can  provide legal advice. An issue with this is how can these systems be trusted? How does one  know that the advice is accurate? How can we ensure that process is fair? There is a ma jor  issue of trust.   In order to combat such issues, there is a need to develop safeguards. One such safeguard  is to ensure that the traditional face -to-face system is kept intact. It is also important to know  who is building the system? Who is the provider ? Who is going to use this system? Who are  the experts in this area who can oversee the development and implementation of these  systems?   Ideally there should be a global body that oversees the implementation of ODR. There is a  need to develop ethics withi n the ODR field. Advice must be accurate. General principles for  ODR should be developed. Technology should be used to enhance communications and the  effectiveness and efficiency of dispute resolution.   All lower level data collection should be done online,  such as submitting complaints,  uploading pleadings, submitting evidence issues. There is still need for a face -to face  contact. Opposing view. Face -to-face is important. See opponent. Read evidence.  Psychological. Oral hearing is very important. At the ve ry least one should be guaranteed of  an oral hearing at some stage in the process. Dangerous not have face -to-face. Appeal.   Impartiality and independence: Decision makers should have the right information in order to  make a decision. The process should be done in such a way so as to convince the parties  that each of them have been fairly treated.   Artificial Intelligence   AI – used more and more in ODR. Used before stage of face -to-face, but do not replace it.  AI can be useful in stages before the face -to-face stage. AI will be less useful in trying to 
CDCJ(2018) 5  113 make decisions. AI should not be used in decision -making. If AI is implemented, and we  reach a stage of robot decision -making, we will have entered new world.   Humans can be biased and discriminatory. But when AI makes a wrong decision it is  essentially emulating humans. But when humans make decisions they take responsibility.  There is a public belief that humans will make it right. If not, appeal. This would probably not  be available if a robot acts. The public  may feel pressure to accept a robot decision because  it is a robot. It is undesirable for AI to make decisions.   Access to Justice   ODR can definitely enhance access to justice. Available to everyone. Low level tech can be  used.   Digital divide – access to i nternet. People who do not have the skills to use technology or  who do not have access to technology are disadvantaged in everyday life. They have a  disadvantage with protecting and enforcing their legal rights. The world is not totally fair, but  the provi sion of technology is going to make it fairer. Technology can provide people with  access to justice who would not ordinarily or traditionally have had it.   Use of ODR   There has been an explosion of ODR within the last year. Many organisations have started  using it or are keen to develop and implement it. E -commerce lower level courts wanting to  use it. Ombudsmen wanting to use it. Far more effective. Quick. Efficient. Cheap. Public like  it.  It is, however, not being used in the courts. There is the desire a nd intent to use it but there  is a bureaucratic issue: courts and public institutions are slow to embrace change. There is a  need to see a way to go. Desire is there. But it will take a long time to implement ODR within  the court systems. Deal with current  case load. Provide new services. Can’t just flicks a  switch.   Implementing ODR in the court system is a question of use of resources. Invest and take  risks. Risks are there. People must uptake it. Ineffective? Heads may roll if not implemented  correctly. Big risks. Big change.   ODR and Security   Regarding data security there is a need to ensure that there is the correct usage of  encryption tools. There are ways of systems being secure provided the effort is put in to  ensure security.   ODR can be governed corr ectly. In a similar way that lawyers do not disclose information  and are bound by ethics, companies providing ODR services should be subject to the same  sort of restriction. Legislation can be passed to ensure this. Collect data – do not give  companies acc ess to data. Security.   Summary   John’s view is that ODR is a very useful tool to enhancing access to justice, ensuring  efficiency and effectiveness in justice system. It can be used, if implemented correctly and  ethically, to enhance access to justice and t o ensure justice is carried out effectively and  efficiently. ODR, however, should only be used up to the point of face -to-face interaction. It is  a fundamental aspect of justice that parties meet face -to-face when assessing each other’s  cases, assessing ev idence and arguing their respective cases before court. There should be 
CDCJ(2018) 5  114 a guarantee of the right to an oral hearing. Humans should still make decisions. Although not  perfect, and not always fair, parties have the right to appeal and humans who make  decisio ns will be held responsible and accountable for their decisions. AI can be used in the  administrative court process, as part of ODR, up until the face -to-face interaction stage. It  should not be used in decision -making. This is potentially dangerous as mac hine decision making could breach fairness. People may trust robot decisions more than they trust  humans, which is a dangerous prospect.     
CDCJ(2018) 5  115 Shannon Salter : 30 OCTOBER 2017; 16:00 – 16:45  -30 OCTOBER 2017   ODR RESEARCH   Personal experience of ODR   Shannon was originally a litigation lawyer at a large Vancouver law firm for several years  before moving on to become a commissioner of the Financial Institutions Commission, vice  president of the BC Council of Administrative Tribunals and a board member of the  Canadi an Legal Information Institute (CanLII). Shannon was initially involved with law from  an administrative law perspective but was attracted to the potential use of ODR to address  access to justice issues.   In 2014 Shannon was tasked with implementing a tribu nal to resolve condominium disputes,  which became the Civil Resolution Tribunal. It has now been operational for 16 months.    ODR overview   In general terms ODR is likely to develop. The functioning of the CRT can prove the model  of ODR – that ODR mechanism s work. Bring the justice to where the system is. Respect  people’s human dignity.   It is unclear at this stage what the limits are of ODR. ODR still needs testing. ODR is being  used in early mediation to lead to solutions for disputes. It has been used to solve family  disputes, which is the most common area. It can also be used in Landlord -tenant disputes.  Because ODR is such a broad area, it is unclear where the limits are.   ODR is separate to AI. This distinction should be made. One should be cautious to conflate  ODR and AI. ODR is about using online tools to resolve disputes. It is not used to make  automated decisions by a machine. ODR is used to facilitate procedural fairness.   ODR processes can be fair and comply with the right to a fair trial. It is imp ortant that  information is made clear – what it is somebody needs to be do run with case and pursue  their claim. It is important that the claimant has the opportunity to be heard. The CRT  provides access to telephone conversations. The fairness of ODR is d ependent on design  issues.   It is important to have consultation with key stakeholders, to test the system with the  community. Consultation about fees structures, testing with random members of the public,  testing with lawyers. Free or low -cost tools shoul d be used as part of the system.   Empathy and deep understanding when designing the system. There is no need to replicate  the traditional court system which is not conducive to fairness and access to justice.   With regard to implementing an ODR system in th e court system of civil law countries (as  opposed to the more flexible common law system:    There is a EU regulation for e -commerce.   Dory Reiling from the Netherlands (a civil law jurisdiction) has been at the forefront of  implementing an ODR system in the  Netherlands. The Ukraine is looking at ODR. What  seems to be the case in civil law countries is that introducing ODR into the court system will  require significant changes to procedural rules. This may be because civil law jurisdictions  have less inherent  jurisdiction, as do courts in common law countries. This may be an  impediment – but a minor one at best.  
CDCJ(2018) 5  116 Digital divide: Issues of the digital divide could be addressed through the correct design of  the system – having alternative means to ODR such as tel ephone, mail and fax. Access in  person services. People can access CRT services at 62 Service BC counters throughout  BC. There is a telephone based service. It is also encouraged for persons unfamiliar with  technology to approach a trusted friend or family  member out.   Out of approximately 3000 cases before the CRT only 3 cases requested no email (and  traditional process). Paper forms are used on average for one case per week.   Access to justice – easier online.   High demand. Asynchronous communication. Peopl e would rather use an online form that a  paper based form and needing to visit the court in person.   88 condominium decisions. These are published decisions which encourages transparency.  Most claims settle at mediation or even negotiation.   The CRT follows  a guided pathway system, known as the Solutions Explorer. This process is  Anonymous – try get the litigants to resolve the dispute themselves.    Out of 14000 condominium disputes only 675 submitted a claim and into the official  negotiation phase.  (There have been over 14000 Solution Explorer explorations, and we  can assume these are people with a condominium problem.)   Ensuring that the information available to the parties is important. The information must also  be accessible and easily understandable. Thi s has been achieved at CRT through the  process of Knowledge engineering. A Knowledge engineer interviews lawyers and asks  them what the common reasons disputes arose and what lawyers wished their clients  understood and knew in order to proceed with a claim . From this information, the knowledge  engineer works with a content specialist, who is good at translating complicated legal terms  – put into plain language – and information is drafted into the system and made available to  the users. It is important to m ake use of User testing. ODR needs to be a user centred  design. Adapt and change. At CRT there are weekly change meetings, where changes and  adaptations to the system are discussed. Feedback and rating of service is also important.   There will be cases in t erms of which the dispute is too complicated to be easily resolved in  the programme. Here, there are referral options, where litigants are referred to legal  organisations which can assist them further with their dispute.    The CRT is User centred. What is required to implement the ODR system is change  management, Goodwill and trust.   Fairness – in a modern world is different to what it was 300 years ago. User centred fairness  is required now.
