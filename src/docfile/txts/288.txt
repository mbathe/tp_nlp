PE650.527v02-00 6/31 RR\1214925EN.docx ENJ. whereas the development of AI and related technologies raises questions about the  protection of innovation itself and the application of IPRs to materials, content or data  generated by AI and related technologies, which can be of an industrial or artistic nature  and which create various commercial opportunities; whereas in this regard it is  important to distinguish between AI-assisted human creations and creations  autonomously generated by AI; J. whereas AI and related technologies are heavily dependent on pre-existing content and  large volumes of data; whereas increased transparent and open access to certain nonpersonal data and databases in the Union, especially for SMEs and start-ups, as well as  interoperability of data, which limits lock-in effects, will play a crucial role in  advancing the development of European AI and supporting the competitiveness of  European companies at the global level; whereas the collection of personal data must  respect fundamental rights and data protection rules and requires tailored governance,  namely in terms of data management and the transparency of data used in developing  and deploying AI technologies, and this throughout the entire lifecycle of an AI-enabled  system; 1. Takes note of the Commission White Paper on ‘Artificial Intelligence - A European  approach to excellence and trust’ and the European Data Strategy; stresses that the  approaches outlined therein are likely to contribute to unlocking the potential of humancentred AI in the EU; notes, however, that the issue of the protection of IPRs in the  context of the development of AI and related technologies has not been addressed by  the Commission, despite the key importance of these rights; highlights the necessity of  creating a single European data space and believes that the use thereof will play an  important role in innovation and creativity in the Union economy, which should be  incentivised; stresses that the Union should play an essential role in laying down basic  principles on the development, deployment and use of AI, without hindering its  advancement or impeding competition; 2. Highlights the fact that the development of AI and related technologies in the transport  and tourism sectors will bring innovation, research, the mobilisation of investment and  considerable economic, societal, environmental, public and safety benefits, while  making these sectors more attractive to new generations and creating new employment  opportunities and more sustainable business models, but stresses that it should not cause  harm or damage to people or society; 3. Stresses the importance of creating an operational and fully harmonised regulatory  framework in the field of AI technologies; suggests that such a framework should take  the form of a regulation rather than a directive in order to avoid fragmentation of the  European digital single market and promote innovation; 4 Calls on the Commission to take into account the seven key requirements identified in  the Guidelines of the High-Level Expert Group, as welcomed by it in its communication  of 8 April 201911, and properly implement them in all legislation dealing with AI;  5. Stresses that the development, deployment and use of AI technologies and the growth of  the global data economy make it necessary to address significant technical, social,  11 ‘Building trust in human-centric artificial intelligence’ (COM(2019)0168).
RR\1214925EN.docx 7/31 PE650.527v02-00 ENeconomic, ethical and legal issues in a variety of policy areas, including IPRs and their  impact on these policy areas; highlights that in order to unlock the potential of AI  technologies, it is necessary to remove unnecessary legal barriers, so as not to hamper  the growth of or innovation in the Union’s developing data economy; calls for an  impact assessment to be conducted with regards to the protection of IPRs in the context  of the development of AI technologies; 6. Stresses the key importance of balanced IPR protection in relation to AI technologies,  and of the multidimensional nature of such protection, and, at the same time, stresses  the importance of ensuring a high level of protection of IPRs, of creating legal certainty  and of building the trust needed to encourage investment in these technologies and  ensure their long-term viability and use by consumers; considers that the Union has the  potential to become the frontrunner in the creation of AI technologies by adopting an  operational regulatory framework that is regularly assessed in the light of technological  developments and by implementing proactive public policies, particularly as regards  training programmes and financial support for research and public-private sector  cooperation; reiterates the need to ensure sufficient leeway for the development of new  technologies, products and services; emphasises that creating an environment conducive  to creativity and innovation by encouraging the use of AI technologies by creators must  not come at the expense of the interests of human creators, nor the Union’s ethical  principles; 7. Considers also that the Union must address the various aspects of AI by means of  definitions that are technologically neutral and sufficiently flexible to encompass future  technological developments as well as subsequent uses; considers it necessary to  continue to reflect on interactions between AI and IPRs, from the perspective of both  intellectual property offices and users; believes that the challenge of assessing AI  applications creates a need for some transparency requirements and the development of  new methods as, for instance, adaptive learning systems may recalibrate following each  input, making certain ex ante disclosures ineffective; 8. Stresses the importance of streaming services being transparent and responsible in their  use of algorithms, so that access to cultural and creative content in various forms and  different languages as well as impartial access to European works can be better  guaranteed; 9. Considers the increasing need for AI and related technologies in remote or biometric  recognition technologies, such as tracing apps in the transport and tourism sector, as a  new way of dealing with COVID-19 and possible future sanitary and public health  crises, while keeping sight of the need to protect fundamental rights, privacy and  personal data; 10. Recommends that priority be given to assessment by sector and type of IPR  implications of AI technologies; considers that such an approach should take into  account, for example, the degree of human intervention, the autonomy of AI, the  importance of the role and the origin of the data and copyright-protected material used  and the possible involvement of other relevant factors; recalls that any approach must  strike the right balance between the need to protect investments of both resources and  effort and the need to incentivise creation and sharing; takes the view that more 
PE650.527v02-00 8/31 RR\1214925EN.docx ENthorough research is necessary for the purposes of evaluating human input regarding AI  algorithmic data; believes that disruptive technologies such as AI offer both small and  large companies the opportunity to develop market-leading products; considers that all  companies should benefit from equally efficient and effective IPR protection; therefore  calls on the Commission and the Member States to offer support to start-ups and SMEs  via the Single Market Programme and Digital Innovation Hubs in protecting their  products; 11. Suggests that this assessment focus on the impact and implications of AI and related  technologies under the current system of patent law, trademark and design protection,  copyright and related rights, including the applicability of the legal protection of  databases and computer programs, and the protection of undisclosed know-how and  business information (‘trade secrets’) against their unlawful acquisition, use and  disclosure; acknowledges the potential of AI technologies to improve the enforcement  of IPRs, notwithstanding the need for human verification and review, especially where  legal consequences are concerned; emphasises, further, the need to assess whether  contract law ought to be updated in order to best protect consumers and whether  competition rules need to be adapted in order to address market failures and abuses in  the digital economy, the need to create a more comprehensive legal framework for the  economic sectors in which AI plays a part, thus enabling European companies and  relevant stakeholders to scale up, and the need to create legal certainty; stresses that the  protection of intellectual property must always be reconciled with other fundamental  rights and freedoms; 12. Points out that mathematical methods as such are excluded from patentability unless  they are used for a technical purpose in the context of technical inventions, which are  themselves patentable only if the applicable criteria relating to inventions are met;  points out, further, that if an invention relates either to a method involving technical  means or to a technical device, its purpose, considered as a whole, is in fact technical in  nature and is therefore not excluded from patentability; underlines, in this regard, the  role of the patent protection framework in incentivising AI inventions and promoting  their dissemination, as well as the need to create opportunities for European companies  and start-ups to foster the development and uptake of AI in Europe; points out that  standard essential patents play a key role in the development and dissemination of new  AI and related technologies and in ensuring interoperability; calls on the Commission to  support the establishment of industry standards and encourage formal standardisation; 13. Notes that patent protection can be granted provided that the invention is new and not  self-evident and involves an inventive step; notes, further, that patent law requires a  comprehensive description of the underlying technology, which may pose challenges  for certain AI technologies in view of the complexity of the reasoning; stresses also the  legal challenges of reverse engineering, which is an exception to the copyright  protection of computer programs and the protection of trade secrets, which are in turn of  crucial importance for innovation and research and which should be duly taken into  account in the context of the development of AI technologies; calls on the Commission  to assess possibilities for products to be adequately tested, for example in a modular  way, without creating risks for IPR holders or trade secrets due to extensive disclosure  of easily replicated products; stresses that AI technologies should be openly available  for educational and research purposes, such as more effective learning methods;
RR\1214925EN.docx 9/31 PE650.527v02-00 EN14. Notes that the autonomisation of the creative process of generating content of an artistic  nature can raise issues relating to the ownership of IPRs covering that content;  considers, in this connection, that it would not be appropriate to seek to impart legal  personality to AI technologies and points out the negative impact of such a possibility  on incentives for human creators; 15. Points out the difference between AI-assisted human creations and AI-generated  creations, with the latter creating new regulatory challenges for IPR protection, such as  questions of ownership, inventorship and appropriate remuneration, as well as issues  related to potential market concentration; further considers that IPRs for the  development of AI technologies should be distinguished from IPRs potentially granted  for creations generated by AI; stresses that where AI is used only as a tool to assist an  author in the process of creation, the current IP framework remains applicable; 16. Takes the view that technical creations generated by AI technology must be protected  under the IPR legal framework in order to encourage investment in this form of creation  and improve legal certainty for citizens, businesses and, since they are among the main  users of AI technologies for the time being, inventors; considers that works  autonomously produced by artificial agents and robots might not be eligible for  copyright protection, in order to observe the principle of originality, which is linked to a  natural person, and since the concept of ‘intellectual creation’ addresses the author’s  personality; calls on the Commission to support a horizontal, evidence-based and  technologically neutral approach to common, uniform copyright provisions applicable  to AI-generated works in the Union, if it is considered that such works could be eligible  for copyright protection; recommends that ownership of rights, if any, should only be  assigned to natural or legal persons that created the work lawfully and only if  authorisation has been granted by the copyright holder if copyright-protected material is  being used, unless copyright exceptions or limitations apply; stresses the importance of  facilitating access to data and data sharing, open standards and open source technology,  while encouraging investment and boosting innovation; 17. Notes that AI makes it possible to process a large quantity of data relating to the state of  the art or the existence of IPRs; notes, at the same time, that AI or related technologies  used for the registration procedure to grant IPRs and for the determination of liability  for infringements of IPRs cannot be a substitute for human review carried out on a caseby-case basis, in order to ensure the quality and fairness of decisions; notes that AI is  progressively gaining the ability to perform tasks typically carried out by humans and  stresses, therefore, the need to establish adequate safeguards, including design systems  with human-in-the-loop control and review processes, transparency, accountability and  verification of AI decision-making; 18. Notes, with regard to the use of non-personal data by AI technologies, that the lawful  use of copyrighted works and other subject matter and associated data, including preexisting content, high-quality datasets and metadata, needs to be assessed in the light of  the existing rules on limitations and exceptions to copyright protection, such as the text  and data mining exception, as provided for by the Directive on copyright and related  rights in the Digital Single Market; calls for further clarification as regards the  protection of data under copyright law and potential trademark and industrial design  protection for works generated autonomously through AI applications; considers that 
PE650.527v02-00 10/31 RR\1214925EN.docx ENvoluntary non-personal data sharing between businesses and sectors should be promoted  and based on fair contractual agreements, including licencing agreements; highlights the  IPR issues arising from the creation of deep fakes on the basis of misleading,  manipulated or simply low-quality data, irrespective of such deep fakes containing data  which may be subject to copyright; is worried about the possibility of mass  manipulation of citizens being used to destabilise democracies and calls for increased  awareness-raising and media literacy as well as for urgently needed AI technologies to  be made available to verify facts and information; considers that non-personal auditable  records of data used throughout the life cycles of AI-enabled technologies in  compliance with data protection rules could facilitate the tracing of the use of copyrightprotected works and thereby better protect right-holders and contribute to the protection  of privacy, if the requirement to keep auditable records were extended to cover data  containing or deriving from images and/or videos containing biometric data; stresses  that AI technologies could be useful in the context of IPR enforcement, but would  require human review and a guarantee that any AI-driven decision-making systems are  fully transparent; stresses that any future AI regime may not circumvent possible  requirements for open source technology in public tenders or prevent the  interconnectivity of digital services; notes that AI systems are software-based and rely  on statistical models, which may include errors; stresses that AI-generated output must  not be discriminatory and that one of the most efficient ways of reducing bias in AI  systems is to ensure – to the extent possible under Union law – that the maximum  amount of non-personal data is available for training purposes and machine learning;  calls on the Commission to reflect on the use of public domain data for such purposes; 19. Stresses the importance of full implementation of the Digital Single Market Strategy in  order to improve the accessibility and interoperability of non-personal data in the EU;  stresses that the European Data Strategy must ensure a balance between promoting the  flow of, wider access to and the use and sharing of data on the one hand, and the  protection of IPRs and trade secrets on the other, while respecting data protection and  privacy rules; highlights the need to assess in that connection whether Union rules on  intellectual property are an adequate tool to protect data, including sectoral data needed  for the development of AI, recalling that structured data, such as databases, when  enjoying IP protection, may not usually be considered to be data; considers that  comprehensive information should be provided on the use of data protected by IPRs, in  particular in the context of platform-to-business relationships; welcomes the  Commission’s intention to create a single European data space; 20. Notes that the Commission is considering the desirability of legislation on issues that  have an impact on relationships between economic operators whose purpose is to make  use of non-personal data and welcomes a possible revision of the Database Directive and  a possible clarification of the application of the directive on the protection of trade  secrets as a generic framework; looks forward to the results of the public consultation  procedure launched by the Commission on the European Data Strategy; 21. Stresses the need for the Commission to aim to provide balanced and innovation-driven  protection of intellectual property, for the benefit of European AI developers, to  strengthen the international competitiveness of European companies, including against  possible abusive litigation tactics, and to ensure maximum legal certainty for users,  notably in international negotiations, in particular as regards the ongoing discussions on 
RR\1214925EN.docx 11/31 PE650.527v02-00 ENAI and data revolution under the auspices of WIPO; welcomes the Commission’s recent  submissions of the Union’s views to the WIPO public consultation on the WIPO draft  Issues Paper on Intellectual Property Policy and Artificial Intelligence; recalls in this  regard the Union’s ethical duty to support development around the world by facilitating  cross-border cooperation on AI, including through limitations and exceptions for crossborder research and text and data mining, as provided for by the Directive on copyright  and related rights in the Digital Single Market; 22. Is fully aware that progress in AI will have to be paired with public investment in  infrastructure, training in digital skills and major improvements in connectivity and  interoperability in order to come to full fruition; highlights, therefore, the importance of  secure and sustainable 5G networks for the full deployment of AI technologies but,  more importantly, of necessary work on the level of infrastructure and security thereof  throughout the Union; takes note of the intensive patenting activity taking place in the  transport sector when it comes to AI; expresses its concern that this may result in  massive litigation that will be detrimental to the industry as a whole and may also affect  traffic safety if we do not legislate on the development of AI-related technologies at  Union level without further delay;  23. Endorses the Commission’s willingness to invite the key players from the  manufacturing sector – transport manufacturers, AI and connectivity innovators, service  providers from the tourism sector and other players in the automotive value chain – to  agree on the conditions under which they would be ready to share their data; 24. Instructs its President to forward this resolution to the Council and the Commission as  well as to the parliaments and the governments of the Member States.
PE650.527v02-00 12/31 RR\1214925EN.docx ENEXPLANATORY STATEMENT Artificial intelligence (AI) is a field of scientific research whose origins date back to the mid20th century. The objective is an ambitious one: to understand how the human cognitive  system works in order to reproduce it and so create comparable decision-making processes.  Some years ago, a new era began in AI, thanks to a combination of vast computing power,  much larger numbers of data sets and powerful algorithms.  The resulting new impetus is fuelling the development and deployment of AI in many sectors.  It is making it possible, for example, to automate the analysis of clinical samples, or to adjust  traffic lights in response to road traffic flows without human intervention. The potential of  this technology, in terms of innovation, is therefore enormous, and it is important that the  European Union adopt an operational legal framework for the development of  European AI and public policies that are commensurate with the issues at stake,  particularly with reference to the training of people in Europe and financial support for  applied and fundamental research. This framework must necessarily include thinking about  intellectual property rights (IPRs) in order to encourage and protect innovation and creativity  in this area.  The definition of AI is still a matter for debate, but legal certainty is likely to stimulate the  necessary investment in this area in the EU. A form of legislative flexibility should therefore  be promoted in order to take account of the multifaceted reality of AI and create a framework  that is future-proof (catering for further technological progress). Upstream, consideration must first be given to assessing patent law in the light of the  development of AI. Patents protect technical inventions, i.e. products that provide a new  technical solution to a given technical problem. Thus, although algorithms, mathematical  methods and computer programs are not patentable as such, they may form part of a technical  invention that can be patented. It is crucial for the deployment of European AI that economic  operators, in particular European start-ups, are aware of this opportunity.  Patent applications registered by the European Patent Office for inventions directly related to  the operation of AI (core AI technologies) have more than tripled in a decade: from 396 in  2010 to 1 264 in 2017. However, it should be noted that more applications are being  submitted in some third countries and that international competition in this strategic area is  strong.  AI is also used by patent offices to facilitate research into the state of the art. In that  connection, it seems important to point out that the technology provides useful assistance, but  should not replace analysis by a human examiner as a basis for granting rights. In the field of  patents, it must also be pointed out that the complexity of the reasoning used by certain AI  technologies may increase the difficulty of checking that these inventions comply with  existing rules.  Downstream, the growing autonomisation of certain decision-making processes can give rise  to technical or artistic creations. Assessing all IPRs in the light of these developments must  be a priority for this area of EU law, in order to foster an environment conducive to  creativity and innovation by rewarding creators. The role of human intervention remains 
RR\1214925EN.docx 13/31 PE650.527v02-00 ENfundamental to the programming of AI devices, the selection of input data and the application  of the results obtained. The prospect of a ‘strong’ AI, that is to say one that is conscious of  itself, seems after all still to be very futuristic.  As regards copyright, the condition of originality, which imprints on the work the personality  of its author, could constitute an obstacle to the protection of AI-generated creations.  However, the general trend with regard to that condition is towards an objective concept of  relative novelty, making it possible to distinguish a protected work from works already  created. AI-generated creation and ‘traditional’ creation still have in common the aim of  expanding cultural heritage, even if the creation takes place by means of a different act. At a  time when artistic creation by AI is becoming more common (one example being the ‘Next  Rembrandt’ painting1 generated after 346 works by the painter were digitised so that they  could be processed using AI), we seem to be moving towards an acknowledgement that an  AI-generated creation could be deemed to constitute a work of art on the basis of the creative  result rather than the creative process. It should also be noted that a failure to protect AIgenerated creations could leave the interpreters of such creations without rights, as the  protection afforded by the system of related rights implies the existence of copyright on the  work being interpreted.  Therefore, it is proposed that an assessment should be undertaken of the advisability of  granting copyright to such a ‘creative work’ to the natural person who prepares and publishes  it lawfully, provided that the designer(s) of the underlying technology has/have not opposed  such use. This reasoning would be in line with the European system of protection of ‘works  data’; such data may be exploited as part of the data used to train AI technologies which can  then generate secondary creations, including for commercial purposes, provided that the right  to such use has not been expressly reserved by their rightholders.  Lastly, given the essential role of data and its selection in the development of AI technologies,  a number of questions arise concerning the accessibility of such data, in particular dependence  on data, lock-in effects, the dominant position of certain undertakings and, in general,  insufficient data flow. It will therefore be important to encourage the sharing of data  generated in the European Union in order to stimulate innovations in artificial  intelligence. In the short term, this may in particular be based on the transposition of the  Open Data Directive and promotion of the conclusion of licensing agreements to encourage  the sharing of industrial data. In the medium term, the Commission’s forthcoming proposal on  the generic legislative framework for the governance of common European data areas will be  decisive, in particular for access to sensitive databases such as those in the field of health.  1 https://www.nextrembrandt.com/
PE650.527v02-00 14/31 RR\1214925EN.docx EN9.7.2020 OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE INTERNAL MARKET AND CONSUMER  PROTECTION for the Committee on Legal Affairs on Intellectual property rights for the development of artificial intelligence technologies (2020/2015(INI)) Rapporteur for opinion: Adam Bielan SUGGESTIONS The Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection calls on the Committee on  Legal Affairs, as the committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions into its  motion for a resolution: 1. Recalls the potential that artificial intelligence (AI) has when it comes to delivering  innovative services to businesses, consumers and the public sector; stresses the key role  that AI technologies can play in the digitisation of the economy in many sectors, such as  industry, healthcare, construction and transport, which can lead to the establishment of  new business models; highlights that the Union must actively embrace developments in  this area to advance the digital single market; underlines that the development and use  of AI in the internal market will benefit from a reliable, balanced and effective system  of intellectual property rights (IPRs); notes the importance of differentiating between AI  applications or algorithms, AI-generated technology and products, data bases and  individual data, which require different forms of rights; 2. Believes that disruptive technologies such as AI offer both small and large companies  the opportunity to develop market-leading products; considers that all companies or  other owners of such products should benefit from equally efficient and effective IPR  protection; considers that this may foster the emergence of European small and  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and result in a significant competitive advantage in  the Union; calls for an analysis of the impact of abusive practices by ‘patent trolls’ and  strategic IPR litigation, which can act as an artificial barrier to entry and protect market  incumbents; underlines the importance of AI technologies when it comes to enabling a  more transparent, efficient and reliable management of IP-related aspects of  transactions; 3. Stresses the importance of measures and information channels that help SMEs and startups to effectively use IPR protection in AI technologies; calls on the Commission and 
RR\1214925EN.docx 15/31 PE650.527v02-00 ENthe Member States to offer support to start-ups and SMEs via the Single Market  Programme and Digital Innovation Hubs to develop and protect their products and thus  enable them to fully develop their potential for growth and jobs in Europe; stresses the  importance of the Commission and the Member States seeking coordination with other  important global players in IPR for the development of AI, so as to create a globally  compatible approach that would be beneficial for both SMEs and start-ups; 4. Stresses the importance of protecting IPRs, including trade secrets, in any regulatory  framework for AI, in particular as regards any detailed requirements for the narrow set  of applications deemed ‘high-risk’, while recognising the need to reconcile these with  the application of other public policy objectives, including respect for fundamental  rights or freedoms; believes that in order to ensure the development of human-centric,  trusted AI, effective implementation of the legislation concerning whistle-blowers is  needed;  5. Stresses that in addition to protecting IPRs, it is in the interest of consumers to have  legal certainty about allowed uses of protected works, especially when it comes to  complicated algorithmic products; calls for the Commission to propose measures for  data traceability, while taking into account both the legality of data acquisition and the  protection of consumer and fundamental rights; 6. Believes that the challenge of assessing AI applications requires the development of  new methods and proper administrative capacity for the market surveillance authorities;  notes that adaptive learning systems may recalibrate following each input, making  certain ex ante disclosures alone ineffective;  7. Considers that where AI applications are certified, they should demonstrate  transparency, explainability – as much as feasibly  possible – and compliance with  ethical standards; notes that this goal cannot be solely achieved through the simple  disclosure of the algorithm or code, if at all; recalls that data sets are also important in  this process; 8. Calls on the Commission to consider how to assess ways that allow for products to be  tested, for instance in a modular way or with the use of verification tools that would  allow products to be adequately tested while observing confidentiality in order to  protect the commercial secrets held by IPR holders.

PE650.527v02-00 18/31 RR\1214925EN.docx EN14.7.2020 OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORT AND TOURISM for the Committee on Legal Affairs on intellectual property rights for the development of artificial intelligence technologies (2020/2015(INI)) Rapporteur for opinion: Andor Deli SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Transport and Tourism calls on the Committee on Legal Affairs, as the  committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions into its motion for a  resolution: Introduction  1. Welcomes the ambitions affirmed by the Commission in its communications of 19  February 2020, as well as in its White Paper on ‘Artificial Intelligence – A European  approach to excellence and trust’ and in the European Data Strategy, in the area of  artificial intelligence (AI) and data; notes, however, that the issue of the protection of  intellectual property rights (IPRs) in the context of the development of AI and related  technologies has to be taken more seriously; 2. Stresses that the development and deployment of AI and related technologies make it  necessary to address technical, social, economic, ethical and legal issues and crosssectoral implications in a variety of policy areas, including IPRs, and to provide answers  and formulate policies at the European level; 3. Highlights the fact that the development of AI and related technologies in the transport  and tourism sectors will bring innovation, research, the mobilisation of investment and  considerable economic, societal, environmental, public and safety benefits, while  making the sector more attractive to new generations and creating new employment  opportunities and more sustainable business models, but should not cause harm or  damage to people or society; 4. Takes note of the global competition between companies and economic regions in the  development of AI solutions for the transport sector; highlights the need to strengthen  the international competitiveness of European companies operating in the transport  sector by establishing the EU as an environment favourable for the development and  application of AI solutions; underlines furthermore that AI should also be deployed in  all modes of transport, in both urban and rural areas, and that a holistic, technologically 
RR\1214925EN.docx 19/31 PE650.527v02-00 ENneutral and flexible approach is therefore needed to tackle adequately all the challenges  in the transport and mobility sector; 5. Affirms that defining the appropriate legal framework at EU level for IPRs for AI and  connectivity innovations, as well as for access to and security of data will be key in the  development and smooth, safe and wide dissemination of AI and related technologies in  transport and tourism ecosystems; 6. Considers that intellectual property (IP) protection strategies will constantly evolve over  time as AI evolves, and that it will be necessary to take account of issues such as  adapting to this changing environment with flexible copyright, patent, trademark and  design protection or even trade secret rules, and to consider what route will provide  innovators with the broadest and most robust means of IP protection that combine legal  certainty and encourage new investment in private enterprises, universities, SMEs and  clusters using public-private collaboration to support research and development; 7. Calls on the Commission to take into account the seven key requirements identified in  the Guidelines of the High-Level Expert Group, as welcomed by it in its communication  of 8 April 20191, and properly implement them in all legislation dealing with AI; 8. Considers the increasing need for AI and related technologies in remote or biometric  recognition technologies, such as tracing apps in the transport and tourism sector, as a  new way of dealing with COVID-19 and possible future sanitary and public health  crises, while keeping sight of the need to protect fundamental rights, privacy and  personal data; IP rights and AI innovations 9. Notes that the current fragmented legal framework of IP rights and legal uncertainty  affect the development of AI and related technologies in transport; calls on the  Commission, therefore, to evaluate the fitness of its intellectual property regime for the  development of AI technologies and, after a thorough analysis and review of the current  legislation, to put forward the legislative proposals it finds necessary in order to ensure  confidence, legal certainty and transparency and avoid further fragmentation, thus  encouraging investment in these technologies; 10. Notes that although AI makes it possible to process a large quantity of data  relating to IPRs, it cannot be a substitute for human verification in relation to the  granting of IPRs and the determination of liability for infringements of IPRs; 11. Notes, with regard to the use of data by AI, that the use of copyrighted data needs to be  assessed in the light of the text and data mining exceptions provided for by the Directive  on copyright and related rights in the Digital Single Market, and in the light of all uses  covered by limitations and exceptions to IPR protection; 12. Calls on the Commission to evaluate the possibility and relevance for companies,  including SMEs, of obtaining patents for software or algorithms with a view to ensuring  both the protection of innovation and the need for transparency required for trustworthy  1 ‘Building trust in human-centric artificial intelligence’ (COM(2019)0168).
PE650.527v02-00 20/31 RR\1214925EN.docx ENAI, as well as the availability of algorithms used for public purposes; stresses the need  to maintain a level playing field between these companies, as well as the importance of  remaining consistent with competition law; 13. Is fully aware that progress in AI will have to be paired with public investment in  infrastructure, training in digital skills and major improvements in connectivity and  interoperability in order to come to full fruition; highlights, therefore, the importance of  secure and sustainable 5G networks for the full deployment of AI technologies but,  more importantly, necessary work on the level of infrastructure and security thereof  throughout the Union; takes note of the intensive patenting activity taking place in the  transport sector when it comes to AI; expresses its concern that this may result in  massive litigation that will be detrimental to the industry as a whole and may also affect  traffic safety if we do not legislate the development of AI-related technologies at  European level without further delay; 14. Points out that standard essential patents (SEPs) play a key role in the development and  dissemination of new AI and related technologies and ensuring interoperability; calls on  the Commission to encourage the emergence of cross-industry standards and formal  standardisation; recalls in this regard the Commission’s communication of 29  November 2017 on SEP licensing and the key principles it set out for transparency in  SEPs, namely fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) licensing and  enforcement; draws particular attention to SEPs that can improve accessibility, road  safety and security for transport users; Intellectual property rights and data 15. Welcomes the Commission’s willingness to ensure that data will be collected and used  in full compliance with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and other strict  data protection rules; stresses the need to continue to safeguard the data of European  citizens, but considers a right balance between data protection and IP rules is needed in  order to grant necessary flexibility to AI innovators; 16. Welcomes the Commission’s aim of creating a single European data space with  investment in standards, tools and infrastructure; supports in particular the  establishment of a common European mobility data space, taking into consideration the  existing European legislative framework on data protection; 17. Calls on the Commission to address adequately and urgently the question of, and  legislative proposals relating to, data and intellectual property protection with fair and  appropriate flexibility and in compliance with the principle of technological neutrality,  also by developing initiatives for the exchange of best practices and investing in  research in this field; 18. Welcomes the future establishment of an enabling and flexible legislative framework  for the governance of common European data spaces, as well as the Commission’s  willingness to foster business-to-government and business-to-business data sharing and  to limit mandatory access to data under FRAND conditions to the cases where specific  circumstances so dictate; highlights the importance of access to vehicle generated data  for all mobility stakeholders in order to promote the development of innovative datadriven services;
RR\1214925EN.docx 21/31 PE650.527v02-00 EN19. Calls on the Commission to pay special attention to access for SMEs and clusters to  data that could boost their activity, as well as to technology centres and universities to  promote their research programmes; 20. Endorses the Commission’s willingness to invite the key players from the  manufacturing sector - transport manufacturers, AI and connectivity innovators, service  providers from the tourism sector and other players in the automotive value chain - to  agree on the conditions under which they would be ready to share their data.

PE650.527v02-00 24/31 RR\1214925EN.docx EN3.9.2020 OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE ON CULTURE AND EDUCATION for the Committee on Legal Affairs on intellectual property rights for the development of artificial intelligence technologies (2020/2015(INI)) Rapporteur: Sabine Verheyen SUGGESTIONS The Committee on Culture and Education calls on the Committee on Legal Affairs, as the  committee responsible, to incorporate the following suggestions into its motion for a  resolution: 1. Recalls that artificial intelligence (AI) and related technologies, more broadly, should be  at the service of humanity and that their benefits should be widely shared, without any  discrimination; stresses that, as AI is an ever-changing collection of technologies that  are being developed at great speed, and as it is progressively gaining the ability to  perform more tasks typically carried out by humans, it may even surpass human  intellectual capacity in some areas in the long term; stresses the need, therefore, to  establish adequate safeguards including, when reasonable, design systems with humanin-the-loop control and review processes, transparency and verification of AI decisionmaking; recognises that in the cultural and creative sectors, creators already make  extensive use of new AI technologies to produce their artistic works; 2. Stresses that the Union should play an essential role in laying down basic principles on  the development, deployment, programming and use of AI, without hindering its  advancement or impeding competition, notably in Union regulations and codes of  conduct; recalls that Directive (EU) 2019/790 provides a legal framework for the use of  copyright protected works in text and data mining (TDM) processes, which are key in  any AI-related process; emphasises, therefore, the requirement that any work used must  be accessed lawfully, as well as the guaranteed right of rights holders to pre-emptively  opt out their works from being used in an AI-related process without their authorisation;  also stresses the need for an ethical framework and strategy for digital data,  accompanied, if necessary, by legislation in which fundamental rights and Union values  are enshrined; 3. Underlines the importance of using AI in schools and universities, enabling them to 
RR\1214925EN.docx 25/31 PE650.527v02-00 ENadopt new and more efficient learning methods that will increase pupils’ and students’  success rates; stresses the importance of promoting AI curricula designed to help pupils  and students to acquire the know-how needed for future jobs; stresses that AI  technologies should be openly available for educational and research purposes; 4. Stresses that open and equal access to AI across the Union and within the Member  States is of upmost importance; stresses that Union support for AI innovation and  research should be widely available across the Union; highlights that special support  should be given to AI developers and beneficiaries from disadvantaged groups and  those with disabilities; 5. Considers that guidance and counselling for AI developers and users on protecting IPR  should be widely available; 6. Recalls that AI cannot only perform activities which used to be exclusively human, but  can also acquire and develop autonomous and cognitive features through experience  learning or reinforcement learning; stresses the notion of responsibility with regard to  AI systems capable of learning through reinforcement; stresses that trained AI systems  can quasi-autonomously create and generate cultural and creative works, with only  minimum human input; notes, moreover, that AI systems can evolve in an unpredictable  way, by creating original works unknown even to their initial programmers, a fact that  should also be taken into account when establishing a framework for the protection of  the exploitation rights derived from such works; reiterates, nevertheless, that AI should  assist and not replace the creative human mind; 7. Takes note that AI systems are software-based and display intelligent behaviour based  on an analysis of their environment; highlights that this analysis is based on statistical  models of which errors form an inevitable part, sometimes with feedback loops that  replicate, reinforce and prolong pre-existing biases, errors and assumptions; notes the  need to ensure that systems and methods are in place to allow algorithms to be verified  and explained and any problems to be resolved; 8. Considers that IPR for the development of AI technologies should be distinguished  from IPR for content generated by AI; stresses the need to remove unnecessary legal  barriers to AI development in order to unlock the potential of such technologies in  culture and education; 9. Emphasises the need to address copyright issues relating to AI-generated cultural and  creative works; underlines that creation by human beings as authors and producers of  works must form the basis of the IPR system; notes, furthermore, that the question of  the extent to which a work created by AI can be traced back to a human creator is of key  importance; draws attention to the need to assess whether there is such a thing as an  ‘original creation’ that does not require any human intervention; considers that thorough  research is needed to understand whether automatically assigning the copyright of AIgenerated works to the copyright holder of the AI software, algorithm or programme is  the best way forward, as there is a need for a human to be credited as the author of a  new creative work; welcomes the Commission’s call for a study on copyright and new  technologies; 10. Expresses concern about the potential vacuum between IPR and the development of AI,  which could make the cultural and creative sectors and education vulnerable to AI-
PE650.527v02-00 26/31 RR\1214925EN.docx ENgenerated copyright-protected works; is concerned about possible infringements of  intellectual property and stresses the need to monitor any market failures or damage that  occur; calls on the Commission to support a horizontal, evidence-based and  technologically neutral approach to common, uniform copyright provisions applicable  to AI-generated works in the Union, which would increase their growth and also attract  private sector investment in the technological and economic development of the AI and  robotics sector; 11. Notes the development of AI capacities in the dissemination of misinformation and the  creation of disinformation; is concerned that this could lead to many breaches of  intellectual property legislation, and is, furthermore, extremely worried about the  possibility of mass manipulation of citizens being used to destabilise democracies; calls  in this regard for action to increase information and media literacy, taking account of  the fact that digital transformation is an indispensable aspect thereof; calls for the  development of software to verify facts and information to be made a priority; 12. Recalls that data is the central element of the development and training of any AI  system; stresses that this includes structured data, such as databases, copyright-protected  works and other creations enjoying IP protection which may not usually be considered  to be data; stresses therefore that it is also important to address the notion of IP-relevant  uses relating to the functioning of AI technologies; 13. Points out that the most efficient way of reducing bias in AI systems is to ensure that the  maximum amount of data is available to train them, for which it is necessary to limit  any unnecessary barriers to TDM and to facilitate cross-border uses; 14. Stresses that where AI is used only as a tool to assist an author in the process of  creation, the current copyright framework remains applicable to the work created and  the intervention of AI is not taken into consideration; 15. Recommends that special security features and rules be introduced in order to protect  privacy rights related to AI technologies; stresses that privacy auditing of AI  technologies should be compulsory; 16. Further recalls that the Union copyright reform introduced a TDM exception according  to which scientific research may benefit from free data uses, and that TDM carried out  for other purposes will also be allowed under the new exception if further requirements  are met; 17. Emphasises that AI can also be an effective tool for detecting and reporting the presence  of copyright-protected content online; also emphasises the need to address the issue of  liability for copyright and other intellectual property infringements by AI systems, as  well as the issue of data ownership; stresses, however, that a clear distinction has to be  made between autonomous infringements and the copying of third party works that  were facilitated or not prevented by the operator of the AI software; states that  traceability should be an indispensable condition in allocating responsibility, as it acts  both as a basis for legal action and enables the diagnosis and correction of malfunctions; 18. Stresses the importance of streaming services being transparent and responsible in their  use of algorithms, so that access to cultural and creative content in various forms and  different languages as well as impartial access to European works can be better 
RR\1214925EN.docx 27/31 PE650.527v02-00 ENguaranteed; 19. Recalls the Union’s ethical duty to support development around the world by facilitating  cross-border cooperation on AI, including through limitations and exceptions for crossborder research and TDM, and therefore urges the speeding up of international action at  the World Intellectual Property Organization to achieve this; 20. Recognises that due to the technological advancement of certain states, the Union has a  fundamental obligation to promote the sharing of the benefits of AI, utilising a number  of tools, including investment in research in all Member States.
