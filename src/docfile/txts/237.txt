  1 Foreword   This report  is published  in the context  of AI Watch1, the European  Commission  knowledge  service  to monitor  the  development,  uptake  and impact  of Artificial  Intelligence  (AI) for Europe,  launched  in December  2018.   AI has become  an area of strategic  importance  with the potential  to be a key driver  of economic  development.   AI also has a wide range  of potential  social  implications.  As part of its Digital  Single  Market  Strateg y, the  European  Commission  put forward  in April 2018  a European  strategy  on AI in its Communication  "Artificial   Intelligence  for Europe".  The aims of the European  AI strategy  announced  in the communication  are:  ● To boost  the EU's technological  and industria l capacity  and AI uptake  across  the economy,  both by  the private  and public  sectors    ● To prepare  for socio -economic -technical  changes  brought  about  by AI  ● To ensure  an appropriate  ethical  and legal framework  for its application  in a safe and lawful   manner,  especially  within  the public  sector.   In Decembe r 2018,  the European  Commission,  the Member  States  and Associated  Countries  published  a  “Coordinated  Plan on Artificial  Intelligence”2, on the development  of AI in the EU. The Coordinated  Plan mentions   the role of AI Watch  to monitor  its implementation.   Subsequently,  in February  2020,  the Commission  unveiled  its vision  for a digital  transformation  that works  for  everyone.  The Commission  presented  a White  Paper  proposing  a framework  for trustworthy  AI based  on  excellence  and trust.   Furthermore,  in April 2021  the European  Commission  proposed  a set of actions  to boost  excellence  in AI, and  rules to ensure  that the technology  is as trustworthy  as possible.  The proposed  Regulation  on a European   Approach  for Artificial  Intelligence  and the update  of the Coordinated  Plan on AI aim to guarantee  the safety   and fundamental  rights  of people  and businesses,  while  strengthening  investment  and innovation  across  EU  countries.  The 2021  review  of the Coordinated  Plan on AI, refers  to AI Watch  reports  and confirms  the role of  AI Watch  to support  the implementation  and monitoring  of the Coordinated  Plan.  AI Watch  monitors  European  Union’s  industrial,  technological  and research  capacity  in AI; AI-related  policy   initiatives  in the Memb er States;  uptake  and technical  developments  of AI; and AI impact.  AI Watch  has a  European  focus  within  the global  landscape.  In the context  of AI Watch , the Commission  works  in coordination   with Member  States.  AI Watch  results  and analyses  are published  on the AI Watch  Portal   (https://ec.europa.eu/knowledge4policy/ai -watch_en ).  AI Watch  is carried  out by the Joint Research  Centre  (JRC)  of the European  Commission,  in collaboration  with  the Directorate ‑General  for Communications  Networks,  Content  and Technology  (DG CONNECT).  AI Watch  indepth  analysis  exercises  allow  achieving  a better  understanding  of European  Union’s  strengths  and areas  where   more  efforts  in terms  of human  structural  and financial  investment  are needed.  AI Watch  aims to provide  an  independent  assessment  of the impacts  and benefits  of AI on growth,  jobs, education,  and society as a whole.   This report  addresses  the following  objective  of AI Watch : it presents  a summary  of the proceedings  of the  workshop  of the 4th AI Watch  Peer Learning  Workshop  on AI use & impact  in public  services . The event  took  place  online  on 28 October  2021,  with the participation  of 86 representatives  from 24 Member  States  and  Associated  Countries , amongst  which  55 public  servants  from Member  States  and Associated  Countries ,  including  14 EU officials,  and 17 researchers  from all over Europe .  The Worksh op was an important  opportunity  to i) engage  with relevant  stakeholders  to better  understand  the  potential  use and impact  of AI for the public  sector;  ii) present  and discuss  a "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the  Public  Sector”; iii) validate  a set of recommendations  with a number  of actions  addressing  stakeholders  at  different  operational  levels,  aiming  at fostering  the adoption  and use of AI by the public  sector  throughout   Europe .                                                    1  https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/ai -watch_en   2  https://digital -strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/plan ai#:~:text=Coordinated%20Plan%20on%20Artificial%20Intelligence%202021%20Review, The%20key%20aims&text=Turning%20strategy%20into%20action%2C%20 the,uptake%20of%20new%20 digital%20solutions ;

  3 1. Executive  Summary   The online  ‘4th AI Watch  Peer Learning  Workshop  on the use and impact  of AI in Public  Services ’, was organis ed  by the JRC of the European  Commission  jointly  with DG CNECT  on 28 October  2021 . The event  saw the  participation  of 86 representatives  from  24 Member  States  (MSs)  and Associated  Countries , amongst   which  55 public  servants  from Member  States  and Associated  Countries , including  14 EU officials,  and 17  researchers  from all over Europe .  The workshop  aimed at expanding  the existing  knowledge  on the endeavours  undertaken  by Member  States   and Associated  Countries  on the use of AI in the Public  Sector  and envisaged  five objectives:   1. Present  the ongoing  work on the “Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector”;  2. Disseminate  some  preliminary  results  from a survey  on Member  States  and Associated  Countries   on the driving  factors  and impacts  of the adoption  of AI in the public  sector ;  3. Collect  feedback  for improvements  on the “Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector” draft   document ;  4. Facilitate  peer-learning  and information -gathering  and exchange  on the state  of the art, challeng es  and opportunities , crosscutting  issues,  existing  and/or  needed  guidelines  about  AI, and continuing  the  Peer Learning  activities,  where  EU Member  States  could  share  their insights  about  the use of AI within   Public  Services  and their results ;  5. Showcase  initiatives  by a few Member  States  related  to the adoption  of AI in the public  sector.   The Workshop  was divided  into three  main  sessions .  In the introductory  session , the background,  the elaboration  process,  and the content  of the draft  document   of the "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector"  (also synthetically  referred  to as “the document” ) was  presented.  The main  content  of the document  presented  at the event consists  of a set of 16 recommendations   to foster  the adoption  and use of AI by the Europe an public  sector .   The resulting  recommendations  are based  on the analysis  of existing  research  literature,  an updated  analysis   of Member  States  and Associated  Countries  national  AI strategies,  and the results  of an EU-wide survey   addressed  to practitioners  from National  Public  Organisations  throughout  Europe,  and EU public  officials  dealing   with AI adoption  in the public  sector.   The recommendations  have been divided  into four Intervention  Areas  clustering  a number  of Recommendations,   and possib le actions  addressing  stakeholders  at different  operational  levels :   Area 1. Promote  an EU-value  oriented,  inclusive  and human -centric  AI in the Public Sector;    Area 2. Enhance  coordinated  governance,  convergence  of regulations  and capacity  building;    Area 3. Build  a shared  and interactive  AI digital  ecosystem;    Area 4. Applying  value  oriented  AI impact  assessment  frameworks.   In the second  session , all participants  were divided  into four groups  each assigned  to one of the above   Intervention  Area.  Working  in breakout  sessions,  the groups  elaborated  feedback  on strengths,  weaknesses,  and  suggestions  for improvement  for each of the recommendations  in the corresponding  Intervention  Area.  The  feedback  was then presented  by each group  in a plenary.   In the third  sessio n, representatives  from Italy, Denmark,  and Portugal  presented  experiences  in the adoption   and use of AI in the public  sector.  Afterwards,  a summary  was presented  of the feedback  collecte d from the  different  breakout  sessions  around  the recommendations .  The summary  of the feedback  was structured  along  with the four Intervention  Areas  in which  recommendations   are grouped.  Five overall  principles  emerged  in discussions  across  the different  Intervention  Areas  and across   the discussion  groups:   1. Avoid  duplicati ons where  there  is room  for reuse  of existing  resources ;  2. The importance  of training  a wide array  of stakeholders;   3. Re-think procurement  practices;  
  4 4. Monitoring  ex-ante and ex-post through  observatories  and experimenting  via sandboxing;   5. Refine  the understandin g of implications  of co-creation.   The concluding  remarks  of the workshop  highlighted  the progress  of AI Watch  activities  leading  to the 4th PeerLearning  Workshop,  and outline d directions  for future  initiatives  at EU level concerning  AI adoption  and use in  the Public Sector , and invited  stakeholders  to keep engagement  high in order  to progress  on a mutually   beneficial  and complementary  fashion .    
  5 2. Introduction   The 4th Peer-Learning  Workshop  on the use and impact  of AI in the public  sector  has been organised   to collect  feedback  on the draft  document  developed  by the JRC in collaboration  with DG CONNECT  and a pool  of independent  experts,  The document  titled  "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector"  aims to  provide  evidence -based,  actionable  recommendati ons addressing  European  public  sector  authorities  at all  levels , in order  to foster  the adoption  and implementation  of AI by Governments  in Europe .  The workshop  draws  on the outcomes  of the previous  3rd Peer-Learning  Workshop  on the use and impact  of AI  in the public  sector  organised  by the JRC on the 24th of June 2021  together  with DG CONNECT.  This event   presented  the preliminary  results  from the analysis  of the National  Strategies  on AI in the Public  Sector  and a  collaborative  effort  to sketch  the “Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector” together  with representatives   from the European  Member  States  and Associated  Countries  and other  stakeholders  was kicked  off.  Invitation s to participate  in the 4th Peer-Learning  Workshop  was sent to 150+  invitees,  including  Governments   public  servants  involved  in the adoption  of AI at national,  regional,  and local level;  relevant  EU officials ;  academic  researchers ; and practitioners  from the private  sector.   The draft  of the "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector"  was circulated  in advance  to all registered   participants  for them  to prepare  an informed  and rich feedback  during  the workshop.   The workshop  was held online  and consisted  of three  parts , namely :    an introduction,  including  the presentation  of the content  of the "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the  Public  Sector"  draft , and background  information  on the methodology  used to structure  and build the  roadmap  and related  sources ;    Four parallel  breakout  sessions , where  participants  provided  comments  and suggestions  for improv ing  the document  both, in the breakout  rooms  and in the plenary  session ;    The conclusive  session,  included  three  presentations  of AI initiatives  applied  to the public  sector  from  Italy, Denmark,  and Portugal,  and a summary  of the feedba ck collected  on the overall  document  "Road   to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector"  received  during  the workshop.   The full agenda  of the workshop  is available  as an Annex  to this report.  The content  of this report  is organis ed  following  the structure  of the three  session s of the workshop.   3. Presentation  of the draft  "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public   Sector"   Chair:  Eva Martinez  Rodriguez,  Project  Manager  at Digital  Economy  Unit, JRC/B6  of the European  Commission.   The first session  of the workshop  consisted  of the presentation  of the draft  document  of the "Road  to  the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector" . The session  was opened  with a welcome  message  by Carlos   Torrecilla  Salinas , Head  of the Digital  Economy  Unit, JRC/B6 of the European  Commission.  Mr Torrecilla   summarised  the activities  conducted  in the last years  by the AI Watch  displaying  that the 4th Peer-Learning   Workshop  is the latest  of the series  of fruitful  events  for debating  on the use and impact  of AI in the Public   Sector.  Moreover,  Mr Torrecilla  informed  the participants  of the recent  publication  of the new JRC Technical   Report  titled  "Beyond  pilots:  sustainable  implementation  of AI in public  services"3, also an outcome  of AI Watch   activities.    After  a brief presentation  of the AI Watch,  he highlighted  the increased  relevance  of AI in the EU public  sector .  Governments  are moving  from  being  regulator s to becoming  key deployers  of AI systems  for  improving  public  service  delivery . He also warned  about  potential  challenges,  including  technical  ones (such   as the presence  of legacy  IT systems,  and biases  in data),  and organisational  ones (such  as issues  with the  governance  of AI) in adopting  AI in the public  sector.    The welcome  messag e ended  with a presentation  of the structure  of the workshop.                                                     3  Molinari,  F., Van Noordt,  C., Vaccari,  L., Pignatelli,  F. and Tangi,  L., AI Watch .

  6 Marina  Manzoni,  Project  Officer  at the Digital  Economy  Unit, JRC/B6  - European  Commission,  then took the floor  together  with Luca Tangi,  Project  Officer  in the same  Unit, to present  the backgrou nd, the elaboration  process,   and the content  of the draft  of the "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector".   The presentation  first outlined  the legal and policy  environment  of the document , which  aims to be  complementary  with the existing  activitie s ongoing  in Europe  on AI and specifically  on AI in the Public  Sector.   This list of policy  initiatives  include s - but is not limited  to - the "White  Paper  On Artificial  Intelligence  - A  European  approach  to excellence  and trust"4, the "AI Act"5, the 2021  review  of the Coordinated  Plan on Artificial   Intelligence6, the Ethic guidelines  for Trustworthy  AI7, and the Assessment  List for Trustworthy  Artificial   Intelligence  (ALTAI)  for self-assessment8. Moreover,  Ms Manzoni  highlighted  the complementar ity of the  document  with the other  activities  ongoing  under  AI Watch .   The "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector"  was presented  as an actionable  plan based  on concrete   evidence , supported  by examples,  ruled  by common  needs  and opportunities,  and in line with existing  initiatives   and policies  at all levels . The document  has the following  objectives:   1. Provide  an educated  picture  of the State  of the Art of AI in Europe ;  2. Identify  challenges  and opportunities ;  3. Outline  initiatives  and activities  in support  of the progress  of AI in the PS;  4. Provide  possible  actions  for key stakeholders  at all levels;   5. Identify  policy  options  and research  avenues  for the future.   Beyond  the legal and policy  basis,  the draft  of the document  was built on the analysis  of a landscaping  exercise   that includes:     A comparative  analysis  of the National  Strategies  on AI from  Members  States  and Associated   Countries9;   A collection  of AI cases  around  Europe  and an in-depth  analysis  of specific  uses and practices10;   acknowledged  studies  in the existing  literature ;   an EU-wide survey.   This EU-wide online  survey  (synthetically  also referred  to as “survey”)  targeted  Member  States'  practitioners   of public  administrations  at all levels  for both internal  use and for outreaching  businesses  and citizens,  with  the objective  of collecting  data from ongoing  AI-projects  in the public  sector  in support  of the recommendations.   The survey  included  questions  on the purpose  of the AI-based  solutions  known  to the respondents,  the policy   areas  for which  the solution  is developed,  its degree  of automation,  the perceived  factors  influencing  adoption,   and the perceived  actual  or expected  impacts,  risks,  and likelihood of permanent  implementation.  To highlight   the importance  of this survey  during  the presentation  Luca Tangi reported  some  findings  in support  of some  of  the recommendations.   Given  this background,  the presentation  outlined  the four areas  in which  the recommendations  had been  clustered:    Area 1. Promote  an EU-value  oriented,  inclusive  and human -centric  AI in the public  sector;                                                     4  White  Paper  on Artificial  Intelligence:  a European  approach  to excellence  and trust.

  7  Area 2. Enhance  coordinated  governance , convergence  of regulations  and capacity  building ;   Area 3. Build  a shared  and interactive  AI digital  ecosystem ;   Area 4. Applying  value  oriented  AI impact  assessment  frameworks.   Area 1 ("Promote  an EU-value  oriented,  inclusive  and human -centric  AI in the public  sector")  includes  three   recommendations:    1.1. Develop  EU regulations  to promote  fair, non-discriminatory  and transparent  AI enabled  public   services  for all citizens;    1.2. Promote  the adopti on of ethical  principles,  the development  of guidelines,  and mitigating  measures   to minimis e risks of deployment  of AI by governments;    1.3. Develop  and promote  dedicated  projects  based  on co-creation  approaches  to increase  citizens  ’ and business  confidence  in the use of AI-based  solutions  by the public  sector.   Responses  of the EU-wide online  survey  indicate  that only a small  portion  of AI-enabled  solutions  paid  attention  to the accessibility  of the relevant  information  by the general  public  a finding  that highlights  a need  for transparency,  which  is what  motivates  the recommendation  1.1 ("Develop  EU regulations  to promote  fair,  non-discriminatory  and transparent  AI enabled  public  services  for all citizens").  Moreover,  the survey  findings   show  that citizens  were only rarely  involved  in the planning  (19%  of the respondents)  and piloting  (26%)  of AIenabled  solutions  and that most  of public  administrations  do not expect  AI-enabled  solutions  to enhance   citizens’ influence  on government  actions  and policies  (73%) . The lack of citizen  involvement  and co-creation  is  the rational e for formulating  recommendation  1.3 ("Develop  and promote  dedicated  projects  based  on cocreation  approaches  to increase  citizens  ’and business  confidence  in the use of AI-based  solutions  by the public   sector").   Area 2 ("Enhance  coordinated  governance,  convergence  of regulations  and capacity  building")  includes  five  recommendations:    2.1. Create  an EU-wide network  of governance  bodies  for AI in the public  sector;    2.2. Design  national  and Europe an, capacity -building  programs  for public  sector  innovators  willing  to  adopt  AI in support  to the Digital  Transformation  of the public  sector;    2.3. Build  upon and promote  the use of regulatory  sandboxes,  allowing  experimentation  of AI enabled   solutions  in controlled  environments;    2.4. Optimise  funding  in support  to AI in government  to promote  the spreading  and scaling  of reusable   solutions;    2.5. Promote  the development  of multilingual  guidelines  and tools for public  procurement  of AI  solutions  for Public  Administrations  throughout  Europe.   Findings  from two items  in the EU-wide online  survey  support  recommendations  in this area.  A survey   question  on the level of government  in which  AI-enabled  solutions  are adopted  show s that the vast majority  of  initiatives  take place  at national  level (47 out of 58 responses) , with much  fewer  at municipal,  regional,  and  supranational  level.  This unbalance  in the distribution  of initiatives  across  levels  of government  calls for an  increased  effort  to improve  the coordination  among  Member  States,  and diffuse  good  practices  of AI within  the  EU: this is the rationale  of recommendation  2.1 ("Create  an EU-wide network  of governance  bodies  for AI in the  public  sector").   Findings  from another  item in the survey  showed  that digital  literacy  of employees  using  AI systems  and that  the presence  of in-house  expert  AI knowledge  is rather  low on average  (respectively  2.9/5  and 3.1/5) . Survey   data indicate  that there  is a fragmented  situation,  with AI projects  divided  almost  equally  between  organisations   with digital  literacy  and in-house  knowledge  and cases  where  there  is a lack of these  elements.  This situation   calls for a systemic  approach,  envisioned  in recommendation  2.2. ("Design  national  and European,  capacity building  programs  for public sector  innovators  willing  to adopt  AI in support  to the Digital  Transformation  of  the public  sector").   Area 3 ("Build  a shared  and interactive  AI digital  ecosystem;  Area 4. Applying  value  oriented  AI impact   assessment  frameworks")  includes  four recommend ations:  
  8  3.1. Support  research  and knowledge  creation  through  an “AI research  and knowledge  alliance”  amongst  European  universities  and R&D institutions;    3.2. Build  a common  European  Data Space  for Public  Sector  bodies  and their operators,  based  on the  compilation  of relevant  AI datasets  throughout  Europe;    3.3. Reinforce  and advance  existing  initiatives  on open data and interoperability;    3.4. Share  reusable  and interoperable  AI components  at all levels  of European  public  administrations;    3.5. Create  a European  marketplace  for GovTech  solutions  in support  of the public  sector.   Survey  data on the advancement  status  of AI projects  show  that a large  portion  (41%)  of the respondents   indicate  that they are involved  in projects  that have moved  beyon d the planning  and piloting  phases,  and are  already  deployed.  The increasing  availability  of deployed  solutions  is the necessary  condition  for establishing   the sharing  of reusable  and interoperable  AI components  (recommendation  3.4), and for building  a common  European  Data Space  for public  sector  bodies  and their operators,  based  on the compilation  of relevant  AI  datasets  throughout  Europe  (recommendation  3.4).  Area 4 ("Applying  value  oriented  AI impact  assessment  frameworks")  includes  three  recommendations :   4.1. Promote  the setting  up of an EU Observatory  on AI, built on a Pan-European  network  of National   AI Observatories  to gather,  share  and collectively  manage  best practices  and experiences  from  different  stakeholders  in the Public  Sector  throughout  Europ e;   4.2. Develop  and apply  an umbrella  impact  assessment  frameworks  based  on key influencing  factors   to measure  the impact  and related  use of AI in the public  sector;    4.3. Support  Green  AI in the Public  Sector  through  environmental  sustainability  assessment s and civic  engagement.   For this area,  survey  data point  to the need for recommendation  4.3 ("Support  Green  AI in the Public  Sector   through  environmental  sustainability  assessments  and civic engagement").  In fact, the majority  of survey   respondents  indicat e that they do not expect  any effect  from the AI-enabled  solution on the natural  environment   - for instance  on levels  of energy  consumption  – (63%)  showing  a lack of awareness  on the relations  between   AI and environmental  sustainability.   At the end of the presentation  of the rationale,  elaboration  process,  and contents  of the document , Marina   Manzoni  highlighted  how the peer-learning  exercise  to be carried  out during  the workshop  should  be aimed  at  collecting  rich feedback  for improvement . This feedback  will allow  the AI Watch  to refine  a final document  build  thanks  to the contribution  of several  key stakeholders.  The final document  "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the  Public  Sector"  is expected  to be published  in early  2022 . 
  9 4. Feedback  to the draft  "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector"   Chair : Rony Medaglia,  Professor  at the Copenhagen  Business  School   This session  was focused  on discussing  the merits  of the "Road  to the adoption  of AI by the Public  Sector" , and  on collecting  structured  feedback  from  participants . The chair of this session,  Rony Medaglia,  presented   the instructions  for the group  work into which  the discussions  would  be organi sed. Participants  were divided   into four groups , each with the task of discussing  and collecting  feedback  on one of the above  mentioned  four  areas  of recommendations:    Each of the four group s was assigned  a moderator  from the JRC team,  and was instructed  to nominate  one of  the group  members  as a rapporteur,  who would  be in charge  of taking  notes  of the main  points  discussed  during   the groupwork  session,  and summaris ing them  using  a template  provided  by the JRC. The template  consisted   of a PowerPoint  slide to be filled  with feedback  on three  aspects  for each of the recommendations:  strengths ,  weaknesses,  and suggestion s for improvement.   The groupwork  was kicked  off by establishing  virtual  breakout  rooms , with participants  being  assigned  to  the four virtual  rooms  on a random  basis.  At the end of the time allotted  for the breakout  room  discussion  (45  minutes),  each group  Rapporteur  reported  on the outcome  of the discussions  back in the plenary  session.   Below  is the summary  of the feedback  provided  by each of the four groups  to the recommendations  included   in the areas  they had been assigned  to, as reported  by each group ’s Rapporteur.  When  a group  was unable  to  nominate  a Rapporteur,  the assigned  group  Moderator  took over the role of Rapporteur.   4.1. Feedback  on recommendations  in Area 1 (Promote  an EU value  oriented,   inclusive  and human -centric  AI in the public  sector )  In relation  to recommendation  1.1 (“Develop  EU regulations  to promote  fair, non-discriminatory  and  transparent  AI enabled  public  services  for all citizens”),  the group  highlighted  the following  points:    Risk of over-regulation . For many  of the areas  potenti ally affected  by the impacts  of AI in the public   sector  (e.g., privacy,  fairness,  the digital  divide),  there  are already  numerous  pieces  of legislation,   guidelines,  and regulations  at national  and at EU level,  such as the GDPR.  By adding  additional   regulat ions on top of existing  ones without  a clear and uniform  view, there  is a risk of over-regulating   the deployment  of AI in the public  sector.  The potentially  negative  outcomes  can be twofold:  on the  one hand,  unnecessary  complexity  in regulation  would  make  it hard for stakeholders  to lawfully   navigate  the path to successfully  implementing  AI in the public  sector;  on the other  hand,  excessive   regulation  would  discourage  innovation.    Slowness  of regulation . Creating  new regulatory  frameworks  would  imply  engagin g in a potentially   lengthy  cycle  of law-making ,. This slowness  has to be taken  into account  when  regulating  AI for  avoiding  a stark  contrast  with the speed  at which  the field of AI for public  services  is evolving,  making   additional  regulation  counterproductive.    Excessive  focus  on regulation . The presentation  of recommendation  1.1 as the very first one in the  document  may be counterproductive,  as it may unintentionally  give the impression  of an undue  focus   on a regulation -centred  approach  to AI in the public  sector,  at the expense  of other  efforts  aimed  at  stimulating  and facilitating  its uptake.   Based  on these  main  points,  the group  provided  the following  suggestions  to improve  recommendation  1.1:   Leverage  existing  regulation . As numerous  efforts  at EU level have been put into providing  detailed   guidelines  for the adoption  of AI in public  sector,  the document  should  provide  for a reflection  on how  to leverage  these,  rather  than producing  new regulation s from scratch.  For example,  the recent   proposal  for a regulation  of the European  Parliament  and the Council  laying  down  harmonised  rules  on Artificial  Intellige nce (the “AI Act”) provides  detailed  guidelines  for AI in the public  sector.  Some  of  them  are particularly  insightful,  such as the provision  for establishing  evaluation  throughout  and after   the deployment  of AI initiatives  in the public  sector.    Don’t focus  on technology  in itself . The recommendations  should  not have an exclusive  focus  on  the technical  features  of AI, assuming  that it is those  technical  features  that automatically  translate   into impacts.  AI is part of a wider,  long trend  of digital  transform ation  in the public  sector  that includes  
  10 other  technologies,  and the characteristics  of AI shares  with this trend  need to be taken  into account.   The document  needs  to not espouse  a deterministic  view of technology,  but instead  it needs  to consider   the AI phenomenon  from a socio -technical  perspective,  where  technology  does not determine   outcomes,  but instead  both shapes  and is shaped  by the complex  features  of the public  sector,   including  organi sational,  cultural,  and behavioural  elements.  A relevant  metapho r would  be that  focusing  on AI technological  features  in themselves,  instead  of looking  at the complex  interplay  of  factors  that constitutes  the phenomenon  of AI in the public  sector,  would  be the equivalent  of trying   to solve  the issue  of drunk  driving  by only focusing  on the technical  features  of cars.   Move  recommendations  of Area 1 later  in the document . This would  avoid  giving  readers  an  impression  that regulating  is more  important  than stimulating  AI innovation.    Allow  experimentation . Within  the bounda ries of GDPR,  AI regulation  should  allow  those  who are  consenting  to let the data handlers  experiment  with AI solutions.    Mitigate  the importance  of explainability  in regulation . While  focusing  on requirements  of  explainability  of AI solutions  is very impor tant, regulators  should  keep in mind  that complete   explainability  might  be an excessively  high bar. A key argument  to take into account  in putting  it into  context,  is the fact that even complete  explainability  of human  decisions  is impossible,  yet it is not  considered  such a pressing  issue.   In relation  to recommendation  1.2 (“Promote  the adoption  of ethical  principles  and the development  of  guidelines  and mitigati ng measures  to minimis e the risks of deploying  AI in government”),  the group  highlighted   the following  points:    Unpredictability  of AI developments . As the field of AI is developing  at a quick  pace,  it is hard to predict   its developments.  This can represent  a challenge  when  considering  guidelines  and mitigating  measures.    Difficulty  of ex-ante impact  assessments . In some  areas,  such as healthcare,  impacts  can only be  assessed  after the deployment  of AI solutions,  and this could  represent  a challenge  for establishing   principles  and guidelines  for emerging  AI applications.   Based  on these  main  points, the group  provided  the following  suggestions  to improve  recommendation  1.2:   Focus  on sandboxing . The challenges  related  to having  to wait for full deployment  of AI solutions  in  order  to understand  their real impacts  can be tackled  by setting  up limite d regulatory  spaces   ("sandboxes")  for experimenting  with AI solutions  and monitoring  their impacts,  before  a full rollout.   Sandboxing  should  also be used to contextualise  regulations  of AI that might  be inspired  from other   contexts  ("Europeanising  AI regul ation").    Monitor  AI over time . Monitoring  activities  need to be put in place  to understand  AI impacts,  and  compare  them  with impacts  expected  before  rollout.    Share  both best and worst  practices . Best practices  should  be shared  among  public  authorities  in  Europe  to learn  from success  stories.  However,  it is equally  important  to share  less successful   experiences  ("worst  practices"),  to avoid  duplication  of errors  (e.g. in managing  transparency  and  fairness ), and to enable  the creation  of better  validation  tools and processes.   In relation  to recommendation  1.3 (“Develop  and promote  dedicated  initiatives  based  on co-creation   approaches  to increase  citizens’  and businesses’  confidence  in the use of AI-based  solutions  by the public   sector”),  the group  highlighted  the following  points:    Definition  of co-creation . While  co-creation  is indeed  very important  in the development  of AI in the  public  sector,  the term needs  to be carefully  defined.  Co-creation  is, in fact, an umbrella  term that  includes  different  forms  of engagement  (consultation,  co-decision,  etc.), different  types  of stakeholde rs  (individual  citizens,  organis ations,  businesses,  etc.).   Unintended  consequences  of co-creation . Involving  diverse  stakeholders  in co-creation  and can have  unintended  consequences.  For example,  co-created  decisions  will be biased  if the sample  of  participating  citizens  is not representative.  Moreover,  co-creation  becomes  impossible  when  citizens   are unwilling  to participate.  For example,  when  developing  an AI system  for fraud  recognition,  one  cannot  expect  fraudsters  to willingly  participate  in co-creation  of the system  that is geared  towards   targeting  them.  
  11 Based  on these  main  points,  the group  provided the following  suggestions  to improve  recommendation  1.3:   Consider  involving  of citizens  from  early  stages . Citizen  involvement  should  be considered  from  the early  stages  of the design  of AI-based  services,  in order  to reap the benefits  of co-creation,  but  also to evaluate  whether  co-creation  is desirable  at all, and at which  stage.  A context  where  co-creation   is not desirable,  such as when  co-creation  may lead to unintended  consequences  of co-creation,  should   in fact be taken  into account.    Carefully  evaluate  participating  samples . The outcomes  of co-creation  are only as good  as the  participants  involved  in it, as confirmed  by well-established  practices,  such as the one of citizen  science.   This implies  that special  attention  needs  to be dedicated  to who is involved  in co-creation,  to ensure   the representativeness  of decisions  taken  through  co-creation,  and avoid  biases.    Use co-creation  to tackle  big societal  questions . Co-creation  can be a key tool to formulate  AIrelated  solutions  to large,  complex  socie tal questions.  A good example  is the United  Nations'   Sustainable  Development  Goals,  the achievement  of which  AI-powered  public  services  can support.  In  order  to design,  implement,  and manage  such solutions,  technical  expertise  should  be coupled  with  social  science  approaches  that can stem  from the input  of a wide array  of stakeholders  outside   government.   4.2. Feedback  on recommendations  in Area 2 (Enhance  coordinated  governance,   convergence  of regulations  and capacity  building)   In relation  to recommendation  2.1 (“Create  an EU-wide network  of governance  bodies  for AI in the public   sector”),  the group  highlighted  that a network  of governance  bodies  is needed,  but that it should  be more  clearly   and formally  stated  in the document . Moreover,  the EU-wide network  of governance  bodies  for AI in the public   sector  could  act as a support  mechanism  and formalised  in a regulation.    In relation  to recommendation  2.2 (“Design  national  and European  capacity -building  programs  for public   sector  innovators  (public officials)  willing  to adopt  AI in support  to the digital  transformation  of public  services”),   the group  suggested  the following  points:    Establish  common  content  across  training  programmes . Training programmes  should  be  harmonised  to include  common  content  such as, for instance,  standardisation,  interoperability,  AI risks,   AI ethics,  etc.   Develop  contextualised  dedicated  training  modules . Besides  common  content,  training   programmes  should  also include  dedicated  modules  for different  contexts,  including  EU regulations,   national  and local regulations,  etc.  In relation  to recommendation  2.3 (“Build  upon and promote  the use of regulatory  sandboxes  for Public   Administrations,  allowing  experimentation  of AI-enabled  solutions  in controlled  environment s”), the group   highlighted  that, since  it is hard to regulate  a technology  that is so quickly  evolving  such as AI, right conditions   need to be created  to ensure  that AI is adopted  appropriately . One possibility  is to adopt  a mash  up approach ,  by combining  existing  and new regulatory  inputs,  and by combining  international  and local ones.   In relation  to recommendation  2.4 (“Optimise  funding  in support  to AI in government  to promote  the spreading   and scaling  of reusable  solutions”),  the group  provided  the following  suggestions :   Grant  a dedicated  funding  quota  to AI in the public  sector  in EU programmes . A way to ensure   a steady  stream  of funding  to the area of AI in the public  sector  would  be to include  dedicated  funding   quotas  in existing  and upcoming  EU initiatives  related  to the public  sector.  Such quota  should  be  considered  a pre-condition  for new programme s to be established . Funding  support  should  be provided   already  at early  phases  of the development  of AI solutions,  in order  to enable  the necessary  conditions   for scaling  and spreading  of solution  components.    Use international  and national regional/local  funds  in a complementary  manner . Funding  from  different  levels  should  be used in a complementary  manner,  and create  synergies.   In relation  to recomme ndation  2.5 (“Promote  the development  of multilingual  guidelines  and tools for Public   Procurement  of AI solutions  for Public  Administrations  throughout  Europe”),  the group  highlighted  the need to  align  EU principles  with Member  States'  laws and regulations . A possible  approach  would  be to devise  
  12 common  EU AI procurement  baseline  guidelines,  which  provide  criteria  for building  Member  States'  guidelines   in compliance  with EU regulations.   4.3. Feedback  on recommendations  in Area 3 (Build  a shared  and interactive  AI  digital  ecosystem)   In relation  to recommendation  3.1 (“Support  research  and knowledge  creation  around  AI for the Public  Sector   through  the setting  up of an “AI research  and knowledge  alliance” amongst  European  universities  and R&D  institutions ”), the group highlighted  the following  points:    Europe  needs  to be a leader  in AI research . Given  the global  race to AI leadership,  Europe  needs  to seek  leadership  in producing  world -class  research  on AI in general,  and on AI in the public  sector  in particular.   Europe an universities  should  focus  on specific  applications  of AI.   Academic  research  is not the only option . While  there  is a need to support  research  produced  in  European  academia,  should  be complemented  with other  types  of research  that are able to reach  a  broader  and more  practitioner -oriented  audience.   Based  on these  main  points,  the group  provided  the following  suggestions  to improve  recommendation  3.1:   Strengthen  multi -disciplinary  research . Research  on AI in the public  sector  needs  to cut across   discipl inary  boundaries:  technical  sciences,  social  sciences,  and humanities.  To this purpose,  there   should  be less emphasis  on the disciplinary  belonging  of particular  types  of schools  in assigning   research  funding  and developing  research  programmes.    Establish  clear funding  channels . Access  to funding  linked  to research  on AI should  be simplified,   with clear channels  established  for supporting  research  centres,  PhD positions,  etc. Specific  funding  for  AI for public  services  should  be clearly  signalled.   In relatio n to recommendation  3.2 (“Build  a common  European  Data Space  for Public  Sector  bodies  and their  operators,  building  on the compilation  of relevant  AI datasets  throughout  Europe”),  the group  highlighted  that  a European  Data Space  would  provide  very valuable  data sets. However,  a data space  should  not be considered   as a centralised  repository,  but instead  as a means  of opening  data by stakeholders  from Member  States  to  each other.  In this effort,  it is important  to keep in mind  that anonymising  data,  which  should be a requirement   in creating  a European  Data Space,  can be a costly  endeavour.   Based  on these  main  points,  the group  provided  the following  suggestions  to improve  recommendation  3.2:   Include  reference  to data trusts,  data cooperatives  and other  new developments  in civil  society . The recommendation  should  acknowledge  and make  reference  to experiences  of data sharing   that are similar  to a data space.  These  include  data trust and data cooperatives.  The recommendation   should  also reference  other  possible  emerging  initiatives  aimed  at data sharing  that stem  from nongovernmental  stakeholders  in civil society.    Include  a diverse  array  of data sources . These  spaces  should  not only include  government -owned   or government -generated  data,  but also data generated  and owned  by non-governmental  actors  --  businesse s and civil society . An example  of such data would  be the ones generated  by participants  in  sharing  economy  platform s, which could  be pooled  to build data assets  to facilitate  their operations   (e.g., Uber drivers  creating  shared  knowledge  to build data assets for taxi drivers).    Focus  on privacy -enhancing  technologies . In building  a European  Data Space,  particular  care  should  be put in preserving  the privacy  rights  of participating  stakeholders.  To this end, a focus  should   be put on the adoption  and use of privacy  enhancing  technologies,  which  should  also be the subject  of  an increased  research  effort.   In relation  to recommendation  3.3 (“Reinforce  and advance  existing  initiatives  on open data and  interoperability”),  the group  highlighted  the following  points:    Costs  of opening  up datasets . Opening  government  data is often  seen as a costly  endeavour  by public   sector  bodies.  In addition,  advantages  of opening  up datasets  are not always  clear to public  managers .  Moreover,  data use and data analytics  are not seen by governments  as areas  of budget  priority.  
  13  Sensitive  nature  of certain  types  of datasets . Given  that some  data are sensitive,  governments  are  hesitant  to open those  datasets  up. As a result  of this, and of costs  related  to opening  up datasets,   some  of the most  important  datasets  might  remain  inaccessible .  Based  on these  main  points,  the group  provided  the following  suggestions  to improve  recommendation  3.3:   Find incentives  to support  the production  and sharing  of quality  data . Given  the costs  and  perceived  risks associated  with opening  up datasets,  public  sector  bodies  should  be provided  with  incentives  to engage  in producing  and sharing  high quality  data.  There  is a need to “close  the loop”  on  the added  value  of open data:  if public  sector  organisations  receive  benefit  from the data they provide,   they would  be incentivised.    Educate  public  managers  on the value  of open data . The perception  of value  of opening  up  datasets  depends  on how aware  decision -makers  are of the potential  advantages  of open data.  To  increase  such awareness,  there  is a need to educate  and train public  managers  to better  understand   how investing  in data infrastructures  and sharing  open data can provide  organisational  and societal   value . This will contribute  to overcome  the narrative  of seeing  open data exclusively  as an  administrative  burden.   In relation  to recommendation  3.4 (“Share  reusable  and interoperable  AI components  at all levels  of European   Public  Administrations”),  the group  highlighted  that, while  sharing  reusable  and interoperable  AI components   can potentially  help all public  administrations  move  at the same  pace,  it can be hard to find relevant  components   to be shared.   Based  on these  main  points,  the group  provided  the suggestion  to align  AI compo nents  to problems . In  sharing  reusable  and interoperable  AI components,  they should  be organised  around  the policy  problems  they  can contribute  to solve.  For example,  a public  manager  looking  for solutions  related  to health  or housing  should   be able to browse an easily  accessible  directory  to find helpful  AI components  from other  Members  States.  Such  directory  should  also include  access  to experts,  standards,  performance  metrics,  and methodologies  to help less  experienced  public  managers  to draw  on shared  AI components  in order  to run a project  from beginning  to end.  In relation  to recommendation  3.5 (“Create  a European  marketplace  for GovTech  solutions  in support  to the  public  sector”),  the group  highlighted  the issue  that the current  procurement  framework  discriminates  against   European  start-ups and small  and medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  who cannot  compete  against  the large  multi national  players.   Based  on these  main  points,  the group  provided  the suggestion  to establish  problem -led procurement   processes  to give European  start -ups and SMEs  an advantage . In order  for the public  sector  to exploit   the innovative  potential  of the private  sector  in full, a problem -led procurement  vehicle  is needed  and would   give innovative  and agile start-ups/SMEs  an advantage,  with respect  to bigger  companies  and multi -national   players.  In this context,  consideration  should  be given  to the identification  and development  of measures  to  stimulate  both the supply  and the demand  side of the European  GovTech  ecosystem.  It was suggested  to explore   ways  to use specific  procurement  framework  and conditions  dedicated  to support  European  start-ups and SMEs,   for example  with the use of Art. 32 of Directive  2014/24/EU11.  4.4. Feedback  on recommendations  in Area 4 (Applying  value -oriented  AI impact   assessment  frameworks)   In relation  to recommendation  4.1 (“Promote  the setting  up of a Pan-European  network  of AI observatory  to  gather,  share  and collectively  manage  best practices  and experiences  learned  from different  stakeholders  in  the Public  Sector  throughout  Europe”),  the group  highlighted  the following  points:    Risk of duplicating  existing  monitoring  efforts . The establishment  of an EU-wide network  of  observatories  on AI in the public  sector  runs the risk of unnecessarily  duplicat ing work already  carried   out by other,  non-EU bodies.  In particular,  the monitoring  activity  carried  out by the OECD.AI  observatory   should  be mentioned  in the document  and taken  into account.                                                     11  https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0024  
  14  Establishing  AI observatories  can be time consuming . The resources  and time required  to gather  all the  data necessary  to establish  an effective  observatory  can be substantial , and need to be carefully   considered.    Risk of evidence  gaps due to a lack of overview  in Member  States . The resulting  datasets  of monitoring   activit ies might  feature  “false”  gaps if there  is no clear overview  of activities  ongoing  in the Member   States.   Based  on these  main  points,  the group  provided  the following  suggestions  to improve  recommendation  4.1:   Coordinate  actions  with existing  observatories . This would  avoid  duplication  of existing   monitoring  effort s, done for instance  by OECD  and UNESCO.    Extend  the scope  of monitoring . Monitoring  in the observatories  should  not only track  the offering   and use of AI solutions,  but also the emergence  of new technologies  and new standards,  and monitor   barriers  and needs  associated  with the adoption  of AI in the public  sector  in Member  States .   Provide  Member  States  with methodologies  and incentives  to establish  observatories . Public   authorities  in each Member  States should  be provided  guidance  on how to establish  observatories  in  the form of methodological  tools to monitor  AI uptake.  Moreover,  since  monitoring  efforts  are resource intensive,  there  should  be tangible  incentives  for public  managers  to embark  on moni toring  activities.    Provide  interactive  interfaces . The data collected  by observator ies should  be presented  with  interactive  features,  for instance , to allow  the comparison  of AI solutions  and tools by users.   In relation  to recommendation  4.2 (“Develop  and apply  umbrella  impact  assessment  frameworks  based  on  key influencing  factors  to measure  the impact  and related  use of AI in the public  sector”),  the group  highlighted   the fact that an umbrella  assessment  framework  that could  be used across  different  Member  States  and across   policy  area is greatly  needed.  However,  for such a framework  to be successful  there  would  have to be an EUwide legislation  in place  to ensure  compliance  and a technology  standard  - something  that is still missing  as  the EU "AI Act" is still not being  finalised.   Based  on these  main  points,  the group  provided  the following  suggestion  to improve  recommendation  4.2:   Expand  the array  of areas  included  in assessing  impacts . Impact  assessment  should  include  a  multitude  of areas  that go beyond  economic  performance  or citizen  satisfaction.  Impacts  should  be  distinguished  between  technical  and functional  impacts.  Technical  impacts  include  elements  such as  technical  standards,  robustness,  interoperability,  data governance,  life expectanc y, cost, service  level  agreements,  and external  sourcing.  Functional  impacts  include  elements  such as trust towards  AI  solutions,  risk of people  doing  their job wrong  (developers,  etc.), outcome  and reach  of the solutions.   In relation  to recommendation  4.3 (“Support  Green  AI in the Public  Sector  through  environmental   sustainability  assessments  and civic engagement”),  the group  highlighted  the fact that, while  it is very important   to reconcile  AI and environmental  impacts,  it can be hard to find accountabili ty in many  AI projects,  since  most   IT infrastructure  is not provided  by public  sector,  but by the private  sector.   Based  on this main  point,  in order  to improve  recommendation  4.3, the group  suggested  considering  the work   carried  out by the OECD  in previous  years  on Green  ICT, whose  main  tenets  are still valid.  Moreover,  the issue   of lack of accountability  could  be tackled  by embedding  analysis  of AI impacts  on the environment  already  at  the procurement  stage  of AI solutions  by the public  sector.   5. The way ahead  at EU and national  level   Chair : Marina  Manzoni,  Project  Officer  - Digital  Economy  Unit, JRC/B6  - European  Commission .  The Chair  of this session  opened  the floor for the presentation  of the experience  of adoption  and use of AI in  and for the public  sector  by three  Member  States:  Italy , Denmark , and Portugal . 
  15 5.1. Member  States'  experiences  of adoption  and use of AI in and for the public   sector   5.1.1.  Italy  Daniela  Battisti,  Head  of International  Relations,  Ministry  for Technological  Innovation  and Digital  Transition,   Italy.  Dr Battisti ’s presentation  started  by showcasing  some  of the work carried  out in 2021  by the Italian  G20  Presidency  in collaboration  with the OECD,  to inform  discussion  within  the Digital  Economy  Task Force  (DETF),   which  was then transformed  into the Digital  Economy  Working  Group  (DEWG)  in August  2021.  The work  consisted  of three  reports,  titled  “G20 Compendium  on the use of digital  tools for public  service  continuity”;  “G20 Collection  of Digital  Identity  practices”; and “Survey  on agile regulation  across  G20 Members”. The reports   highlighted  the importance  of establishing  reliable  systems  for verifying  digital  identities  in Member  States,  in  order  to reinforce  citizen  trust in AI-based  public  sector  initiatives.  The experience  with drafting  these  three   reports  highlighted  the fact that agile regulation  can be a powerful  approach  to AI: by establishing  regulatory   sandboxes , in fact, the need for regulating  AI can be more  successfu lly balanced  with the need to stimulate   innovation  and experimentation  in this field. Dr Battisti  stressed  the need for an agile  approach  to regulation   for AI, citing  cases  where  young  entrepreneurs  could  not apply  what  they had developed,  and ended  up selling  their product  and expertise  abroad,  thus widening  the gap between  Europe  and China/US.   Dr Battisti  then argued  for the need to promote  digital  transformation  by establishing  a safe and transparent   context  to secure  the public  sector's  operations  and service  delivery  by combating  and preventing  corruption.   To that purpose,  providing  public  incentives  for the private  sector  to invest  in the development  of transferable   skills is of key importance.  In particular,  Dr Battisti  highlighted  the importance  of promoting  digital  skills  for  women,  young  people,  and low-skilled  workers , by establishing  training  and upskilling  programmes.   Echoing  the discussions  carried  out during  the breakout  sessions  of the workshop,  the presentation  highlighted   the important  role of government  in procuring  AI. Governments,  in fact, should  promote  sustainable  growth   for SMEs  and micro  enterprises,  leveraging  their role as procurers  of AI solutions.   The presentation  then zoomed  in on initiatives  taken  in the area of public  sector  AI in Italy. In particular,   reference  was made  to an EU-supported  project  launched  by the Italian  Revenue  Agency,  consisting  of a system   to detect  tax evasion  based  on machine  learning  technologies.  The project  was referred  to as a concrete   example  of an AI-enabled  solution  in the taxation  area that was developed  by involving  all relevant   stakeholders  (taxation  authorities,  developers,  service  providers,  and users),  and that has been informed  by a  user-friendly  and data-driven  approach.   Summing  up, the experie nce matured  at the Ministry  for Technological  Innovation  and Digital  Transition  in  collaboration  with the OECD  has shown  that digital  government  maturity,  including  common  tools and enablers,   are fundamental  in securing  governments'  capacity  and capability  to respond  effectively.  In particular,  digital   tools and platforms  (including  AI-enabled  ones,  such as chatbots)  provided  an optimal  way to secure  the  continuity  of public  services  in the face of a major  disruption,  such as the one of the COVID -19 pandemi c.  5.1.2.  Denmark   Lasse  Olsen,  Policy  Officer  at the Agency  for Digitisation,  Denmark.   The presentation  by Lasse  Olsen  focused  on showing  the results  of the Knowledge  assessment  of projects  of  the Danish  National  Artificial  Intelligence  Uptake  Fund.  The Danish  National  AI Uptake  Fund  is an investment   fund for new technologies  established  for the period  2019 -2022  between  the Danish  national  government,   Local  Government  Denmark  and the Danish  Regions  to support  projects  using  AI to increase  the quality  and  efficienc y of key tasks  in the public  sector.   The goal of the knowledge  assessment  that has been carried  out by the Danish  Agency  for Digitisation  is  threefold:  to share  knowledge  between  existing  AI projects;  to provide  knowledge  on cross -cutting   challenges  and input  for the future  joint governmental  collaboration;  and to disseminate  experiences  to  public  authorities  and stakeholders.  The summary  of the knowledge  assessment  has also been translated  to  English.  
  16 The knowledge  assess ment  drew on three  sources  of data:  interviews  with the managers  of 15 “signature”  projects  (7 at municipal  level,  8 at regional  level),  spanning  the areas  of health,  cancer  treatment,  employment,   administration,  and welfare;  desk research;  and subsequent  written  feedback  from the managers.   Findings  from the knowledge  assessment  identified  seven  areas  of challenges  experienced  by the projects.   These  areas  are (in decreasing  order  of prevalence):  insufficient  quality  of data;  uncertainty  regarding  the  interp retation  of the GDPR;  limited  technical  access  to data;  lack of access  to legal expertise;  difficulties  in  navigating  ethical  considerations;  insufficient  management  support;  and challenges  in collaborating  with  suppliers.   The presentation  zoomed  in on the three  areas  of challenge  perceived  as most  significant  by the managers:  the  one related  to data;  the one related  to law; and the one related  to IT infrastructure.   In relation  to data , findings  of the knowledge  assessment  show  that over half of the project s experienced  a  lack of technical  access  to data in existing  systems.  This happens  because  managers  experience  that the  systems  are not built for data extraction,  or because  authorities  need to pay a supplier  to access  their own data.   A specific  example  of this challenge  is the one evidenced  at the Zealand  University  Hospital,  where  managers   have experienced  difficulties  in accessing  data from the electronic  healthcare  record  system  platform  (Sundhed   platform).   In relation  to law, the biggest  perceived  challenge  is the interpretation  of the GDPR.  In particular,  data from the  knowledge  assessment  evidence  difficulties  in managing  the usage  of data for other  purposes  than the ones  for which  data was originally  intended,  as provided  for by the GDPR.   In relation  to IT infrastructure , findings  from the knowledge  assessment  indicate  that several  projects  are  challenged  by insufficient  amounts  of data,  or data that is of insufficient  quality.  An additional  challenge  is the  lack of data standards.  For example,  the Copenhagen  hospital  Rigshospitalet  reports  a lack of protocols  for data  standardisation , resulting  in data naming  that changes  from department  to department.   In conclusion,  the knowledge  assessment  solicited  recommendations  from the managers  involved  in the  projects.  These  recommendations  are summari sed in 10 items:    1. Create  an overview  of the data and understand  the data needs;   2. Do not underestimate  the need for establishing  a legal basis  for the project;   3. Establish  an overview  of existing  and potential  IT systems;  4. Everyone  who is affected  by the project  should  be included;   5. Make  time to assemble  the right project  group  with the necessary  skills;   6. Respect  data and data ethics;   7. Ensure  support  from the management;   8. Avoid  technology  fixation;   9. View AI projects  as core projects  in the organisation;   10. Find good  collaboration  partners.   5.1.3.  Portugal   Paulo  Quaresma,  Professor,  Member  of the Board  of Directors  of the Science  and Technology  Foundation  (FCT),   Portugal.   The presentation  by Prof. Quaresma  focused  on the initiatives  related  to AI in the public  sector  carried  out in  connection  with INCoDe,  the Portuguese  program  for Digital  Competences . The presentation  first  introduced  some  information  on FCT, the Portugues e Science  and Technology  Foundation.  FCT is a public  agency   funding  a number  of AI-related  research  centres  and associated  labs, AI projects,  and PhD grants  and researcher   contracts.  The funding  is assigned  through  open calls.  In particular,  in the past few years,  FCT has published   specific  calls for projects  on AI in the public  administration,  with the goal of attracting  proposals  on a wide  variety  of areas,  and the requirement  for the applying  consortia  to include  both research  institutions  and a  public  administration.  FCT currently  funds  around  40 projects  on AI in public  administration,  for a total of a bit  less than 10 million  euro.  In addition,  FCT funds  the use and access  to advanced  computing  resources,  including  
  17 the Portuguese  Advanced  Computing  Network,  and a recent  call for the use of AI cloud  services,  to which  public   administrations  are also expected  to apply.   INCoDe  is the main  Portuguese  program  for Digital  Competences,  and consists  of an integrated  public  policy   initiative  aimed  at enhancing  digital  competences  across  different  ministries,  with the time horizon  of 2030.   The programme  runs across  five action  lines:  education  and training ; qualification  and requalification ;  inclusion ; advanced  training ; and research .  The presentation  then focused  on the Portugues e national  strategy  for AI, titled  “AI Portugal  2030”.  The  national  strategy  includes  a focus  on public  administration  and its modernis ation.  A working  group  named  “AI  for the public  sector”  has also been established  under  the umbrella  of INCoDe  to monitor,  assess,  and help AI  for the public  sector  initiatives  to achieve  success.  The assessments  carried  out by the working  group,  it is noted,   are not aimed  at replacing  assessments  already  carried  out by the funding  agencies.   The working  group identified  a total of 70 projects  on AI in the public  sector  started  in the period  2019 -2020   from open calls by the FCT, or from initiatives  by the Agency  for Administrative  Modernization  (AMA).  These   projects  are distributed  across  five areas:  18 projec ts in the health  area (for example,  the project  titled  “Use of  AI to enhance  dermatological  screening”,  to enable  skin cancer  monitoring  via videoconference,  which  is now  quite  close  to deployment;  and the project  titled  “Application  of AI and NLP Methodol ogies  in the Screening,   Counseling  and Referral  Service  of the phone  line NHS24”,  to help nurses  and doctors  classifying  phone  calls  from patients);  11 projects  in education  (for example,  the project  titled  “Permanent  Observatory  of School   Dropout  and School Success”);  11 projects  in territory  (for example,  the project  titled  “IPSentinel  Land  Recognition  System”);  17 projects  in citizen  and consumption  (for example,  the project  titled  “Detection  of  addiction  patterns  in online  game”);  and 13 projects  in public services  (for example,  the project  titled  “BALCAT:   AI for ballistics  analysis”,  which  is an already  a quite  mature  project).   In concl usion,  the presentation  summaris ed the main  achievements  of this array  of activities,  which  are  publishing  the national  strategy  for AI, establishing  the INCoDe  working  group,  publishing  open calls for AI in  the public  sector  projects,  and supporting  the establishment  of 70 ongoing  R&D projects,  which  should  start to  be used by the public  sector  in 2022.  The list of effort s to still be completed,  on the other  hand,  includes  closer   monitoring  and proactive  support  to the ongoing  projects,  focusing  on the public  procurement  of innovation,   and establishing  stronger  links with existing  EU networks  and public  sector  initiatives.   5.2. Summary  and discussion  of Member  States'  feedback   Rony Medaglia  presented  a summary  of the feedback  provided  by the workshop  participants  during  the previous   breakout  session  followed  by the plenary  discussion.   The summary  was structured  along  with the four Intervention  Areas  in which  recommendations  are grouped.   Five overall  principles  emerged  in discussions  across  the different  Intervention  Areas  and across  the  discussion  groups:   1. Avoid  duplications  where  there  is room  for reusing  existing  resource s  There are already  existing  initiatives  on almost  all aspects  related  to AI adoption  and use in the public.  Those   initiatives  have to be taken  into account.  These  aspects  include  technology  procurement,  training,  monitoring   activities,  best practices,  ethical principles  and regulations.  It is important  to build on the existing  base of  knowledge  and practice  without  reinventing  things  that have been already  discovered.  This will allow  Member   States  to avoid  duplication  and unnecessary  waste  of resources    2. Importance  of training  a wide array  of stakeholders .  Stakeholders  involved  and potentially  affected  by AI adoption  and use in the public  sector  are numerous  and  diverse.  They include  not only governments,  but also startups , SMEs,  non-governmental  organis ations, large   corporations,  and individual  citizens.  Each of these  stakeholders  needs  to have the awareness  and possess   proper  skills to tackle  the complex  phenomena  brought  about  by AI in the public  sector.  In order  to achieve  this  awareness  and skills  equipm ent, education  and training  are crucial.   3. Re-think  procurement  practices .  The adoption  and use of AI is even more  challenging  when  it occurs  in a public  sector  context.  One of the reasons   for this is that the public  sector  plays  the crucial  role of the procurer of technology  solutions,  with key  responsibilities  towards  citizen  stakeholders.  Traditional  procurement  practices  are challenged  by the swiftly   evolving  nature  of AI, on the one hand,  and by the fact that AI systems  are very hard to inspect  and asses s 
  18 before  their actual  deployment.  This calls for a fundamental  re-thinking  of procurement  practices,  to allow   government  to effectively  play both roles of mitigating  potential  unintended  consequences  of AI, and enabling   the innovation  processes  that it brings about.   4. Monitoring  ex-ante and ex-post through  observatories  and experimenting  via  sandboxing.   Monitoring  activities  and impacts  assessment  are key in the adoption  and use of AI in the public  sector.  There   is a need for new and comprehensive  indicators  to understand  the expected  ex-ante and actual  ex-post effects   of AI. Given  that the potential  risks of full AI rollouts  might  be too great  to be acceptable,  the practice  of  sandboxing  can represent  a pragmatic  strategy  for the public  sector  to strike  the necessary  balance  between   controlling  AI and enabling  its potential .  5. Refine  the understanding  of implications  of co-creation .  Co-creation  is more  than a buzzword.  It carries  in fact the potential  to not only increase  the transparency  and  democratic  nature  of government  action,  but also of leverag e untapped  reserves  of knowledge  and skills that  reside  outside  the boundaries  of government,  which  are required  to solve  complex  problems.  As a powerful   approach,  however,  co-creation  needs  to be carefully  defined,  and thus designed.  How to identify  stakeholders   to co-create  with?  How to avoid  biases  that can result  from  skewed  participation  in co-creation  processes?  How  to govern  co-creation?  The EU public  sector  needs  to provide  clear answers  to these  questions  when  adopting   co-creation  approaches  for using  AI in public  service  delivery . 
  19 6. AI Watch  for the public  sector:  conclusions  and the way forward,   announcements    Dietmar  Gattwinkel,  Policy  Officer  - eGovernment  and Trust  Unit, CNECT/H4  -- European  Commission    Mr Gattwinkel  provided  concluding  remarks  to the workshop,  and outlined  some  ways  forward  in the EU  journey  towards  AI in the public  sector.  The 4th Peer-Learning  Workshop  came  after  two other  AI Watch  peerlearning  workshops  in 2020  and one in 2021,  where  progress  made  by Member  States  in the area of AI in the  public  sector  has been interesting  to notice  and discuss.  Deliverables  stemming  from the workshop  will be  completed  by early  2022 , and will include  a final version  of the roadmap  document , besid es a report  on the  workshop  activities.   Parallel  EU initiatives  that are of relevance  for policy  on AI in the public  sector  include :    a GovTech  incubator  as part of the Digital  Europe  Programme  possibly  creating  a marketplace  also for  AI;    the "Adopt  AI" programme  to support  public  procurement  of AI systems;     the Digital  Urban  European  Twins  project,  which  leverages  the capabilities  of emerging  technologies,   including  AI, for smarter  decision  making;     and the Digital  Earth  initiative , which  aims to model,  monitor  and simulate  Earth's  natural  phenomena   and related  human  activities,  and can also facilitate  the uptake  of AI in the public  sector.   In thanking  all participants  for joining  the 4th Peer-Learning  Workshop  on the use and impact  of AI in public   service s, Mr Gattwinkel  noted  that not only Artificial  Intelligence  can bring  value  to the EU public  sector,  but the  EU public  sector  can also bring  something  to AI. This is not only the purchasing  power  of public   administration,  but also the possibility  for the public  sector  to showcase  how to establish  transparency,  avoid   vendor  lock-in and involve  citizens . These  ingredients  represent  the perfect  recipe  for establishing  an AI that  really  works  for people.  In this sense,  the EU public  sector  can be a role model for the adoption  and use of AI  by the rest of society.
