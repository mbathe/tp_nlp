12 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y Executive Summary
13 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y Our society is experiencing profound changes brought  about by digitalisation. Innovative data-based  technologies may benefit us at both the individual and  the wider societal levels, as well as potentially boosting  economic productivity, promoting sustainability and  catalysing huge strides forward in terms of scientific  progress. At the same time, however, digitalisation poses  risks to our fundamental rights and freedoms. It raises  a wide range of ethical and legal questions centring  around two wider issues: the role we want these new  technologies to play, and their design. If we want to  ensure that digital transformation serves the good of  society as a whole, both society itself and its elected  political representatives must engage in a debate on how  to use and shape data-based technologies, including  artificial intelligence (AI). Germany’s Federal Government set up the Data Ethics  Commission (Datenethikkommission)  on 18 July 2018.  It was given a one-year mandate to develop ethical  benchmarks and guidelines as well as specific  recommendations for action, aiming at protecting the  individual, preserving social cohesion, and safeguarding  and promoting prosperity in the information age. As a  starting point, the Federal Government presented the  Data Ethics Commission with a number of key questions  clustered around three main topics: algorithm-based  decision-making (ADM), AI and data. In the opinion of  the Data Ethics Commission, however, AI is merely one  among many possible variants of an algorithmic system,  and has much in common with other such systems in  terms of the ethical and legal questions it raises. With this  in mind, the Data Ethics Commission has structured its  work under two different headings: data  and algorithmic  systems  (in the broader sense).In preparing its Opinion, the Data Ethics Commission was  inspired by the following guiding motifs :  ●Ensuring the human-centred and value-oriented  design of technology  ●Fostering digital skills and critical reflection in the  digital world  ●Enhancing protection for individual freedom,   self-  determination and integrity  ●Fostering responsible data utilisation that is  compatible with the public good  ●Introducing risk-adapted regulation and effective  oversight of algorithmic systems  ●Safeguarding and promoting democracy and social  cohesion  ●Aligning digital strategies with sustainability goals  ●Strengthening the digital sovereignty of both Germany  and Europe.
1 General ethical and   legal principles Humans are morally responsible for their actions, and  there is no escaping this moral dimension. Humans are  responsible for the goals they pursue, the means by which  they pursue them, and their reasons for doing so. Both  this dimension and the societal conditionality of human  action must always be taken into account when designing  our technologically shaped future. At the same time, the  notion that technology should serve humans rather than  humans being subservient to technology can be taken as  incontrovertible fact. Germany’s constitutional system is  founded on this understanding of human nature , and it  adheres to the tradition of Europe’s cultural and intellectual   history. Digital technologies have not altered our ethical  framework – in terms of the basic values, rights and  freedoms enshrined in the German Constitution and  in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European  Union. yet the new challenges we are facing mean that  we need to reassert these values, rights and freedoms  and perform new balancing exercises. With this in mind,  the Data Ethics Commission believes that the following  ethical and legal principles and precepts should be viewed  as indispensable and socially accepted benchmarks for  action.Human dignity Human dignity is a principle that presupposes the  uncon  ditional value of every human being, prohibiting  such practices as the total digital monitoring of the  individual or his or her humiliation through deception,  manipulation or exclusion. Self-determination Self-determination is a fundamental expression of  freedom, and encompasses the notion of informational  self-determination. The term “digital self-  determination”  can be used to express the idea of a human being a selfdetermined player in a data society. Privacy The right to privacy is intended to preserve an individual’s  freedom and the integrity of his or her personal identity.  Potential threats to privacy include the wholesale  collection and evaluation of data about even the most  intimate of topics. Security The principle of security relates not only to the  physical and emotional safety of humans but also to  environmental protection, and as such involves the  preservation of vitally important assets. Guaranteeing  security entails compliance with stringent requirements,  e. g. in relation to human/machine interaction or system  resilience to attacks and misuse.
15 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y Democracy Digital technologies are of systemic relevance to the  flourishing of democracy. They make it possible to shape  new forms of political participation, but they also foster  the emergence of threats such as manipulation and  radicalisation. Justice and Solidarity In view of the vast amounts of power being accumulated  using data and technologies, and the new threats  of exclusion and discrimination, the safeguarding of  equitable access and distributive justice is an urgent task.  Digitalisation should foster participation in society and  thereby promote social cohesion. Sustainability Digital developments also serve sustainable development.  Digital technologies should contribute towards achieving  economic, ecological and social sustainability goals. Ethics cannot be equated on a one-to-one basis with  the law. In other words, not everything that is relevant  from an ethical perspective can and should be enshrined  in legislation; conversely, there are provisions of the law  that are motivated purely by pragmatic considerations.  Nevertheless, the law must, at all times, be heedful of the  potential ethical implications of the legal provisions in  force, as well as living up to ethical standards. The Data  Ethics Commission holds the view that regulation is   necessary, and cannot be replaced by ethical principles .  This is particularly true for issues with heightened  implications for fundamental rights that require the  central decisions to be made by the democratically  elected legislator. Regulation is also an essential basis  for building a system where citizens, companies and  institutions can trust that the transformation of society  will be guided by ethical principles. At the same time, regulation must not unduly inhibit  technological and social innovation and dynamic market  growth.  Overly rigid laws that attempt to regulate every  last detail of a situation may place a stranglehold on  progress and increase red tape to such an extent that  innovation by German companies can no longer keep  pace with the rate of technological development on the  international stage. yet legislation is only one of a range of tools that can  be used to lend tangible shape to ethical principles. The  synergistic use of various governance instruments  at  different levels (multi-level governance) is vital in view of  the complexity and dynamism of data ecosystems. These  instruments include not only legislative measures and  standardisation, but also various forms of co-  regulation  or self-regulation. Technology and technological design  can moreover function as governance instruments  themselves, and the same applies to business models  and options for steering the economy. Governance in the  broader sense also encompasses policy-making decisions  in the fields of education and research. It is important to  consider each of the aforesaid governance instruments  not only in a national context, but also (and in particular)  in their European and international  contexts. In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, all of the  key questions presented by the Federal Government  belong to one of two different perspectives: questions  that concentrate mainly on data (the “data perspective” )  and questions that are primarily focused on algorithmic  systems (the “algorithms perspective” ). These two  perspectives should not be regarded as competing views  or two sides of the same coin; instead, they represent two  different ethical discourses, which both complement  each other and are contingent upon each other . These  different ethical discourses are typically also reflected in  different governance instruments, including in different  acts of legislation.
Data The data perspective  focuses on digital data, which are  used for machine learning, as a basis for algorithmically  shaped decisions, and for a plethora of further purposes.  This perspective considers data primarily with a view to  their origin  and to the potential impact  their processing  may have on certain parties who are involved with the  data, such as by being the data subject, as well as on  society at large. From an ethical and legal point of view,  it is important to identify  standards for data governance ;  typically, however, rights  that parties involved with the  data can enforce against others will play an even more  significant role. A central distinction in this context is  that between personal and non-personal data, since it  determines whether the provisions of data protection  law apply. General standards for data governance In the opinion of the Data Ethics Commission,  responsible data governance must be guided by the  following data ethics principles: ●Foresighted responsibility: Possible future cumulative  effects, network effects and effects of scale,  technological developments and changing actor  constellations must be taken into account when  gauging the potential impact of collecting, processing  and forwarding data on individuals or the general  public.  ●Respect for the rights of the parties involved: Parties  who have been involved in the generation of data –  whether as data subjects or in a different role – may  have rights in relation to such data, and these rights  must be respected.  ●Data use and data sharing for the public good:  As a non-rivalrous resource, data can be duplicated  and used in parallel by many different individuals  for many different purposes, thereby furthering the  public good.  ●Fit-for-purpose data quality: Responsible use of data  includes ensuring a high level of data quality that is fit  for the relevant purpose.  ●Risk-adequate level of information security: Data  are vulnerable to external attacks, and it is difficult  to recover them once they have gone astray. The  standard of information security applied must  therefore be commensurate with the potential for   risk inherent to the situation in question.  ●Interest-oriented transparency: Controllers must  be prepared and in a position to account for their  data-related activities. This requires appropriate  documentation and transparency and, if necessary,  a corresponding liability regime in place. 2 
17 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y Data rights and corresponding obligations For self-determined navigation in the data society, parties  must have, and be able to enforce, certain data-related  rights against others. First and foremost among these  rights are those relating to an individual’s personal data ,  which derive from the right to informational selfdetermination that is enshrined as a fundamental  right, and which are guaranteed by the applicable data  protection law. Digital self-determination in the data  society also includes the self-determined economic  exploitation of one’s own data, and it includes selfdetermined manage  ment of non-personal data , such as  non-personal data generated by one’s own devices. The  Data Ethics Commission takes the view that, in principle,  a right to digital self-determination in the data society  also applies to companies and  legal entities  and – at least  to some extent – to groups of persons (collectives). Data are often generated with contributions from  different parties who are acting in different roles –   be it as the data subject, be it as the owner of a  data-  generating device or be it in yet another role.  In the opinion of the Data Ethics Commission such  contributions to the generation of data should not lead to  exclusive ownership rights in data, but rather to dataspecific rights of  co-determination and participation ,  which in turn may lead to corresponding obligations  on the part of other parties. The extent to which an  individual should be  entitled to data rights of this kind,  and the shape they should take, depends on the following  general factors: a)  the nature and scope of that party’s contribution to  data generation , b)  the weight of that party’s legitimate interest  in being  granted the data right, c)  the weight of any possibly conflicting interests on the  part of the other party or of third parties, taking into  account any potential compensation arrangements   (e. g. protective measures, remuneration), d) the interests of the general public , and e) the balance of power  between the parties involved.Data rights may allow their holders to pursue a number of  different goals, in particular the following:  ●requiring that a controller desist from data use    (up to a right to require erasure of the data),  ●requiring that a controller rectify the data ,  ●requiring that a controller grant access to data    (up to full data portability), or  ●requiring an economic share  in profits derived   with the help of the data. For each type of data right (desistance, rectification, access,  economic share) there exists a separate set of conditions   defining, e.  g., what counts as a party’s legitimate interest  in being granted the data right. For determining whether  a party has a right to require desistance from a particular  data use, key considerations include the potential for  harm associated with said use and the circumstances  under which the party in question had contributed to  generating the data. Potential for harm may also be  relevant when a request is made to rectify data, but  the benchmark is lower in this respect. Where a party  requests access to data, there is a graded spectrum of  interests that count as a legitimate interest to be granted  such access, which is particularly relevant within existing  value creation systems. Only under very narrowly defined  conditions may a party have an independent claim to an  economic share in profits derived by others. The rights  granted to data subjects  under the EU’s General Data  Protection Regulation (GDPR) are a particularly important  manifestation of these data rights, aimed specifically at  protecting the natural persons to whom the data pertain;  they are also to some extent a standardised manifestation   given that they hinge on the qualification of data as  personal data. Considering these principles, the Data Ethics Commission  wishes to submit the following key recommendations  for action:
18 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y Standards for the use of   personal data 1 The Data Ethics Commission recommends that measures  be taken against ethically indefensible uses of data .  Examples of these uses include total surveillance, profiling  that poses a threat to personal integrity, the targeted  exploitation of vulnerabilities, addictive designs and dark  patterns, methods of influencing political elections that  are incompatible with the principle of democracy, vendor  lock-in and systematic consumer detriment, and many  practices that involve trading in personal data. 2 Data protection law as well as other branches of the  legal system (including general private law and unfair  commercial practices law) already provide for a range of  instruments that can be used to prevent such ethically  indefensible uses of data. However, in spite of the  widespread impact and enormous potential for harm,  too little has been done to date in terms of harnessing  the power of these instruments, particularly against the  market  giants. The various factors contributing to this  enforcement gap  must be tackled systematically. 3 As well as steps to make front-line players (e.  g. supervisory  authorities) more aware of the existing options, there is  an urgent need for the legislative framework in force to  be fleshed out more clearly and strengthened in certain  areas . Examples of recommended measures include  the blacklisting of data-specific unfair contract terms,  the fleshing out of data-specific contractual duties of a  fiduciary nature, new data-specific torts, the blacklisting  of certain data-specific unfair commercial practices and  the introduction of a much more detailed legislative  framework for profiling, scoring and data trading. 4 In order to allow supervisory authorities to take action  more effectively, these authorities need significantly  better human and material resources. Attempts should be  made to strengthen and formalise cooperation between  the different data protection authorities in Germany,  thereby ensuring the uniform and coherent application of  data protection law. If these attempts fail, consideration  should be given to the centralisation of market-related  supervisory activities  within a federal-level authority  that is granted a broad mandate and that cooperates  closely with other specialist supervisory authorities.  The authorities at Land  level should remain responsible  for supervisory activities relating to the public sector,  however. 5 The Data Ethics Commission believes that “data  ownership”  (i.e. exclusive rights in data modelled on the  ownership of tangible assets or on intellectual property)  would not solve any of the problems we are currently  facing, but would create new problems instead, and  recommends refraining from their recognition . It also  advises against granting to data subjects copyrightlike rights of economic exploitation in respect of  their personal data (which might then be managed by  collective societies). 6 The Data Ethics Commission also argues that data should  not be referred to as “counter-performance” provided  in exchange for a service, even though the term sums up  the issue in a nutshell and has helped to raise awareness  among the general public. Regardless of the position that  data protection authorities and the European Court of  Justice will ultimately take with regard to the prohibition  under the GDPR of “tying” or “bundling” consent with  the provision of a service, the Data Ethics Commission  believes that consumers must be offered reasonable  alternatives  to releasing their data for commercial use  (e. g. appropriately designed pay options ).
19 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y 7 Stringent requirements and limitations  should be  imposed on the use of data for personalised risk  assessment (e. g. the “black box” premiums in certain  insurance schemes). In particular, the processing of  data may not intrude on intimate areas of private life,  there must be a clear causal relationship between the  data and the risk, and the difference between individual  prices charged on the basis of personalised and nonpersonalised risk assessments should not exceed certain  percentages (to be determined). There should also be  stringent requirements in respect of transparency, nondiscrimination and the protection of third parties. 8 The Data Ethics Commission advises the Federal  Government not to consider the issues falling under the  heading of “digital inheritance”  as having been settled by  the Federal Court of Justice’s 2018 ruling. The ephemeral  spoken word is being replaced in many situations by  digital communications that are recorded more or less  in their entirety, and the possibility that these records  will be handed over to a deceased’s heirs adds a whole  new dimension of privacy risk. A range of mitigating  measures should be taken, including the imposition of  new obligations on service providers, quality assurance  standards for digital estate planning services and national  regulations on post-mortem data protection. 9 The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should invite the social partners  to work towards a common position on the legislative  provisions that should be adopted with a view to  stepping up the protection of employee data , based  on examples of best practices from existing collective  agreements. The concerns of individuals in non-standard  forms of employment should also be taken into account  during this process. 10 In view of the benefits that could be gained from  digitalising healthcare , the Data Ethics Commission  recommends swift expansion of digital infrastructures  in this sector. The expansion of both the range and the  quality of digitalised healthcare services should include  measures to better allow patients to exercise their rights  to informational self-determination. Measures that  could be taken in this respect include the introduction  and roll-out of an electronic health record, building  on a participatory process that involves the relevant  stakeholders, and the further development of procedures  for reviewing and assessing digital medical apps in the  insurer-funded and consumer-funded health markets. 11 The Data Ethics Commission calls for action against the  significant enforcement gap that exists with regard to  statutory protection of children and young people  in the  digital sphere. Particular attention should be paid to the  development and mandatory provision of technologies  (including effective identity management) and default  settings that not only guarantee reliable protection of  children and young people but that are also  familyfriendly, i.e. that neither demand too much of parents  or guardians nor allow or even encourage excessive  surveillance in the home environment. 12 Standards and guidelines on the handling of the personal  data of vulnerable and care-dependent persons   should be introduced to provide greater legal certainty  for professionals in the care sector. At the same time,  consideration should be given to clarifying in the relevant  legal provisions on living wills that these may also include  dispositions with regard to the future processing of  personal data as far as such processing will require the  care-dependent person’s consent (e.  g. for dementia  patients who will not be in a position to provide legally  valid consent).
20 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y 13 The Data Ethics Commission believes that a number of  binding requirements should be introduced to ensure the  privacy-friendly design of products and services , so that  the principles of privacy by design and privacy by default  (which the GDPR imposes on controllers) will already be put  into practice upstream, by manufacturers and service pro viders themselves. Such requirements would be particularly  important with regard to consumer equipment. In this con text, standardised icons should also be introduced so that  consumers are able to take informed purchase decisions. 14 Action must also be taken at a number of different levels  to provide manufacturers with adequate incentives to  implement features of privacy-friendly design . This in cludes effective legal remedies that can be pursued against  parties along the entire distribution chain to ensure that  also manufacturers can be held accountable for inadequate  application of the principles of privacy by design and privacy  by default. Consideration should also be given, in particular,  to requirements built into tender specifications, procure ment guidelines for public bodies and conditions for funding  programmes. The same applies to privacy-friendly product  development , including the training of algorithmic systems. 15 While debates on data protection tend (quite rightly) to  centre around natural persons, it is important not to   ignore the fact that companies and legal persons must  also be granted protection . The almost limitless ability to  pool together individual pieces of data can be used as a  means of obtaining a comprehensive picture of a company’s  internal operating procedures, and this information can  be passed on to competitors, negotiating partners, parties  interested in a takeover bid and so on. This poses a variety  of threats – inter alia  to the digital sovereignty of both  Germany and Europe – in view of the significant volumes  of data that flow to third countries. Many of the Data Ethics  Commission’s recommendations for action therefore also  apply on a mutatis mutandis  basis to the data of legal  persons. The Data Ethics Commission believes that action  must be taken by the Federal Govern  ment to step up the  level of data-related protection afforded to companies .Improving controlled access  to personal data 16 The Data Ethics Commission identifies enormous potential  in the use of data for research purposes that serve a  public interest (e.  g. to improve healthcare provision). Data  protection law as it currently stands acknowledges this  potential, in principle, by granting far-reaching privileges  for the processing of personal data for research purposes.  Uncertainty persists, however, in particular as regards the  scope of the so-called research privilege for secondary  use of data, and the scope of what counts as “research”  in the context of product development. The Data Ethics  Commission believes that appropriate clarifications in  the law  are necessary to rectify this situation. 17 The fragmentation of research-specific data protection  law, both within Germany itself and among the EU  Member States, represents a potential obstacle to datadriven research. The Data Ethics Commission therefore  recommends that research-specific regulations should  be harmonised , both between federal and Land  level  and between the different legal systems within the EU.  Introducing a notification requirement for research-   specific national law could also bring some improvement,  as could the establishment of a European clearing house  for cross-border research projects. 18 In the case of research involving particularly sensitive  categories of personal data (e.  g. health data), guidelines   should be produced with information for researchers on  how to obtain consent in a legally compliant manner,  and innovative consent models should be promoted  and explicitly recognised by the law . Potential options  include the development and roll-out of digital consent  assistants or the recognition of so-called meta consent,  alongside further endeavours to clarify the scope of the  research privilege for secondary use of data.
21 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y 19 The Data Ethics Commission supports, in principle, the  move towards a “learning healthcare system” , in which  healthcare provision is continuously improved by making  systematic and quality-oriented use of the health data  generated on a day-to-day basis, in keeping with the  principles of evidence-based medicine. If further progress  is made in this direction, however, greater efforts must be  made at the same time to protect data subjects against  the significant potential for discrimination that exists  when sensitive categories of data are used; this might  involve prohibiting the exploitation of such data  beyond  the defined range of purposes. 20 The development of procedures and standards for data  anonymisation  and pseudonymisation  is central to  any efforts to improve controlled access to (formerly)  personal data. A legal presumption that, if compliance  with the standard has been achieved, data no longer  qualify as personal, or that “appropriate safeguards” have  been provided in respect of the data subject’s rights, would  improve legal certainty by a long way. These  measures  should be accompanied by rules that – on pain of criminal  penalty – prohibit the de-anonymisation of anonymised  data (e.  g. because new technology becomes available  that would allow the re-identification of data subjects) or  the reversal of pseudonymisation, both in the absence of  narrowly defined grounds for doing so. Also research in  the field of synthetic data  shows enormous promise, and  more funding should be funnelled into this area. 21 Fundamentally speaking, the Data Ethics Commission  believes that innovative data management and data trust  schemes hold great potential, provided that these systems  are designed to be robust, suited to real-life applications  and compliant with data protection law. A broad spectrum  of models falls under this heading, ranging from dashboards  that perform a purely technical function ( privacy manage ment tools , PMT) right through to comprehensive data and  consent management services ( personal information man agement services , PIMS). The underlying aim is to empower  individuals to take control over their personal data, while not overburdening them with decisions that are beyond  their capabilities. The Data Ethics Commission recom mends that research and development in the field of data  management and data trust schemes should be identified  as a funding priority, but also wishes to make it clear that  adequate protection of the rights and legitimate interests of  all parties involved will require additional regulatory meas ures at EU level . These regulatory measures would need to  secure central functions without which operators cannot be  active, since their scope for action would otherwise be very  limited. On the other hand, it is also necessary to protect  individuals against parties that they assume to be acting in  their interests, but that, in reality, are prioritising their own  financial aims or the interests of others. In the event that  a feasible method of protection can be found, data trust  schemes could serve as vitally important mediators between  data protection interests and data economy interests. 22 As far as the right to data portability  enshrined in Article  20 GDPR is concerned, the Data Ethics Commission  recommends that industry-specific codes of conduct and  standards on data formats should be adopted. Given that  the underlying purpose of Article 20 GDPR is not only to  make it more straightforward to change provider, but also  to allow other providers to access data more easily, it is  important to evaluate carefully the market impact of the  existing right to portability and to analyse potential mech anisms by which it can be prevented that a small number  of providers increase yet further their market power. Until  the findings of this evaluation are available, expansion of  the scope of this right (for example to cover data other than  data provided by the data subject, or real-  time porting of  data) would seem premature and not advisable. 23 In certain sectors, for example messenger services and  social networks, interoperability or  interconnectivity   obligations  might help to reduce the market entry barriers  for new providers. Such obligations should be designed on  an asymmetric basis, i.e. the stringency of the regulation  should increase in step with the  company’s market share.  Interoperability and interconnectivity obligations would also  be a prerequisite for building up or strengthening, within and  for Europe, certain basic services of an information society.
22 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y Debates around access to  nonpersonal data 24 Access by European companies to appropriate non-  personal  data of appropriate quality is a key factor for the growth  of the European data economy. In order to benefit from  enhanced access to data , however, stakeholders must have  a sufficient degree of data-awareness and have the data  skills that are necessary to make use of the data. Also, access  to data proves to be disproportionately advantageous to  stakeholders that have already built up the largest reserves  of data and that have the best data infrastructures at hand.  The Data Ethics Commission therefore wishes to stress that  the factors referred to should always receive due attention  when discussing whether and how to improve data access,  in keeping with the ASISA principle  (Awareness – Skills –  Infrastructures – Stocks – Access) . 25 The Data Ethics Commission therefore supports the  efforts already initiated at European level to promote and  improve data infrastructures in the broadest sense of the  term (e.  g. platforms, standards for application program ming interfaces and other elements, model contracts, EU  Support Centre), and recommends to the Federal Govern ment that these efforts should continue to be matched by  corresponding efforts at national level. It would also be  advisable to set up an ombudsman’s office at federal level  to provide assistance and support in relation to the nego tiation of data access agreements and dispute settlement. 26 The Data Ethics Commission ascribes enormous impor tance to a holistically conceived, sustainable and strategic  economic policy  that outlines effective methods of  preventing not only the exodus of innovative European  companies or their acquisition by third-country compa nies, but also an excessive dependence on third-country  infrastructures (e.  g. server capacities). A balance must be  struck in this context between much-needed international  cooperation and networking on the one hand, and on the  other a resolute assumption of responsibility for sustaina -ble security and prosperity in Europe against the backdrop  of an ever-evolving global power dynamic. 27 Also from the perspective of boosting the European data  economy, the Data Ethics Commission does not see any  benefit in introducing new exclusive rights (“data ownership”,  “data producer right”). Instead, it recommends affording  limited third-party effects to contractual agreements   (e. g. to restrictions on data utilisation and onward  transfer of data by a recipient). These third-party effects  could be modelled on the new European regime for the  protection of trade secrets. The Data Ethics Commission  also recommends the adoption of legislative solutions  enabling European companies to cooperate in their use  of data, for example by using data trust schemes, without  running afoul of anti-trust law ( “data partnerships” ). 28 The data accumulated in existing value creation systems  (e. g. production and distribution chains) are often of  enormous commercial significance, both inside and  outside that value creation system. In many cases,  however, the provisions on data access that appear in the  contractual agreements concluded within a value creation  system are unfair and/or inefficient, or lacking entirely;  in certain cases, there is no contractual agreement at all.  Efforts must therefore be made to raise awareness among  businesses  in sectors far outside what is commonly  perceived as the “data economy”, and to provide practical  guidance and support (e.  g. model contracts). 29 The Data Ethics Commission furthermore recommends  cautious adaptations of the current legislative  framework . The first stage in this process should be to  make explicit reference in Section 311 of the [German]  Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , BGB) to the special  relationship that exists between a party that has  contributed to the generation of data in a value creation  system and the controller of the data, clarifying that such  parties may have certain quasi-contractual duties of a  fiduciary nature. These duties should normally include  a duty to enter into negotiations about fair and efficient 
23 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y data access arrangements. Consideration should also  be  given to whether additional steps should be taken,  which could range from blacklisting particular contract  terms also for B2B transactions, to formulating default  provisions for data contracts, to introducing sector-   specific data access rights. 30 The Data Ethics Commission believes that open govern ment data (OGD) concepts  hold enormous potential,  and recommends that these concepts should be built  on and promoted. It also recommends a series of  measures to promote a shift in mindset among public  authorities  (something that has not yet fully taken place)  and to make it easier in practice to share data on the  basis of OGD concepts. These measures include not  only the establishment of the relevant infrastructures   (e. g. platforms), but also harmonisation and improvement  of the existing legal framework that is currently  fragmented and sometimes inconsistent. 31 Nevertheless, the Data Ethics Commission identifies a  degree of tension between efforts to promote OGD (relying  on principles such as “open by default” and “open for all  purposes”), and efforts to enhance data protection and the  protection of trade secrets (with legally enshrined concepts  such as “privacy by default”). The Data Ethics Commission  submits that, in cases of doubt, priority should be given  to the duty of protecting  individuals and companies who  have entrusted their data to the State (often without being  given any choice in the matter, e.  g. tax information). The  State must deliver on this duty by implementing a range of  different measures, which may include technical as well as  legal safeguards against misuse of data. 32 In particular, it would be beneficial to develop standard  licences and model terms and conditions  for public-   sector data sharing arrangements, and to make their use  mandatory (at least on a sector-specific basis). These  standard licenses and model terms and conditions should  include clearly defined safeguards for the rights of third  parties who are affected by a data access arrangement. Provision should also be made against data being used in a  way that ultimately harms public interests, and also against  still greater accumulation of data and market power on the  part of the big players (which would be likely to undermine  competition) and against the taxpayer having to pay twice. 33 As regards open-data concepts in the private sector ,  priority should be given to promoting and supporting  voluntary data-sharing arrangements . Consideration  must be given not only to the improvement of  infrastructures (e.  g. data platforms), but also to a broad  range of potential incentives; these might include certain  privileges in the context of tax breaks, public procurement,  funding programmes or licensing procedures. Statutory  data access rights and corresponding obligations to grant  access should be considered as fall-back options if the  above measures fail to deliver the desired outcomes. 34 Generally speaking, the Data Ethics Commission  believes that a cautious approach should be taken to the  introduction of statutory data access rights; ideally such  rights should be developed only on a sector-by-sector  basis . Sectors in which the level of demand should be  analysed include the media, mobility or energy sectors.  In any case, before a statutory data access right or  even a disclosure obligation is introduced, a full impact  assessment needs to be carried out, examining and  weighing up against each other all possible implications;  these include implications for data protection and the  protection of trade secrets, for investment decisions  and the distribution of market power, as well as for the  strategic interests of German and European companies  compared to those of companies in third countries. 35 The Data Ethics Commission recommends considering  enhanced obligations of private enterprises to grant  access to data for public interest and public-sector  purposes  (business-to-government, B2G). A cautious and  sector-specific approach is, however, recommended in  this respect as well.
Algorithmic systems The algorithms perspective  focuses on the architecture  of data-driven algorithmic systems, their dynamics  and the systems’ impacts on individuals and society.  The ethical and legal discourse in this area typically  centres around the relationship between humans and  machines, with a particular focus on automation and  the outsourcing of increasingly complex operational and  decision-  making processes to “autonomous” systems  enabled by AI. The algorithms perspective differs from  the data perspective in that the data processed by the  system might have no connection whatsoever with the  persons affected by it; in particular, individuals may  suffer ethically indefensible implications even if all of the  data used (e.  g. to train an algorithmic system) are nonpersonal. The current debates on “algorithmic oversight”  or liability for AI are of central importance in this respect. General standards for algorithmic systems The Data Ethics Commission distinguishes between three  different levels of algorithmic involvement in human  decision-making, based on the distribution of tasks  between the human and the machine in the specific case  in question: a)  algorithm-based  decisions are human decisions based  either in whole or in part on information obtained using  algorithmic calculations, b)  algorithm-driven  decisions are human decisions  shaped by the outputs of algorithmic systems in such a  way that the human’s factual decision-making abilities  and capacity for self-determination are restricted, c)  algorithm-determined  decisions trigger consequences  automatically; no provision is made for a human  decision in the individual case.In the opinion of the Data Ethics Commission, the  following principles should be observed to ensure the  responsible use of algorithmic systems.  ●Human-centred design: Systems must be centred  around the human who uses them or who is affected  by their decisions; they must prioritise his or her  fundamental rights and freedoms, basic needs,  physical and emotional well-being and skills  development.  ●Compatibility with core societal values: The process  of system design must take account of the system’s  impact on society as a whole, and in particular its  effects on the democratic process, on the citizen-   centred nature of state action, on competition, on  the future of work and on the digital sovereignty of  Germany and Europe.  ●Sustainability: Considerations relating to  the availability of human skills, participation,  environmental protection, sustainable resource  management and sustainable economic activity are  becoming increasingly important factors in the design  and use of algorithmic systems.  ●Quality and performance: Algorithmic systems must  work correctly and reliably so that the goals pursued  with their help can be achieved.  ●Robustness and security: Robust and secure system  design involves not only making the system secure  against external threats, but also protecting humans  and the environment against any negative impacts that  may emanate from the system.  ●Minimisation of bias and discrimination: The  decision-  making patterns upon which algorithmic  systems are based must not be the source of  systematic bias or the cause of discriminatory  decisions. 3 
25 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y  ●Transparent, explainable and comprehensible   systems: It is vitally important to ensure not only that  the users of algorithmic systems understand how these  systems function and can explain and control them,  but also that the parties affected by a decision are  provided with sufficient information to exercise their  rights properly and challenge the decision if necessary.  ●Clear accountability structures: Questions of the allo cation of responsibility and accountability including  possible liability arising with the use of algorithmic  systems must be unambiguously resolved. System criticality The level of criticality of an algorithmic system  dictates  the specific requirements it must meet, in particular with  regard to transparency and oversight. System criticality  is determined by assessing an algorithmic system’s  potential for harm, on the basis of a two-pronged  investigation into the likelihood that harm will occur  and  the severity of that harm . The severity  of the harm that could potentially be  sustained, for example as a result of a mistaken decision,  depends on the significance of the legally protected  rights and interests affected (such as the right to privacy,  the fundamental right to life and physical integrity, the  prohibition of discrimination), the level of potential  harm suffered by individuals (including non-material  harm or loss of utility that are hard to calculate in  monetary terms), the number of individuals affected,  the total figure of the harm potentially sustained and  the overall harm sustained by society as a whole, which  may go well beyond a straightforward summation of the  harm suffered by individuals. The likelihood  that harm  will be sustained is also influenced by the properties  of the system in question, in particular the role of the  algorithmic system components in the decision-making  process, the complexity of the decision, the effects of  the decision and the reversibility of these effects. The  severity and likelihood of the predicted harm may also  be contingent on whether the algorithmic systems are  operated by the State or by private enterprises and,  particularly in a business context, on the market power  wielded by the system’s operator.In conclusion, the Data Ethics Commission wishes to  make the following recommendations for action on the  basis of these principles: Risk-adapted regulatory approach 36 The Data Ethics Commission recommends adopting  a risk-adapted regulatory approach  to algorithmic  systems. The principle underlying this approach should  be as follows: the greater the potential for harm, the  more stringent the requirements and the more farreaching the intervention by means of regulatory  instruments. When assessing this potential for harm, the  sociotechnical  system as a whole  must be considered,  or in other words all the components of an algorithmic  application, including all the people involved, from  the development phase – for example the training  data used – right through to its implementation in  an application environment and any evaluation and  adjustment measures. 37 The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  potential of algorithmic systems to harm individuals and/ or society should be determined uniformly on the basis  of a universally applicable model . For this purpose, the  legislator should develop a criteria-based assessment  scheme  as a tool for determining the criticality of  algorithmic systems. This scheme should be based on the  general ethical and legal principles presented by the Data  Ethics Commission. 38 Among other things, the regulatory instruments and  the requirements that apply to algorithmic systems   should include corrective and oversight mechanisms,  specifications of transparency, explainability and  comprehensibility of the systems’ results, and rules on  the allocation of responsibility and liability for using the  systems.
26 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y 39 The Data Ethics Commission believes that a useful first  stage in determining the potential for harm of algorithmic  systems is to distinguish between five levels of  criticality .  Applications that fall under the lowest of these levels  (Level 1) are associated with zero or negligible potential  for harm, and it is unnecessary to carry out special  oversight of them or impose requirements other than  the general quality requirements that apply to products  irrespective of whether they incorporate algorithmic  systems. 40 Applications that fall under Level 2 are associated  with some potential for harm , and can and should be  regulated on an as-needs basis; regulatory instruments  used in this connection may include ex-post controls,  an obligation to produce and publish an appropriate  risk assessment, an obligation to disclose information  to supervisory bodies or also enhanced transparency  obligations and access rights for individuals affected. 41 In addition, the introduction of licensing procedures  may be justified for applications that fall under Level 3,  which are associated with regular  or significant potential  for harm . Applications that fall under Level 4 are  associated with serious potential for harm ; the Data  Ethics Commission believes that these applications  should be subject to enhanced oversight and transparency  obligations. These may extend all the way through to the  publication of information on the factors that influence  the algorithmic calculations and their relative weightings,  the pool of data used and the algorithmic decision-making  model; an option for “always-on” regulatory oversight via a  live interface with the system may also be required. 42 Finally, a complete or partial ban should be imposed  on applications with an untenable potential for harm   (Level 5). 43 The Data Ethics Commission believes that the measures  it has proposed should be implemented in a new EU  Regulation on algorithmic systems enshrining general  horizontal requirements (Regulation on Algorithmic  Systems, EU-ASR) . This horizontal regulation should  incorporate the fundamental requirements for algorithmic  sytems that the Data Ethics Commission developed. In  particular, it should group together general substantive  rules – informed by the concept of system criticality –  on the admissibility and design of algorithmic systems,  transparency, the rights of individuals affected,  organisational and technical safeguards and supervisory  institutions and structures. This horizontal instrument  should be fleshed out in sectoral instruments  at EU and  Member State level, with the concept of system criticality  once again serving as a guiding framework. 44 The process of drafting the EU-ASR (as recommended  above) should incorporate a debate on how best to  demarcate the respective scopes of this Regulation and  the GDPR . A number of factors should be taken into  account in this respect; firstly, algorithmic systems may  pose specific risks to individuals and groups even if they  do not involve the processing of personal data, and these  risks may relate to assets, ownership, bodily integrity  or discrimination. Secondly, the regulatory framework  introduced for the future horizontal regulation of  algorithmic systems may need to be more flexible and  risk-adapted than the current data protection regime.
27 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y Instruments 45 The Data Ethics Commission recommends the introduction  of a mandatory labelling scheme  for algorithmic systems  of enhanced criticality (Level 2 upwards). A mandatory  scheme of this kind would oblige operators to make it  clear whether (i.e. when and to what extent) algorithmic  systems are being used. Regardless of system criticality,  operators should always be obliged to comply with  a mandatory labelling scheme if there is a risk of  confusion between human and machine that might  prove problematic from an ethical point of view. 46 An individual affected by a decision should be able to  exercise his or her right to “meaningful information  about  the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended  consequences” of an algorithmic system (cf. GDPR) not  only in respect of fully automated systems, but also in  situations that involve any kind of profiling , regardless  of whether a decision is taken on this basis later down  the line. The right should also be expanded in the future  to apply to the algorithm-based decisions themselves,  with differing levels of access to these decisions according  to system criticality. These measures may require the  clarification of certain legislative provisions or a widening  of regulatory scope at European level. 47 It certain cases, it may be appropriate to ask the  operator of an algorithmic system to provide an  individual explanation  of the decision taken, in addition  to a general explanation of the logic (procedure) and  scope of the system. The main objective should be to  provide individuals who are affected by a decision with  comprehensible, relevant and concrete information.  The Data Ethics Commission therefore welcomes the  work being carried out under the banner of “Explainable  AI” (efforts to improve the explainability of algorithmic  systems, in particular self-learning systems), and  recommends that the Federal Government should fund  further research and development in this area. 48 In view of the fact that, in certain sectors, society as a  whole may be affected as well as its individual members,  also particular parties who are not individually affected   by an algorithmic system should be entitled to access   certain types of information about it. It is likely that rights  of this kind would be granted primarily for journalistic  and research purposes; in order to take due account  of the operator’s interests, they would need to be  accompanied by adequate protective measures. The Data  Ethics Commission believes that consideration should  also be given to the granting of unconditional rights to  access information in certain circumstances, in particular  when algorithmic systems with serious potential for harm  ( Level 4) are used by the State. 49 It is appropriate and reasonable to impose a legal  requirement for the operators of algorithmic systems  with at least some potential for harm (Level 2 upwards)  to produce and publish a proper risk assessment ; an  assessment of this kind should also cover the processing  of non-personal data, as well as risks that do not fall under  the heading of data protection. In particular, it should  appraise the risks posed in respect of self-  determination,  privacy, bodily integrity, personal integrity, assets,  ownership and discrimination. It should encompass not  only the underlying data and logic of the model, but also  methods for gauging the quality and fairness of the data  and the model accuracy, for example the bias or the rates  of (statistical) error (overall or for certain sub-groups)  exhibited by a system during forecasting/category  formation.
28 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y 50 To provide controllers and processors with greater legal  clarity, further work must be done in terms of fleshing  out the requirements to document and log  the data sets  and models used, the level of granularity, the retention  periods and the intended purposes. In addition, operators  of sensitive applications should be obliged in future to  document and log the program runs of software that may  cause lasting harm. The data sets and models used should  be described in such a way that they are comprehensible  to the employees of supervisory institutions carrying out  oversight measures (as regards the origin of the data sets  or the way in which they are pre-processed, for example,  or the optimisation goals pursued using the models). 51 System operators should be required by the standard-   setting body to guarantee a minimum level of quality,  from both a technical and a mathematical-procedural  perspective . The procedural criteria imposed must ensure  that algorithmically derived results are obtained in a  correct and lawful manner. For this purpose, quality criteria  could be imposed, in particular as regards  corrective and  control mechanisms, data quality and system security.  For example, it would be appropriate to impose quality  criteria on the relationship between algorithmic data  processing outcomes and the data used to obtain these  outcomes. 52 The Data Ethics Commission believes that a necessary  first step is to clarify and flesh out in greater detail the  scope and legal consequences of Article 22 GDPR in  relation to the use of algorithmic systems in the context  of human decision-making. As a second step, the Data  Ethics Commission recommends the introduction of  additional protective mechanisms for algorithm-based  and algorithm-driven decision-making systems , since  the influence of these systems in real-life settings may  be almost as significant as that of algorithm-determined  applications. The prohibitory principle followed to date  by Article 22 GDPR should be replaced by a more flexible  and risk-adapted regulatory framework that provides adequate guarantees as regards the protection of  individuals (in particular where profiling is concerned) and  options for these individuals to take action if mistakes are  made or if their rights are jeopardised. 53 Consideration should be given to expanding the  scope  of anti-discrimination legislation  to cover specific  situations in which an individual is discriminated against  on the basis of automated data analysis or an automated  decision-making procedure. In addition, the legislator  should take effective steps to prevent discrimination  on the basis of group characteristics  which do not in  themselves qualify as protected characteristics under law,  and where the discrimination often does not currently  qualify as indirect discrimination on the basis of a  protected characteristic. 54 In the case of algorithmic systems with regular or  significant (Level 3) or even serious potential for harm  (Level 4), it would be useful – as a supplement to the  existing regulations – for these systems to be covered by  licensing procedures or preliminary checks  carried out  by supervisory institutions, in the interests of preventing  harm to individuals who are affected, certain sections of  the population or society as a whole. Institutions 55 The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should expand and realign the  competencies of existing supervisory institutions and  structures and, where necessary, set up new ones.  Official  supervisory tasks and powers should primarily  be entrusted to the sectoral supervisory authorities  that  have already built up a wealth of expert knowledge in the  relevant sector. Ensuring that the competent authorities  have the financial, human and technical resources  they  need is a particularly important factor in this respect.
29 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y 56 The Data Ethics Commission also recommends that the  Federal Government should set up a national centre of  competence for algorithmic systems ; this centre should  act as a repository of technical and regulatory expertise  and assist the sectoral supervisory authorities in their task  of monitoring algorithmic systems to ensure compliance  with the law. 57 The Data Ethics Commission believes that initiatives   involving the development of technical and  statistical  quality standards for test procedures and audits   (differentiated according to critical application areas if  necessary) are worthy of support. Test procedures of this  kind – provided that they are designed to be adequately  meaningful, reliable and secure – may make a vital  contribution to the future auditability of algorithmic  systems. 58 In the opinion of the Data Ethics Commission, particular  attention should be paid to innovative forms of coregulation and self-regulation , alongside and as a  complement to forms of state regulation. It recommends  that the Federal Government should examine various  models of co-regulation and self-regulation as a  potentially useful solution in certain situations. 59 The Data Ethics Commission believes that an option  worth considering might be to require operators by law  (inspired by the “comply or explain” regulatory model) to  sign a declaration confirming their willingness to comply  with an Algorithmic Accountability Code . An independ ent commission with equal representation – which must  be free of state influence – could be set up to develop a  code of this kind, which would apply on a binding basis  to the operators of algorithmic systems. Appropriate  involvement of civil society representatives in the drafting  of this code must be guaranteed. 60 Voluntary or mandatory evidence of protective measures  in the form of a specific quality seal  may also serve as a  guarantee to consumers that the algorithmic system in  question is reliable, while at the same time providing an  incentive for developers and operators to develop and  use reliable systems. 61 The Data Ethics Commission takes the view that  companies and authorities operating critical algorithmic  systems should be obliged in future to appoint a contact  person , in the same way that companies of a specific size  are currently obliged to appoint a data protection officer.  Communications with the authorities should be routed  through this contact person, and he or she should also be  subject to a duty of cooperation. 62 To ensure that official audits of algorithmic systems  take due account of the interests of civil society and any  companies affected, suitable advisory boards should be  set up within the sectoral supervisory authorities . 63 In the opinion of the Data Ethics Commission, technical  standards adopted by accredited standardisation  organisations  are a generally useful measure, occupying  an intermediate position between state regulation and  purely private self-regulation. It therefore recommends  that the Federal Government should engage in appropriate  efforts towards the development and adoption of such  standards. 64 The system of granting competitors, competition  associations or consumer associations the right to file an  action  has been an important feature of the German legal  landscape for many years, and could play a key role in  civil society oversight of the use of algorithmic systems.  In particular, private rights of this kind could allow civil 
30 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y society players with a legitimate mandate to enforce  compliance with legal provisions in the area of contract  law, fair trading law or anti-discrimination law, without  needing to rely on the authorities to take action and  without needing to wait for individuals to authorise them. Special topic: Algorithmic systems  used by media intermediaries 65 Given the specific risks posed by media intermediaries  that act as gatekeepers to democracy , the Data  Ethics  Commission recommends that options should be  examined for countering these risks, also with regard to  influencing EU legislation (→ see Recommendation 43 above) .  A whole gamut of risk mitigation measures should be  considered, extending through to ex-ante controls   (e.g. in the form of a licensing procedure). 66 The national legislator is under a constitutional obligation  to protect the democratic system from the dangers to  the free, democratic and pluralistic formation of opinions  that may be created by providers that act as gatekeepers  by establishing a binding normative framework for  media . The Data Ethics Commission believes that the  small number of operators concerned should be obliged  to use algorithmic systems that allow users (at least as  an additional option) to access an unbiased and balanced  selection of posts and information that embodies  pluralism of opinion. 67 The Federal Government should consider measures that  take due account of the risks typically encountered in the  media sector in respect of all media intermediaries and  also in respect of providers that do not act as gatekeepers  or whose systems are associated with a lower potential  for harm. These measures might include mechanisms for  enhancing transparency  (for example by ensuring that information is available about the technical procedures  used to select and rank news stories, introducing  labelling obligations for social bots ) and establishing a  right to post countering responses on timelines. Use of algorithmic systems  by state bodies 68 The State must, in the interests of its citizens, make use  of the best available technologies, including algorithmic  systems, but must also exercise particular prudence  in all of its actions in view of its obligation to preserve  fundamental rights and act as a role model. As a general  rule, therefore, the use of algorithmic systems by public  authorities should be assessed on the basis of the  criticality model as particularly sensitive , entailing at the  very least a comprehensive risk assessment. 69 In the areas of law-making  and the dispensation of  justice , algorithmic systems may at most be used for  peripheral tasks. In particular, algorithmic systems must  not be used to undermine the functional independence of  the courts or the democratic process. By way of contrast,  enormous potential exists for the use of algorithmic  systems in connection with administrative  tasks, in  particular those relating to the provision of services and  benefits. The legislator should take due account of this fact  by giving the green light to a greater number of partially  and fully automated administrative procedures. Cautious  consideration should therefore be given to expanding the  scope of both Section 35a of the German Administrative  Procedures Act (  Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz , VwVfG)  (which is couched in overly restrictive terms) and the  corresponding provisions of statutory law. All of these  measures must be accompanied by adequate steps to  protect citizens.
31 ExECUTIVE  SUMMAR y 70 Decisions taken by the State on the basis of algorithmic  systems must still be transparent , and it must still be  possible to provide justifications  for them. It may be  necessary to clarify or expand the existing legislation  on freedom of information and transparency in order to  achieve these goals. Furthermore, the use of algorithmic  systems does not negate the principle that decisions  made by public authorities must generally be justified  individually; on the contrary, this principle may impose  limits on the use of overly complex algorithmic systems.  Finally, greater priority should be accorded to opensource solutions, since the latter may significantly  enhance the transparency of government actions. 71 From an ethical point of view, there is no general right to  non-compliance with rules and regulations. At the same  time, however, automated “total” enforcement of the law  raises a number of different ethical concerns. As a general  rule, therefore, systems should be designed in such a  way that a human can override technical enforcement   in a specific case. The balance struck between the  potential transgression and the automated (and perhaps  preventive) enforcement measure must at all times meet  the requirements of the proportionality principle. Liability for algorithmic systems 72 Liability for damages, alongside criminal responsibility  and administrative sanctions, is a vital component of any  ethically sound regulatory framework for algorithmic  systems. It is already apparent today that algorithmic  systems pose challenges to liability law as it currently  stands, inter alia  because of the complexity and dynamism  of these systems and their growing “autonomy”. The  Data Ethics Commission therefore recommends that the  current provisions of liability law should undergo in-depth  checks and (where necessary) revisions. The scope of these  checks and revisions should not be restricted on the basis of too narrowly defined technological features, such as  machine learning or artificial intelligence. 73 The proposal for a future system under which legal  personality would be granted to high-autonomy  algorithmic systems, and the systems themselves would  be liable for damages ( “electronic person” ), should not  be pursued further . As far as this concept is, by some  protagonists, based on a purported equivalence between  human and machine it is ethically indefensible. And as far  as it boils down to introducing a new type of company  under company law it does not, in fact, solve any of the  pertinent problems. 74 By way of contrast, if harm is caused by autonomous  technology used in a way functionally equivalent to the  employment of human auxiliaries, the operator’s liability  for making use of the technology should correspond  to the otherwise existing vicarious liability regime of a  principal for such auxiliaries  (cf. in particular Section 278  of the German Civil Code). For example, a bank that uses  an autonomous system to check the creditworthiness of  its customers should be liable towards them to at least  the same extent that it would be had it used a human  employee to perform this task. 75 As the debate currently stands, it appears highly likely  that appropriate amendments will need to be made to  the Product Liability Directive  (which dates back to the  1980s), and a connection established to new product  safety standards; in addition, certain changes may need to  be made to the rules relating to fault-based liability  and/ or new bases of strict liability  may need to be introduced.  In each case, it will be necessary to determine the liability  regime that is most appropriate for particular types of  products, digital content and digital services, and the exact  shape that this regime should take (once again depending  on the criticality of the relevant algorithmic system).  Consideration should also be given to innovative liability  concepts currently being developed at European level.
A European path The Data Ethics Commission examined a great many  different questions in the course of its work, and  discussions on these questions have raised new ones in  turn; this alone should serve to indicate that this Opinion  can serve only as one out of many building blocks in the  larger edifice of a debate on ethics, law and  technology   that will continue for many years to come. The Data  Ethics Commission takes the view that it is important to  remember that ethics, law and democracy must serve as  a shaping force for change, both in the broader sense and  more specifically in the field of technology. To achieve  this goal, interdisciplinary discourse in politics and society  is required, and care must be taken to ensure that any  rules and regulations adopted are open enough to retain  their regulatory clout and their ability to adapt, even  in the face of fast-paced changes to technologies and  business models. These rules and regulations must be  enforced effectively by means of appropriate instruments,  procedures and structures, and these latter must  make it possible to intervene promptly in response to  infringements or undesirable developments.In the global contest for future technologies, Germany  and Europe are being confronted with value systems,  models of society and cultures that differ widely from  our own. The Data Ethics Commission supports the  “European path”  that has been followed to date: the  defining feature of European technologies should be  their consistent alignment with European values and  fundamental rights, in particular those enshrined in the  European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights and  the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of  Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The Data Ethics Commission believes that the State has  a particular responsibility to develop and enforce ethical  benchmarks for the digital sphere that reflect this value  system. In order to deliver on this promise to citizens,  it must act from a position of political and economic  strength on the global stage; excessive dependence  on others turns a nation into a rule taker rather than a  rule maker, resulting in the citizens of this nation being  subject to resulting in the citizens of this nation being  subject to requirements imposed by players elsewhere  in the world, or by private corporations that are, for  the most part, exempt from democratic legitimacy and  oversight. Embarking on efforts to safeguard the digital  sovereignty of Germany and Europe in the long term  is  therefore not only a politically far-sighted necessity, but  also an expression of ethical responsibility. 4 
Part A Introduction
34 PART A | I NTRODUCTION Guiding motifs Our society is experiencing profound changes brought  about by digitalisation. Innovative data-based  technologies may benefit us at both the individual and  the wider societal levels, as well as potentially boosting  economic productivity, promoting sustainability and  catalysing huge strides forward in terms of scientific  progress. At the same time, however, digitalisation poses  risks to our fundamental rights and freedoms. It raises  a wide range of ethical and legal questions centring  around two wider issues: the role we want these new  technologies to play, and their design. If we want to  ensure that digital transformation serves the good of  society as a whole, both society itself and its elected  political representatives must engage in a debate on how  to use and shape data-based technologies, including  artificial intelligence (AI). Germany’s Federal Government set up the Data  Ethics Commission (Datenethikkommission)  on 18 July  2018. It was given a one-year mandate to develop  ethical benchmarks and guidelines as well as specific  recommendations for action, aiming at protecting the  individual, preserving social cohesion, and safeguarding  and promoting prosperity in the information age. As a  starting point, the Federal Government presented the  Data Ethics Commission with a number of key questions  clustered around three main topics: algorithm-based  decision-making (ADM), AI and data. In the opinion of  the Data Ethics Commission, however, AI is merely one  among many possible variants of an algorithmic system,  and has much in common with other such systems in  terms of the ethical and legal questions it raises. With this  in mind, the Data Ethics Commission has structured its  work under two different headings: data  and algorithmic  systems  (in the broader sense).In preparing its Opinion, the Data Ethics Commission was  inspired by the following guiding motifs :  ●Ensuring the human-centred and value-oriented  design of technology  ●Fostering digital skills and critical reflection in the  digital world  ●Enhancing protection for individual freedom, self-   determination and integrity  ●Fostering responsible data utilisation that is  compatible with the public good  ●Introducing risk-adapted regulation and effective  oversight of algorithmic systems  ●Safeguarding and promoting democracy and social  cohesion  ●Aligning digital strategies with sustainability goals  ●Strengthening the digital sovereignty of both Germany  and Europe.
35 A 1.  MISSION  AND  BASIC  UNDERSTANDING 1. Mission and basic understanding Our society is experiencing profound changes brought  about by digitalisation. Innovative data-based  technologies may benefit us at both the individual and  the wider societal levels, as well as potentially boosting  economic productivity, promoting sustainability and  catalysing huge strides forward in terms of scientific  progress; in some cases, this has already happened. The  digital transformation offers tremendous opportunities  for all countries, in particular for Germany as a closely  networked and high-tech economy, but it means  that German companies are coming under increasing  competitive pressure on the international market. At  the same time, it is already becoming apparent that  digitalisation poses risks to our fundamental rights and  freedoms. It raises a wide range of ethical and legal  questions centring around two wider issues: the role we  want these new technologies to play, and their design. If  we want to ensure that digital transformation serves the  good of individuals and society as a whole, both society  itself and its elected political representatives must engage  in a debate on how to shape the design of data-based  technologies, including AI. On 18 July 2018, the Federal Government set up the Data  Ethics Commission ( Datenethikkommission ) and named  its 16 members (→ see Annex, 2) . Christiane Wendehorst and  Christiane Woopen were appointed as co-spokespersons.  The Data Ethics Commission was given a one-year  mandate to develop ethical benchmarks and guidelines,  aiming at protecting the individual, preserving social  cohesion, and safeguarding and promoting prosperity  in the information age. It was also asked to put forward  specific recommendations for action and suggestions for  possible legislation with a view to allowing these ethical  guidelines to be observed, implemented and supervised.  As a starting point, the Federal Government presented the  Data Ethics Commission with a number of key questions  (→ see Annex 1)  clustered around three main topics:  (I) algorithm-based decision-making, (II) AI and (III) data. In this context, “ AI” is understood by the Data Ethics  Commission to be a catch-all term for technologies and  related applications based on digital methods which  involve the machine processing of potentially very large  and heterogeneous data sets in a complex procedure that  mimics human intelligence; the results obtained from  such a procedure may be applied in an automated way.  Some of the most important methods underpinning AI  (as just one aspect of a much wider computer science  landscape) include sub-symbolic pattern recognition,  machine learning, computer-based knowledge  representation and knowledge engineering, which in  turn encompasses heuristic search methods, inference  techniques and action planning. The Data Ethics Commission however believes that it  would be wrong to restrict the ethical and legal debate to  AI alone. It is merely one among many possible variants  of an algorithmic system, and thus represents a subset of  this field. Both AI systems and other types of algorithmic  systems share a number of features that may give rise to  ethical problems, meaning that regulations focused on AI  alone would tackle only part of the problem. The feature  of self-learning, which is in the foreground in AI, brings  with it specific challenges, and due consideration must be  given to them at the risk assessment stage; at the same  time, however, there are many other features besides  self-learning that require special attention. The following  arguments therefore relate to algorithmic systems of all  kinds . Applications are rarely based on a single algorithm,  and examining algorithms in isolation is rarely  meaningful. Any ethical appraisal must be based on the  sociotechnical system as a whole , or in other words all  the components of an algorithmic application, including  all the people involved, from the development phase –  for example the training data used – right through to its  implementation in an application environment and any  evaluation and adjustment measures.
36 PART A | I NTRODUCTION 2. Working method Between September 2018 and September 2019, the Data  Ethics Commission met on a monthly basis. It discussed  examples of use cases for new technologies in a range  of different sectors, and analysed them in terms of  both the technology involved and the ethical and legal  issues raised. The findings obtained from this work and  from fundamental debates made it possible to identify  overarching topics and questions, which were used as a  starting point for the development of an ethical appraisal  framework and the drafting of specific recommendations  for future political and legislative action. As early as  October 2018, in response to a policy paper by the  Federal Government, the Data Ethics Commission put  forward two specific recommendations for points that  should be included in the Artificial Intelligence Strategy,  and these recommendations were taken up by the  Federal Government. In November 2018, the Data Ethics  Commission issued another recommendation, calling for  the roll-out of an electronic health record, building on a  participatory process.1 The Data Ethics Commission involved the public in two  public conferences. The first took place on 7 February  2019 at the Federal Ministry of Justice and Consumer   Protection ( Bundesministerium der Justiz und für  Verbraucherschutz ), and centred around the issue of “Selfdetermination and external determination in the age  of artificial intelligence”. The second – an international  round table under the title “Towards ethical shaping  of our digital future” – was held on 9 May 2019 at the  Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community  (Bundesministerium des Innern, für Bau und Heimat ). Both  events allowed the Data Ethics Commission to engage  in in-depth discussions with experts and stakeholders as  well as members of the public and interested citizens.2  1 Both documents are available on the Data Ethics Commission’s website (at www.datenethikkommission.de ). 2 Further information on the public conferences, including video recordings, can be found on the Data Ethics Commission’s website   (at www.datenethikkommission.de ).On 14 November 2018, during the Federal Government’s  Digitalklausur , an exchange of views took place between  the Federal Chancellor, all the members of the Federal  Government, and the two co-spokespersons of the Data  Ethics Commission. Ad-hoc discussions were also held  with individual members of the Federal Government.  In addition, the Data Ethics Commission organised  expert hearings and consultation meetings with other  institutions and bodies working on related topics,  including the Study Commission “Artificial Intelligence”,  the Commission of Experts on Competition Law 4.0,  the Federal Government’s Digital Council, the Advisory  Council for Consumer Affairs and many more. One of the defining features of the Data Ethics  Commission is that its work and advisory activities are  fully independent and free from any external political  influence. All of the viewpoints outlined in this report  reflect either the personal opinions expressed by the  Data Ethics Commission’s individual members, or the  opinions that emerged from internal discussions within  its institutional members. The Data Ethics Commission  has adopted all of the recommendations in this report by  consensus.
37 A 3.  OBJECTIVES  AND  SCOPE  OF THE  REPORT 3. Objectives and scope of the report The goal pursued by the Data Ethics Commission in  publishing this report is to further the development of  our ethical and legal framework  in order to confront  the challenges posed by digital technologies. The main  concern is to ensure that the fundamental conditions  are in place for the free democratic basic order to  be preserved, and for the potential that exists to be  leveraged so that sustainability-oriented goals can be  achieved and our social market economy can flourish. Given the increase in the volume of personal data being  collected and the use of automated methods to process  these data for different purposes, one of the main  priorities of the Data Ethics Commission is to reconcile  the need to protect the individual’s fundamental  rights and freedoms  – including self-determination and  integrity – with the need to promote progress, prosperity,  the safeguarding of democracy and the shaping of a  society that is fit for the future. Protecting individuals  against data misuse and discrimination and guaranteeing  the security of all parties involved are tasks that fall  squarely within the remit of a State governed by the  rule of law, and effective regulations must be adopted  and institutions set up for this purpose. At the same  time, however, the State must facilitate the emergence  of innovative business models that safeguard future  prosperity for everyone.The Data Ethics Commission believes that digitalisation –  in particular the rapidly increasing availability of data  and the use of complex algorithmic systems, including  AI – holds enormous potential  for technical and social  innovation and for achievement of the UN’s Sustainable  Development Goals. Promising avenues for action  include promoting health, humanising the world of work,  designing sustainable cities and communities, providing  a decent education and implementing effective climate  protection measures. At the same time, however, we  must not forget the major risks  that may face individuals,  society as a whole and the free democratic basic order in  connection with the extensive use of digital technologies.  These risks include the possibility of high-  granularity  profiling (using techniques such as online tracking,  voice analysis during remote job interviews, or even  the diagnosis of pathological mental conditions on  the basis of social media posts), the potential for these  profiles to be exploited for the purpose of controlling  and manipulating people (either on a small scale through  individual pricing or on a larger scale by manipulating  democratic opinion-building processes through “micro-   targeting”), the potential for discrimination against  different social groups, and the ability to delegate human  responsibility to machines. With these factors in mind,  the Data Ethics Commission believes that we must  actively shape our future in such a way as to realise the  potentials while avoiding the risks. The Data Ethics Commission advocates for a multi-step  approach to achieving these goals. The first step is an  ethical reflection on the value of human activity in an  environment shaped by technology, and a reaffirmation  of the key ethical principles and precepts  upon which  our society is founded (→ Part B) . In the view of the Data  Ethics Commission, the key questions can be divided  into questions that concentrate mainly on data (the “data  perspective”) and questions that are primarily focused on  algorithmic systems (the “algorithms perspective”). These  two perspectives represent ethical discourses which  both complement each other and are contingent upon  each other, and which are also each reflected in different  governance instruments (→ Part D) .
38 PART A | I NTRODUCTION In the section devoted to the data perspective (→ Part E) ,  the Data Ethics Commission outlines general ethical  principles for data governance  (→ E 1) , in particular ethical  principles governing data rights and data obligations  (→ E 2) ; these serve as the basis for a series of specific  recommendations for action regarding the use of data  and data access (→ E 3 to 5) . In the section devoted to  the algorithms perspective (→ Part F) , the Data Ethics  Commission sets out general ethical requirements  for the design of algorithmic systems (→ F 2)  and the  risk-adapted regulation of these systems (→ F 3) . The  instruments and institutions that would be required to  implement regulations of this kind are examined in detail  and summarised in recommendations to the legislator  (→ F 4 to 8) . A shared basic understanding of technical  parameters and relationships (→ Part C)  serves as an  essential foundation for considerations of this kind. The  report ends with a plea for the Federal Government to  follow a “European path” (→ Part G) . As per its mission, the Data Ethics Commission’s  recommendations are targeted primarily at the German  Federal Government and its associated institutions. At  certain points, however, the target audience is widened  to include other stakeholders, for example Länder and  municipalities, research institutions or enterprises. The  Federal Government is always the secondary target  audience of any such recommendations, given the  underlying recommendation for it to encourage and  support these other stakeholders in their efforts. All  of the recommendations should also be viewed in the  context of the institutions and rules that have been or  will be put in place at EU and international level, and  in the context of further developments in these arenas.  In cases where the Data Ethics Commission suggests  that a recommendation should be implemented at EU  or international level , it should be interpreted as a  recommendation to the German Federal Government to  make a vigorous and future-oriented contribution to the  debate taking place within Europe and across the globe.
Ethical and legal  principlesPart B
40 PART B | E THICAL  AND  LEGAL  PRINCIPLES 1. The fundamental value of human agency Given the fast-paced development of digital technologies,  including self-learning algorithmic systems (“artificial  intelligence”) which incorporate certain functions that  can outperform the abilities of humans, the elementary  question is raised whether human agency poses an  ethically relevant value in and of itself  which transcends  considerations of effectiveness and efficiency, and  which is inherently preferable to the functioning of  machine systems. This question is all the more pressing  as the momentum and internal logic of international  competition are, for the most part, dictated solely by the  goal of maximising economic efficiency. Human agency derives its basic value from its moral  significance. A human being can provide reasons for one’s  actions and decide whether or not to perform them, and  must bear responsibility for these actions. It is only by  taking action that individuals can develop and realise  their full potential in accordance with their capabilities,  preferences and understanding of a meaningful life.  This dimension of meaning  lends a value to human  activity that could never be claimed for the functioning  of technical systems. Technology can only ever be the  means to achieving a goal that humans have set. Even  if – hypothetically speaking – humans were to decide that  algorithmic systems could set themselves goals, allowing  them to do so would be a goal that had been set by  humans. The use of technical systems may therefore be a  component of human activity, and may even be ethically  required in certain cases, but it will never be possible  for technical systems to replace the moral dimension of  human agency completely. Human agency and the human  drive to develop as a living being are characterised by  their multi-dimensional nature. Although the conceptions  of man espoused by different cultures and different faiths  vary significantly, they all incorporate the dimension of  the living and of moral responsibility, and despite all the  differences in the respective answers, they all embrace  the question of the meaning of life whereas technical  systems merely function. We must weigh up many different criteria when  identifying cases in which preference should be given to  human activity over the use of algorithmic systems. As  a basic principle, a higher level of effectivity should be  prioritised only with regard to the performance of certain  limited functions. Effectiveness should not rule supreme.   It must not place material restrictions on the ability of  humans to take action as a form of self-development, and  it must take second place to the basic ethical dimension  of a meaningful and flourishing life, both as an individual  and as a member of society. For example, even if it were  possible for a human to be cared for more effectively by a  robot than by another human, care by a robot cannot be  allowed to replace the human element of attention and  affection for the person needing that care. At the same  time, however, the use of robots to perform care-related  tasks alongside humans may be deemed expedient if  it makes the situation significantly safer for the person  receiving care. yet the effectiveness gains of technical  systems must take a back seat if they entail an intrusion  into the privacy or personal integrity of the individual,  for example because they force an employee to modify  all of his or her work processes in order to maximise  effectiveness. People must be allowed to retain their  subjectivity rather than morphing into objects that are  “acted upon” by machines. Humans are morally responsible for their actions, and  there is no escaping this moral dimension. Humans are  responsible for the goals they pursue, the means by  which they pursue them, and their reasons for doing so.  This dimension must always be taken into account when  designing our technologically shaped future. At the same  time, the notion that technology should serve humans  rather than humans being subservient to technology  can be taken as incontrovertible fact. Germany’s  constitutional system is founded on this understanding  of the human being , and it adheres to the tradition of  Europe’s cultural and intellectual history.
41  B 2.  RELATIONSHIP  BETWEEN  ETHICS  AND  LAW 2. Relationship between ethics and law Exponential technical developments relating to the  collection and use of digital data and the deployment  of algorithmic systems and artificial intelligence are  increasingly shaping the life of every individual and all  aspects of our social coexistence. These developments  give rise to far-reaching and profound questions, and  the answers to these questions must be guided by  the fundamental legal and ethical principles  that a  democratic society undertakes to uphold. The benchmarks and guiding principles underpinning  the processes by which society shapes and has to  shape various sectors – the economy, education, public  spaces, healthcare, finance, transport and energy – are  fundamentally ethical in nature. Although liberal systems  are characterised by a high degree of moral pluralism, a  common ethical framework is nevertheless established  in constitutional law, and more especially in fundamental  rights as far as the relationship between the State and  the individual is concerned. The significance of this  ethical and legal framework in relation to an individual  case and in the event of conflict between differing values  or fundamental rights is not always clear-cut. yet this  does not relativise the binding nature and fundamental  importance of the ethical foundation of our community .  Instead, it merely goes to prove once again the crucial  importance of an open and ongoing debate on the future  shape of our society, and serves as a basis for democratic  decision-making processes that acknowledge the  possibility of different answers within the framework of  the Constitution. Ethics cannot be equated on a one-to-one basis with the  law. In other words, not everything that is relevant from  an ethical perspective can and should be enshrined in  legislation; conversely, there are provisions of the law that  are motivated purely by pragmatic considerations and are  not ethically imperative. Nevertheless, legislation must, at  all times, be heedful of its potential ethical implications  and must live up to ethical standards – at the very least,  the requirements outlined in constitutional law.The Data Ethics Commission holds the view that  regulation is necessary, and cannot be replaced by  ethical principles and guidelines in cases where the  constitutionally developed principle of materiality   requires the enactment, in the form of parliamentary  legislation, of democratically legitimate rules that can be  enforced against anyone. Internet governance is also the  governance of society. As algorithmic systems, including  artificial intelligence, become an increasingly normal  feature of the daily lives we lead together in society, we  must also develop and enforce rules to govern them. This  calls for an ongoing public debate, and also – particularly  in cases where fundamental rights are at threat –  parliamentary debate and legislative initiatives. Given past  experiences of law enforcement in the Internet sphere,  and in view of the experience that power tends to be  accumulated in the hands of a few large corporations  in certain sectors of markets dominated by digital  technologies, a systematic move away from enforceable  rules and towards voluntary regulation would appear to  be a mistake. At the same time, regulation must not unduly inhibit  technological and social innovation and dynamic market  growth.  Overly rigid laws that attempt to regulate every  last detail of a situation may place a stranglehold on  progress and increase red tape to such an extent that  innovative processes in Germany can no longer keep  pace with the rate of technological development on  the international stage. On the other hand, regulatory  frameworks can and must protect fundamental rights  and freedoms and create legal certainty. This is an  essential first stage in building a system within which  citizens, companies and institutions can trust in the  fact that the transformation of society will be guided  by ethical principles. In addition, the “toolbox-like”  nature of the legal system with its options for regulating  matters at many different levels, ranging from acts and  ordinances right down to codes, self-governance options  and voluntary obligations, makes it suitable for creating  a framework that is adaptable and can keep up with  technological progress.
42 PART B | E THICAL  AND  LEGAL  PRINCIPLES However, the need for guidance goes far beyond the  regulatory sphere . With this in mind, many different  stakeholders – such as professional groups, companies  and advisory boards at national, regional and international  level – have responded to the manifold upheavals by  drafting ethical codes or sets of guiding ethical principles,  in some cases with an ensuing public debate. The Data Ethics Commission welcomes the diversity of  stakeholders taking action and the number of voices  being heard in the discussion on how the process of  digitalisation can be shaped in an ethical way, since this  highlights the indispensability of public debate and for  everyone to take responsibility for the flourishing of  our future lives together . In keeping with the mission  assigned to it in the coalition agreement, the Data  Ethics Commission has based its recommendations for a  “framework on how to develop data policy and deal with  algorithms, artificial intelligence and digital innovations”  not only on the precepts of constitutional law, but also  on cross-cutting ethical principles that apply to differing  degrees in all areas of society; these principles are briefly  outlined below.1 1   By following this approach, the Data Ethics Commission is adhering to the same basic principles endorsed by the European Group on Ethics  in Science and New Technologies (EGE) in its opinion: EGE: Statement on Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and “Autonomous” Systems, 2018,   (available at:  http:/ /ec.europa.eu/research/ege/pdf/ege_ai_statement_2018.pdf ).
43  B 3.  GENERAL  ETHICAL  AND  LEGAL  PRINCIPLES 3. General ethical and legal principles 3.1 Human dignity Human dignity, which from an ethical viewpoint is  synonymous with the unconditional value of every  human being and which is enshrined as a “fundamental  constitutional principle” in the constitutional order, is  of foundational and supreme importance. It follows  from the principle of human dignity that every individual  merits respect, regardless of his or her attributes and  achievements. Protecting the value which is inherent  in every human being and which does not need to be  acquired also implies that human beings are not ranked  in a classifying system across various spheres of life  and activities (“super scoring”) or labelled like an object  with a price and treated accordingly. The fact that each  human is an individual rather than a pattern made up  of data points must also be borne in mind at all times in  situations where human behaviour is measured and these  measurements are processed by algorithmic systems.  Algorithmic systems must therefore always be designed  in such a way that they can cater to each human’s claim  to individuality. Acknowledging human dignity involves recognising that  humans must always be “superior to technology”, i.e. that  they must not be completely or irrevocably subordinated  to technical systems. The opportunities for configuration  and intervention may be localised at different levels in  each specific application, but the principle of human  sovereignty of action  must be upheld. Humans hold  responsibility in human/machine interactions, and must  not be regarded as defective beings that need to be  optimised or perfected by the machine. Instead, human  use of algorithmic systems aims at realising human ideas  and objectives more effectively and rapidly and with  fewer errors.Protecting human dignity also involves ensuring that the  human as a relational being  is not misled by technology  about the nature of a relationship; for example, it would  be wrong for a human to be systematically deceived into  thinking that he or she is speaking with another human  when it is actually a bot. The psychological integrity  of the individual  is a particularly important factor in  protecting human dignity. This rules out the use of datadriven systems for manipulative purposes, particularly  when the systems draw on comprehensive and highly  granular personality profiles. It also rules out the use  of algorithmic systems to discriminate systematically  against individuals or groups , for example by  “downgrading” them, preventing them from using certain  services for ethically untenable reasons or systematically  misleading them as they participate in the democratic  discourse. 3.2 Self-determination The opportunity for self-determination is inextricably  linked with human dignity. Humans express their  freedom  by determining their life goals and the way they  lead these lives, as a basis for determining, developing  and enacting the very essence of their self. A society that  takes freedom seriously must put in place a framework  within which its citizens can develop freely and respect  each other’s freedom, despite all their differences. For  example, if people are to lead a self-determined life  and develop in freedom, technical systems must not  restrict and control human avenues for action without  an ethically meaningful reason. Self-determination must  not be viewed solely through an individualistic lens –  humans are relational beings whose life unfolds through  social interactions with others, on the basis of manifold  reciprocal links and influences. The rules that govern these interactions are shaped over  time by the cultural and socionormative framework  that  serves as a basis for our life together in society. They are  also shaped by law in a democratic society, especially  where imbalances of power and information prevail.
44 PART B | E THICAL  AND  LEGAL  PRINCIPLES The more information third parties have collected about  an individual, the more difficult it becomes for that  individual to act unselfconsciously in social situations or  even to reinvent himself or herself completely. Steps must  be taken to ensure that data collection and evaluation  practices do not result in personal and social profiles  being routinely created in multiple locations, thereby  “cementing” a particular version of the individual. Selfdetermination therefore also encompasses the right to  develop and alter one’s own identity , and the possibility  of starting one’s life afresh. The right to self-determination  thus also includes each individual’s right to decide how  he or she is perceived in public and to prevent public  misrepresentations. Another vital aspect of self-determination is that people  must not only be allowed to assume responsibility , but  must do so and do justice to the task. Responsibility  always lies with a human – institutionally enshrined, if  necessary – never with a machine. Even if a technical  system is used to apply inferences based on automated  evaluations (i.e. whether or not a loan should be granted),  the responsibility for developing and using this system in  an ethically sound manner must lie with humans. An important manifestation of self-determination  is informational self-determination . It includes the  individual’s right to determine who can collect and use  which personal data, when they may do so and for what  purpose. Informational self-determination allows an  individual to protect his or her freedom of action and  privacy to the extent he or she deems important, and also  to determine as what personality he or she wants to be  perceived and treated in public.In this era of digitalisation, the special importance of  individuals as self-determined actors in the data society  goes beyond their informational self-determination.  The term digital self-determination  refers to this;  it encompasses the skills needed by an individual  to determine for himself or herself the content that  should be used as a basis for interacting with his or her  environment, and how he or she can unfold his or her  own personality in an interactive way. Under certain  circumstances, it may also include the self-determined  economic exploitation of an individual’s own data assets  and the self-determined governance of non-personal data,  for example the data generated when operating certain  devices. Digital self-determination always goes hand in  hand with digital accountability. The Data Ethics Commission takes the view that  businesses and legal persons  should also be entitled to a  right to digital self-determination. Legal persons cannot  invoke the concept of human dignity granted by Article 1  paragraph 1 of the [German] Basic Law ( Grundgesetz ,  GG) and protected in the framework of the general right  of personality, and are therefore barred from referring  to the associated core area of personality development,  which enjoys absolute protection. Article 2 paragraph 1  of the Basic Law, in conjunction with Article 19 paragraph  3 of the Basic Law, does however grant legal persons a  protected right of personality that also incorporates a  right to informational self-determination.  The ability of consumers to take self-determined  action and conscious consumption decisions is a vital  prerequisite for optimum resource allocation and  maximisation of the public good at macroeconomic level.  Any erosion of the skills needed by consumers  to exercise  their right of self-determination, for example because of  the excessive use of decision-making assistants and the  associated habituation effects, raises ethical questions  regarding external determination and the freedom of  individuals to take decisions, and also regarding the ability  of a small number of market-dominant firms to exert  control over society.
45  B 3.  GENERAL  ETHICAL  AND  LEGAL  PRINCIPLES 3.3 Privacy The protection of human dignity and self-determination   are closely and materially linked with the protection of  privacy. The individual’s right to determine who may  access which personal information relating to him or  her, and when and for what purpose they may do so  (informational self-determination, see section 3.2 above),  is justified by the supreme ethical importance of the  ability to prevent intrusions into one’s private sphere and  also to appear in public in the certainty that one’s privacy  is protected. Efforts to protect human dignity must  include legislative measures to regulate the responsible  use of personal data. A further aspect of privacy is the need to preserve  the integrity of an individual’s personal identity . For  example, this integrity may be violated if an algorithmic  system – using data collected for entirely different  purposes – “calculates” the personality of an individual  together with his or her preferences and proclivities, and  the system operator then uses these calculations for  its own purposes, regardless of or even contrary to the  individual’s will. Given that different spheres of society are being  shaped more and more by data-driven technologies,  it is important for us to increase the amount of  attention we pay to the use of data . Many people are  willing to make their personal data available for public  or semi-public use because they will receive certain  products and services in return, or because they wish to  contribute to the public good. Merely telling the public  to think twice before disclosing personal data is not  effective. Instead, effective regulations must be adopted  so that people can rely on the fact that their data will be  used responsibly, and that steps will be taken to prevent  any ethically unacceptable uses. 3.4 Security Algorithmic systems also give rise to crucial security  questions. The context of use may promote or jeopardise  user security. Security is relevant from an ethical and legal  perspective because of the role it plays in protecting  high-ranking values , such as an individual’s physical and  mental health and his or her privacy, or public security,  peace, and free and equal democratic elections. Security can relate to collecting and using data, which  means that the concept also has a bearing on the  protection of privacy . The major data scandals that  have hit the headlines in recent years have made it  clear that privacy breaches and the use of personal data  for manipulative purposes can have far-reaching – and  sometimes political – consequences. Consideration must also be given to the physical and  emotional safety  of an individual who operates and uses  an algorithmic system. Stringent requirements apply in  this respect, e.g. in connection with human/machine  interactions. If a robot carer is used, for example, it must  be ensured that neither the person receiving care nor the  person providing care suffer any harm in terms of their  physical and mental integrity. Algorithmic systems may also have an impact on  environmental safety . Malfunctions of algorithmically  controlled public infrastructures, e.g. traffic or energy  and water supply infrastructures, may cause enormous  amounts of damage. Algorithmic systems may also be innately unsafe,  causing malfunctions or even functioning as gateways  for malicious attacks and manipulation . Even beyond  inherent system vulnerabilities of this kind, it must not be  forgotten that an algorithmic system could be misused  for harmful purposes.
46 PART B | E THICAL  AND  LEGAL  PRINCIPLES 3.5 Democracy Digital technologies are in a complex manner  systemically relevant  for the development of  fundamental rights (in particular freedom of expression  and information, (informational) self-determination,  confidentiality of telecommunications, freedom of  assembly and association, freedom of occupation and  right to property), for democracy, for the safeguarding  of diversity, for an open societal debate and for free and  equal elections. For example, social media sites serve as a  low-threshold opportunity for every citizen to participate  in debates on the shape of our future, and as such should  in principle be welcomed. At the same time, however,  there is a risk that they may be used for manipulation  and radicalisation. The State should take decisive action  to counter these risks by adopting rules and setting  up institutions capable of preventing undesirable  developments and misuse.  It is also an undeniable fact that the rise of the Internet  has been accompanied by an economic decline in  journalism and its privately funded plurality. yet the  electronic public sphere cannot in any way be considered  a valid replacement for the role played by journalism in a  democracy, namely that of a “fourth estate” or “watchdog  of democracy” – i.e. an instance that exercises control  of power and claim to truth on the basis of systematic  and independent investigations and criticism. Under  certain circumstances, powerful media intermediaries  playing a gatekeeper function  may exert a controlling  influence over the democratic formation of will, posing  a significant threat to democracy that – based on ethical  considerations and the provisions of constitutional law –  must be countered through legislative means.Education and training  must also play a prominent role  in safeguarding the free democratic basic order, since  they influence, in a wide variety of ways, the participation  of citizens in the shaping of society – a process that is of  critical and fundamental importance for democracy, these  citizens’ understanding and appraisal of socially relevant  interrelationships and developments, and – ultimately –  their level of confidence in a future that can be shaped  and that is founded on values. Education and training  must impart not only technical and mathematical skills,  but also skills in the fields of ethics, law, economics and  the social sciences. 3.6 Justice and solidarity Observance of the principles of justice by society and its  institutions is another fundamental factor that allows  us to live together in peace, prosperity, freedom and  democracy. Data and technology have placed enormous  influence – both economic clout and the societal sway  that results from the former – in the hands of a small  number of large companies, and this has raised new  questions about a fair economic order. The availability  of large volumes of data and the digitalisation of  processes e.g. in the workplace and the healthcare  sector raises other questions relating to equitable  access and distributive justice , however, for example  in relation to income and the provision of healthcare;  these developments may mean that scarce resources  can be distributed more fairly, but they may also mean  that individual groups of people suffer disadvantage or  discrimination. There is also a close link between justice and opportunities  for participation. Stronger participatory processes ,  also supported by digital tools, can play an important  role in promoting social innovations during a time of  technology-induced social upheavals. Finally, questions  of justice arise in connection with situations where the  use of algorithmic systems – in particular self-learning  algorithmic systems – means that individuals or groups  of people suffer discrimination for no justifying reason.
47  B 3.  GENERAL  ETHICAL  AND  LEGAL  PRINCIPLES A clear assignment of responsibility and accountability   is an indispensable feature of a democratic State under  the rule of law. An adequate level of transparency and  explainability is an essential prerequisite for auditing  algorithmic systems appropriately on the basis of their  real potential for harm. Opportunities for seeking  legal recourse and, if necessary, holding another party  accountable, i.e. liable, must also be available under  certain conditions. In the world as it stands today, access to digital resources   via the Internet is a fundamental requirement for digital  and thus also social participation. As part of its public  provision remit, the State is obliged to ensure that its  citizens can access up-to-date Internet infrastructure  anywhere in the country and to an adequate extent,  using either a fixed or a mobile connection. As part of its  educational remit, it must provide its citizens with the  skills needed for self-determined navigation of the digital  world and for accurate appraisal of the opportunities and  risks of Internet use. Opportunities for participation promote social cohesion ,  which is also based on a fundamental attitude of societal  solidarity and integration of the latter into the institutional  framework. Digital technologies may strengthen solidarity,  but may also weaken or destroy it. When algorithmic  systems are used in certain spheres of society such as  the insurance sector or the provision of opportunities  for social participation, care must be taken to avoid a  systematic weakening of solidarity, which may, in some  cases, be caused by very subtle effects. For example, it  is perfectly possible for data-driven differentiation and  unequal treatment that appears plausible and justified in  individual cases to lead overall to a reduction in solidarity  with certain groups of people, some of whom may be  particularly reliant on society’s support.3.7 Sustainability Digital technologies offer huge potential in terms of  more efficient resource management and innovative  business models. This economic aspect generally attracts  the lion’s share of attention in general debates on the  topic. To date, however, less interest has been shown in  the question of whether digital technologies can also  contribute to economic sustainability. Consideration  must also be given to issues relating to ecological and  social sustainability. The UN has adopted 17 Sustainable  Development Goals relating to economic, social  and ecological aspects , which apply to all the UN  Member States and should be achieved by 2030. Digital  technologies may make it easier to do so; this is the  aim pursued by the International Telecommunication  Union (ITU) with its “AI for Good” initiative, for example.  Similarly, the German Advisory Council on Global Change  (Wissenschaftliche Beirat der Bundesregierung Globale  Umweltveränderungen ) recently outlined its vision of an  AI-based and highly granular network of environmental  sensors that would allow unprecedented “comprehensive  and real-time monitoring of the natural Earth systems,  their condition and development”, as a vital building block  in a future digital sustainability policy. yet digital technologies do not only conserve resources;  they also consume them, for example through the  ever-rising demand for electricity and the reliance of  digital products on certain rare earth elements that  are only available in limited quantities and in certain  countries. Rare-earth mining causes enormous damage  to the environment. This raises questions with regard  to sustainable economic and ecological development,  and also questions of international justice  concerning  the use of natural resources and global responsibility for  future generations.
48 PART B | E THICAL  AND  LEGAL  PRINCIPLES Human knowledge and human skills are also resources  whose sustainability must be safeguarded. The  development of digital technologies and the concomitant  reduction in the tasks that need to be performed by  humans will mean that individuals gain certain new skills  but lose other competences of the human being . A debate  must be held on our responsibility towards the next  generation, and measures are required to preserve and  develop certain skills and avenues for independent action. As noted elsewhere in this Opinion, there is a need  for regular and comprehensive technological impact  assessments , and these assessments must also consider  the sustainability of new technologies in their various  manifestations. It is incumbent upon the legislator  to ensure that responsibility for sustainability is  incorporated into the rules that govern the data economy  and algorithmic systems, for example through the  introduction of an obligation to disclose the entire energy  footprint of an energy-hungry blockchain system. The pursuit of sustainability goals set by the United  Nations should be a particular focus of public  investments  into the data economy and algorithmic  systems. When allocating government funding, priority  should be given not to economic gains which are only  short-term in nature, but to the development of data and  algorithmic systems for purposes such as recording and  monitoring environmental impacts and developments,  or systems for optimising and reducing energy and  resource consumption. In addition, more should be done  to promote sustainability-oriented social innovations that  foster social creativity and participation.
Part C Technical foundations
PART C | T ECHNICAL  FOUNDATIONS 50 Data-intensive IT applications have a lasting impact  on our living and working environment, our economy,  our scientific endeavours and our society. As well as  being permanently tethered to our smartphones, we use  search engines on a daily basis, rely on recommendation  software, send text or voice messages to our family and  friends, regulate the temperature in our home remotely  and allow navigation devices to guide us from one place  to another. We are able to do so because of a series of  technological developments that have occurred over the  past few decades. Some of the fundamental technical  concepts underpinning these developments are described  below; the aim is not to provide a comprehensive account  but to highlight key points as a basis for identifying any  resulting problems and starting points for potential  governance approaches.
C 1.  STATUS  QUO 51 1. Status quo Entirely new fields of application  have been opened up  thanks to the improved performance and miniaturisation  of the physical components of IT systems (hardware)  that are used to store and process data, along with  continual enhancements to both wired and wireless  connectivity. Smartphones, tablets and wearables are  gradually infiltrating our workplaces and homes, along  with sensors, actuators and, in some cases, “autonomous”  systems such as robots. In many locations, the Internet  is “always on” thanks to mobile access, making it  possible – e.  g. in combination with various sensors in  smartphones, such as geolocators, gyrosensors, cameras,  microphones, etc. – not only to input text, but also to  upload image, video and audio recordings to the Internet  at any time and from almost anywhere. This penetration  of technology makes it possible not only to communicate  and use social networking sites, but also to link devices to  the Internet of Things (IoT). It has become impossible to draw a clear dividing line  between the analogue and the digital worlds; the former  contains more and more components that transfer  information into the latter, while digital information is  becoming ever more widely available in the analogue  world, bringing the two closer and closer together and  creating a hybrid world .Data volumes are increasing exponentially  thanks to  comprehensive arrays of sensors, the IoT and the falling  price of storage capacity. Specialised tools are needed  to process such large volumes of data. At the same time,  the accumulation of so much data (together with the  availability of high-performance hardware) has promoted  the widespread use of machine learning procedures,  and some of these have achieved impressive results, for  example in the field of speech and image recognition. Speech recognition and video processing have now seen  such huge leaps forward in terms of performance that  there is potential for the boundaries between reality and  computer-generated information  to become blurred.  When this happens, people are no longer sure whether  or not they are talking to a speech bot, or whether they  are watching a normal video recording or a “deep fake”,  i.e. a synthesised human image saying things that the real  person never actually said.
PART C | T ECHNICAL  FOUNDATIONS 52 2. System elements 2.1 Data 2.1.1  Definition and properties of data In keeping with the Data Ethics Commission’s mission,  this report concentrates on data that are digital and  machine-readable . These data are made up of a stream of  binary electrical impulses, which may be transient (signals  that only exist for an instant, e.  g. a control impulse for a  technical system) or persistent (stored on a medium). Data are multifaceted. The word “data” is an umbrella  term that encompasses an enormous range of  manifestations. For example, data can be categorised  on the basis of data type (e.  g. binary, nominal, ordinal,  metric and textual data), the process used to generate  the data (e.  g. survey data, sensor data), the sector in  which the data are collected (e.  g. financial data, weather  data) or their function in a digital system (e.  g. login data,  training data). They can be further categorised on the  basis of their level of processing. Data that have not yet  been processed are referred to as “raw data”. Processed  data are referred to as “structured” or “unstructured”,  depending on the level of structuring (normalisation).  Data can function as the input into a system or the output  from a system, and an output may, in turn, function as  an input into another system. Data can also represent  digital assets, such as multimedia content or units of  cryptocurrency. A further distinction of enormous legal  significance is that between personal and non-personal  data.The terms “data” and “information” are not always  synonymous.  To make sense of the binary electrical  impulses  that form the basis for digital data, i.e. to  transform data into “information”, it is necessary to know  their context  and semantics  (meaning). One possible  context would be the origin of a generated signal –  knowing which precise sensor emitted a signal, for  example. The term “semantics” refers to the information  contained in a certain sequence of binary signals; for  example, a “4” that appears in a survey may equally well  represent the number of children in a household or the  number of tubes of toothpaste bought in the past six  months. Potential sources of context and semantics  include metadata, domain tables, ontologies, identifiers  and other technical specifications that supplement  data values. Whenever the term “data” is used in the  remainder of this report, familiarity with the context and  semantics will always be implied. Data are of varying quality.  The purpose of most  data – or, more accurately, the information contained  therein – is to reflect reality as accurately as possible.  This can for example be done by assigning attributes  that are exhibited by entities in real life to the correct  entities in the digital world (information objects). There  are also many types of data that are intended to express  the likelihood of something happening in reality (either  now or in the future). Some types of data are intended  to construct a hypothetical reality, while others have no  relation to reality whatsoever. In all of these cases, the  pool of data may contain errors . A distinction should  be made between these errors and cases in which the  data do what is expected of them but are unsuitable   for achieving a specific goal, for example performing  a particular analysis (e.  g. the data are insufficiently  granular, or outdated, or incomplete in some way). The quality of the data used is of decisive importance  for data-driven systems, since even a perfect algorithm  cannot deliver high-quality results if it receives poor  data as an input (i.e. inaccurate or inadequate data). Data  quality is not an absolute value; the relevant data quality  dimensions and their quality level depend on the specific  use (see Figure 1) .
C 2.  SySTEM  ELEMENTS 53 2.1.2  Data management Data are not some pre-existing entity – they are created.   The process of collecting, preparing and processing  data involves many different human decisions that have  implications for the future use of the data. For example,  the potential that might have been gained from data may  be irretrievably lost if they are stored without any context  or semantics. Careful data management  is necessary to  avoid situations of this kind. Before collating data from different sources, it is vital  to ensure that the collation will be possible from both a  technical and a semantic perspective (“interoperability”).  The data from these different sources must be mapped  against each other in a way that reflects their semantics.  In cases where interoperability is particularly important,  efforts should be made to achieve standardisation  of the  technical specifications (formats, descriptive metadata,  etc.). Reference data play an important role in this  respect, i.e. standardised schemes or ontologies, some  of which fall under the remit of national or international  institutions (e.  g. the International Classification of  Diseases (ICD) published by the WHO). 1 Doug Laney: 3D Data Management. Controlling Data Volume, Velocity, and Variety, META Group Inc., 2001.2.1.3  Big data and small data The term “big data”  does not refer to a separate type  of data, but instead to a new methodological approach  for the identification of relationships. Laney1 famously  used the “three Vs” – volume, velocity and variety – to  define this approach while it was still in its incipient  stages; large volumes of varied data, potentially from a  variety of sources, are generated at high velocity (often  in real time). Special technologies are needed to process  these large volumes of rapidly changing data that vary in  terms of both their nature and their quality. The analysis  of large data sets (“big data”) is particularly well suited  to situations where it is necessary to identify the most  promising of a large number of potential correlations. In  the field of medical research, for example, it is helpful  to start with big data methods that identify a number of  likely candidates from a long list of environmental factors  that might increase risk for a disease, before going on to  perform costly and high-precision experiments or studies  that investigate only these candidates. A specific problem  associated with this approach is that it initially shows  only correlations  rather than causalities, and completely  unsuitable candidates may therefore be identified.

PART C | T ECHNICAL  FOUNDATIONS 54 In many areas, the volumes of data available will never  be large enough to allow analysis using big data methods  (for example, the client base of a small or medium-sized  company may never exceed 200 customers, and the  number of political parties in one country rarely reaches  three figures). Suitable “small data”  analytical methods  can also be used to extract a great deal of knowledge and  information from data. The quantity of data is not what  matters; instead, the decisive factor is the availability of  suitable tools that make it possible to combine data of an  adequately high quality in quantities that are sufficient for  the task at hand, as a basis for effective data analysis. 2.2 Data processing 2.2.1  Algorithms From a data protection point of view, the term  “processing”  refers to the entire sequence of actions  from data generation and extraction through to storage  and any transformation of the actual data (Article  4(2) GDPR). By way of contrast, the mathematical and  technical sciences mainly deploy the term to refer to the  use of data. The following arguments are based on the  latter of these two understandings of the term. Any method of digital data processing follows the IPO  (input, processing, output) model  – data enter a system  as an input, are processed, and then leave it as an output.  Any form of internal processing within an IPO system is  based on an algorithm, or in other words an operational  processing sequence that specifies a procedure as a series  of different processing steps, with the aim of achieving  the desired result through successive transformations  of the data inputs. Algorithms have been around since  the time of Euclid, who specified a method for easily  calculating the greatest common divisor of two natural  numbers. The word “algorithm” is derived from the name  of the Arabian mathematician al-Khwarizmi (formerly  Latinised as “Algorithmi”), who published a collection of  calculation rules for solving algebraic equations in 830 AD  or thereabouts.It is hard to overestimate the importance of the term  “algorithm” in modern computer science. To solve a  particular problem by processing data, an algorithm  must not only be implemented correctly, but also  used productively. This presumes a knowledge of the  algorithm. In many cases, however, the algorithm that  will ultimately deliver the desired result is not yet  known, and the first and most important task is to find  a suitable algorithm . For many situations of practical  relevance, the processing specifications can be derived  directly (i.e. deduced) from specialist knowledge, known  models or legislative provisions. In other situations, our  understanding of the context is not yet sophisticated  enough to allow it to be described using more or less  simple mathematical formulae. If this framework of understanding is absent, various  strategies can be applied to identify an algorithm. These  include random chance, trial and error or data-based  inference . The latter approach follows the principle  of induction – an attempt is made to infer a general  rule from individual cases (i.e. the data). If a general  rule is found that can be used to solve the question, it  can be assumed to be a suitable algorithm. It is worth  remembering that there may well be several suitable  rules, and furthermore that the result of this process  of induction may not necessarily be correct. The result  inferred from the individual cases may be partially or  wholly inaccurate.
C 2.  SySTEM  ELEMENTS 55 2.2.2  Statistical inference A central concern of statistics is the drawing of inferences  from data. Statistical inference procedures can be  applied to data sets to investigate problems that lack a  known inherent logic. More importantly, however, they  can also be used for problems where random chance  forms an integral part of the process to be modelled.  Examples would be estimating the probability that  it will rain on the following day, or identifying highprobability prospects for a particular product. There are  many different statistical inference methods to choose  among, starting with various forms of regression (linear  regression, logistic regression or regularisation (ridge  regression)), moving through support-vector machines  (SVM), Bayesian networks and rule learners (such as  Aprioiri, CART and random forest), and ending up with  neural networks (NN). All of these procedures are  suitable for extracting information from the available  data. Some of them are specifically designed to solve  regression questions, for example estimating the future  height of a child based on the height of his or her parents,  whereas others, such as SVM, CART and NN, are used for  classification-type question, e.  g. pregnant/not pregnant,  dog/cat. Whether or not they represent a suitable means  of answering a question depends on many factors,  including the data volume and type.Besides methods for induction, statistics offers a broad  set of tools for measuring the quality of the results  (estimations) obtained . These measurements can be used  to estimate potential errors and to monitor actual errors  in practice. Thus an estimate of a child’s future height can  be stated as 175 cm with a deviation range of +/– 4 cm.  If a pregnancy test yields a positive result, this result  might be deemed to be 93% accurate. A pregnancy test  is a good example of the need to monitor two different  parameters: the number of false positives (e.  g. when the  women is not pregnant but the pregnancy test is positive)  and the number of false negatives (e.  g. when the woman  is pregnant but the pregnancy test is negative). The ideal  statistical procedure would never result in any of these  errors. In practice, it is necessary to weigh up the severity  of the two errors and decide which false rate should be  minimised. Is it worse for a woman to find out at a later  date that she is, in fact, pregnant after being told that  she is not, or for a woman to be told that she is pregnant  when this is not true? The two error types cannot be  minimised at the same time, since it is generally the  case that the lower the frequency of one, the higher the  frequency of the other. A balance must be struck, and this  will look different depending on the context.
PART C | T ECHNICAL  FOUNDATIONS 56 The quality characteristics of the methods themselves are  used as a basis for assessing the quality of the results. It  is even possible to guarantee the quality  of the results  obtained using certain methods; for example, estimation  procedures that use a uniformly minimum-variance  unbiased estimator (UMVUE) ensure that the best  possible results are obtained using the data available. If  a regression using UMVUE-based parameters supplies a  result stating that the expected height of a child is 175  cm +/−  4 cm, no other estimator would have achieved  a smaller error margin. Similarly, if a support-vector  machine is used, the model determined on the basis of  the relevant data (provided that a model can be found  at all) is guaranteed to be the best possible model for  the method in question. In certain cases, well-founded  procedures for assessing the quality of either the model  itself or the estimates generated using the model are  yet to be developed – this applies, in particular, to the  method class of neural networks. Quality indications  can also be provided for neural networks, however.  Measurements of how well a model functions using data  that were previously unknown are particularly important.  The model is taught using one data set (training data)  and assessed for quality using a different data set (test  data). This approach can be used to identify models that  do not reflect the general rule because they have learned their training data too thoroughly. Cases of this kind are  referred to as overfitting; an overfitted model will achieve  significantly better quality values for the training data  than for the test data. Many statistical procedures can be solved analytically.  This means that the question can be formulated as a  mathematical equation or a system of equations and  solved through transformations (even though this often  requires a great deal of skill). However, a direct analytical  solution is impossible for many other methods (for  example if additional conditions such as a regularisation  term are applied, see below). In these cases, use can  be made of optimisation procedures  that approximate  the solution through many small steps. Optimisation  procedures are not necessarily optimal; for example, the  calculated result may be only a local optimum and not  the global optimum (or one of them). Different classes of problems: analytical procedures and optimisation procedures A direct analytical solution is possible for tasks such  as “Find the value of y for the equation y=4  · x+3  where x=3 ”. A solution of this kind is not possible for the task  “Solve the linear equation a · x1+ b · x2+⋯+ h · x8= y,  in which as many parameters as possible a, b, …, g, h  are equal to 0”.An additional regularisation term is applied for  this purpose: min((a  · x1+ b · x2+⋯+ h · x8– y)+  sum(parameter  ≠0)) . Optimisation procedures are used to find solutions.
C 2.  SySTEM  ELEMENTS 57 2.2.3  Machine learning The boundary between traditional statistics and machine  learning , a term first defined by Mitchell,2 is difficult to  delineate. The scales tip towards machine learning at  the latest when optimisation procedures (→ see section 2.2.2  above for further details)  are used to solve inductive inference  problems. The different approaches to estimation or “learning”  strategies  that fall under the heading of machine learning  can be differentiated on the basis of the formulation of  the optimisation problem to be solved. A distinction is  made between a number of different learning procedures:  ●Supervised learning:  Supervised learning procedures  require knowledge of the correct output (the “O” in  the IPO model) for each piece of information used  as input (the “I”). Height is a classic example: before  inferring the height of a child (output) from the height  of his or her parents (input), it is necessary to know  the height of the child in advance. It is also necessary  to know the correct result of a pregnancy test, the  actual weather that follows a weather forecast, the  properties of the soil predicted by a soil analysis, etc.  In practice, the real challenge often lies in obtaining  the correct output information and assessing its  quality. This output information is frequently referred  to as a label . The majority of machine learning  algorithms currently in use were trained using  supervised learning procedures. 2 Tom Mitchell: Machine Learning, McGraw-Hill, 1997. ●The decisive questions with regard to these learning  procedures are how to formulate the actual  optimisation problem, which regularisation terms  to use and how to define the loss function (i.e. are  all errors treated the same, or are there different  weightings and levels of severity, e. g. when comparing  false negatives for patients with cancer who are  incorrectly diagnosed as healthy and false positives for  healthy patients who are incorrectly diagnosed with  cancer?). Quality of labels Labels can also contain errors. Several levels of  complexity can be defined for data labelling: 1. Labels whose accuracy can be verified when  the data are collected. Example: only one  correct and relevant value exists for physical  systems or properties such as the speed  of an object, the temperature of a room or  an individual’s date of birth. In principle,  therefore, these values can be ascertained as  labels by an algorithm. 2. Labels whose accuracy cannot be verified when  the data are collected and may, in certain cases,  not be verifiable at a later date. 3. Labels with a construed and non-verifiable  relationship to the real world. Example:  concepts such as social milieus or character  types have been developed with a view  to achieving a better understanding and  analytical grasp of humans and their behaviour.  These concepts are abstractions that are not  necessarily an accurate representation of the  “truth” (in so far as it exists).
PART C | T ECHNICAL  FOUNDATIONS 58  ●Reinforcement learning  involves assessing an agent’s  actions and imposing a punishment or reward. An  agent selects from a pool of different actions and  performs whichever action it has selected; this action  changes the state of the system and functions as  an optimisation input. In addition to the state (or  change in state) of the system that is brought about  by the agent’s actions, there must also be a clearly  defined reward function. In the case of supervised  learning, the correct and optimal solution is available  for every input; this is not necessarily true in the case  of reinforcement learning. Instead, the optimisation  goal pursued is that of finding the action strategies  that lead to the best end state with reference to  the optimisation problem. Actions that deliver only  short-term improvements may need to be rejected to  achieve this goal. Alongside the optimisation problem  itself and the relevant loss factor, the reward function  plays a particularly important role in this learning  strategy. ●Unsupervised learning  involves searching for  structures in a particular quantity of input data. There  is no need for the correct structures to be known or  for a reward function to exist. A precise definition of  the structure being searched for is required, however.  For example, a search can be carried out for clusters  (i.e. groups in the data) by imposing the requirement  that the difference between all the data points in  a cluster should be minimised while the difference  between the clusters should be maximised. The  optimisation problem for unsupervised learning is  identified on this basis. Unsupervised learning is also  referred to as data mining . Decisive factors include not only the learning procedures  but also the availability of sufficient volumes of data  that are adequately high in quality and broad in scope,  since close approximation of an optimisation goal cannot  otherwise be achieved. In many cases, the volume, quality  or scope of the data are lacking in some way, meaning  that other avenues must be pursued to ensure that good  outcomes can nevertheless be obtained using machine  learning techniques. Identifying an optimisation goal A public transport company is planning to alter its bus  routes to reflect recent changes in the city where it  operates; many residents have moved to peripheral  areas, large inner-city brownfield sites have been  developed, and gentrification has brought about  huge changes in the composition of the population in  various districts. The project manager has collected  data in the form of passenger and usage figures, and  is attempting to optimise the routes served so that  the city’s needs can be met as effectively as possible  without needing to use extra buses. He is aware that a  range of different goals or constraints could be imposed  on the optimisation, such as using fewer buses, using  fewer drivers or avoiding the creation of new routes.  For example, depending on how the optimisation  problem is formulated, it might be possible to achieve  a solution whereby densely populated neighbourhoods  are served by more bus lines compared to other  districts, but anyone living in a suburb is forced to put  up with longer travel times or a lower frequency of buses. Since the project manager himself lives in the  affluent commuter belt, he has a personal preference  for an optimisation strategy that minimises the longest  travel time. A strategy of this kind would result in  faster connections to all areas of the city, including the  outlying districts. His line manager is unimpressed by  both of these models. He believes that the goal should  be to transport as many passengers as possible. This  puts short-distance routes with plenty of passengers  at an advantage, but is bad news for longer routes with  more than four stops. It should be readily apparent  from the above that decisions on the optimisation  function can have social impacts. Many questions are  raised, including the following: Who should decide on  the goal of optimisation? Who else should have a say in  the decision? How can the matter be debated with the  general public, and is it necessary and meaningful to do  so? Should certain groups/neighbourhoods have access  to legal remedies if they feel that they have been placed  at an unfair disadvantage compared to others?
C 2.  SySTEM  ELEMENTS 59 For example, synthetic data  can be used, i.e. data that are  generated artificially rather than being collected directly  in the real world and that boast several advantages over  real-world data.3 They can be produced in any quantity,  which is particularly important when dealing with  simulations for which real-world data cannot yet be  generated. When they are created, steps can be taken to  ensure that the entire range of possible values is included  in the synthetic data, e.  g. in order to test how a technical  system would behave when confronted with unusual  data combinations. Their quality can be measured, and  if necessary it can be guaranteed in individual cases  that the properties of a set of real-world reference data  are retained; alternatively, distortions occurring in sets  of real-world data can be pinpointed and removed in  order to avoid discrimination. If the set of synthetic data  contains no references to persons, it is anonymous and  does not fall within the scope of the GDPR. Synthetic  data can also be used to train algorithms or test systems;  there is, however, a risk that the algorithm will be  influenced by properties of the artificially generated data  that have no counterpart in reality. Separate functional  testing must therefore be carried out before the  algorithm is used for practical applications. A middle course is frequently adopted in the form of  augmentation . This involves creating new data from  the real-world data so that a greater range of situations  can be covered at the training stage; the pool of data  is enlarged, but the relationship to the real-world data  is preserved. The term “augmentation” describes the  process of generating new data that deviate slightly from  the original data. For example, a characteristic feature of  augmented images is that they have been shifted, rotated  or distorted in some way. 3 Jörg Drechsler/Nicola Jentzsch: Synthetische Daten: Innovationspotenzial und gesellschaftliche Herausforderungen [Synthetic data: potential for  innovation and societal challenges], Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, May 2018 (available at: https:/ /www.stiftung-nv.de/sites/default/files/synthetische_ daten.pdf ). 4 John McCarthy/Marvin Minsky/Nathaniel Rochester/Claude Shannon: A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial  Intelligence, 1955.2.2.4  Artificial intelligence In the current parlance, the field of machine learning –  and more specifically neural networks – is referred to  as artificial intelligence (AI) , but this term often gives  rise to confusion. Machine learning is only one specific  procedure that falls under the heading of “weak AI”  and that is used to solve well-specified tasks. By way of  contrast, “strong AI” methods are expected not just to  tackle a single task, but to handle a broad spectrum of  tasks, potentially without human intervention. Despite  the hopes raised by the term “artificial intelligence”,  machine learning methods are not capable of such feats. Historically speaking, the concept of artificial  intelligence  first appeared in the Dartmouth Proposal,  published back in 1956 in the USA,4 to refer to a broad  area of research within the field of computer science.  The decades since AI first emerged as a field of research  have been marked by repeated cycles of unrealistic  expectations followed by disillusionment. AI left the  ivory towers and made inroads into the economy and  everyday life (both workplaces and homes) at the latest  in the 1970s and 1980s, in the form of “expert systems”,  and research efforts in Germany stepped up a gear in the  1980s. Achievements that can be chalked up to AI research  include not only machine learning techniques, but also  a large number of other vitally important methods,  such as procedures for pattern recognition, knowledge  representation, inferences, action planning and user  modelling . Applications for these procedures include  speech, image and dialogue comprehension, robotics and  multi-agent systems.

The process  starts when an algorithm (f) is developed using the training data. Once an algorithm has been identified that meets the  desired quality standards, it is put into production. To ensure monitoring and quality control capabilities the production  process must make it possible to record the input (x) that enters the algorithm, the output (y) that leaves the algorithm,  and the relevant correct value ( y). This information can be used as a basis for monitoring the algorithm in a production  environment. To do so, a comparison is carried out to determine the extent to which the output of the algorithm (y)  reflects the expected value ( y). The algorithm can continue to be operated without changes in the event of non-critical  deviations between these values. If significant deviations are detected, it may be necessary to re-evaluate (i.e. recalibrate)  the parameters of the algorithm. If critical deviations are detected, an algorithmic redesign is recommended. The problem of understanding and comprehending Humans often find it difficult or impossible to  understand methods intuitively if they are described  in mathematical or technical terms. This even goes  for experts in the field of modelling. Even in the case  of relatively simple classification methods that are  well understood mathematically (such as logistic  regression), almost no one can intuit which result they  will return for a given set of input values.Neural networks for image recognition are a good  example of this phenomenon; a human can generally  look at a photograph and understand immediately  what he or she is looking at, but a human looking at the  data structures used as an input for a neural network  intended to classify the same photograph is likely to  understand almost nothing. This means that, even if a  human is familiar with all the digital input values and  comprehends all the steps in a neural network, he or  she will not necessarily understand the recognition  process. If an error occurs, for example, he or she may  not be able to determine why recognition has failed and  how the problem can be fixed. Humans and machines  recognise objects and patterns according to different  sets of rules, and it is not always easy to translate  between the two.

PART C | T ECHNICAL  FOUNDATIONS 62 2.2.5  Algorithmic systems An algorithmic system generally incorporates multiple  algorithms that can work together rather than a single  algorithm, and the term “component” is used to  describe an executable part of such a system. Different  components of an algorithm might be based on  different technical implementations. The architectural  style known as microservices is a good example. It is  important to remember that the individual components  of a system of this kind might be subject to different  regulatory requirements or protection objectives during  their development. In addition, different stakeholders  might be responsible for different components of an  algorithmic system, for example as suppliers, operators or  manufacturers. It should be borne in mind that different  requirements or different sets of rules might apply to the  individual components, e.  g. in respect of data quality,  non-discrimination or freedom of contract.2.3 Software If an algorithm is formulated in a programming language  (formal language) rather than natural language, it is  executable in automated form on a computer as a  program  (or software ). The functioning of software  depends not just on the data it processes, but also on  the context in which it is executed (cf. concepts such as  the “technology stack”, which contains all the hardware  and software components used for execution) and  its parameterisation. Parameters are an “outside-in”  method of configuring software. They make it possible  to pass information to the software, ranging from simple  data (such as display options or path names) through  to complex models. More extensive parameterisation  options generally go hand in hand with more flexible  software use and a more complex development process,  making parameters all the more important. For example,  software that can be parameterised can be adapted to  different contexts with a relatively small amount of effort,  and without modifying the source text (i.e. the actual  implementation). There are special variants of adaptive  systems which over time automatically adapt to their  context – such as the individual using these systems or  the environment in which they are used. In order to guarantee or improve the efficiency of  high-quality software development processes in spite  of increasingly complex framework conditions, and in  order to reduce communication problems during these  processes, model-driven development approaches  have  been pursued successfully for many years. A generic  software component is parameterised on the basis  of a complex model, using a language specific to the  application context. Mathematical and statistical models  represent a special case, and differ from domain-specific  languages in that a model is not explicitly specified or  programmed; instead, the mathematical or statistical  model is (implicitly) taught or trained using data (→ see  section 2.2.3 above on machine learning) .
C 2.  SySTEM  ELEMENTS 63 2.4 Hardware Software is executed by hardware, and in particular  by processors . In recent years, these processors have  seen steady gains in performance, while the devices  themselves have seen continual reductions in size,  meaning that the array of potential applications has  become ever wider. Moore’s Law (according to which  performance should increase a hundredfold every  10 years) is subject to physical constraints, however.  When chip components become so small that they are  barely bigger than individual atoms, fulfilling Moore’s  predictions using silicon as a transistor material becomes  an increasingly costly and technically challenging  task. Researchers are therefore currently investigating  alternative materials such as graphene in conjunction  with new computing concepts such as photonic  quantum computing. The question of whether these  will be suitable for everyday use remains open, however.  Solutions focusing on parallel computing are more  established, and include multi-core and many-core  processors or the use of graphics processing units (GPUs).  In order to accelerate machine learning using bulk data,  application-specific chips (such as tensor processing  units, TPUs) that are optimised to handle the highly  parallel addition and multiplication of matrices for neural  networks have been developed. The increasingly parallel nature of computing is not  without its problems, however; humans find it very  difficult to identify any related processor errors, and the  calculations performed at the hardware level are almost  impossible to reproduce and comprehend.2.5 System architecture Applications today rarely run on a single computer.  Instead, many different software components run on  different computers and interact with each other to  perform a task. The term “distributed system”  is used  to refer to this method of distributing the work across  different hardware nodes. A distributed system is made  up of different software and hardware components  that interact within a network. The network nodes  communicate with each other over wired or wireless  links. A wide range of protocols and standards  exist for  network communication, and are used as a basis for  processing data at the network nodes and forwarding  these data through the network (i.e. transporting them  to other nodes). Specifications outlining the requests  that can be submitted to a server are published in an  application programming interface (API), for example.  As a general rule, steps must be taken to prevent these  interfaces being used incorrectly or accessed by attackers. IT infrastructures that can be reached via the Internet  are referred to as the cloud , and cloud applications can  be accessed by billions of users. Groups of related cloud  applications are often referred to as digital platforms ,  and many – such as the “Big Four” or “GAFA” (Google,  Apple, Facebook, Amazon or “GAFAM” if Microsoft is also  included) – have a high level of name recognition.
PART C | TECHNICAL FOUNDATIONS Hub 1  e. g. smart lighting Hub 2  e. g. heating control ROUTER Hub 3  … Hub 4  … COMPONENTS CONTROLLER SMART HOME GATEWAY INTERNET Network communication:  wireless   wired64 In the early days of the Internet of Things, most data  were sent directly to the cloud and processed there on large digital platforms. By way of contrast, an increasing number of solutions are currently being developed that involve the processing (or at least pre-processing) of data immediately and as close as possible to the place where they are collected, or in other words “on the edge” of the Internet. This practice of processing data near to where they are collected is referred to as edge computing, to distinguish it from situations in which the data are processed in the cloud (cloud computing). Data pre-processing is particularly important, since it allows not only the minimisation of communication effort, but also the creation of more privacy-friendly systems, since any references to individuals that are not required can be removed at this point (close to where the data are collected). The complex system landscape that has emerged in recent years (incorporating the Internet, edge computing and IoT) entails a high level of interconnection, making it hard to distinguish the individual systems from one another.The way in which the architecture of distributed systems is designed also has a significant impact on the business processes supported by the system, since it acts as a factor in decisions on the technology that is used, the network nodes on which the software runs, the interfaces and protocols used for communications and the other parties involved in these communications. For example, if manufacturers want to use the hardware data collected by their devices for the purpose of long-term efforts to improve those devices, they have the choice of setting up their own communication infrastructure, making use of the user’s own infrastructure (where available) or asking the user to make the data available via an interface. The way in which data of this kind are handled in cooperative processes should be transparent and agreed contractually if necessary. Technical parameters may place constraints on the contractual provisions governing the exchange of data. Figure 3: Example of system architecture in the smart home

These technologies involve  the management of multiple identical copies of a  ledger by different partners, instead of the centralised  management of a single ledger. New ledger entries are  added to all of the copies, and the current accuracy  of the database is confirmed by consensus. The  underlying architecture of systems of this kind varies  from linear approaches to a wide range of graphbased solutions, depending on their intended purpose  and the structure of the transactions. A consensus  can also be achieved using different methods. These  methods are outlined in consensus protocols.One of the most famous examples of a DLT architecture  is the blockchain  concept, implementations of which  include Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchains are used  to store data as a list of records (“blocks”). The blocks  are linked to each other using cryptography, meaning  that a transaction stored as a block implicitly confirms  the accuracy of previous transactions (i.e. the entire  chain), making it extremely difficult for fraudsters to  manipulate the data by modifying it or deleting entries.  Use of a decentralised consensus protocol eliminates  the need for an additional instance that confirms the  integrity of transactions.

Part D Multi-level governance  of complex data  ecosystems
68 PART D | M ULTI -LEVEL  GOVERNANCE  OF COMPLE x DATA  ECOS ySTEMS The high level of complexity and dynamism of data  ecosystems means that new challenges must be  overcome in terms of regulating, controlling and  designing these systems before the ethical and legal  framework upon which the Data Ethics Commission has  based its work can be implemented in practice; this will  require cooperation between different stakeholders and  interaction between different governance instruments at  many different regulatory levels (multi-level governance).  Part D examines  relevant governance instruments  and stakeholders , with further details provided in the  following two parts on data and algorithmic systems  (in particular regarding the interplay between different  instruments and stakeholders).
69 D 1.  GENERAL  ROLE  OF THE  STATE 1. General role of the State All those who are entitled to exercise ethically  justified rights and who are obliged to comply with  the corresponding obligations – be they citizens,  companies or government agencies – must actually be  able to do so in practice. This presents the State with  a wide range of tasks. First and foremost, the State is  responsible for establishing a legal framework  within  which a data society geared towards the public interest  can develop. The speed at which algorithmic systems  are developing and infiltrating ever more areas of life  poses major challenges for the legislature and the  courts that hand down rulings clarifying the legislative  provisions. The State must ensure that any regulations  adopted in an environment of this kind are sufficiently  hard-hitting to steer developments, while at the same  time being flexible enough to continue fulfilling their  purpose even if the technological parameters change.  Statutory provisions must therefore be formulated in a   technology-neutral manner , and innovative regulatory  models must be developed. In addition, the appropriate infrastructural and  technological prerequisites  must be in place – such as  enabling technologies, institutions and intermediaries,  complemented by the involvement of a broad gamut  of civil society actors. The Data Ethics Commission  believes that, here too, the State must play a key role in  guaranteeing and safeguarding these services of general  interest.  The new opportunities opened up by the data society  also impose a far-reaching educational remit  on the  State. It is necessary to identify the skills required to take  a creative yet reflective approach to the use of digital  technologies, and to determine the framework conditions  that must be put in place before appropriate training can  be offered to a diverse range of target groups. The State’s  educational remit should be understood in a broad sense,  and should incorporate public outreach work  with the  aim of raising awareness in this area.Furthermore, the State is also generally responsible for  encouraging research and development (R&D). It is  particularly important here to support R&D with regard  to ethically sound technologies (e.g. those that uphold  the principles of accountability, transparency and antidiscrimination). Extensive research and development  programmes are needed to ensure that ethical and legal  principles are taken into account, and more funding must  be channelled towards these programmes. Not all of the funding needs to be provided by the  State itself or by institutions that are closely aligned  with the State, but the State must put in place the  framework  (legal and otherwise) for a data society in  which individuals and businesses alike can operate in a  self-determined fashion on the basis of ethical values  and principles, in which these individuals and businesses  are provided with adequate protection, and in which the  potential of data and algorithmic systems are harnessed  to shape a worthwhile future. Germany’s efforts in the direction of ethically sound  and multi-level governance should also include  active contributions to debates at the European and  international level . The global dimension of technological  developments means that action by a single nation  state or regulations adopted at the national level alone  are inadequate. The Data Ethics Commission therefore  welcomes the European and international initiatives that  have already been launched (by the European Commission  and the OECD, for example) with a view to ensuring that  our future is shaped on the basis of ethical principles.  Safeguarding the digital sovereignty  of Germany and  Europe in the international context is a vitally important  task in this regard (→ see Part G for further details) .
70 PART D | M ULTI -LEVEL  GOVERNANCE  OF COMPLE x DATA  ECOS ySTEMS 2. Corporate self-regulation and corporate digital  responsibility  Responsibility for mitigating the risks of digitalisation  and for leveraging its significant potential should not be  placed solely at the feet of the State and its legislators.  This responsibility  should also be shared with the parties  that develop, disseminate and use the technologies, even  in the absence of any legal obligation . Although the  State must shoulder most of the responsibility, not least  because it is obliged to protect its citizens by guaranteeing  the confidentiality and integrity of IT systems and  safeguarding other fundamental rights, self-regulation  tools are also vitally important, particularly in the context  of the digital transformation process. The term “corporate digital responsibility” (CDR)  is  used at a theoretical and practical level to refer to the  idea that companies, as manufacturers and operators  of digital technologies, should each assume their own  responsibility for the consequences of digitalisation. Like  corporate social responsibility (CSR), CDR falls under  the broader umbrella of corporate responsibility; in this  case, the focus is on voluntary corporate activities in  the digital sphere which go beyond what is currently  prescribed by law, and which actively shape the digital  world to the benefit of society in general, and of  customers and employees in particular. To further this  aim, in October 2018, the Federal Ministry of Justice and  Consumer Protection launched an initiative to clarify the  principles and concepts of corporate digital responsibility  (www.bmjv.de/cdr ). According to this initiative, CDR can  encompass many topics,1 including the protection of  personal data, inclusion in the digital sphere, transparency  (e.g. in relation to algorithms or data protection), the  development of digital innovations that help to achieve  sustainability objectives, algorithmic use that is geared to  the public interest, open data and information security. 1  Corporate Digital Responsibility Initiative: Shaping the digitalization process responsibly: A joint platform, 2018 (available at: https:/ /www.bmjv.de/ SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/News/Artikel/100818_CDR-Initiative_EN.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3 ).The responsible development of digital products and  services must be a central priority in all corporate  decisions taken at all levels of the company. Ethical  questions must not be a matter for legal departments  and compliance officers alone. Instead, they must be  viewed as a cross-cutting task  and integrated into  all processes . All of the parties involved must be  aware of their responsibility to consider ethical values  such as participation, fairness, equal treatment, selfdetermination and transparency. The negative social and  societal impacts of digitalisation and digital business  models on employees, suppliers, clients, society as  a whole and the wider environment should thus be  minimised, and the new opportunities that digitalisation  offers for the achievement of macrosocial goals should  be leveraged. When applied correctly, the concept of  CDR can lead to improvements in terms of consumer  protection, digital participation and the sustainable  development of the digital economy . CDR is fundamentally similar to corporate social  responsibility (CSR) in that it requires companies to  take self-regulatory action on a voluntary basis. Internal  strategies such as in-house or industry-specific codes  of values are therefore a particularly effective way of  implementing CDR. In this respect, the Data Ethics  Commission welcomes the proliferation of professional  and ethical standards and codes of conduct published  by associations and companies in the data-processing  industry, with the proviso that these standards and codes  must help to clarify exactly what needs to be done; CDR  must not be reduced to a metaphorical fig leaf that  allows companies to pretend that they are upholding the  principles of digital ethics when the truth is very different.
71 D 2.  CORPORATE  SELF -REGULATION  AND  CORPORATE  DIGITAL  RESPONSIBILIT y  In the Data Ethics Commission’s view, the data protection  impact assessment that must (under the relevant  circumstances) be carried out pursuant to the GDPR  while a digital product is still at the development stage  should be accompanied by a more comprehensive and  general societal impact assessment  focused on the  assumption of foresighted responsibility (including the  impact on any employees and customers of a company  that are particularly affected by the digital transformation  process) which also takes into account the long-term  social effects of data-driven business models. It might be  a good idea for companies commanding a large market  share to set up an advisory panel (along the lines of  consumer and customer advisory panels) that could be  consulted when drawing up impact assessments of this  kind; the panel should be made up of representatives  of the groups of people most affected by the relevant  business model.
72 PART D | M ULTI -LEVEL  GOVERNANCE  OF COMPLE x DATA  ECOS ySTEMS 3. Education: boosting digital skills and critical  reflection Digital self-determination presupposes digital skills.  The Data Ethics Commission therefore unreservedly  welcomes the efforts undertaken by the Federal  Government, by consumer protection associations,  by legal professional groups and by other bodies to  raise public awareness of the importance of the selfdetermined use of data and digital technologies  (from  smartphone settings through to digital inheritance  planning) and to provide straightforward and easy-tounderstand information on the available options as well  as practical guidance. It also welcomes the steps taken  to raise awareness among consumers of the potential  inherent to data, and to provide them with muchneeded information about their rights and about the  real opportunities and risks involved in the economic  exploitation of their data. The Data Ethics Commission  recommends that all of these efforts should be continued  and stepped up. School pupils should also be made aware of the issues  connected with digitalisation as early as possible. Digital  skills should be integrated into the curriculum , and  teachers must be provided with comprehensive training  on the subject at regular intervals. This is the only way  to ensure that new generations will grow up to become  competent “digital natives”, able to assess both the  opportunities and the risks of new digital applications,  to take informed decisions and to assert their rights  effectively. In addition, lifelong education  on the use of data and  digital technologies must be provided to all age groups  and social groups. It must be borne in mind that digital  skills require not only a basic knowledge of the underlying  technology (which, in turn, requires ongoing education  in technical and mathematical subjects), but also an  adequate familiarity with the economic, legal, ethical  and social sciences; this broad spectrum of knowledge is  necessary to comprehend, discuss and assess the various  opportunities and risks in all their complexity. Education and training in computer science, data science  and software development is of particular relevance  in this respect. As well as basic instruction on ethical  and legal issues, more in-depth teaching on statistics,  methodology and scientific theory is needed. It is  particularly important to ensure that questions relating  to data ethics and research ethics are embedded in  discipline-specific methodological training, and there  must be a major push in this area to ensure that ethical  and legal considerations are incorporated into earlystage discussions by the parties that develop digital  products and services or are involved in decisions on  their development. An essential first step towards achievement of these  goals is cooperation between as many different entities  as possible, including government agencies, bodies that  are closely aligned with the State and private actors   at federal, State (Bundesland) and municipal levels. The  challenges involved in providing the general public with  digital skills, maintaining these skills in the long term,  and adapting them to each individual’s lived experience  are so great that they could never be tackled successfully  by a single, centralised body. That said, a key role must  be played by supervisory authorities (data protection  authorities and/or the relevant specialist supervisory  authorities), the Foundation for Data Protection,  consumer protection associations and training providers.  The media and institutions involved in media regulation  also have a large part to play in this connection; they  must not only provide society with information about the  new technologies and cast a critical eye over technical  progress, but also establish new forums for debate. Although government agencies must remain chiefly  responsible for imparting digital skills to the general  public, this task cannot be realised in full unless the  necessary civil society structures  are put in place, such as  digital volunteering, tech accountability journalism and  consumer-focused market observation. The Data Ethics  Commission therefore recommends that the Federal  Government should provide long-term support for the  establishment of structures of this kind.
73 D 3.  EDUCATION : BOOSTING  DIGITAL  SKILLS  AND  CRITICAL  REFLECTION Companies  also have a responsibility to provide training  to their staff. For example, a company can attain high  ethical standards only if its employees (particularly those  in management and in product development) have  an adequate awareness of potential ethical and legal  issues. As far as education and training is concerned,  questions relating to data ethics and data law should  also be included in a broad spectrum of academic and  professional training routes  and in workplace training.  Particular attention should be given to technical and  business professions, with a view to ensuring that ethical  and legal considerations are incorporated into earlystage discussions by the parties that develop digital  products and services or are involved in decisions on their  development.
74 PART D | M ULTI -LEVEL  GOVERNANCE  OF COMPLE x DATA  ECOS ySTEMS 4. Technological developments and ethical design Efforts to impart more advanced digital skills to the  general population must not end up shifting the weight  of responsibility away from manufacturers and digital  service providers and towards users, not least because  users have only limited opportunities to grasp and  comprehend all the steps involved in the processing  of their data and the underlying business models.  Responsibility should be laid first and foremost at the  feet of those who are able to exert an influence over the  development of products and services. This concept is  embodied in the principle of ethics by design  or ethics in  design , and appears in the GDPR (with reference to data  protection and intrusions into the private sphere) under  the heading of data protection by design and by default.  Aligning the development of technologies and products  (including services and applications) with the ethical  values and principles outlined above is also a good way  of increasing public confidence in digital products and  acceptance of these products. At the same time, however, the design of every product  must be tailored to the target user groups . Involving  user groups and their needs at an early stage of product  development (participatory product development)  may  be helpful in this respect. It is particularly important  for products that are targeted at vulnerable and/or less  digitally literate user groups to have an inclusive design ,  including privacy-friendly default settings, with a view  to protecting the digital self-determination of these  user groups. Inclusive design allows manufacturers and  operators to meet the constitutional requirement for  informational self-determination as enshrined in Article  1 paragraph 1 of the German Basic Law (Human dignity),  according to which protection must not be contingent  upon individual capabilities and personal circumstances.The most popular methods and platforms used to  develop technologies, the most commonly used libraries  and other code components have rarely supported the  requirements of ethics by design to date. Components  with a “better” design from the perspective of ethics or  data protection law are at best a niche interest. There is  a need for change in this area so that compliance with  ethical principles in general and data protection principles  in particular becomes the rule rather than continuing  to be the exception. Ethics by design requires the gap  between different communities to be bridged, and this  has certain implications for the professions affected.  The goals of this approach could be furthered not only  by information on methods and catalogues, but also by  best-practice concepts, supporting tools, development  frameworks  and (open-source) code components .  Platforms with repositories of these components  and usable pools of data (which, in some cases, are a  necessary prerequisite for checks) would make it possible  to highlight the specific properties required, supply the  documentation needed and provide opportunities for  exchanging know-how and experience. Although ethics by design is a crucial governance  instrument that allows the process of designing products,  processes and services to be aligned with individual and  public interests from the outset, it provides no guarantee  that the resulting products and services will be ethical.  Ethical principles can and should have a positive influence  on technological developments, but ethics is not a task  that can be delegated to technology . Furthermore,  decisions about which ethical principles should be  implemented and how they should be implemented (for  example whether fairness metrics should be applied to  algorithmic systems, and if so which metrics) should  not be left to developers alone; instead, these decisions  should be negotiated on a context-specific basis, if  necessary with the involvement of the parties affected.
75 D 5.  RESEARCH 5. Research Although data-processing systems with a more ethical  design are frequently developed and showcased by  researchers, there is a gulf between the world of research  and the real world. One of the reasons for this may  be the fact that some of these technical solutions (for  example those based on cryptographic mechanisms)  are counterintuitive in nature and more difficult for  many people to understand than conventional methods;  a prime example is a digital identification document  that changes in appearance every time it is shown,  making it impossible to “join the dots” between its  holder’s observed behaviours. Many people attempt to  understand  these innovative technologies by drawing  on conceptual models  from the surrounding (analogue)  world, but these latter provide an insufficient basis for  comprehending them or appraising their added value.  Despite the advantages offered by these technologies in  terms of ethics and data protection law, it is unlikely that  their use will become widespread until the public gains  a better understanding of them and is more confident in  their use. In many cases, cross-cutting (and therefore  interdisciplinary) cooperation  is an essential starting  point for understanding the implications of new  developments and designing ethical systems, but  cooperation of this kind is not adequately rewarded  by the discipline-bound metrics for good science and  research. In many areas, interdisciplinary research will  be given due recognition only if a shift in mindset occurs  (this applies to universities, peer reviews and expert  opinions, for example). Research funding should be  funnelled towards interdisciplinary cooperation which  delivers results that would have been impossible to  achieve within the silos of the individual disciplines, and  should allow the necessary institutional frameworks and  long-term career paths to be established.In many cases, high-quality and promising technical  solutions have already emerged from the research  sector, but the demand for these solutions is currently  still lacking. There is also a need for methodologies or  technologies that signpost a route  from the current  implementation status to an improved state of  technology . Once again, funding should be channelled  into development and innovation  so that improved  solutions can move from the drawing board to reality.  Instead of providing support for only a few outstanding  success stories, the need for broad-based progress in the  field of ethical design must be acknowledged.
76 PART D | M ULTI -LEVEL  GOVERNANCE  OF COMPLE x DATA  ECOS ySTEMS 6. Standardisation At the very latest when Lawrence Lessig coined the  aphorism “Code is Law”,2 thereby emphasising the  relevance of technical reality, it should have been obvious  that technical standardisation  is an essential factor in  the implementation of legal and ethical requirements.  Bodies responsible for the technical standardisation  of communications networks have been established at  international level (ISO/IEC, IEEE, IETF, ITU, ETSI or  W3C), European level (CEN) and national level (DIN being  the prime example in Germany, alongside other specific  standards for public bodies). A technical standard by  itself has no legal force, and anyone who uses a technical  system must also comply with the applicable legislation,  even if the provisions of this legislation run counter to  the requirements imposed by a global technical standard.  Nevertheless, standardisation is hugely influential in  terms of what is available on the market; wherever  possible, therefore, steps should be taken to avoid  adopting standards that infringe the current legislation. The standardisation process is often criticised for its  lack of democratic legitimacy, and it is true that the  groups within society that stand to be most affected are  often deprived of any opportunity for representative  participation . For example, non-governmental  organisations or other civil society representatives are  seldom involved in the standardisation process, and  generally speaking even data protection authorities are  only rarely involved in the standardisation of technical  systems. In a worst-case scenario, this may mean that  the operation of a technical system complies with the  standards but violates the legislation. Another point of  criticism is that a number of international standards that  manufacturers or operators are supposed to comply with  are not available free of charge in the public domain , but  must instead be purchased. 2 Lawrence Lessig: Code and other Laws of Cyberspace, 1999.Past standardisation efforts in the field of information  security served as a major contributing factor to  the addition of extra security features and gradual  improvements in the level of security, for example of  online banking. yet the Snowden revelations made it clear  that a number of intelligence services and government  agencies were deliberately attempting to weaken  standards by including security loopholes or backdoors  as a way of safeguarding access in the future. The role  of technical standardisation can be expected to gain in  importance over coming years, for example as a result  of the GDPR-imposed requirement to take due regard  of state-of-the-art technology, or as a consequence of  the German IT Security Act ( IT-Sicherheitsgesetz ). The  political influence exerted by a number of different  countries (not all of which are in Europe) can also be  expected to increase. An impact assessment  of standards that are currently  in existence or are still being debated must go beyond  purely technical and economic considerations, and  be expanded  to include ethical and societal factors.  The State should ensure that civil society actors, data  protection authorities, consumer protection experts or  spokespersons for organisations representing the parties  affected can play a role in the standardisation process  alongside the stakeholders that have dominated it to date.
Data rights and   data obligationsStandards for   algorithmic   systems 77 D 7.  TWO  GOVERNANCE  PERSPECTIVES : THE  DATA  PERSPECTIVE  AND  THE  ALGORITHMS  PERSPECTIVE 7.Two governance perspectives: the data perspective and the algorithms perspective In the following two parts, the arguments set out above  are applied to data-based algorithmic systems on the  basis of two different but complementary approaches.  The general ethical principles and precepts  used as a  basis by the Data Ethics Commission (see Part B above)  are important in two respects: firstly, they must guide  data governance measures, in particular with a view to  ensuring that procedures for collecting, accessing and  using data are ethically sound; secondly, they must guide  the design of algorithm-based systems used to process  data (including the oft-cited “artificial intelligence”  systems). The perspective that focuses primarily on  data (the “data perspective”) and the perspective  that concentrates mainly on algorithmic systems (the  “algorithms perspective”) should not be regarded as  competing views or two sides of the same coin; instead,  they represent two different ethical discourses, which  both complement each other and are contingent upon  each other . These different ethical discourses are typically  also reflected in different governance instruments,  including in different acts of legislation.  The data perspective  focuses on the data that are used  to train algorithmic systems, as a basis for algorithmically  shaped decisions, or for a plethora of other purposes  specifically associated with the context of meaning and  the semantics of data  (Part C, section 2.1). In particular,  it requires thinking about the origin of these data and the  potential impact their processing may have on individuals  involved with the context and semantic content of  the data. From an ethical and legal perspective, it is  important to identify standards for data governance;  typically, however, the rights  that these individuals can  assert against others will play an even more significant  role. A central distinction in this context is that between  personal and non-personal data, since it determines  whether the rights granted to data subjects under data  protection law apply. Current debates that are pertinent  in this connection include those on “data ownership  rights” or open data, for example.Figure 4:   Data perspective and algorithms perspective By way of contrast, the algorithms perspective  focuses on the architecture of data-driven algorithmic  systems, their dynamics and the systems’ impacts  on individuals and society. The ethical and legal  discourse in this area typically centres around the  relationship between humans and machines, with a  particular focus on automation and the outsourcing of  increasingly complex operational and decision-making  processes to autonomous systems enabled by artificial  intelligence (AI). The algorithms perspective differs from  the data perspective in that the data subjects affected by  the system may not necessarily have anything to do with  the original training or processing data; even if they do,  they are not the focus of attention. The focus is on the  objective requirements that apply, observance of which  may be enforced and failure to comply with which may  lead to liability and sanctions. The current debate on  “algorithmic oversight” is relevant and important in this  respect.

Part E Data
80 PART E | D ATA Data provide access to information, information can  lead to knowledge, and knowledge bestows influence  and power. In the light of new capabilities of automated  data processing and an exponential increase in memory  and computing capacity, having access to data can  mean an enormous increase in power and opportunities.  Controlling important resources is inherently associated  with a certain level of responsibility. Thus data, like other  resources, may be used only for lawful and ethically  acceptable purposes, and, like other resources, the impact  of their use on individuals and the general public as a  whole must always be assessed. yet data also exhibit  certain characteristics that differentiate them from other  resources.In the following sections, the Data Ethics Commission  will therefore take these specific characteristics of data  as a starting point, and develop, on the basis of the  principles outlined in Part B and without claiming to be  exhaustive, general standards of data governance (→ section 1  below)  as well as data rights and corresponding data  obligations (→ section 2 below) . It will then set out specific  recommendations for action in relation to standards for  the use of personal data (→ section 3 below) , improvements  to controlled access to personal data (→ section 4 below)  and  general access to data, in particular non-personal data  (→ section 5 below) .
81 E 1. GENERAL  STANDARDS  OF DATA  GOVERNANCE 1. General standards of data governance Any attempt to identify specific principles of data  governance must start with the differences between data  and traditional resources such as oil or goods. The unique  characteristics of data include, in particular, the following:  ●data are created and processed further in a distributed  and dynamic process , through the interaction of a  number of different players acting in very different  roles (e.  g. the data subject, the operator of a data-   generating system, the developer); this process is,  in principle, never fully complete ;  ●data are a non-rivalrous resource , i. e. they can be  duplicated as often as necessary and used in parallel  by multiple different players for multiple different  purposes;  ●data are multifunctional and can be used across  different sectors , and the potential and risks inherent  to them depend, to an exceptionally large extent, on  each data controller’s specific goals and opportunities  and, in particular, given the importance of effects of  scale, the ability to combine them with other data.1.1 Foresighted responsibility The special characteristics of data, such as their  unusually dynamic nature and the unusually high context  dependence of opportunities and risks associated with  them, mean that there is a particular need for foresighted  responsibility when making decisions about collecting,  using or forwarding data. When assessing the potential  impacts, including the risk of infringing the rights of third  parties, particular consideration should be given to the  following points:  ●the volume  of the emerging collections of data, with  a particular focus on any cumulative effects, network  effects or effects of scale;  ●the technological means  for processing data, with  a particular focus on the technological options that  are, or will be, available to large corporations and  government bodies (especially in relation to the  recombination and decryption of data);  ●the purposes  of data processing, with a particular  focus on potential changes to the context of data use  and the players involved (e.  g. as a result of access  by government agencies or following a corporate  takeover). In the case of personal data, the principle of foresighted  responsibility has found its standardised expression in  the maxims of data minimisation and storage limitation  that are enshrined in the GDPR. A range of further duties  under the GDPR, from the need to carry out a data  protection impact assessment to mandatory requirements  for controller-to-processor contracts, likewise follow  from this principle.
82 PART E | D ATA 1.2 Respect for the rights of the parties involved The use of data must always be underpinned by respect  for the rights of others. Acts or omissions that are  ethically unacceptable or unlawful in general terms,  because they violate the rights of others , do not become  acceptable or lawful simply because they are committed  by way of using data (e.  g. fraud is a criminal offence  regardless of whether it is committed by use of data  or otherwise). As data are generated in distributed  processes and through the interaction of many different  players, parties who have in any way been involved in  the process of data generation, for example as the data  subject or as the owner of a data-generating device,  may – from an ethical and possibly also from a legal  perspective – be entitled to genuinely data-specific  rights (data rights)  in relation to these data (→ for  further details, see section 2 below) . Such data rights must be  respected whenever data are used. Respect for the rights of others implies much more than  simply avoiding intrusion into legally protected spheres,  such as another party’s copyright. What is needed instead  from an ethical perspective is in-depth consideration   for the data-related legitimate interests of parties who  are specifically linked to the data and who may therefore  have certain rights of co-determination and participation  concerning the data. This in-depth consideration may  also imply duties to take action, for example by granting  another party access to the data in certain ways. In the case of personal data, the principle of respect for  third-party data rights is expressed particularly clearly  in the principles of lawfulness, fairness and purpose  limitation  enshrined in the GDPR. The GDPR itself sets  out a number of data rights vested in the data subject,  e. g. the right to be informed, the right to rectification, the  right to restriction of processing, the right to erasure or  the right to data portability.1.3 Data use and data sharing for the public good Resources that could be used to further key legally  protected interests of individuals (e.  g. health) or to  promote the public good, particularly in pursuit of the  UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals relating to  economic, social and ecological aspects, should not  be neglected. As a basic principle, there is an ethical  imperative  to use these resources in cases where to do  so would increase overall prosperity and where there are  no overriding and conflicting interests of other parties  (particularly data rights). One of the special features that make data unique is that  they are a non-rivalrous resource. They do not “wear  out”, even if they are used in parallel by many different  players for many different purposes, and they can be  duplicated an almost infinite number of times. Sharing  data can mean that the player who first shares the data is  at the very least no worse off, and everyone else involved  (however loosely) is better off than they would have been  had the data not been shared. An ethically responsible  approach to data governance must take this fact into  account. Data sharing is also enormously important in  terms of safeguarding fair and efficient competition . At the same time, however, conflicts can sometimes  arise between the principle of furthering the public  good by data use and data sharing on the one hand, and  the principles of foresighted responsibility and respect  for other parties’ data rights, including considerations  of appropriate investment protection, on the other.  The creation of incentives for voluntary data sharing   should therefore always be prioritised, and legislative  requirements to share data should be the exception.
83 E 1. GENERAL  STANDARDS  OF DATA  GOVERNANCE 1.4 Fit-for-purpose data quality Data, together with their context and semantics, are  stored information. Information regularly purports to be  the most accurate possible representation of reality as it  currently stands, or the most accurate possible prediction  of future reality. In situations that do not involve the  automated processing of data by algorithmic systems,  it is immediately obvious to everyone that incorrect  information is not only worthless, but also potentially  harmful; as soon as automation comes into play, however,  it is all too common for people to fall prey to false  objectivity  and show a foolhardy willingness to rely on  the results of calculations that were carried out using  incorrect or incomplete data, and are therefore also likely  to share these characteristics (“garbage in, garbage out”). In the interests of everyone, therefore, responsible data  governance in the data society must also include efforts  to achieve a standard of quality that is appropriate for  the intended purpose  (→ Part C, section 2.1.1) . The meaning of  “appropriate” must always be determined on a context-   specific  basis when used in relation to data quality,  however. For example, it is important to remember that  data may reflect societal preconceptions, stereotypes  and discrimination, which will, in turn, influence the  functioning of any algorithmic system trained using  these data (→ for further details, see Part F, section 2.6) . Data that  accurately reflect an existing deficit may therefore be  unsuitable for use as a basis for other purposes, even if  they are of a high statistical quality. Another important factor in this connection is that data  can be used across different sectors and for different  purposes. The FAIR principle  (Findable, Accessible,  Interoperable, Reusable ) may be relevant in this context,  for example as regards data storage and encoding  methods. According to this principle, data must be  prepared and stored in such a way as to be findable and  accessible, and must be coded in an interoperable format  and in a way that makes the data reusable in different  contexts by as many different players as possible. In the case of personal data, the desire to achieve a high  level of data quality is manifested in the principle of   accuracy  enshrined in the GDPR.  1.5 Risk-adequate level of information security  Data can be freely duplicated, and it is almost impossible   to recover them once they have gone astray. The  wide range of possibilities for external attack , many  of which are invisible from outside, mean that data  are also vulnerable to malicious attempts to falsify or  destroy them. A high level of information security  that  is commensurate with the relevant risk potential is  therefore, from a technical perspective, directly related to  the principles of foresighted responsibility and respect for  the rights of the parties involved. Appropriate information  security, encompassing a broad spectrum of measures at  different levels, is a vital prerequisite for mutual trust on  the part of those involved in the data society. In the case of personal data, the concept of information  security is manifested in the principle of integrity and  confidentiality  enshrined in the GDPR. 1.6 Interest-oriented transparency Since a party that uses and effectively controls data may  gain influence and power as a result, this party must, in  principle, be able and willing to account  for its actions.  One of the reasons for this is the protection of parties  whose data rights might be affected or even violated.  An interest-oriented level of transparency  is required  so that these parties (or entities enforcing data rights  or data law for the benefit of others) can determine  whether and to what extent data rights have, in fact,  been affected or violated, and against whom they can  lodge claims. In the case of personal data, transparency – i.  e. ensuring  that data processing operations are easy for data  subjects to understand  – is a basic principle of the  GDPR, and the same is also true for the principle of  accountability . Many of the provisions of the GDPR, for  example those relating to information, documentation  and the right to request access, are designed to improve  transparency.

85 E 2. DATA  RIGHTS  AND  CORRESPONDING  OBLIGATIONS   2. Data rights and corresponding obligations  According to the ethical principle of digital selfdetermination, individuals should not merely be perceived  as being passive and in need of protection and as facing  actual or potential threats, but rather as self-determined  actors in the data society . Self-determined navigation  of the data society by individuals requires that these  individuals have certain rights that can be asserted against  others. First and foremost among these rights are those  which relate to an individual’s personal data , which  derive from the right to informational self-determination  that is enshrined as a fundamental freedom, and which  are guaranteed by the data protection law currently in  force. Digital self-determination also encompasses the  self-determined economic exploitation of one’s data and  the self-determined handling of non-personal data , for  example the data generated by the operation of one’s  devices. The Data Ethics Commission takes the view that, in  principle, a right to digital self-determination also applies  to companies and legal entities  and – at least to some  extent – to groups of persons (collectives). In this context,  the Data Ethics Commission believes that it is possible to  identify general principles underpinning data rights and  obligations that go beyond data protection alone.1 2.1  General principles of data rights and  obligations Complex data generation processes (understood in  the broader sense, i.  e. including various phases of data  creation, enhancement and refinement) often involve  interactions between different parties that may be  pursuing different goals and playing different roles and  that contribute, in their respective roles, to the generation  of data in the process. A contribution by a party   (i. e. a natural or legal person) to the generation of data   may be relevant if any of the following are true: a) the information stored in the data relates (in terms of  meaning) to the party or to an object associated with  this party (e.  g. belonging to him or her); 1 Model of data rights and data obligations based on Preliminary Drafts no. 2 (February 2019) and no. 3 (October 2019) of the “Principles for a Data  Economy” by the European Law Institute (ELI) and the American Law Institute (ALI), made available to the Data Ethics Commission. These preliminary  drafts have not yet been adopted by either the ALI or the ELI and do not yet represent the official position of either of these organisations.b) the data were generated by an activity of that party  or by the operation of an object (e.  g. a sensor) that  belongs to this party; or c) the data were generated by software or another  component (e.  g. sensors) created by or invested in   by this party. Where the situation referred to in a), i.  e. the situation  that a party is the subject of the information stored in  the data, relates to natural persons, this is of particular  significance since this situation gives rise to the right to  informational self-determination and data protection  enshrined in constitutional law. Given the specific characteristics of data and the  inextricable link between personal data and personality  rights, the Data Ethics Commission believes that a  contribution to the generation of data should not give  rise to exclusive ownership rights in said data, above and  beyond the existing intellectual property rights (→ see sections  3.3.2 and 5.2.4) . Instead, a contribution to the generation of  data should entitle a party to specific data rights in the  form of co-determination and participation rights ; these  rights in turn impose obligations on other actors. From an  ethical perspective, this will result in a dynamic and special  relationship  between a party involved in the generation of  data and the party controlling the data. The duration of  this relationship may vary, as may its intensity. As far as  personal data are concerned, the relationship will largely  be determined by the applicable data protection law. From an ethical perspective, the recognition and design   of data rights, and corresponding data obligations, in  dynamic environments depend on the following general  factors, which are normally also the factors underlying  relevant legal provisions where data rights and  obligations have already been substantiated in the law: a) the scope and nature of the contribution to data  generation  by the party asserting a data right;
Balance of power  between the  partiesWeight of the interest  in being granted the  data rightContribution to  data generation Weight of any  conflicting interests  on the part of others Interests of the  general publicData rights and   data obligations86 PART E | DATA b) the weight of that party’s legitimate interest in being  granted said right (in particular the right to require  desistance, access, rectification or an economic share); c) the weight of any possibly conflicting interests on the  part of the other party or of third parties, taking into account any potential compensation arrangements (e. g. protective measures, remuneration); d) the interests of the general public; e) the balance of power between the party asserting the  data right and the other party.These factors interact with one another in what can be described as a flexible system; if the public interest in data access is particularly high, for example, it may compensate for a relatively insignificant contribution to data generation. Consideration must always be given to the general principles outlined in Part B in order to avoid situations in which crucially important individual interests are undermined by a purported or actual public interest. These factors also determine how certain details (e. g. formats, deadlines, protective measures or financial compensation) should be fleshed out and put into practice. This includes the question of whether action should be taken only upon request by the party asserting the data right (e. g. data access claim) or also proactively (e. g. an obligation to publish data).

87 E 2. DATA  RIGHTS  AND  CORRESPONDING  OBLIGATIONS   The rights granted to data subjects  by the GDPR are a  particularly important manifestation of these principles,  aimed specifically at protecting the natural persons to  whom the information pertains; they are also to some  extent a standardised manifestation given that they  hinge on the qualification of data as personal data.  The principles formulated here can also be applied to  non-personal data, however, and relate not only to  individuals, but also to legal entities and collectives.  2.2  Clarification of the general principles with  reference to typical scenarios Data rights may have a number of different goals ; these  include obliging another party to desist from using the  data (up to requiring erasure of the data), gaining access to  the data (e.  g. disclosure, transfer, full portability), arranging  for the data to be rectified, or claiming an economic share  in the profits derived with the help of the data. 2 Article 6(1), Article 9(1) GDPR.2.2.1  Scenarios involving desistance from use Situations often occur in which a party requests another  party to desist from using data in a certain way. The  GDPR even works from the basic assumption that  (personal) data should not be used unless there is a legal  basis for doing so and a number of other requirements  have been met.2 In a general sense and beyond the scope  of the GDPR, if a party has a significant legitimate interest  in the controller desisting from data use, the outcome  (from an ethical perspective) may be a right to require  said desistance , potentially even including a right to  erasure of the data, where the data processing operation: a) might cause harm to that party or to a third party; and b) is inconsistent with the circumstances under which  that party contributed to generation of the data, in  particular because (i) the contribution was made for another purpose,  and the party could not reasonably have been  expected to contribute to the generation of the  data if it had foreseen the present data processing  operation; or (ii) consent by that party would be invalid for  overriding reasons. Before any such right to require desistance from use  can be affirmed, however, the party’s legitimate interest  in being granted the right must be weighed up against  the other factors referred to above (→ in section 2.1) . For  example, such a right cannot be affirmed in cases where  the processing of data is, by way of exception, justified  by compelling other interests (e.  g. the prosecution of  criminal offences).
88 PART E | D ATA With regard to non-personal data , requests to desist  from the use of data may become relevant, for example,  in the context of value creation chains and customer  relationships where non-personal data are often of  enormous economic significance and a party involved  may have a significant legitimate interest to assert such  a right (→ section 5.3 below) .  Example 1   The non-personal data collected by sensors in modern  agricultural machinery (relating to soil quality, weather,  etc.) are used by manufacturers as a basis for many of  the services they provide (precision farming, predictive  maintenance, etc.). If the manufacturers were to  forward these data to potential investors or lessors of  land, however, the latter would be given information  that might prove harmful to an agricultural holding  if negotiations over the land were to take place in  the future. It can be assumed that the agricultural  holding would not have helped to generate the data  voluntarily had it known that they would be used  for this purpose. When assessing a right to require  desistance from an ethical perspective, consideration  must be given to the balance of power between the  parties in the case at hand, and also to the fact that  the agricultural holding made an extremely significant  contribution to generation of the data. Third-party  rights deemed worthy of protection would include only  the manufacturer’s interest in maximising their profit  and a general interest on the part of investors, lessors,  etc. in obtaining accurate information.From an ethical perspective, a waiver of a data right  to  require desistance is possible only under very limited  circumstances. Such a waiver should automatically be  ruled out in cases where consent to data use would be  invalid for overriding reasons (within the meaning of  requirement b) (ii)), for example because it is illegal or  inconsistent with public policy; this is because, under our  legal system and the fundamental values underpinning  it, there exists no such thing as a liberty to do any kind of  harm to oneself or to others. In other cases, a waiver may  be possible, provided that stringent requirements are  met (e.  g. there is a separate agreement that is not linked  to other services and does not involve the party being  placed under pressure) to ensure the voluntary nature  of the waiver, meaning that requirement b) (i) would no  longer apply. In Example 1, the agricultural holding could consent  to the data being forwarded to third parties, e.  g. on  the basis of an individual agreement with appropriate  remuneration; use of the tractor should not be  dependent on the data being forwarded.
89 E 2. DATA  RIGHTS  AND  CORRESPONDING  OBLIGATIONS   For personal data , obligations to desist from data use  normally follow already from the provisions of data  protec  tion law, but the criteria outlined above can be  used to determine whether the substantive limits of  consent  have been exceeded (→ section 3.2.1 below)  or to  guide the balancing of different legitimate interests,  for example.  Example 2   Data relating to the activities of a social network user  are used for extensive personality profiling; the profile  contains the attributes “mentally unstable” and “esoteric  tendencies”. As a result, the user is shown advertisements  by companies that offer personal horoscopes or energy  healing services (at significant cost) on an almost daily  basis and often immediately after he has posted content  that signals stress or anxiety; he often makes purchases  as a result. When he set up his user account, he clicked  on a checkbox next to the following statement: “I am  happy for my data to be evaluated so that my personal  preferences and attributes can be identified more  accurately and the services offered to me (including by  third-party providers) can be personalised to my needs  (profiling).” “Consent” of this kind does not make the  subsequent data processing operations lawful. There  are a number of different arguments for reaching this  conclusion: one of them being that processing the data  for this purpose may cause significant harm to the user,  which would be inconsistent with the circumstances  under which he generated the data (because he could  not reasonably have been expected to do so had he  known that data would be used for this purpose, and  because the law does not allow the abuse of mental  states of this kind, cf. Section 138 of the [German] Civil  Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch, BGB).There are many circumstances under which an obligation  to desist from the use of data cannot be mitigated by  consent or a balancing of conflicting interests; in such  cases, reference is often made to “red lines” or “ absolute  limits ”. There is no requirement for these limits to  be data-specific, and most are not. For example, it is  reasonable to prohibit election manipulation practices  that are incompatible with the principle of democracy,  regardless of whether said practices involve the use of  data. In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, an  example for data-specific absolute limits is the total  surveillance of individuals.  Example 3   When entering into an employment contract, an  employee signs an agreement stating that the  location tracking functions on her smartwatch and  mobile telephone, as well as a number of apps that  collect data (e.  g. by tracking sleeping behaviours  and emotions), will be kept switched on at all times,  even when she is not at work, and that she will hand  the devices over to her employer when requested in  order for the relevant data to be accessed. It is readily  apparent that these arrangements, taken together, are  equivalent to total (or almost total) surveillance, which  is incompatible with human dignity, self-determination  and privacy. This is true even if the employee gave  consent to each of these measures, even if she decided  of her own accord to enter into a contract with this  employer, and even if there were other offers of  employment available to her.
90 PART E | D ATA Conversely, the criteria that apply to scenarios involving  desistance from use may also bear an indirect relevance  to situations in which there is an ethical or even legal  obligation to use  data; such an obligation may arise  where a party is under a general obligation to protect  certain legally protected interests and has, at the same  time, access to data that could be used to secure or  improve the protection of these interests. In this kind of  situation, an obligation to use data arises as the corollary  of an obligation to protect certain legally protected  interests unless a third party has a conflicting right to  require desistance from data use.  Example 4   A hospital is experiencing an outbreak of a multi-   resistant pathogen. It wants to analyse the health  data of patients who have recently become infected in  order to gain a better idea of why certain individuals  are more likely to fall prey to the pathogen, as a basis  for pinpointing the inpatients that might benefit  most from a move to another hospital. Under these  circumstances, the hospital has a general obligation to  provide new patients with the best possible protection  against infection by taking all available and reasonable  precautions to this end. This includes the use of health  data belonging to patients who have already been  infected with the pathogen, provided that said use  might protect new patients and there is no obligation  emanating from the former group of patients to desist  from use of their data. 3 By way of examples: European Commission: Building a European data economy, COM(2017) 9 final, 10 January 2017, pp. 11 et seqq. (available at:  https:/ /ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2017/EN/COM-2017-9-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF ); European Commission: Towards a common  European data space, COM(2018) 232 final, 25 April 2018, pp. 8 et seqq. (available at: https:/ /ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2018/EN/COM2018-232-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF ). 2.2.2  Scenarios involving access to data When it comes to scenarios involving a request for access  to data, there will be many situations in which the party  seeking access to data and the party who effectively  controls the data will be able to reach an agreement on  the action to be taken. Voluntary arrangements  of this  kind should be welcomed, provided that there are no  conflicting and overriding third-party or public interests,  and in particular provided that there are no parties with a  right to require desistance from use based on the above  criteria. Given the enormous potential for value creation  inherent to data, however, in-depth discussions are also  being held on the circumstances and conditions under  which access to data should or even must be granted  from an ethical viewpoint.3  This may apply in situations in which access to data is  required (and perhaps even mandated by law) in order  to enable a party to comply with a special obligation or  task  (e. g. prosecution of a criminal offence, public health  concern). Any such data access right must be consistent  with the rules that apply to this obligation or task;  particular attention should be paid to the principle of  proportionality , and any potential third-party rights to  require desistance from use (→ see section 2.2.1 above)  must be  considered. There may also be independent requests for access to  data, for example within existing value creation systems .  Such systems typically involve many different parties who  contribute to the generation of data in different roles  (e. g. as suppliers, manufacturers, retailers or end users),  and who are, in principle, familiar with and have agreed  to both their own roles and the roles of the other players  involved (→ see section 5.3 below for further details) . Legitimate  interests that can be asserted by a party as a basis for an  access request may, in particular, include cases in which  the data are required for the following purposes:
91 E 2. DATA  RIGHTS  AND  CORRESPONDING  OBLIGATIONS   a) to use an asset in line with its intended purpose within  the value creation system (e.  g. repair of a connected  device by the end user); b) monitoring and improving the quality of a service  provided within the framework of the value creation  system (e.  g. by a supplier); c) to ascertain the truth or provide evidence (e.  g. in a  legal dispute with third parties); d) to avoid anti-competitive effects (e.  g. lock-in effects); or e) to create new value using the data (e.  g. by developing  a smart service). Example 5   A supplier provides the engines for the agricultural  machinery referred to in Example 1. It would be  extremely useful for the supplier to have access to certain  tractor data so that it can verify and constantly improve  the quality of its engines. These data are stored in the  manufacturer’s cloud, however, and the latter is unwilling  to allow the supplier to access them. In situations of this  kind, it is important to remember that the supplier has  made a significant contribution to the generation of  the engine data, and that the data are urgently needed  to improve the quality of a service provided within  the framework of the same value creation system in  which the manufacturer is also involved. Consideration  must be given not only to the balance of power in the  specific case at hand, but also to the fact that all parties  involved – including the general public – have an interest  in high-quality engines. There may, however, also be  relevant economic interests on the manufacturer’s side, in  particular relating to confidentiality.Access rights are also being discussed in situations  where the party seeking access and the party that  effectively controls the data are not yet part of the same  value creation system, but where a new value creation  system  could originate in which they are both involved.  The outcome of an assessment based on the general  criteria will normally be different in situations of this  kind, if only because the party seeking access has not  typically contributed to the generation of the data, and  the justifications that can be cited for granting an access  right are rather public interest considerations  or specific  considerations, such as safeguarding competition  (→ see  section 5.5 below for further details) .  Example 6   In Example 1, the manufacturer (which holds a  dominant position in the tractor market) has been  collecting soil and weather data for decades. A start-up  recognises the potential of a database for investors  using these data, and requests access to them. In this  case, consideration must be given to the fact that the  start-up itself has not made any contribution to the  generation of the data. The existence of a public interest  in data access (and the significance of this interest)  depends on whether the manufacturer is abusing  its market power and on how much the European  economy would benefit from the breaking up of a small  group of market-  dominant companies (presuming that  the start-up is based in Europe). In any case, potential  harmful effects of data disclosure on trade secrets  and other legitimate third-party interests, such as the  interests of the manufacturer and the agricultural  holdings in Example 1, must be taken into account.
92 PART E | D ATA The generally recognised principles of open government  data (OGD) , which embody the idea that government  data should be made available to the private sector,  include “open by default” and re-use of data “by anyone  for any purpose”.4 There have been calls from many  quarters to expand these open data concepts to include  data created by and effectively controlled by private  entities. The move towards open data, however, also gives  rise to complex ethical questions, for example the extent  to which a generalised assessment that no longer looks at  the individual case is acceptable. Example 7   A municipality implements a large-scale project to  collect mobility data using smartphone signals, with a  view to facilitating traffic management (by adjusting  the timing of public transport services, for example).  Theoretically speaking, the data are “anonymised”; if  the data sets are combined with other data sets and  some additional knowledge, however, the owner can  be identified with a confidence level of 95%. A number  of different parties are interested in gaining access to  these data; they include a researcher who wants to  use them as a basis for identifying the optimal design  of urban recreational areas, a start-up that wants to  establish an online detective agency via which users  can pay to access the mobility profile of their spouse,  competitor, etc. and a research institute tasked by a  foreign government with investigating the political  activities of its citizens. Case-by-case assessments of  these three access requests would deliver very different  outcomes. It is therefore a difficult question whether  the municipality may, or even must, make these data  public with a view to the many possible uses of the  data that would promote the public good. 4 See Recital 16 of Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open data and the re-use of public sector information (PSI Directive); Principles 1 and 3 of the G8 Open  Data Charter signed at the G8 Summit on 18 June 2013; and Principle 1 of the International Open Data Charter signed in September 2015 at the Open  Government Partnership Summit.The Data Ethics Commission wishes to emphasise, in  this context, the importance of the (potential) rights  of individual parties who have contributed to data  generation, in particular the rights of data subjects, to  require desistance from data use. It follows not only  that all possible and reasonable protective measures  (including anonymisation techniques, to be improved on  an ongoing basis) should be taken after weighing up the  potential for harm and the expected benefit for the public  good, but also that – depending on the potential for  harm – the granting of blanket access may be out of the  question (→ see section 5.4 below for further details) . 2.2.3  Scenarios involving rectification Not all data are of a high quality. Problems that are  particularly likely to arise include an unsuitable context,  inaccurate  encoding or incomplete  data in the sense  that any deductions obtained using the data are also  incorrect . In circumstances of this kind, a party involved  in the generation of data may have an ethically justified  right to re quire rectification of the underlying data or of  the deductions obtained using the data. The threshold for  a right of this kind to be granted is relatively low, since in  principle there is neither a protected individual interest  nor a public interest in the processing of inaccurate or  incomplete data. As a general rule, only the following  requirements must be met: a) the processing of inaccurate or incomplete data must  be potentially harmful to a party (in particular the  party to whom the information relates); and b) the rectification must not be disproportionate, taking  into account the severity and likelihood of harm on the  one hand and the effort involved in rectifying the data  on the other.
93 E 2. DATA  RIGHTS  AND  CORRESPONDING  OBLIGATIONS   Example 8   A very high error rate has been detected in the engine  data stored by the manufacturer in Example 5. This  is problematic for the company that supplies these  engines, not only because it deprives the company of  the possibility to fulfil its quality assurance remit, but  also because these engine-related data are pooled with  engine-related data from other engine suppliers as a  basis for evaluations, and poor performance metrics  for the engines from the relevant supplier might reduce  the latter’s chances of securing orders from other  manufacturers. In this case, the processing of inaccurate  data causes harm to the supplier, and there are no  indications that the effort involved in rectification  would be disproportionate. If the amount of effort involved in rectifying the data  is excessive but the potential for harm is significant,  a right to require desistance from use will frequently arise  (→ see section 2.2.1 above) . 2.2.4  Scenarios involving an economic share  Cases where a party uses data to create value after other  parties have contributed to the generation of said data  are an everyday occurrence, and a good thing in principle.  Provided that no one is entitled to a right to require  desistance from use (→ see section 2.2.1 above) , such use of  the data must normally be tolerated by the parties who  contributed to their generation. Given the strong affinity  which the data rights and obligations set out in this  section have with considerations of public good , there  are potent arguments against recognising a general right  to remuneration for all parties who have contributed to  the generation of data. Instead, such parties must content  themselves with existing mechanisms of collective  economic participation, in particular through the taxation  of value creation.In cases where there is no valid contract to back up a  claim for remuneration, financial compensation should at  most be considered as a mitigating measure, for example  if the exercising of a data right without compensation  appears disproportionate in the specific case at hand  (→ see section 2.1 above, factor c) . From an ethical perspective,  and in the view of the Data Ethics Commission, a party  who has contributed to the generation of data should be  entitled to independent remuneration  for their use by  others only in very exceptional cases . Cases of this kind  might arise if: a) the party’s contribution to the generation of data  required an unusual amount of effort  or was  particularly unique , and it would hardly be possible  (from an economic viewpoint) to replace it with  contributions by other players; and b) an exceptionally large amount of value has been  created using the data; and c) the circumstances under which the contribution to  data generation was made mean that it would have  been impossible or unreasonable  for the party to  engage in negotiations on any remuneration . The amount of any remuneration paid in such exceptional  cases must be adequate; in particular, basic incentives of  using data to create value must not be removed. It must  also be remembered that the party creating the value has  typically incurred financial risks. 2.3  Collective aspects of data rights and data  obligations An answer must be found to the issue of whether (and  if so to what extent) the above arguments concerning  the right to require desistance from use, the right to  access data, the right to rectification and the right to  an economic share in profits derived with the help of  the data can also be applied to collectives  in the sense  of defined groups of persons (e.  g. indigenous peoples  with regard to the use of their genetic data), i.  e. whether  collectives may be entitled to certain data rights in  connection with the use of “their” data. For example, 
94 PART E | D ATA thought must be given to the question of whether –  ethically speaking – a population (of a nation state, or  of the EU) which has generated data should have a right  to an economic share in profits, such as in the form of  taxes or transfer payments. The Data Ethics Commission  believes that this question can, in principle, be answered  in the affirmative. Example 9   An Internet giant earns billions from the data  generated when individuals all around the world use its  services. Yet even though this megalith of a company  generates 10-digit sums year on year using data from  EU-based individuals, it pays virtually no taxes in the  EU. The question arises whether the company should  be obliged on ethical grounds to allow the general  public in the EU to share (through taxation) in the  value it creates. The issue raises fundamental questions  about distributive and participatory justice, and about  what a just economic system looks like. However,  aspects such as market power and the unique nature of  contributions (e.  g. if audio data in a certain language  is used to develop new voice-controlled services) may  also have to be taken into account. The relational nature of many data types  makes it  particularly important to include groups and collectives in  any debate. This relational nature is apparent from the way  that many digital services require users to disclose data  about their contacts or “friends”, for example. As far as data  rights and the corresponding obligations are concerned,  the “friends” may have the right to require desistance from  use of the data and the right to gain access to the data, etc.;  at the same time, their potential interests must always be  taken into account when weighing up whether a data right  should be granted (→ see section 2.1 above) . However, there are  also cases in which a party contributes to the generation of  data, and these data then indirectly provide information on  other parties  – even if the latter played no role (not even in  the broadest sense of the word) in their generation. This is particularly relevant in the sphere of genetic data, but also  applies to other data types. There is still another, closely  related group of cases, where individualised data (even in  aggregated form) may have implications with potentially  negative third-party effects  that extend beyond the  individual who supplied the data.  Example 10   A health insurance company offers reduced premiums  as an incentive to sign up for health tracking schemes.  While those who agree to disclose their data will benefit  from lower premiums, those who refuse to do so may  end up paying more. Issues relating to the representativeness of data  used  to train algorithmic systems can also be interpreted as  problems of relationality: the lack of any relationship  between the parties who supply the training data and  the parties to whom the trained systems are applied may  result in systematic bias and potential discrimination (→  see Part F, section 2.6 for further details) . To overcome this hurdle, individualistic approaches to  data rights in ethics, law and technology design must  be expanded to include relational concepts of data  rights  (cf. also the debate on group privacy). Under  certain circumstances, it may therefore be possible –  at least when viewed through the lens of ethics – for  one group member’s contribution to data generation  to be attributed to the other group members as well,  potentially entitling these latter, in spite of the fact that  they themselves made no individual contribution, to  certain rights of their own (the right to request desistance  from use or the right to gain access, for example).
95 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA 3. Standards for the use of personal data 3.1  Personal data and data relating to  legal entities Any information relating to an identified or identifiable  natural person  is regarded as personal data. An  identifiable natural person is one who can be identified,  directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an  identifier such as a name, an identification number,  location data, an online identifier or to one or more  factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic,  mental, economic, cultural or social identify of that  natural person (Article 2(1) GDPR). Even though the remainder of this section focuses on  personal data in the legal sense of the term, the Data  Ethics Commission wishes to stress that the protection  of companies and legal entities  is a valid concern that  should not be relegated completely to the sidelines.  The potential hazards confronting legal entities have  been exacerbated yet further by the networking of  all machines, the exchange of data between factory  components, and the storage of all production data  generated by Industry 4.0 plants in “digital twins”. If  individual sets of data (generated through the operation  of devices, for example) are pooled together, the result  may be an almost seamless overview of a company’s  internal operating procedures, which may – in the  absence of appropriate protective mechanisms – easily  fall into the hands of the wrong parties outside the  company (competitors, negotiating partners, authorities,  prospective buyers, etc.). The Data Ethics Commission  believes that the risk posed not only to the digital  self-determination of companies and legal entities but  also to the digital sovereignty of Germany and Europe   (since data flows predominantly involve third countries)  is concerning from an ethical viewpoint, and that steps  must be taken to mitigate against it.A key legislative starting point for protecting enterprise  data is the protection of trade secrets , in particular the  [German] Act on the Protection of Trade Secrets ( Gesetz  zum Schutz von Geschäftsgeheimnissen , GeschGehG).  When interpreting and applying this Act, efforts must  be made to guarantee the comprehensive protection of  sensitive business data, given the central importance of  the latter in building a fair and competitive economic  system as the basis for economic and social well-being.  In many respects, however, Directive (EU) 2016/943 (the  provisions of which were transposed into the Act on the  Protection of Trade Secrets) is not adequately tailored  to the reality of IoT and Industry 4.0. The Data Ethics  Commission therefore calls on the Federal Government  to step up data-related protection of German and  European companies . The recommendations for action relating to personal  data put forward by the Data Ethics Commission in the  remainder of this section, for example in relation to a riskadequate interpretation of the applicable legal framework  (→ section 3.2.2 below)  or privacy-friendly design of products  and services (→ section 3.6 below)  also apply to the protection  of data relating to companies and legal entities (in a  modified or attenuated form where appropriate). 3.2  Digital self-determination: a challenge to be  tackled by the legal system as a whole  3.2.1   Cooperative relationship between the applicable  legal regimes Our economy and society are heavily reliant on the use  of personal data in a huge variety of different contexts,  and yet there is always a degree of tension between  this use of personal data and the fundamental rights  of individuals. The constitutional right to informational  self-determination (as part of the general right of  personality) is essentially part of the protection of  human dignity. Data protection law , in particular the  GDPR, clarifies these benchmarks and has binding force  on public and private bodies.
96 PART E | D ATA The GDPR is one of the great achievements of the  EU legislator, and currently functions as a source of  inspiration for other countries. It is important to temper  our expectations of this piece of legislation, however;  the GDPR is focused on data protection rather than on  comprehensive promotion of individual welfare and the  public good in the data economy. Taken in isolation, it  is not a suitable tool for averting all the harm that an  individual may suffer as a result of his or her personal  data being processed, and cannot therefore be regarded  as protecting his or her integrity in all respects. All of the  different mechanisms provided by the legal system as a  whole must be used to safeguard these legally protected  interests, particularly those that are not specifically  addressed by the provisions of data protection law  (e. g.  economic interests, the right to life and health, physical  integrity and reputation). This applies even in situations  where personal data are at play. The concept of consent  that is enshrined in data  protection law  is a vitally important mechanism for  safeguarding informational self-determination in the  digital and analogue spheres. yet the concept of a right  to self-determination that is not subject to substantive  limitations and that includes the freedom to inflict any  kind of harm on oneself or third parties would be an alien  element in our legal system, and is ethically indefensible.  The law should limit or even prohibit an individual’s  free and informed consent – as an expression of his or  her general freedom of action, which is protected as a  fundamental right – only in narrowly defined exceptional  circumstances. However, consent under data protection  law should be subject to substantive limitations, by way  of analogy to the limitations to freedom of contract or to  consent when it comes to intrusions on bodily integrity. In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, it has become  clear that the average individual is systematically  overwhelmed  by the number and complexity of the  decisions that he or she is required to take in connection  with consent under data protection law, and by the  5 Cf. also Recital 42 of the GDPR. 6 This relates in particular to the fairness test applied to general terms and conditions of business (Sections 307 et seqq. of the [German] Civil Code  (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , BGB)), the principles of public morals (Section 138 of the Civil Code), wilful immoral damage (Section 826 of the Civil Code)  and contractual and quasi-contractual protection and fiduciary duties (Section 241 paragraph 2 of the Civil Code).difficulty involved in estimating all the potential impacts  of data processing. The Data Ethics Commission believes  that inadequate use of consent by providers of digital  services is one of several reasons for a general loss of  trust  in the digital society. As things stand, individuals  can often no longer rely on the fact that the State and the  legal system have put in place the framework conditions  necessary for them to navigate the world in safety and  (relatively speaking) free from care, without needing to  worry about the possibility of suffering serious harm from  other parties. For business-to-consumer transactions,  contract law, and more specifically unfair contract terms,  control has provided the basis for ‘rational indifference’  on the part of consumers and for far-reaching protection  even in low-value cases. The same result should  be achieved by way of applying the fairness test to  declarations of consent .5 In applying the fairness test,  general values and principles underlying the legal system  as a whole must be taken into account. 3.2.2   Risk-adequate interpretation of the applicable  legal framework The Data Ethics Commission wishes to stress that the  existing legal framework must be interpreted and applied  in such a way as to mitigate to the maximum the new  hazards we are facing in connection with the widespread  collection, use and analysis of personal data. Notwithstanding the need to comply with the  requirements of data protection law, data processing  operations are also subject to a number of absolute  limits . Wherever possible, any uses of data that go  beyond these limits should be prevented by interpreting  and applying the law in force6 in a manner consistent  with fundamental rights. In the view of the Data Ethics  Commission, this is relevant, for example, for:
97 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA  ●incursions into personal privacy and integrity  that are  incompatible with fundamental rights and that result  from profiling and/or scoring (e.  g. certain methods of  determining personality traits, emotions or expected  behaviours);  ●total surveillance  that is incompatible with human  dignity, inter alia  through a “comprehensive  surveillance footprint” or “super scoring”;  ●immoral exploitation  of situations of urgent need or  of medical conditions;  ●election manipulation practices  that run counter to  the principle of democracy. The legislation currently in force already categorises  ethically reprehensible attempts to mislead or manipulate  consumers in a commercial context – which should  include business practices aimed at persuading the party  to disclose his or her personal data – as misleading or  aggressive commercial practices  under the [German]  Unfair Competition Act ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren  Wettbewerb , UWG), regardless of whether the provisions  of data protection law have been infringed; any such  attempts will therefore trigger the appropriate legal  consequences (e.  g. rescission on grounds of fraud or  threat, injunctive relief and compensation). The Data  Ethics Commission wishes to cite the following as  potential examples of such practices:  ●addictive designs , i. e. technologies which exert  undue influence on a user (in particular by means  of mechanisms that promote addictive behaviour)  and which are therefore liable to have a substantially  adverse impact on his or her freedom to decide  whether to use them (and stop using them);  ●dark patterns , i. e. technologies (mainly user interfaces)  that are designed in such a way as to deceive a user  about certain facts and/or manipulate him or her into  taking a certain decision (which may have financial  implications). 7 Cf. the instruments referred to in Footnote 6.Absolute limits must also be imposed on data processing  in order to protect individuals against being placed  at an undue financial disadvantage , and the existing  legislation contains various provisions that can be used  to enforce this protection.7 In the view of the Data Ethics  Commission, examples of unfair contract terms and  violations of contractual or pre-contractual duties of a  fiduciary nature include the following:  ●preventing access to data that have been generated by  a device and that are required for normal use of said  device, including for the performance of repairs by  an independent workshop, or making it unreasonably  difficult to access these data (e.  g. access only granted  in accordance with Article 12 GDPR, i.  e. only within  one month or even three months);  ●preventing access to the data needed to operate a   pre-owned  networked device, or making it  unreasonably difficult to access these data (e.  g. for  an individual who has bought a house equipped with  smart home technology);  ●making it harder for individuals to switch provider by  means of  data lock-in  (i. e. refusing to hand over data  analyses for which the user has already paid from an  economic perspective, and which are not protected  trade secrets);  ●processing user generated data by a manufacturer or  another member of the supply chain and for a purpose  that runs completely counter to the user’s economic  interests (e. g. price differentiation with the aim of  extracting the maximum from each individual that he  or she is willing to pay).
98 PART E | D ATA 3.2.3.   The need to clarify and tighten up the applicable  legal framework As things currently stand, a level of protection of legally  protected interests that is in line with constitutional  requirements can be achieved, for many questions  arising in a digital society, only through case-by-case  interpretation of general legal concepts and blanket  clauses by supervisory authorities and courts. The  Data Ethics Commission believes that this situation is  untenable. General legal concepts and blanket clauses  offer the advantage of being flexible and keeping future  options open, yet the authorities and courts often take  years or even decades to develop established case law for  new phenomena (digital phenomena in particular), which  in the meantime results in a structural enforcement  gap with regard to the law in force and in a lack of legal  Social media monitoring Social media monitoring is the systematic oversight   of social media content on a particular topic. It has  evolved into a data utilisation tool that takes  advantage of the fact that social networks not only  expand users’ communication options but also allow  their digital behaviour to be constantly monitored. Companies frequently deploy data generated by social  network users, e.  g. for the purpose of market research  or marketing. Although public-sector bodies have  so far been slower to make use of the opportunities  afforded by social media monitoring, it is by no  means an unheard-of practice; for example, the tax  authorities use web crawlers to trawl through content  that is publicly available on the Internet as a way of  pinpointing business sellers that are not paying VAT. Algorithmic systems can be used to make information  collated from social media monitoring usable and  exploitable  for more far-reaching and intrusive  purposes (in particular the creation of personal  profiles for commercial purposes). Provided that the  weighing up of interests pursuant to Article 6(1)(f)  GDPR supports such a use or exploitation or there  is another legal basis for processing, this may be  entirely consistent with the law. Pursuant to Recital  51 GDPR, the fact that the data subject has disclosed  the data himself or herself does not, in itself, justify  the further use and exploitation of the data. The Data Ethics Commission takes the view that  monitoring activities can, at any rate, be deemed  to have crossed the boundary between lawful and  unlawful when publicly available information is  monitored and the scope of this monitoring could  not have been gauged by the data subject when the  information was disclosed (for example – generally speaking – statements made by minors without due  consideration), or alternatively when the information  is highly sensitive (for example suicidal ideation  statements). Even if applicants for a job have willingly  made data public, these data should not be used  during the recruitment process if they represent too  great an intrusion into personal integrity or if they  are not clearly related to the applicant’s job history  (e. g. statements about his or her sexual orientation).  The same applies to any other systematic evaluation  of data originating from an individual’s private life  (e. g. tracking data). Particularly when the modes of use and exploitation  are more far-reaching and intrusive, a weighing  up of interests may result in limits being placed  on their admissibility (e.  g. businesses that target  advertisements on the basis of sexual orientation or  exploit individuals known to be in an emotionally  vulnerable state). Certain providers (in particular  providers of social networking sites) are technically  capable of carrying out in-depth evaluations of the  communications that are exchanged via the central  platforms they operate; even if general access to the  content is prevented using end-to-end encryption,  metadata provide them with the means to obtain  highly instructive analytical findings. A legislative  ban on the evaluation of communications between  individuals or within closed groups should also be  imposed on private providers in keeping with the  principle of telecommunications secrecy. The Data  Ethics Commission therefore recommends that the  Federal Government should not delay in its efforts  to secure the introduction of such a ban during the  forthcoming negotiations on adoption of the ePrivacy  Regulation. 
99 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA 3.2.3.

Given the extent to which this issue affects  fundamental rights and the uncertainty as to whether  and when solutions will emerge that meet constitutional  requirements, the Data Ethics Commission believes that  prompt action to establish a clear and binding regulatory  framework falls squarely within the remit of the  democratically legitimised legislator. In view of the hazards posed to individuals by  personality-sensitive profiling  (sometimes resulting in  scoring ), the Data Ethics Commission believes that there  is an urgent need to take effective action to tighten up  the current legal framework in this particularly critical  area, in order to effectively counter the risks of individuals  being manipulated or suffering discrimination. Social media monitoring Social media monitoring is the systematic oversight   of social media content on a particular topic. It has  evolved into a data utilisation tool that takes  advantage of the fact that social networks not only  expand users’ communication options but also allow  their digital behaviour to be constantly monitored.

A legislative  ban on the evaluation of communications between  individuals or within closed groups should also be  imposed on private providers in keeping with the  principle of telecommunications secrecy. The Data  Ethics Commission therefore recommends that the  Federal Government should not delay in its efforts  to secure the introduction of such a ban during the  forthcoming negotiations on adoption of the ePrivacy  Regulation.  Profiling “Profiling” is defined in Article 4(4) GDPR  as any  form of automated processing of personal data  consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate  certain personal aspects relating to a natural person,  in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning  that natural person’s performance at work, economic  situation, health, personal preferences, interests,  reliability, behaviour, location or movements. Profiling ultimately involves making deductions   (drawing conclusions) on the basis of input data, in  particular using certain statistical inference methods  (→ Part C, section 2.2.2) . These deductions may relate to the  actual or purported “properties” of an individual (e.  g.  “mental stability”, “reliability”, “social acceptability”)  and/or take the form of predictions if they relate  to an individual’s future behaviour (e.  g. a particular  consumption pattern).In addition to profiling, attempts are frequently made  to assign users to a predefined stereotype category  on  the basis of their observed behaviour when interacting  with digital systems, using “matching algorithms”;  for example, someone who books a holiday might be  classified as a sports fan, a culture enthusiast, a family  man or woman, a keen hiker, a sales representative  or a gourmet. The stereotype that is instantiated for  an individual user is used to store typical preferences,  goals and personality traits, which will be used in  subsequent algorithmic processing operations. Sometimes it is not the profiles themselves that are  stored; instead, ad-hoc deductions (in particular  behavioural predictions) are generated dynamically  and in real time using raw data (e.  g. “is now ready to  purchase shoes”).
100 PART E | D ATA Given that profiling makes it possible to personalise a  wide range of digital products and services to a degree  that many users perceive as convenient and helpful,  a categorical ban on it would overshoot the mark.  However, the Data Ethics Commission recommends that  the Federal Government should speak out – during the  forthcoming evaluation of the GDPR, for example – in  favour of expanding the GDPR to include specific rules  on profiling  that go beyond the existing provisions of  Article 22 GDPR on the permissibility of automated  decision-making; alternatively, the Federal Government  could lobby for a separate EU legislative act that would  effectively counter the risks that profiling poses to the  fundamental rights of individuals. If an adequately  hard-hitting European solution proves unworkable in the  foreseeable future, legislative rules should be put in place  at national level (within the scope of what is permitted  by EU law) to regulate profiling procedures that pose a  potential risk to fundamental rights. The Data Ethics Commission believes that there is a  particularly urgent need for provisions (horizontal and/or  sectoral) on profiling concerning the following matters,  as far as solutions do not already follow from correct  interpretation of the GDPR: a) imposition of absolute limits , i. e. the prohibiting by  law of certain critical applications  (e. g. when selecting  from a pool of job applicants, the use of profiles that  have been generated on the basis of data originating  from their private lives), of profiling procedures that  involve highly sensitive personal data , for example  in connection with emotion detection software and  biometric data, and of data processing operations that  entail an unacceptable potential for harm  to the data  subjects or society; 8 High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence: Policy and Investment Recommendations for Trustworthy AI, 26 June 2019, pp. 14, 40 (available at:  https:/ /ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/policy-and-investment-recommendations-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence ).b) imposition of admissibility requirements  for critical  profiling procedures, including quality requirements  in relation to the meaningfulness and accuracy of the  profiles generated (→ see Part F, section 4.2.1 for further details) ,  and a risk-adequate system of opt-ins and opt-outs  (the latter being appropriate only if the level of risk is  very low); c) clarification of the principle of proportionality , inter  alia as regards the requirements that apply to the  nature and scope of the data used for profiling, the  permitted level of detail in the conclusions drawn for  profiling purposes, and in particular the purposes for  which profiling may admissibly be used; d) imposition of specific labelling, disclosure and  information obligations , inter alia  as regards the  existence and purpose of algorithmic systems that  may be used to carry out ad-hoc deductions , and any  critical deductions that have already been carried out  (instead of providing information only on automated  decisions taken at a later stage in the process); e) provision of feasible options for data subjects to exert  an influence  over the profiles that have been created  about them, including the option to erase/rectify/ verify them; this also includes the right to a “digital  new start” involving the erasure of existing profiles  (e. g. upon reaching the age of majority), as recently  suggested by an EU High-Level Expert Group.8 Voice assistants Voice assistants promise a great deal in terms of  convenience and easier access to digital technologies  (particularly for people with disabilities), yet they also  harbour risks as far as self-determination by data  subjects is concerned. Voice assistants record ambient noise, often without  the user having activated any related function. If these  recordings include speech by the user or third parties,  they are regarded as biometric data  for the purpose of  the GDPR. Speech recordings are analysed in real time  so that a response can be given to spoken commands,  and automated processes often log certain data types  in a log file. The unique timbre of an individual’s  voice and his or her speech patterns can be analysed  as a basis for uniquely identifying  the individual or  deciphering speech emotions . Profiling of this kind  represents a particularly deep and invasive intrusion  into the core area of personality rights, and entails the  risk of further exacerbating the structural imbalances  between the demand and supply side of the market.  Enormous potential for misuse  is also present  given the possibility of recombining or digitally  reconstructing the spoken word (deep fakes). In reality, individual users often have only a vague  idea of how data processing is carried out, and indeed  of whether it is carried out at all. Particularly if a user  is relatively inexperienced in technical matters, he or  she may easily be persuaded to disclose additional  sensitive personal data upon hearing an authentically  human-sounding voice . In many cases, voice  assistants are not limited simply to recording what  is going on in their immediate vicinity, but instead –  when networked with other virtual assistants and  smart home products – act as the control centre and  “technological heart” of modern homes.The Data Ethics Commission believes that the creation  of comprehensive profiles, based on the use of voice  assistants and the integration of a wide range of  software and hardware components, poses a critical  risk. The ease, convenience and apparent benefits  of connecting voice assistants to other devices may  ultimately lead users into a “plug-and-play trap”. In  the view of the Data Ethics Commission, a range of  measures should be taken to mitigate against the risks  associated with voice assistants. These include not  only bans on particularly critical profiling procedures  and applications, but also the following: a) binding technical requirements that implement  the principles of data protection by design and  by default (→ see also section 3.6 below) , especially the  processing of speech files on an exclusively local  basis  (as well as the option to erase these files  locally), and restrictions stating that data may be  forwarded to operators or third parties only in  the form of commands that have already been  translated into machine language (e.  g. an order  that has been placed); b) binding technical requirements that include an  option to switch off  the microphone and Internet  connection and a way of telling (i.  e. a visual  indication ) whether the microphone is on or off   (→ see also section 3.6 below) ; c) transparency obligations  which are designed in  a manner appropriate to the medium (→ see Part F,  section 4.1) , i. e. which ensure that the most important  information is also provided acoustically , either  when a pertinent situation arises or at regular  intervals.
101 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA b) imposition of admissibility requirements  for critical  profiling procedures, including quality requirements  in relation to the meaningfulness and accuracy of the  profiles generated (→ see Part F, section 4.2.1 for further details) ,  and a risk-adequate system of opt-ins and opt-outs  (the latter being appropriate only if the level of risk is  very low); c) clarification of the principle of proportionality , inter  alia as regards the requirements that apply to the  nature and scope of the data used for profiling, the  permitted level of detail in the conclusions drawn for  profiling purposes, and in particular the purposes for  which profiling may admissibly be used; d) imposition of specific labelling, disclosure and  information obligations , inter alia  as regards the  existence and purpose of algorithmic systems that  may be used to carry out ad-hoc deductions , and any  critical deductions that have already been carried out  (instead of providing information only on automated  decisions taken at a later stage in the process); e) provision of feasible options for data subjects to exert  an influence  over the profiles that have been created  about them, including the option to erase/rectify/ verify them; this also includes the right to a “digital  new start” involving the erasure of existing profiles  (e. g. upon reaching the age of majority), as recently  suggested by an EU High-Level Expert Group.8 Voice assistants Voice assistants promise a great deal in terms of  convenience and easier access to digital technologies  (particularly for people with disabilities), yet they also  harbour risks as far as self-determination by data  subjects is concerned.

102 PART E | D ATA In addition to special legislative measures of this kind  aimed at protecting users, the Federal Government  should examine the extent to which it would be possible  to lobby for a new or expanded legislative framework  to ensure appropriate data governance, preferably at  European level but otherwise at national level; this  framework should be entirely separate from the goals  of data protection law (i.  e. outside the scope of the  GDPR). The Data Ethics Commission wishes to issue the  following special recommendations in this connection   (→ see section 3.2.2 above for further examples in each case) : a) blacklisting of data-specific unfair contract terms   (Sections 308 and 309 of the [German] Civil Code  (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , BGB)) and data-specific  contractual and pre-contractual duties of a fiduciary  nature  (Section 241 paragraph 2 of the Civil  Code); b) specification of data-specific torts  under the umbrella  of the existing tort of intentional infliction of harm  contrary to public policy (e.  g. as a new Section 826a  of the Civil Code); c) blacklisting of data-specific misleading and aggressive  commercial practices , such as addictive designs  and dark patterns, by expanding the blacklist that  already exists in the [German] Unfair Competition  Act ( Gesetz gegen den unlauteren Wettbewerb , UWG);  the full harmonisation approach of the EU’s Unfair  Commercial Practices Directive means that this change  would need to be initiated at EU level, however.When profiling is carried out by government agencies ,  the potential for cumulative infringements of  fundamental rights or for aggregated surveillance must  be taken into account, as must potential side effects or  “collateral damage”. The Data Ethics Commission believes  that there is particular potential for abuse if individual  subsystems are connected, resulting in the pooling of  data and analytical findings from very different areas  and sectors, which significantly steps up the intensity of  surveillance. Intelligent pattern recognition techniques  (in particular facial recognition) make it easier to link  up personal information across a variety of surveillance  systems and to merge profiles; in view of this fact, the  Data Ethics Commission recommends firstly that pattern  recognition techniques of this kind should come into play  only when their use is an absolutely vital prerequisite   for the fulfilment of state obligations, and secondly that  clear legal limits  – beyond the separation rule concerning  intelligence activities – must be imposed on the exchange  of information  and patterns between authorities. This  may also encompass new legal provisions banning  particular types of use and exploitation, particularly as  regards the sharing of data between government agencies  engaged in preventive and repressive measures.
103 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA 3.2.4  Uniform market-related supervisory activities The task of supervising compliance with data protection  law by players in the German economy is shared  between federal and Land  authorities. Discrepancies  can be observed in terms of the interpretation of data  protection law and in the approach to enforcement;  this raises certain challenges for the parties affected.  Although the European Data Protection Board (EDPB)  has been introduced by the EU Member States with  the aim of ensuring uniform application of the GDPR,  and this institution also has the power to adopt binding  decisions in individual cases, the coexistence of different  data protection authorities in the various German Länder   within the framework of the federal system has, to  date, prevented the emergence of any such binding and  uniform approach  at national level. In the event that it proves impossible to strengthen  and formalise cooperation between the German data  protection authorities, thereby safeguarding the uniform  and consistent application of data protection law,  consideration should be given to the establishment of  a new data protection authority  at federal level for  market-related data activities. Concentrating supervisory  powers within a single body would make it possible  to build up the specialist expertise required to enforce  data protection law in an environment characterised by  highly dynamic technological developments. The single  authority – either acting alone or in close cooperation  with other authorities – would also need to be able to  safeguard the enforcement of other data-related areas  of law  that have close functional ties to data protection  legislation (e.  g. general private law and unfair commercial  practices law). The establishment of a single body able  to wield market supervisory powers in the field of data  protection might also make Germany’s voice louder  within the European Data Protection Board, since all of  the Member States are already represented on the EDPB  by a data protection authority with national jurisdiction.  Finally, the centralisation of official competencies should  go hand in hand with the designation of a single court  responsible for judicial control over market-related  supervisory authorities in the field of data protection, so  that this court can also build up the relevant expertise  and set forth a consistent body of case law.Various models  are conceivable from the perspective  of organisational law. Based on its powers to regulate  economic law, the Federal Government could transfer  supervisory competences for data protection in  the economy (i.  e. the private sector) to the Federal  Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of  Information, and provide the latter with the relevant  resources. By setting up a number of different satellite  offices, the Commissioner could ensure the nation-wide  presence of data protection bodies, similar to the Federal  Office for Migration and Refugees or the Bundesbank.  Alternatively, the Länder  could establish a joint facility  on the basis of an interstate treaty, by way of analogy to  similar projects in the broadcasting sector, for example, or  the Central Offices of the Länder  for Safety Engineering  and Health Protection. The joint facility responsible  for supervisory activities in the field of data protection  would need to be an independent body, and this principle  should be enshrined in the interstate treaty. Irrespective  of the decisions taken in this connection, the authorities  should be provided with better human and material  resources  to allow them to “punch at their weight”. For reasons of constitutional law, the data protection  authorities at Land  level  should retain jurisdiction for  the public sector .
104 PART E | D ATA 3.3 Personal data as an asset 3.3.1  Commercialisation of personal data The economic significance of personal data is hard to  overestimate. It is generally acknowledged that the  protection of personality rights as fundamental rights  also encompasses the individual’s right to decide  whether certain aspects of his or her personality  should  be made available for a fee  (e. g. the right to one’s  own image), or in other words whether they should be  exploited for economic purposes.9 In the same way that  there is not a complete ban on the exploitation of data  by individuals, however, there are no rules categorically  stating that personal data may not be exploited for  economic purposes on the initiative of third parties.  Some people compare the situation to the trade in  human organs, but this comparison is flawed in several  respects: unlike human organs, data are a non-rivalrous  resource, and so the mere fact that personal data are  processed by someone else does not in and of itself  necessarily cause harm to the data subject – harm is  caused only by the processing of data in specific contexts  or for specific purposes. Interpreting the right to informational self-determination  as a natural corollary of human dignity makes it clear  that the limits  imposed on the economic exploitation  of personal data should generally coincide with the  general limits placed on the processing of personal data  (→ see sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 above) , including the substantive  limitations on consent. Against this backdrop, the  economic exploitation of personal data is neither subject  to more stringent rules in general, nor privileged in any  way. Economic aspects frequently come into play when  general data protection rules are applied, however (for  example, consent may no longer be freely given if the  data subject is exposed to economic pressure). 9 See e.  g. Section 22 of the [German] Act on the Protection of Copyright in Works of Art and Photographs ( Gesetz betreffend das Urheberrecht an  Werken der bildenden Künste und der Photographie , KunstUrhG). 10 By way of examples: European Commission: Building a European data economy, 10 January 2017, COM(2017) 9 final (available at: https:/ /ec.europa. eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2017/EN/COM-2017-9-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF ); Arbeitsgruppe “Digitaler Neustart” der Konferenz der  Justizministerinnen und Justizminister der Länder [Working Group “Digital New Start” of the Conference of Ministers of Justice of the Länder]: Report  of 15 May 2017, pp. 29 et seqq. (available at: https:/ /www.justiz.nrw.de/JM/schwerpunkte/digitaler_neustart/zt_bericht_arbeitsgruppe/bericht_ag_dig_ neustart.pdf ).3.3.2.   Data ownership and the issue of financial  compensation As things stand, the Data Ethics Commission does not  believe that there are adequate grounds  for introducing  additional ownership-like rights of exploitation that  would allow data subjects to request an economic share  in the profits derived with the help of data (often referred  to under the concepts of “ data ownership ” or “data  producer right”).10 Both data protection law and general  private law already provide the individual with a range of  legal rights that are effective vis-à-vis third parties, and  on the basis of these rights individuals could theoretically  make their toleration of data activities dependent on  payment of an appropriate fee. If the individual fails  to negotiate a fee of this kind, this can be attributed to  circumstances (e.  g. lack of negotiating power and/or  poorly functioning competition) that have nothing to do  with the absence of any additional ownership-like right  of exploitation. In theory, the imbalance in negotiating power could be  counter-balanced through the introduction of collective  societies  that collectively exercise ownership-like rights  to exploit data. Extending the concept of personal data  to include an ownership-like economic component  would, however, potentially be at odds with data  protection , in particular as regards the voluntary nature  of consent, the ability to withdraw consent at any time  and the right to request erasure. It would also create  questionable financial incentives  by encouraging the  generation of a maximum of personal data, and would  put pressure on individuals (in particular on vulnerable  groups such as minors and low earners) to disclose as  much data as possible. If industry passes the costs of  any such remuneration on to the customers, privacyconscious individuals  might also be forced to shoulder  a comparatively greater burden  in financial terms.
105 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA The above arguments do not hold water to the same  extent when it comes to anonymised data. However, given  the huge number of individuals that contribute to the  generation and processing of data, the level of complexity   of a fair remuneration system and the 24/7 monitoring  that would be required to measure data flows would be  out of all proportion to any potential gains in terms of  justice. Data quality  might also be negatively affected,  since incentives would be created to generate data  “artificially” (e.  g. through the creation of fake profiles),  ultimately producing a distorted picture of reality. The  Data Ethics Commission therefore counsels against  introducing rights of exploitation  designed as exclusive  rights, either for anonymised data or for other data types . 3.3.3.  Data as counter-performance A large number of digital content and service types  (e. g. search engines, social networks, messenger  services, online games) are offered to end users for no  monetary consideration. They are financed in other  ways, in particular through payments received from  third parties in exchange for personalised advertising  and other personalised information services targeted  at users, or for user profiles and user scores. Personal  data are therefore often referred to in shorthand  terms as “counter-performance” for digital content or  services, for example in the original draft of Article 3(1)  of the Digital Content Directive (although the term was  removed at a later point in the legislative procedure).11  The extent to which the economic model described  above is, in fact, compatible with the prohibition under  Article 7(4) GDPR of “tying” or “bundling” consent  with the provision of a service12 must ultimately be  clarified by the European Court of Justice. 11 European Commission: Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of  digital content, 9 December 2015, COM(2015) 634 final (available at: https:/ /ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2015/EN/1-2015-634-EN-F1-1.PDF ). 12 European Data Protection Supervisor: Opinion 4/2017 on the Proposal for a Directive on certain aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital  content, 14 March 2017, p. 15 (available at: https:/ /edps.europa.eu/sites/edp/files/publication/17-03-14_opinion_digital_content_en.pdf ).The Data Ethics Commission argues that data should  not be referred to as “counter-performance” provided  in exchange for a service , even though the term sums up  the issue in a nutshell and has helped to raise awareness  among the general public. Firstly, personal data form  an integral part of an individual’s personality, and are  protected under constitutional law. Secondly, their  classification as a counter-performance might have  unintended consequences. For example, it might be  abused as an argument in favour of largely excluding  data-related standard contract terms from unfairness  control, or as a justification for triggering contractual  sanctions against consumers who withdraw consent or  exercise their right to erasure, etc. In this connection, the German legislator should not –  when implementing Directive (EU) 2019/770 on certain  aspects concerning contracts for the supply of digital  content and digital services – use the leeway available  to Member States in any way that might prevent the  individual from seeking legal remedies under data  protection law. In particular, if an individual withdraws  his or her consent to the processing of data, the provider  may have a right to terminate provision of its service with  immediate effect; however, it should not be possible for  the provider to request payment for services already  provided , and there should be no retrospective and  automatic reversion to a pay option . Pay options  are increasingly being discussed as a way of  avoiding the “tying” or “bundling” of consent with the  provision of a service. yet even the smallest of financial  burdens represents a disadvantage, in particular for  vulnerable population groups, and may dissuade data  subjects and encourage them to disclose excessive  amounts of personal data. It is also to be feared that the  financial burden on privacy-conscious individuals would be  disproportionate. Commercial users  that have previously  been able to use certain digital content or services for free  (e. g. a company’s page on a social networking site) should  therefore be the preferred source of funding .
106 PART E | D ATA Pay options may, however, increase consumer awareness  of the financial value of their own data, and also  create transparency. For these reasons, the Data Ethics  Commission believes that offering pay options as an  alternative  may be an ethically acceptable way to ensure  that consent given by users is genuinely free. At the  same time, however, the price must not be abusive and  exceed market prices; from the consumer’s perspective,  it must represent a realistic alternative to the disclosure  of personal data. From an ethical viewpoint safeguards  must be put in place to protect privacy-conscious users  from having to “cross-subsidise” other users; equally, the  needs of socially vulnerable groups must be taken into  consideration, for example through government transfers.  3.3.4   Data as the basis for personalised risk assessments Price-related predictions obtained using algorithmic  systems for the purpose of personalised risk assessment   (e. g. on a one-off basis when approving a loan or on an  ongoing basis in the case of black box schemes operated  by insurance companies) are characterised by a higher  level of granularity. This is ultimately a sector-specific  use case for a certain profiling technique and the  associated scoring procedures (→ see section 3.2.3 above and  Part F, section 4.2.2 below for further details of profiling in general) . The  processing of additional personal data for the purpose of  personalised risk assessments regularly requires consent  from the data subjects. Individuals who hope to gain  economic advantages as a result are particularly likely to  grant such consent, yet the granting of consent by one  individual may have significant impacts on others, and  give rise to chain reactions that are problematic from an  ethical viewpoint (unravelling effects). This may put data  subjects under disproportionate pressure, and jeopardise  the voluntary nature of consent.Example 11   Insured parties who are healthy are particularly  likely to consent to the processing of their data by a  health insurance company. As a result, others come  under pressure to also grant consent in order to avoid  arousing any suspicions regarding their state of health.  In cases where individual behaviour can influence the  parameters, models of this kind can also have a significant  influence on how people lead their lives . Another  ethical consideration that is particularly relevant in the  insurance sector is that the goal of increasingly granular  risk assessments runs counter to the basic principle of  collective risk sharing  by the community of all insured  persons. Taken to its extreme (i.  e. if the insurer has access  to “comprehensive” information and adjusts the price to  the individual risk), the whole concept of insurance would  be reduced to absurdity. The Data Ethics Commission therefore believes that  personalised risk assessments must comply with the  following ethical requirements in particular: a) data processing must not intrude into the core of an  individual’s private life ; it must be restricted to areas  where the individual is already in contact with the  exterior world and must therefore expect conclusions  to be drawn on the basis of his or her behaviour. This  principle dictates that it would be ethically acceptable  for a car insurance company (for example) to record  the miles driven or traffic offences committed by a  driver, but not purely private behaviour inside his or  her vehicle, even if this behaviour might be relevant  from a risk perspective (e.  g. how often he or she  yawns, whether he or she chats to passengers), or  even the driver’s state of health (e.  g. heart problems)  or other lifestyle factors (e.  g. purchasing behaviour in  relation to coffee or alcohol); b) a clear causal relationship  must exist between the  data being processed and the risk to be determined,  and any linking of data must avoid discriminatory   repercussions (→ see Part F, section 2.6 below for further details) ;
107 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA c) the data must not allow conclusions to be drawn  directly that have implications for relatives or other  third parties ; d) full transparency  is required as regards the specific  parameters and their weighting, and the impacts on  pricing or other conditions; the individual must also be  provided with clear and comprehensible explanations  of how to improve these conditions (→ see Part F,  section 2.7) ; e) in order to keep unwanted chain reactions in check,  the difference between the “optimal” conditions and  the conditions that apply if consent is refused must  not exceed a certain ceiling (e.  g. maximum price  difference ). 3.3.5  Data as reputational capital When coupled with personalised economic conditions  (personalised prices, personalised ranking and  personalised products and services), personal data,  profiles and scores serve as reputational capital.  Personalised behavioural rewards aimed at increasing  customer loyalty  (e. g. the granting of discounts  depending on the quantity purchased in the previous  month) incentivise consumers to consent to the  processing of their personal data, and may be apt to  influence the way they lead their lives. No evidence  that the ethical limits outlined above (→ section 3.3.4)  are  currently being disregarded in the German economy in  connection with customer loyalty programmes has come  to the attention of the Data Ethics Commission, but  developments should continue to be monitored. 13 Cf. Article 9 of this Regulation on data access and many general provisions, e.  g. on general terms and conditions of business and ranking.In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, most of the  problems arising in connection with price differentiation  in the narrow sense  and measures of a similar ilk relate to  the regulation of algorithmic systems (→ see Part F for further  details) . At the same time, however, price differentiation  morphs into a data use problem as soon as consumers are  led to believe that they can access prices that are lower  overall by disclosing as much personal data as possible or  by exhibiting certain behaviours tailored to the relevant  criteria (e.  g. making online purchases using a computer  manufactured by a certain company), or conversely if it is  suggested that consumers who refuse to consent to the  processing of their data for the purpose of personalised  pricing will always pay higher prices on average . The Data  Ethics Commission believes that the latter would also  pose an ethically questionable risk to the voluntary nature  of consent. True reputational data  that are also visible to external  third parties (e.  g. “stars” indicating that someone with  a profile on an online platform is a good person to do  business with) are gaining ever more economic and nonmaterial significance. To a certain extent, reputational  data of this kind are covered by the new Regulation (EU)  2019/1150 on promoting fairness and transparency   for business users of online intermediation services.13  The regulatory approach chosen by the lawmakers who  drafted this Regulation – based for the most part on  transparency requirements and self-regulation – was  cautious, and the Data Ethics Commission welcomes  this approach in principle. However, it is worth noting  that certain sectors are heavily dependent on true  reputational data, and that this factor in particular might  lead to significant lock-in effects that may jeopardise  competition and cause problems if individuals are unable  to take their data with them when switching to a different  online intermediary platform.
108 PART E | D ATA Example 12   A micro entrepreneur who offers taxi services via an  online platform has been ranked highly by many of his  former passengers, and now wishes to switch platform  and take these rankings with him. The Data Ethics Commission is aware of the problems  that would arise if a general obligation to recognise  ranking profiles built up on a different platform were  to be enshrined in law. However, it recommends that  the Federal Government should examine the conditions  under which commercial users with profiles of this kind  might nevertheless be granted a right to portability ,  with a view to lobbying for broader regulation at  European level.14 By way of contrast, the rise in significance of social  reputation data  (number of “likes”, “followers” or  “friends”) is part of a wider trend in our society, and –  with the limited exception of “influencers” – can no  longer be viewed predominantly through the lens of  personal data as an economic asset, but must instead be  discussed in relation to its systemic societal implications. 3.3.6  Data as tradeable items A significant number of companies are already deriving  financial gain (and, in some cases, earning a great deal of  money) by compiling personal data, profiles and scores  or personalised statistical evaluations (carried out using  aggregated raw data) and then reselling them to third  parties, or by enriching existing profiles with estimated  data and then placing them on the market. In the  following section, business models of this kind will be  referred to as “data trading” . 14 Cf. for example Articles 6 and 7 of the draft “Model Rules on Online Intermediary Platforms” by the European Law Institute, which were made  available to the Data Ethics Commission.The GDPR does not currently contain any provisions  relating specifically to data trading; instead, business  models of this kind are categorised merely as normal  data processing operations that are subject to the  general provisions of the GDPR. In many cases, closer  examination of the applicable provisions leads to  the inescapable conclusion that certain types of data  trading infringe the provisions of the GDPR, and are  therefore contrary to the law. Generally speaking,  however, the field of data trading is characterised  by a significant enforcement gap . The Data Ethics  Commission therefore believes that urgent action should  be taken by the data protection authorities in relation  to this sector, and that the European Data Protection  Board (EDPB), or alternatively the Conference of  Independent Data Protection Authorities of the Federal  Government and the Länder (Konferenz der unabhängigen  Datenschutzaufsichtsbehörden des Bundes und der  Länder) , should develop – in keeping with the GDPR’s  risk-based approach – clearly delimitable categories for  different types of lawful data trading. Greater clarity is  needed regarding the instances of data trading where  the data subject must grant consent to the forwarding  of data, the instances where the data subject has a  right only to object to the processing of data, and the  instances where compelling reasons rule out even the  right to object. Having regard to the general principles governing data  processing (Article 5 GDPR), the forwarding of data to  third parties should be permitted only within closely  prescribed limits in situations that are not covered by the  existing provisions of data protection law. The Data Ethics  Commission therefore recommends that the Federal  Government should speak out at European level – in  connection with the forthcoming evaluation of the GDPR,  for example – in favour of expanding the scope of the  GDPR to include specific provisions on data trading .  The following ethical considerations , some of which  are already enshrined in the GDPR, should be taken into  account when drafting future legal provisions of this kind:
109 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA a) The individual’s right to informational selfdetermination should be the starting point for any  balancing exercise, meaning that data trading in  principle requires prior consent  by the data subject,  with due regard for the substantive limitations  on  consent (→ sections 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 above) . b) If data are processed on a legal basis other than  consent (which is likely to occur only in isolated  cases), the individual must have a straightforward  opportunity to exercise his or her right to object  in  advance (e.  g. by unchecking a checkbox immediately  before the data are collected), and must not be  forced to communicate his or her objection via  separate communication channels. c) Data trading models that deprive data subjects of any  choices  whatsoever should only rarely be considered,  and only if and to the extent that the data need to  be forwarded in order to further public interests that  manifestly outweigh the countervailing interests.  Comprehensive legislative clarification of this category  is required. d) The GDPR contains detailed provisions on the transfer  of data to processors and on the forwarding of data  to third countries. Given the content and rationale  of the GDPR, it would be illogical to assume that the  requirements that apply to transfers of data to third  parties within the EU should be any less stringent  than those that apply to transfers outside the EU,  and certain other points can also be inferred from the  general provisions, e.  g. that these requirements should  be regarded as “appropriate safeguards”. Nevertheless,  the Data Ethics Commission recommends that urgent  action be taken to clarify (explicitly and by law) the  obligations that apply when transferring data to  third parties, e.  g. control obligations, as well as the  circumstances under which parties may be held liable.e) Controllers should be obliged to document and  disclose the specific source of the data they have  collected or generated by the use of algorithmic  systems, as well as the identity of the individual  recipients of the data; the information must be  provided in a standardised and machine-readable  format, which allows e.  g. automated data  management using a privacy management tool/ personal information management system (→ see  section 4.3 below for further details) . This would take due  account of the fact that data subjects  have largely  been left in the dark  as regards the existence of data  traders, which means that a simple list of the different  categories of sources or recipients would be of little  use to them. f) Given the large number of data traders in the market,  data subjects will be able to exercise their rights  effectively  only if central mechanisms are established  that facilitate this process or assume responsibility for  it (e.  g. data protection authorities, → see section 3.2.4 above,  or privacy management tools/personal information management  systems, see section 4.3 for further details ). g) Given that dispersion effects give rise to higher risks  and the potential for loss of control, data traders  should be subject to a certification obligation under  data protection law  that includes regular audits by  the certification bodies. The Data Ethics Commission  recommends that specific certification criteria should  be adopted as appropriate by the independent data  protection authorities of the Federal Government  and the Länder , and that these criteria should take  due account of the risks and recommendations it  has outlined.
110 PART E | D ATA 3.4 Data and digital inheritance Modern communication technologies and data  processing capacities make it possible to record every last  detail of an individual’s private activities for decades on  end, and to evaluate these recordings using automated  systems. Handing the data collected about a deceased  individual over to his or her heirs or another third party  adds a whole new dimension of privacy risk , both for  the deceased person and, in particular, for the individuals  with whom he or she communicated during his or her  lifetime. These data are often compared to diaries and  personal correspondence, but this comparison is flawed  because many channels of digital communication  (messenger services, chats, e-mails, etc.) serve as a  functional replacement for the ephemeral spoken word  rather than for letters. 3.4.1  Precedence of living wills The Data Ethics Commission believes that, in the bestcase scenario, a data subject should make intentional  and informed dispositions during his or her lifetime. In  many cases, however, people neglect to make any such  dispositions for the sole reason that they are unaware  of the legal and practical options or put off by the level  of uncertainty. Against this backdrop, the Data Ethics  Commission believes that there are justified grounds for  obliging service providers  to alert users to the option of  making dispositions that provide for ongoing incapacity  to provide consent (e.  g. due to dementia) or for death,  and to provide the technical means for making said  dispositions, with the minimum of barriers (i.  e. with the  fewest possible changes of medium). Corresponding  provisions could be added to the [German] Telemedia Act  (Telemediengesetz , TMG) .15 15 For a previous discussion of this topic, see Mario Martini, Juristenzeitung (JZ), 2012, p. 1154.In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, the situation  following a data subject’s death is merely an extreme  example that should serve as a prompt for further  reflection on the general design of digital modes of  communication. The Data Ethics Commission therefore  recommends that the Federal Government should  examine the possibility of making it obligatory for  messenger services to offer a default option of erasing  messages  after a certain period of time; if a user chose  this option, a message would automatically be erased  after expiry of the relevant period unless it had been  manually archived by the recipient or the sender. 3.4.2  The role of intermediaries Growing awareness of the topic of digital inheritance  has allowed new business models to flourish, and a  large number of companies are now offering services in  this field (ranging from the central storage of account  data and passwords through to comprehensive digital  inheritance management). These services may provide  useful guidance, but they are also associated with certain  hazards, including inadequate provision for cases in which  a company goes bankrupt or is otherwise liquidated, and  shortcomings in information security (up to and including  genuine fraud). The Data Ethics Commission believes that  quality assurance , new regulations  (characterised by a  cautious approach) and public awareness-raising  about  the potential advantages and risks are required in order to  protect citizens.
111 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA In addition, it recommends that the Federal Government,  as part of its remit to provide services of general interest  to the public, should set up a body that is (at the very  least) subject to state supervision  and that provides  affordable basic digital inheritance protection and  planning services to citizens; these services must reflect  the latest developments in the field of information  security technology. When a German citizen writes a will,  he or she can choose to store it privately or with a notary  or district court, and similar options (private or privatesector solutions or a government-run service) should also  be available for an individual’s digital inheritance. 3.4.3  Post-mortem data protection The Data Ethics Commission does not recommend a  wholesale rejection of the principles set forth by the  German Federal Court of Justice16 regarding the transfer  of estates to heirs , since the potential advantages would  be far outweighed by the effects (either undesirable and/ or excessive) of a different default solution, e.  g. a trust  model imposed by law or a distinction between user  account content that is regarded as an asset and content  from the same user account that is regarded as highly  personal. Conversely, inheritance law should not apply at  all if the nature of a user account (e.  g. an online account  with an Alcoholics Anonymous group) renders all of the  data within it financially worthless but highly sensitive.  In cases where the principle of telecommunications  confidentiality  applies, inter alia  to protect the  deceased’s communication partners, the legislator will,  in any case, still have to reconcile this with the right to  inheritance (which is enshrined as a fundamental right),  for example through a corresponding reference in the  part of the Civil Code devoted to inheritance law. 16 Judgment by the German Federal Court of Justice of 12 July 2018, ref. III ZR 183/17.The principle set forth by the Federal Court of Justice –  that an estate should be transferred to the deceased’s  heirs – is linked to the existence of a contractual  relationship. If there is no contractual relationship, or if a  transfer to the heirs cannot take place owing to the highly  sensitive nature of the data, the heirs will have no right  of legal recourse. Since post-mortem data protection   is not provided by the GDPR, there are also no means  of legal recourse for relatives under the current state  of data protection law. Ethical concerns are raised by  the fact that controllers have almost unlimited power  to dispose of a deceased’s personal data as a result, and  the Data Ethics Commission therefore recommends that  the Federal Government should follow in the footsteps  of several other EU Member States and make use of the  option provided by Recital 27 of the GDPR, by enacting  provisions on post-mortem data protection . Even after  the death of a data subject, the latter’s relatives should be  able to exercise his or her fundamental rights, such as the  right to erasure and the right to rectification of incorrect  data. At the same time, suitable measures should be  taken to ensure compliance with dispositions made by  the deceased during his or her lifetime, even if these  dispositions are only implied (e.  g. through a deliberate  choice to publish a “life story”).
112 PART E | D ATA 3.5 Special groups of data subjects 3.5.1  Employees The fact that employers collect employees’ location  data and performance data, which is a widespread  phenomenon in certain modern workplaces, poses  a significant risk to these employees’ right to  informational self-determination and general rights of  personality ; the same is true of the creation of biometric  profiles which is a necessary precursor to certain forms  of collaboration. Questions to be considered include  not only the legal basis for data processing and for  the granting of co-determination rights to employee  representation bodies, but also obligations to provide  employees with information (e.  g. on the hazards posed  by multi-sensor fusion) and, depending on the context,  with opportunities to object, issues regarding data  retention procedures, terms of data retention and the  extent to which employees’ data may be disclosed to  third parties, the right to rectification of incorrect or  obsolete data (in personal profiles, for example) and  appropriate erasure procedures. Further points for  consideration include framework conditions for (limited)  control and surveillance of employees, restrictions  on the tracking of employees’ locations and a ban on  comprehensive location profiles, restrictions on any  obligation to share social media accounts or to allow an  employer to access data in the context of “bring your  own device” models, framework conditions for the use  of biometric systems, and restrictions on psychological  investigation methods.The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should invite the social partners  to work towards a common position on the legislative  provisions that should be adopted with a view to stepping  up the protection of employee data , based on examples  of best practices from existing collective agreements.  The concerns of individuals in non-standard forms of  employment should also be taken into account during  this process, and collective agreements and works council  agreements should continue to play a significant part in  employee data protection. yet the foundational principles  of employee data protection should not be regulated  solely by collective agreements and works council  agreements, firstly because not all employees are covered  by these latter, and secondly because of the importance  of these principles from a fundamental rights perspective.  It is also worth noting that the legal uncertainty currently  reigning over the scope of the GDPR provisions is having a  negative impact on investment security. With reference to the wider field of legal bases for  the processing of employee data, the Data Ethics  Commission believes that the traditional construct of  consent  under data protection law is not suitable in all  contexts, since it is difficult to put in place the framework  conditions necessary for consent to be given voluntarily  in all employment situations, and impossible to find an  appropriate balance in all cases between the employer’s  needs and the option for employees to revoke consent  and request the erasure of data at any time. Employee  data protection measures should therefore focus on legal  grounds of justification  that are specifically tailored to  the employment context, and that guarantee a high level  of protection and an appropriate weighing up of interests  against fundamental rights. The outcomes may look very  similar to consent in certain respects, while taking into  account the power structures that typically exist in an  employment context.
113 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA When deciding whether interest groups should be  granted co-determination rights17 in relation to the  processing of data within companies, due regard must be  given to the asymmetry of knowledge  that exists between  employers and employees as regards the operating  principles and details of these data processing operations.  There is a need for models that go further than the  existing mechanisms by allowing interest groups to access  external expertise, while at the same time ensuring not  only the appropriate involvement of the company data  protection officer, but also the protection of trade secrets.  Given the constant advancement of data-processing  systems within companies (software updates, self-learning  elements, etc.), there should be a shift away from consent  as a single, one-off event and towards ongoing oversight  of processes  by interest groups. Progress in the field of employee data protection should  not neglect the stages of applying  for a job and entering  into an employment relationship . For example, care must  be taken to ensure that the provisions of applicable law  that prohibit employers from asking certain questions  during the application procedure or when recruiting an  individual (e.  g. asking whether a woman is pregnant) are  not circumvented through the use of “human resources”  algorithms or through a request to grant the employer  access to social media accounts. 17 For examples of current legislative provisions, see e.  g. Section 87 (1) (6) of the [German] Works Constitution Act ( Betriebsverfassungsgesetz , BetrVG)  (in relation to works councils), or Section 75 (3) (17) of the [German] Federal Staff Representation Act ( Bundespersonalvertretungsgesetz , BPersVG) (in  relation to staff councils). 18 German Ethics Council ( Deutscher Ethikrat ), Big Data and Health, Opinion, 30 November 2017 (available at: https:/ /www.ethikrat.org/fileadmin/ Publikationen/Stellungnahmen/englisch/opinion-big-data-and-health-summary.pdf ).Steps must also be taken to ensure that persons in nonstandard forms of employment  are not excluded from  progress in the field of employee data protection. The  upsurge in these forms of employment in the platform  economy means that many people no longer have  access to the traditional employee rights and rights of  co-determination. The imbalance of power that arises  between the client or the platform operator on the one  hand and the contractors or the platform workers on  the other is often significant and may have implications  in terms of data protection and informational selfdetermination. Appropriate legislative provisions should  be adopted (ideally at EU level) and the institutional  framework developed further (e.  g. through an interest  group) to mitigate against this risk. 3.5.2  Patients In view of the benefits that could be gained from  digitalising healthcare , as a basic principle the Data  Ethics Commission recommends swift expansion of  digital infrastructures  in this sector and the introduction  of procedures for reviewing and assessing digital  healthcare services . Both the range and the quality of  digitalised healthcare services should be improved to  allow patients to exercise their rights to informational  self-determination and become more health literate.18 Even as things stand today, the provision of healthcare  services involves the processing of huge volumes of  personal data. The data involved are typically health data  and genetic data, or in other words special categories of  personal data within the meaning of Article 9 GDPR. When  designing a future health landscape that will be primarily  digital in nature, comprehensive account must be taken of  the need to provide special protection for these data  at  the same time as boosting the right to self-determination   of patients and those with health insurance policies, inter  alia in the field of research (→ see section 4.1 below) .
114 PART E | D ATA In this connection, the Data Ethics Commission  emphasises the urgent need to introduce and roll out an  electronic health record  with a view to improving the  quality, transparency and cost-effectiveness of medical  care.19 Given the vital role that an electronic health  record would play in digitalising the healthcare sector,  the Data Ethics Commission wishes to make it clear that  greater attention should be paid to both information  security and patient autonomy while implementing this  system; the existing cryptosecurity concept (based on  the decentralised management of keys (PINs) for insured  parties) should continue to apply, for example. It should  also be possible to use the electronic health record even  if a patient is incapable of granting consent, based on the  provisions concerning legal representation that otherwise  apply and regardless of the type of health insurance policy  held by the patient. Digital health services and products that are not  collectively financed (consumer-funded health market)   are becoming ever more important, not least because the  digital healthcare services offered by the statutory health  insurance funds have been few and far between to date.  It is important not to underestimate the relevance of  these services – which include not only fitness, health and  wellness apps, but in particular digital self-monitoring  apps and the associated wearables – in the context of a  digitalised healthcare sector. yet these apps are often of  questionable (and poorly verified) quality, meaning that the  data they collect are of limited usefulness; this carries a  risk to the health of the affected patients and users, which  can, in some cases, be significant. It should furthermore  not be assumed that patients are able to assess the quality  of these products and services independently, in particular  their compliance with the principles of data protection  and information security; equally, access to digital  healthcare services should not be dependent on individual  financial wherewithal. With this in mind, the Data  Ethics Commission welcomes the plans for the Federal  Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut  für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte)  to introduce a  procedure for examining and assessing apps of this kind. 19 See in this respect the Data Ethics Commission’s previous recommendation on participatory development of an electronic health record,  dated 28 November 2018 (available at: www.datenethikkommission.de ).3.5.3  Minors  The Data Ethics Commission welcomes the efforts which  have been undertaken – and which include both the  adoption of legislation and voluntary self-regulation – to  develop special protective mechanisms  allowing minors  to exercise their right to digital self-determination. The  primary goal of these mechanisms should be to step up  the level of data protection and the degree of protection  against profiling, manipulation through dark patterns and  addictive designs, etc.; their secondary goal should be  to provide greater protection against content that is not  age-appropriate (that glorifies violence, for example). At the same time, however, the Data Ethics Commission  wishes to make it clear that all such protective  mechanisms will prove futile unless a reliable identity  management system  is in place, ensuring that the  age of minors is detected and that they are treated  appropriately. Relying on users to be honest about  their age is without question the wrong approach.  When viewed through the lens of ethics, however, it  would also be problematic to ask providers to ascertain  a user’s age themselves by collecting personal data,  some of which may be highly sensitive (e.  g. facial  recognition, with data transferred to the provider’s  cloud); at the same time, placing the entire burden  on whoever holds parental authority may easily result  in a situation where the latter feels that too much is  being asked of him or her. The Data Ethics Commission  therefore recommends that the Federal Government  should promote the emergence of family-friendly  technologies  that allow minors to exercise their right to  self-determined development while, at the same time,  reliably guaranteeing their protection.
115 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should lobby at European level for  measures to enforce compliance with the principles of  data protection by design and by default  as enshrined  in the GDPR, particularly in the case of mobile end  devices, in order to protect the right to informational  self-determination of minors and protect their privacy.  The German and European data protection authorities,  the competition authorities, the media regulators and the  technical regulatory authorities should take action within  their relevant remits and spheres of responsibility to force  the manufacturers of operating systems for mobile end  devices and the providers of digital services to adhere  to all of the legislative requirements that apply to the  age groups in question and to block services that are not  age-appropriate. The parties responsible for procuring  relevant systems with a view to their use in schools and  kindergartens should also incorporate these requirements  into the tendering procedures. A more detailed discussion  of the need to force manufacturers to comply with the  principle of data protection by design and by default can  be found below (→ section 3.6.1) . As far as further action in this area is concerned,  consideration should also be given to the introduction  of an EU-wide obligation that forces manufacturers of  child-friendly mobile end devices to program them from  the outset as devices that are specifically intended for  children, and to ensure that “jail breaking” or “rooting”  is impossible (or possible only with a key). The devices  programmed in this way should enforce compliance  with all of the legislative provisions aimed at protecting  children, and block services that are not age-appropriate.  If the relevant settings are enabled  on the device/ operating system upon activation, minors should not  be able to change these settings without their parents’  consent. A solution of this kind would also offer clear  advantages over parental control apps, firstly because  these apps often pose data protection and information  security problems in their own right, and secondly  because they raise ethical questions in terms of the  opportunities they afford for the total surveillance of  private life.3.5.4  Other vulnerable and care-dependent persons  In many cases, data belonging to vulnerable individuals  are processed for the benefit of these individuals, e.  g. in  the care sector. Digital technologies can make it much  safer for older people to remain in the environment to  which they are accustomed, for example, and they may  also help to alleviate some of the negative impacts of  the skills shortage in the care sector and ensure better  healthcare provision. In particular, digital assistance  systems  – when used correctly – can serve as a bridging  technology, and adjust adaptively to the varying needs of  different people. The right to life, the right to bodily integrity and also  the right to informational self-determination are  fundamental rights that must be reconciled with each  other in accordance with the principle of practical  concordance. Particular consideration must be given  to two questions in particular: whether risks are posed  to life or health , and the extent to which the right to  informational self-determination  is encroached upon.
116 PART E | D ATA The Data Ethics Commission believes that standards  and guidelines  on surveillance by professionals in the  care sector should be developed by the Conference  of Independent Data Protection Authorities of the  Federal Government and the Länder . In particular,  these standards and guidelines should specify the legal  provisions upon which the professionals can base their  action in particular situations, and the cases in which  (especially if consent  has not been granted by the data  subject or his or her caregiver) surveillance is either  prohibited or possible on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) or  (d) GDPR. They should also outline arrangements for  the provision of information, whereby the Data Ethics  Commission takes the position that differentiated  information on digital surveillance options should be  provided prior to their use in an institutional setting (e.  g.  care home, kindergarten or school), and that consent  must also be obtained on a differentiated basis in  cases where there is no legal basis for data processing.  Standards and guidelines of this kind would also be an  appropriate way both to provide more legal certainty for  care home operators and care staff and to reduce liability  risks. Section 1901a of the Civil Code should be amended  accordingly to clarify the fact that living wills  can also  include dispositions in which the relevant data subject  grants prior consent to the processing of data. As a basic principle, a particularly high level of protection  should also be accorded to people in their own homes,  since they are likely to regard the space within their  four walls as a safe haven of privacy. Once again, new  technologies have opened up new and expanding options  for the surveillance of private individuals by other  private individuals  (e. g. the surveillance of romantic  partners, children or persons with disabilities), which  range all the way through to the ethically alarming  prospect of total private surveillance. Given that  awareness of this topic is lacking in many quarters, the  Data Ethics Commission recommends that awarenessraising campaigns  in this area should be initiated both by  the Federal Government and by the governments of the  Länder , since the latter often hold jurisdiction in this field.  Although it recommends that the Federal Government  should continue monitoring developments, it does not  believe that legislative measures (e.  g. new criminal  offences) are required at present.3.6 Data protection by technical design Citizens, companies, government agencies or other  parties that are entitled to assert ethically justified  data rights and that are obliged to comply with the  corresponding data obligations must be in a position  to do so in the first place. The necessary technical  framework  must be put in place, and enabling  technologies must play a prominent role in this respect.  yet enabling technologies of this kind must not lead  to a situation in which responsibility for the protection  of fundamental rights and freedoms is offloaded onto  individual users. Instead, the State must, as a matter  of principle, adopt the regulations  that are required to  provide reliable protection for these fundamental rights  and freedoms, without the need for action on the part  of individuals. 3.6.1   Privacy-friendly design of products and services As its heading suggests, Article 25 GDPR makes it  mandatory for controllers to comply with the principles  of “data protection by design and by default” . Designers  of new technologies must therefore take due account  of concerns relating to data protection (based on the  interpretation of the term applied in Article 5 GDPR),  while following a risk-adequate approach. The technical  and organisational measures that must be implemented  to this end may be required prior to processing (i.  e.  when the controller determines the means by which the  data will be processed) as well as during the processing  operation itself. 
117 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA The design specifications of data protection law have  a high level of practical relevance in relation to end  devices . Some end devices are designed to be worn on  the body (wearables, e.  g. a smartwatch or smart textiles)  or at least carried close to the body (e.  g. a smartphone),  while others are designed to be mobile by other means  (e. g. a networked car) or immobile (e.  g. smart home facilities). When designing software systems for end  devices of this kind, the amount of time that should  be spent reflecting on the ethical questions they raise  depends on the likelihood that they will be used in close  proximity to the body or in private and intimate spheres  (e. g. bathrooms and bedrooms), on the probability that  their use will affect particularly vulnerable persons (e.  g.  Data protection by design and by default 1 Technology Working Group of the Conference of Independent Data Protection Authorities of the Federal Government and the Länder : Das  Standard-Datenschutzmodell – Eine Methode zur Datenschutzberatung und -prüfung auf der Basis einheitlicher Gewährleistungsziele  V.1.1 – Erprobungsfassung [The standard data protection model – a method for data protection consulting and assessment on the basis of  uniform warranty objectives, V.1.1 – test version], 2018 (available at https:/ /www.datenschutzzentrum.de/sdm/ ).Data protection by design  imposes conditions on the  selection of technical and organisational measures  (relating to the state of the art, implementation  costs, processing and the risk posed to the rights  and freedoms of natural persons, for example). Data  protection by default  imposes no such conditions,  since this principle must be adhered to without  exceptions. In practice, however, it is often the  case that excessive amounts of personal data (e.  g.  identifiers) are processed, that inadequate restrictions  are placed on processing, that retention periods are  too long and that an inappropriately high number of  people are able to access the data. The field of “privacy engineering”  has therefore  emerged under the banner of additional protectionrelated goals such as non-linkability, transparency  and intervenability; the standard data protection  model (SDM) used by the German data protection  authorities now incorporates these goals as  “warranty objectives”.1 Like the IT Baseline Protection  Catalogues published by the Federal Office for  Information Security ( Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der  Informationstechnik , BSI), the SDM defines modules  that can be used by controllers and designers of new  technologies as a basis for choosing technical and  organisational measures that are appropriate to their  protection needs. Although only the first few modules are currently available, others are planned. The fact  that many developers use the IT Baseline Protection  Catalogues and the ISO 2700x series of standards  as reference works means that these developers are  familiar with the fundamental concept and able to  take better account of the legal requirements when  designing and implementing technical systems. The choice between centralisation and decentralisation   is another question that must be clarified on a caseby-case basis when designing technical systems. As a  general rule, centralised systems allow operators to  exercise a higher level of control and influence. This  might be a good thing, for example if the underlying  aim is to incorporate features that contribute to data  protection or information security. yet it can also be  a bad thing, since the potential for misuse – either  by malicious third parties wanting to steal data  or sabotage data processing, or by the operators  themselves exploiting the large volumes of data they  have amassed for purposes other than those notified  to the data subjects – is greater if data are stored  centrally and the processing of these data is also  controlled centrally. When designed appropriately,  however, decentralised systems can help to decrease  or prevent data linkability, and reduce disruptions to  overall system availability.
118 PART E | D ATA children and young people, care-dependent persons,  persons with disabilities), and on the extent to which  they encroach upon an individual’s personality. The  high level of responsibility (or autonomy) granted to or  demanded from the users who assemble, configure and  operate these devices represents a particular challenge  when attempting to design technologies that foster selfdetermination. The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should step up its support for R&D  efforts on technical standards  for end devices. It also  urges the Federal Government to lobby at European  level for the introduction of technical requirements   aimed at safeguarding self-determination and product  safety in the private sphere, with particular reference to  end devices for consumers . The Data Ethics Commission  takes the view that the following principles should, as a  minimum, be enshrined in any end device requirements  that are adopted:  ●Products must be protected against cyber attacks  and improper use  of data; the measures taken must  be commensurate with the need for protection  and comply with the state of the art, and suitable  guarantees must be provided in particular for sensitive  data (e.  g. health data). A high level of cyber resilience  must be achieved, and this is a joint task incumbent  upon the State, industry and each individual.  ●Users must be able at all times to identify the  functions that are currently enabled ; in particular,  they must be able to see whether the camera,  microphone, GPS or other sensors are switched on,  whether the device is connected to the Internet, and  whether their data are being transferred outside a  closed local area. ●It must be easy to turn off data transfers , including  transfers outside the local area, and data that are  stored locally after this function is switched off must  not be transferred without the user’s consent when it  is next switched on (and the same must also be true  for individual applications, e.  g. on smartphones or  smart TVs).  ●If basic device functions  are technically possible  without data transfers of this kind , the functions  must remain available when data transfers are turned  off (e.  g. a smart fridge must continue to keep its  contents cool).  ●Devices should be supplied with “user onboarding”   software; onboarding should take place automatically  when the devices are first put into operation, and it  should be possible to repeat the onboarding process  as often as necessary, even for second users. The  information provided to users should cover not only  the mode of operation, but also the collection and  further processing of user data.  ●If end devices have a direct connection to the Internet  (e. g. routers) and are secured using a password, it  should not be possible to put them into operation  without changing the factory password beforehand.  On the system side, passwords  should be allowed only  if they comply with the state of the art.
119 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA The way in which products, services and applications are  designed has a huge influence on the extent to which  controllers and processors are able to comply with the  data protection obligations incumbent upon them, and  yet manufacturers that are not directly responsible for  processing personal data fall outside the scope of the GDPR.  Controllers that cannot or do not want to use solutions they  have developed themselves must therefore insist on “bakedin” data protection.20 With this in mind, the Data Ethics  Commission recommends that the Federal Government  should either take steps itself or support action by other  parties with the aim of forcing manufacturers to shoulder a  greater share of the responsibility . Suitable measures might  include the following: 20 Cf. Recital 78 of the GDPR. 21 Christiane Wendehorst: Verbraucherrelevante Problemstellungen zu Besitz- und Eigentumsverhältnissen beim Internet der Dinge, Teil 2: Wissenschaftliches  Rechtsgutachten [Consumer-oriented problems relating to possession and ownership structures in the Internet of Things, Part 2: Scientific legal opinion],  Studien und Gutachten im Auftrag des Sachverständigenrats für Verbraucherfragen [Studies and opinions on behalf of the Advisory Council for Consumer  Affairs], December 2016, p. 120 (available at: http:/ /www.svr-verbraucherfragen.de/wp-content/uploads/Wendehorst-Gutachten.pdf ). ●direct imposition by the legislator of product design  and product safety requirements ;  ●new and effective legal remedies  along the  distribution chain that can be used to shift the burden  of responsibility for inadequate data protection by  design and by default onto manufacturers21 (whereby a  certain amount of progress has been made in the new  Directive (EU) 2019/771 on certain aspects concerning  contracts for the sale of goods in terms of shifting the  burden of responsibility from consumers onto retailers  and along the distribution chain); Comprehensibility and transparency Data protection by design also encompasses the  comprehensibility and transparency of systems, including  the applications, scripts, sources and elements for each  point in time during the development procedure and the  process itself. The Data Ethics Commission welcomes  the ongoing efforts to develop best-practice models  for good terms and conditions of business and “onepagers” for consumers. As part of a multi-level approach,  consumers should initially be provided with simple and  “boiled-down” information on the most important data  processing operations; if necessary, they should then be  informed in detail about the general terms and conditions  of business and data protection measures. On its own,  however, this approach will not solve the underlying  problem, which is that the information provided often  fails to do its job, either because it is inadequate and/or  because it exceeds the consumer’s capabilities. So that consumers can make informed purchase  decisions, standardised, machine-readable and readily  understandable graphical symbols (icons)  should be introduced at European level, following broad  consultations with industry and civil society. These  icons should convey the key digital characteristics of  products (including digital products such as apps) and  services; “Basic functions available only with Internet  connection”, “Internet connection required for enhanced  functions”, “User data transfers” and “User tracking” are  examples of possible characteristics. The icons could  also be colour coded , which would be particularly useful  in the case of product characteristics that apply to a  greater or lesser degree. The Data Ethics Commission  recommends that the Federal Government should lobby  the European Commission to develop standardised  icons of this kind, in keeping with Article 12(8) GDPR. Increased transparency for consumers could also be  achieved by supporting the development of certified  electronic shopping assistants , which would identify a  product in a brick-and-mortar or online shop and then  serve up product information to the consumer in a  format that he or she is likely to understand.
120 PART E | D ATA  ●calls for tenders  and guidelines for public procurement  measures  that are designed in such a way as to require  evidence of all-round compliance with the GDPR,  including the principles of data protection by design  and by default;  ●incentives  that encourage compliance with  particularly high standards of data protection by  design and by default, for example requirements to  this effect in government funding programmes. 3.6.2   Privacy-friendly product development The importance of data protection by technical design  must also be taken into account at the product  development and enhancement stages. This applies, in  particular, to the development of algorithmic systems ,  since these latter typically require data in bulk, for example  to use as training data (→ see Part C, section 2.2 for further details) . Privacy-friendly training of algorithmic systems 1 Datatilsynet: Artificial intelligence and privacy, Report, January 2018, pp. 27 et seq. (available at:   https:/ /www.datatilsynet.no/globalassets/global/english/ai-and-privacy.pdf ).Various options are available for complying with the  principles of data protection enshrined in Article 5  GDPR while training algorithmic systems. In January  2018, for example, Datatilsynet (the Norwegian data  protection authority) proposed privacy-friendly means  and methods for the training of algorithmic systems:1 8. use of data minimisation procedures  in relation  to training data, e.  g. through the use of synthetic  data (using generative adversarial networks, for  example), through federated learning or through  the use of data-minimising variants such as those  proposed for neural networks;9. use of encryption procedures  such as differential  privacy, homomorphic encryption or other  procedures that allow the retrieval of information  without granting full access to the database; 10. use of procedures that promote transparency  to  achieve a higher level of comprehensibility and  traceability. The Data Ethics Commission believes that research  is still needed in all of these areas, and this also  applies to options for the privacy-friendly testing of  algorithmic systems. 
121 1 The Data Ethics Commission recommends that measures  be taken against ethically indefensible uses of data .  Examples of these uses include total surveillance,  profiling that poses a threat to personal integrity, the  targeted exploitation of vulnerabilities, addictive designs  and dark patterns, methods of influencing political  elections that are incompatible with the principle of  democracy, vendor lock-in and systematic consumer  detriment, and many practices that involve trading in  personal data. 2 Data protection law as well as other branches of the  legal system (including general private law and unfair  commercial practices law) already provide for a range of  instruments that can be used to prevent such ethically  indefensible uses of data. However, in spite of the  widespread impact and enormous potential for harm,  too little has been done to date in terms of harnessing  the power of these instruments, particularly against the  market  giants. The various factors contributing to this  enforcement gap  must be tackled systematically. 3 As well as steps to make front-line players (e.  g. super visory authorities) more aware of the existing options,  there is an urgent need for the legislative framework in  force to be fleshed out more clearly and strengthened  in certain areas . Examples of recommended measures  include the blacklisting of data-specific unfair contract  terms, the fleshing out of data-specific contractual  duties of a fiduciary nature, new data-specific torts, the  blacklisting of certain data-specific unfair commercial  practices and the introduction of a much more detailed  legislative framework for profiling, scoring and data  trading. 4 In order to allow supervisory authorities to take action  more effectively, these authorities need significantly  better human and material resources. Attempts should be  made to strengthen and formalise cooperation between  the different data protection authorities in Germany,  thereby ensuring the uniform and coherent application of  data protection law. If these attempts fail, consideration  should be given to the centralisation of market-related  supervisory activities  within a federal-level authority  that is granted a broad mandate and that cooperates  closely with other specialist supervisory authorities.  The authorities at Land  level should remain responsible  for supervisory activities relating to the public sector,  however.Summary of the most important  recommendations for action  Standards for the use of  personal data
122 PART E | D ATA 5 The Data Ethics Commission believes that “data  ownership”  (i. e. exclusive rights in data modelled on the  ownership of tangible assets or on intellectual property)  would not solve any of the problems we are currently  facing, but would create new problems instead, and  recommends refraining from their recognition . It also  advises against granting to data subjects copyrightlike rights of economic exploitation in respect of  their personal data (which might then be managed by  collective societies). 6 The Data Ethics Commission also argues that data should  not be referred to as “counter-performance” provided  in exchange for a service, even though the term sums up  the issue in a nutshell and has helped to raise awareness  among the general public. Regardless of the position that  data protection authorities and the European Court of  Justice will ultimately take with regard to the prohibition  under the GDPR of “tying” or “bundling” consent with  the provision of a service, the Data Ethics Commission  believes that consumers must be offered reasonable  alternatives  to releasing their data for commercial use  (e. g. appropriately designed pay options ). 7 Stringent requirements and limitations  should be  imposed on the use of data for personalised risk  assessment (e. g. the “black box” premiums in certain  insurance schemes). In particular, the processing of  data may not intrude on intimate areas of private life,  there must be a clear causal relationship between the  data and the risk, and the difference between individual  prices charged on the basis of personalised and nonpersonalised risk assessments should not exceed certain  percentages (to be determined). There should also be  stringent requirements in respect of transparency, nondiscrimination and the protection of third parties. 8 The Data Ethics Commission advises the Federal  Government not to consider the issues falling under the  heading of “digital inheritance”  as having been settled by  the Federal Court of Justice’s 2018 ruling. The ephemeral  spoken word is being replaced in many situations by  digital communications that are recorded more or less  in their entirety, and the possibility that these records  will be handed over to a deceased’s heirs adds a whole  new dimension of privacy risk. A range of mitigating  measures should be taken, including the imposition of  new obligations on service providers, quality assurance  standards for digital estate planning services and national  regulations on post-mortem data protection. 9 The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should invite the social partners  to work towards a common position on the legislative  provisions that should be adopted with a view to  stepping up the protection of employee data , based  on examples of best practices from existing collective  agreements. The concerns of individuals in non-standard  forms of employment should also be taken into account  during this process. 10 In view of the benefits that could be gained from  digitalising healthcare , the Data Ethics Commission  recommends swift expansion of digital infrastructures  in this sector. The expansion of both the range and the  quality of digitalised healthcare services should include  measures to better allow patients to exercise their rights  to informational self-determination. Measures that  could be taken in this respect include the introduction  and roll-out of an electronic health record, building  on a participatory process that involves the relevant  stakeholders, and the further development of procedures  for reviewing and assessing digital medical apps in the  insurer-funded and consumer-funded health markets.
123 E 3. STANDARDS  FOR  THE  USE  OF PERSONAL  DATA 11 The Data Ethics Commission calls for action against the  significant enforcement gap that exists with regard to  statutory protection of children and young people  in the  digital sphere. Particular attention should be paid to the  development and mandatory provision of technologies  (including effective identity management) and default  settings that not only guarantee reliable protection of  children and young people but that are also  familyfriendly, i.  e. that neither demand too much of parents  or guardians nor allow or even encourage excessive  surveillance in the home environment. 12 Standards and guidelines on the handling of the personal  data of vulnerable and care-dependent persons   should be introduced to provide greater legal certainty  for professionals in the care sector. At the same time,  consideration should be given to clarifying in the relevant  legal provisions on living wills that these may also include  dispositions with regard to the future processing of  personal data as far as such processing will require the  care-dependent person’s consent (e.  g. for dementia  patients who will not be in a position to provide legally  valid consent). 13 The Data Ethics Commission believes that a number of  binding requirements should be introduced to ensure  the privacy-friendly design of products and services ,  so that the principles of privacy by design and privacy  by default (which the GDPR imposes on controllers) will  already be put into practice upstream, by manufacturers  and service providers themselves. Such requirements  would be particularly important with regard to consumer  equipment. In this context, standardised icons should  also be introduced so that consumers are able to take  informed purchase decisions. 14 Action must also be taken at a number of different levels  to provide manufacturers with adequate incentives to  implement features of privacy-friendly design . This  includes effective legal remedies that can be pursued  against parties along the entire distribution chain to  ensure that also manufacturers can be held accountable  for inadequate application of the principles of privacy  by design and privacy by default. Consideration should  also be given, in particular, to requirements built into  tender specifications, procurement guidelines for public  bodies and conditions for funding programmes. The  same applies to privacy-friendly product development ,  including the training of algorithmic systems. 15 While debates on data protection tend (quite rightly)  to centre around natural persons, it is important not  to ignore the fact that companies and legal persons  must also be granted protection . The almost limitless  ability to pool together individual pieces of data can be  used as a means of obtaining a comprehensive picture  of a company’s internal operating procedures, and this  information can be passed on to competitors, negotiating  partners, parties interested in a takeover bid and so on.  This poses a variety of threats – inter alia  to the digital  sovereignty of both Germany and Europe – in view of the  significant volumes of data that flow to third countries.  Many of the Data Ethics Commission’s recommendations  for action therefore also apply on a mutatis mutandis   basis to the data of legal persons. The Data Ethics  Commission believes that action must be taken by the  Federal Government to step up the level of data-related  protection afforded to companies .
124 PART E | D ATA 4. Improving controlled access to personal data All types of data (both personal and non-personal) represent  a key resource  within the data economy and serve as a  vital ingredient in many applications that foster the public  good. The breakneck speed of development of digital  technologies – some of which benefit each and every one  of us enormously – can be attributed in part to the ability  to evaluate data generated by billions of users. Although  data protection must always remain the central priority for  applications involving personal data, more and more people  are asking whether general improvements in the area of  controlled access to personal data might be ethically tenable  or even desirable, in keeping with the principle of data use  and data sharing for the public good (→ section 1.3 above)  and  within the framework prescribed by data protection law. 4.1  Enabling research that uses personal data 4.1.1  Preliminary considerations Research serves as the basis for almost all our technical  achievements, and the current onslaught of digitalisation  means that data-based research is becoming increasingly  important . Its significance has already been recognised  by the GDPR, backed up in certain cases by national  law (i.  e. the [German] Federal Data Protection Act  (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz , BDSG) and the data protection  acts of the Länder ). The Data Ethics Commission wishes to  emphasise the fact that data processing operations involving  genetic, biometric and other health data  are of enormous  value in terms of furthering research goals, promoting  preventive methods and developing new diagnostic and  therapeutic approaches. The use of artificial intelligence  holds the promise of significant progress in certain areas,  but – depending on the problem being tackled – may rely  on large pools of data. The issue of releasing health data  for research purposes (referred to as “data donation” ) is  a recurrent topic of debate. This term “data donation” is  misleading , however, because data that have been donated –  unlike organs or money – can be reused as often as necessary  and in parallel, even by the data donor himself or herself. 22 Cf. Conference of the Independent Data Protection Authorities of the Federal Government and the Länder : Orientierungshilfe der  Aufsichtsbehörden für Anbieter von Telemedien [Guidance by the supervisory authorities for telemedia providers], March 2019, p. 14 (available at:  https:/ /www.datenschutzkonferenz-online.de/media/oh/20190405_oh_tmg.pdf ).Provided that the research can, for the most part, be  described as a public-good activity in terms of the way  that it uses data (e.  g. for providing healthcare services,  developing sustainable mobility concepts or improving  living conditions in the broader sense), the Data Ethics  Commission recommends that full use should be made  of the existing privileges under data protection law ,  and that research should be viewed as a particularly  valuable good when weighing it up against competing  interests.22 It additionally recommends that the Länder   should exercise the regulatory powers they already hold  (for example in the area of higher education law or within  the framework of data protection law) in such a way as to  foster innovation and in keeping with the aforementioned  notion of special privileges for research. A broad  interpretation should be placed on the term “scientific  research” in this context, inter alia  with reference to  consistent past decisions by the Federal Constitutional  Court, and it should be irrelevant whether the research in  question is being carried out by government-funded or  private institutions. The Data Ethics Commission wishes to point out that –  challenging though the task may be – an appropriate  balance  must be sought between the researchers’  fundamental rights and the data subjects’ right to  informational self-determination. When carrying out  the weighing up of interests required by law, special  priority should be accorded to the protection of sensitive  data  and the associated rights of data subjects such  as patients and insured parties. For example, the duty  of confidentiality imposed on certain individuals (such  as doctors) who are subject to a code of professional  secrecy (cf. Section 203 of the [German] Criminal Code  (Strafgesetzbuch , StGB)) may also apply to the work of  research institutions if these latter use data collected  or stored by the individuals in question. The procedural  precautions imposed by law with a view to protecting  the right to informational self-determination would then  need to be observed.
125 E 4. IMPROVING  CONTROLLED  ACCESS  TO PERSONAL  DATA 4.1.2  Legal clarity and certainty Although the law as it currently stands permits  and promotes data-based research, questions of  interpretation  arise in relation to certain details, and  these questions require further clarification by the  supervisory authorities and courts. For example, it has yet  to be definitively clarified whether the further processing   of data that have already been lawfully collected for  one purpose (e.  g. healthcare provision) can – on the  basis of Article 5(1)(b) GDPR and, in the light of Recital  50, with “appropriate safeguards” within the meaning  of Article 89 GDPR – automatically be deemed lawful  if they are processed for research purposes, or whether  the requirement for a separate legal basis pursuant to  Article 6(1)–(3) or Article 9 GDPR applies just as it did  when the data were first collected (for example, Section  27 of the Federal Data Protection Act states that healthrelated data can be processed only if express consent has  been provided or if the research interests “substantially  outweigh” the data subject’s interests). It has also been  suggested in certain quarters that the right to process  the data further can only be invoked by the party that  collected the data in the first place; similar uncertainty  reigns over the scope of the term “research” as regards  product development and enhancement . Even though a legal framework exists for data-based  research in Germany, inter alia  in relation to healthrelated data and other special categories of data, the  finer details of this regulatory framework lack uniformity,  if only because the country’s federal structure means  that both the Federal Government and the Länder  hold  constitutionally enshrined legislative powers. From a  research perspective, the resulting legal uncertainty  is  exacerbated yet further by an ongoing lack of reliable  guidance, in particular as regards the criteria that must  be met in order for consent to be deemed valid and in  order for the data subject’s interests to be “substantially  outweighed” by research interests within the meaning of  Section 27 of the Federal Data Protection Act. This legal  uncertainty could prove a stumbling block for data-based research in Germany. The Data Ethics Commission  believes that recommendations for action and  interpretative criteria  should therefore be developed –  perhaps by the Conference of Independent Data  Protection Authorities of the Federal Government and  the Länder , with the involvement of relevant stakeholders  from politics, the healthcare industry and civil society –  so that the relevant rules can be applied in a feasible and  legally compliant way (for further information on pseudonymisation  and anonymisation standards, → see section 4.2 below) . With a view to further harmonisation  aimed at  overcoming regulatory discrepancies in the field of  research (different regulatory approaches by the Member  States, division of regulatory scope between the Federal  Data Protection Act and the data protection acts of the  Länder , special regulations for specific subjects), the  Data Ethics Commission recommends that the Federal  Government should: a) push for synchronisation of the research-specific  legal bases  in the Federal Data Protection Act, in the  data protection acts of the Länder  and in subjectspecific acts; b) drive forward projects at European level  aimed at  greater harmonisation of the regulatory frameworks  put in place by the Member States in respect of  research data protection; and c) lobby for a duty of notification  incumbent upon  Member States when adopting national laws in this  area, and for the establishment of a European clearing  house  for cross-border research projects.
126 PART E | D ATA 4.1.3  Consent processes for sensitive data Voluntary, informed and explicit consent by the data  subject is a critically important means of protecting  individuals (test subjects) participating in research  projects, particularly in the case of clinical research and  research involving health data and other particularly  sensitive categories of data, because it provides the test  subject with an opportunity to exercise his or her right to  informational self-determination . Since it necessitates  the provision of easy-to-understand information about  the research project, it also ensures that the test subject  will not discover at a later date that his or her values  or preferences  prevent him or her from participating in  the study. As a protective instrument enshrined in law,  it improves the transparency of research and therefore  increases people’s level of confidence in it. Not least  among its benefits is the fact that it also promotes the  integrity of research and researchers. yet researchers who act as controllers face considerable  challenges when it comes to obtaining informed  consent, particularly when the project involves sensitive  data. For example, if researchers want to embark on  a new project using health data already available in a  database, the data subjects must be contacted so that  consent can be obtained again (unless the data subjects  originally consented to the reuse of their data in future,  or provided – to use the term preferred within ethics  discourse – broad consent ). Researchers wishing to use  health data collected in the course of routine medical  care for research purposes must first contact patients  and ask them to grant informed consent, which is a  task fraught with huge practical obstacles. With this in  mind, the Data Ethics Commission recommends that  appropriate model procedures for the obtaining of  consent  should be designed and developed with a view to  making it easier to process data for research purposes.With explicit reference to the link that exists between  consent and a data subject’s fundamental rights, the  Data Ethics Commission also calls for the development  of innovative consent models  in the research sector.  Dynamic consent  models that involve tailoring  declarations of consent to the individual context are  already being trialled, for example. In this connection,  it must be ensured that the consenting party remains  able to control his or her data even after granting  consent; in order to ensure that this is the case, the Data  Ethics Commission recommends that more emphasis  be placed on the development and design of privacy  management tools (PMT) and personal information  management systems (PIMS) (→ see section 4.3 below)  for  the research sector, such as digital consent assistants  or  data agents. Consent assistants of this kind may make it  significantly easier for data subjects to keep track of the  data processing operations to which they have granted  consent, even after these operations have commenced;  equally, they may make it possible to go back and ask  data subjects for consent again if circumstances change,  and to provide data subjects with a straightforward way  of revoking their consent. Calls are being heard increasingly often – particularly  in connection with research using health data – for  blanket consent  models that involve a data subject  granting consent to a wide range of data uses in the  field of research, without reference to a specific course  of treatment or other event. Although the research  sector can advance compelling reasons for models of  this kind, there are a number of concerns and obstacles  that must be overcome before they are adopted (in  particular the need for consent to be informed and for  it to be linked to a specific purpose). They would make  it impossible to take a consenting party’s preferences  and values into account on a differentiated basis, even  if far-reaching legal safeguards were provided against  misuse of his or her data and encroachments upon his  or her privacy.
127 E 4. IMPROVING  CONTROLLED  ACCESS  TO PERSONAL  DATA Against this backdrop, the Data Ethics Commission  recommends further discussion of the innovative model  known as “meta consent” .23 After being appropriately  informed – and without being in a situation where  consent is specifically required – the data subject  decides on the type of research projects and research  contexts for which he or she wishes to grant consent  and the type of consent involved (specific or broad).  Consent may be limited on the basis of considerations  such as the following:  ●research context (e.  g. private or public research,  commercial or non-commercial research, national,  European or international research);  ●data sources (e.  g. electronic health record, human  tissue, health data, lifestyle data from wearables);  ●type of research (e.  g. preventive research, research  into cancers or neurodegenerative disorders, any kind  of health research). If researchers later wish to use the data for a specific  research project, the data subject is informed  in advance  and given the opportunity to object  to this use of his or  her data. 23 Thomas Ploug / Søren Holm: Bioethics, 2016 (30:9), pp. 721 et seqq.Each real-life implementation of this model should be  under the oversight  of a data trust scheme, an ethics  commission or another responsible body tasked with  ensuring that the consenting party’s preferences are, in  fact, taken into account. It should also be possible for  the data subject to amend the terms of his or her meta  consent at any time, and the technical and regulatory  framework required to do so must be in place. Example 13   Example 13  A data subject specifies that the data from  his electronic health record may be used for public  and commercial research. He also specifies that his  blood and tissue samples may be used for public and  commercial research into degenerative diseases. He  consents to the processing of data from his electronic  health record provided that the data are not transferred  out of Europe. A company from Spain would like to use  data from his electronic health record as well as data  from his tissue samples for dementia research. The data  subject is informed of their intention to do so, and told  that he has four weeks to object to his data being used  in this way.
128 PART E | D ATA When deliberating on and designing a model of this kind,  care must be taken to ensure that any constraints placed  on the freedom of research  and the research privilege  for secondary use of data are equivalent in scope to the  restrictions imposed under the current legal system.  Preference should be given to meta consent models that  emphasise the ability of data subjects to express their  values and preferences  regarding the use of their health  data for research purposes; this would also increase  public confidence in health data governance. Another ethical question that must be considered is  that of accountability – not only in relation to the use  of data, but also in relation to their non-use, since this  may block potential progress in vital areas and result in  discrimination against certain groups as a result of their  exclusion from progress . For example, methodological  reasons mean that clinical studies involving older people  suffering from several different chronic diseases and  taking several different kinds of medication at the same  time must necessarily be very limited in scope. If highquality procedures can be used to evaluate their health  data, however, key findings might be obtained on the  interactions between these different medications and  their actions under everyday conditions; these findings  could then be used as a productive basis for more  extensive research and the treatment of these patients  going forwards. With the above in mind, and given the significance of  the European healthcare sector from both a medical  and economic perspective, the Data Ethics Commission  recommends proactive support for a “learning  healthcare system”  in which healthcare provision is  continuously improved by making systematic and qualityoriented use of the health data generated on a day-today basis, in keeping with the principles of evidencebased medicine. A learning healthcare system imposes  high requirements in terms of multi-level governance  and requires a cross-disciplinary approach to healthcare  provision that puts the insured party or patient front  and centre.4.1.4  Legal protection against discrimination At the same time, however, the Data Ethics Commission  wishes to emphasise that all parties involved in  developing and designing new health-related research  projects must take due account of the significant  potential for discrimination  that is opened up through  the availability of sensitive data (e.  g. when a data subject  looks for a job or takes out an insurance policy). Technical  progress has made it possible to sequence and decode  the human genome, and data scientists are now able to  analyse biometric and behavioural data collected in the  course of daily life; this means that it is also possible  to profile an individual’s risk of falling ill in the future,  typically based on the likelihood that he or she will suffer  from this or that disease – and when genetic data come  into play, his or her relatives may also be affected. With this in mind, the Federal Government should  examine the possibility of including new grounds  for action under the [German] General Act on Equal  Treatment ( Allgemeine Gleichbehandlungsgesetz , AGG) ,  as well as specific bans  on using information about a  person’s health (by way of analogy to the corresponding  provisions on genetic data in the [German] Genetic  Diagnostics Act ( Gendiagnostikgesetz , GenDG)).
129 E 4. IMPROVING  CONTROLLED  ACCESS  TO PERSONAL  DATA 4.2  Anonymisation, pseudonymisation and  synthetic data Operations that involve accessing personal data must  always comply with the applicable provisions of data  protection law, and abide by the rules on data processing  laid out in these provisions – from the purpose limitation  principle right through to appropriate protective  measures. Under certain circumstances, therefore, it may be vitally important for businesses or other users to know  for certain that their operations either fall outside the  scope of data protection law or are compliant with data  protection law. The Data Ethics Commission believes that  there is a lack of legal certainty in a number of different  areas, for example concerning the anonymisation  and pseudonymisation of data, the identification and  consideration of a link between individuals and (allegedly  anonymised) data sets, and synthetic data. Anonymised and pseudonymised data Anonymisation  involves processing a set of personal  data in such a way that any link to the data subject  is broken irrevocably. A distinction is made between  randomisation and generalisation; both are different  ways of approaching the task of anonymisation,  and they can be used individually or in combination.  Randomisation  involves modifying data in such a way  that the anonymised data can no longer be matched up  with the data subject. This can be achieved by falsifying  individual data sets, for example. Appropriately  designed randomisation methods ensure that the  statistical properties of the original data set are  retained, for example by swapping values rather than  changing them. Generalisation  involves aggregating  pieces of [less] detailed information, such as age  categories instead of dates of birth, names of regions  instead of postcodes, or periods of time instead of time  stamps that are accurate to the nearest second. Three main strategies are used to identify natural  persons in a data set:a) singling out:  a method of pinpointing data sets  relating to specific individuals from a larger pool of  data, for example by using unique characteristics that  make it possible to identify these individuals; b) linkability:  a method that involves linking up at least  two data sets that relate to the same individual or  group of individuals on the basis of matching values  that appear in both data sets, such as identifiers,  spatial coordinates or times. Even a small amount  of data available on an individual can be augmented  using this linking strategy, allowing him or her to be  identified; c) inference: a method that involves deriving the  highly probable value of a characteristic from the  values of a number of other characteristics, again  allowing the data relating to an individual to be  augmented and increasing the likelihood that he or  she will be identified.
130 PART E | D ATA Anonymised data sets make it impossible to recreate  the links that once existed between the data and  the individuals to whom the data relate, or to create  such links for the first time, given the technological  means that are reasonably likely to be used and that  are available or being developed at the time of the  processing (cf. Recital 26 GDPR); an attacker wishing  to identify one or all of the data subjects (through deanonymisation) would find the task impossible. Modifications to a set of data – in particular the  artificial addition of fuzziness (also referred to as  noise or blurring, depending on the context) – ensure  that it is impossible to pull out data that belong to a  specific individual, that linkable data are not used and  that inferences cannot be drawn; these modifications  typically also place constraints on the utility of the data.  If the user is aware of the evaluations that will later  be carried out using the data set, the anonymisation  procedures can be optimised with this in mind, for  example by retaining the necessary level of detail for  the relevant characteristics wherever possible. The  same applies to comparisons of different data sets  (interoperability); if the user knows which comparisons  will be carried out, appropriate anonymisation methods  can be designed by categorising the data into identical  groups as required, and taking into account the increase  in risk that may occur as a result of incorporating  information from other data sets. Pseudonymisation  involves processing data in such a  way that they can no longer be assigned to a specific  data subject without additional information, which  may take the form of mapping tables or cryptographic  hash methods, for example. Pseudonymisation differs  from anonymisation in that a reference to a person (in  the legal sense of the term) is retained. The controller  must prevent (unauthorised) access to the additional  information whenever the pseudonymised data are  processed in future, since otherwise it would be  possible to map the data to the data subjects. The  GDPR refers to pseudonymisation several times as a  technical and organisational measure for reducing the  risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons.Both anonymisation and pseudonymisation involve  processing a set of data that is already available, and  must be distinguished from pseudonyms , which are  deployed on the user side. Users may choose their  own pseudonymised identifiers (e.  g. user names for  online services or e-mail addresses), or use identifiers  provided automatically by a technological system,  for example the online ID function of an electronic  ID card or attribute-based authorisation certificates  designed with data protection concerns in mind. In the  vast majority of cases, the use of pseudonyms provides  little in the way of protection against identification of  the data subject, particularly if they are used across  contexts and communication partners, which allows  the data in a user-specific profile to be linked to  other data and augmented. Conversely, constantly  changing “transaction pseudonyms” are restricted to a  specific context, making it much harder to identify the  individual in question. Internet-based procedures aimed at concealing the  link between a data subject and the data relating to  that data subject cannot generally be regarded as  anonymisation in the strict sense of the term, but  may nevertheless provide some level of protection  against identification and observation. Simple web  proxies make it possible to surf the Internet using  the identifier (i.  e. the IP address) of an intermediary  server; multiple users (whose identifiers are known  to the proxy server) may therefore have the same  identifier as far as the destination web servers are  concerned, provided that they avoid identifying  themselves through the use of cookies, etc. Further  steps to prevent identification can be taken by  arranging multiple intermediary servers one behind  another, for example in mix networks such as Tor  or in mix cascades such as JonDo. Once again, noise  can be added by sending artificially created “dummy  traffic”, as an additional obstacle in the path of anyone  attempting to observe the human users.
131 E 4. IMPROVING  CONTROLLED  ACCESS  TO PERSONAL  DATA 4.2.1  Procedures, standards and presumption rules It is often not possible to anonymise  data – i.  e.  completely break the link between data and the data  subject to whom they belong in such a way that it cannot  be recreated – without losing any of the data’s utility.  At the same time, however, perfect anonymisation  is often not required, firstly because many goals can  (upon closer examination) be achieved using data  with a somewhat lower level of utility, and secondly  because the GDPR already contains exemptions for data  processing operations that serve the public good (e.  g.  in the research sector), meaning that even personal data  can be processed without obtaining consent from the  data subjects. Nevertheless, efforts aimed at developing  effective anonymisation technologies and procedures   should be stepped up with a view to allowing data to be  processed wholly outside the scope of the GDPR. Ultimately, legal certainty can be achieved only by  developing standardised technologies and procedures ,  which must always take due account of the whirlwind  pace of technological development. The Data Ethics  Commission therefore recommends that the Federal  Government should lobby – in particular at EU level – for  easy-to-use anonymisation standards  that would benefit  both data subjects and users, and for pseudonymisation  measures  that are commensurate with the level of risk  faced by data subjects in their private lives (as featured on  the agenda of the Federal Government’s Digital Summit). 24 Federal Office for Information Security: Technical Guidelines BSI TR-02102 Cryptographic Mechanisms: Recommendations and Key Lengths, last  updated in February 2019 (available at: https:/ /www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Publications/TechGuidelines/TG02102/BSITR-02102-1.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=9 ).In particular, anonymisation standards should be combined  with clear rules imposing a rebuttable legal presumption ,  which would provide legal certainty for users, who could  rely on their data processing operations falling outside the  scope of the GDPR where the standard has been met. In  this context, it is important to remember that restrictions  may need to be imposed in these presumption rules, for  example on the period of validity (by way of analogy to  cryptographic procedures),24 or on the authorised methods  of processing (for example stating that data may not be  published or made accessible to an unspecified number  of people). As long as there is no legal basis for rebuttable  presumption rules, the Federal Government should  support the development of technical best practices  and  industry-specific codes of conduct , with a view to building  up experience in these fields. In certain fields, the standardisation of anonymisation  and pseudonymisation procedures may also impose  rules on the way in which the link between a data  subject and the data relating to him or her should be  broken, making it possible to compare different data  sets and improving interoperability . At least in areas  where improved interoperability is a sought-after  outcome, the Data Ethics Commission recommends that  context-specific rules should be developed for preferred  groupings (e.  g. value ranges of age categories, postcodes  or IP addresses). A similar approach is already followed  by Germany’s statistical offices when handling data,  for example.
132 PART E | D ATA Anonymisation and pseudonymisation procedures are  carried out on repositories of data that are known to (or  at least suspected to) contain personal data. These differ  from repositories of data that are not thought to contain  personal data, but could be used as a means or at least  a starting point (either on their own or in combination)  for creating a link between purportedly anonymous  data and the data subject to whom these data belong.  Once again, the Data Ethics Commission recommends  the development and binding implementation of  standardised methods for checking whether data  subjects can be identified from a set of data ; these  methods must allow the user to conclude with a  reasonable degree of certitude that the data are either  personal or non-personal. 4.2.2  Ban on de-anonymisation Presumption rules should also be accompanied by  appropriate bans on de-anonymisation , and any  infringement of these bans (i.  e. cases where it proves  possible to identify a data subject using formerly  anonymous data, for example as a result of technological  developments) should be subject to a penalty . The bans  would need to be designed in such a way as to avoid  placing roadblocks in the way of research into the detection  and removal of links between data and data subjects in  repositories of data, since any options for de-anonymisation  that are available must be investigated further with a view  to developing appropriate anonymisation standards and  verifying their effectiveness. In addition, the introduction  of bans on de-anonymisation and penalties for their  infringement must not be misused as a pretext for  downgrading the standards that apply to anonymisation or  diluting the meaning of the term “personal data” as used  in the GDPR, since companies involved in vitally important  efforts to drive forward the technology of anonymisation  using technical means would otherwise be placed at a  competitive disadvantage. The same applies to the reversal  of pseudonymisation in the absence of justified reasons (a  list of which should be drawn up). 25 Jörg Drechsler / Nicola Jentzsch: Synthetische Daten: Innovationspotenzial und gesellschaftliche Herausforderungen [Synthetic data: potential for  innovation and societal challenges], Stiftung Neue Verantwortung, May 2018 (available at: https:/ /www.stiftung-nv.de/sites/default/files/synthetische_ daten.pdf ).4.2.3  Synthetic data A distinction should be made between genuine data and  synthetic data , i. e. data that are generated artificially  rather than being collected directly in the real world.  Synthetic data boast several advantages over real-world  data;25 firstly, they can be produced in any quantity, which  is particularly important when dealing with simulations  for which real-world data cannot be generated. Secondly,  steps can be taken when synthetic data are created  to ensure that the entire range of values is mapped as  comprehensively as possible, e.  g. in order to test how  a technical system would behave when confronted  with unusual data combinations. Thirdly, the quality of  synthetic data can be measured, and if necessary it can be  guaranteed in individual cases that the properties of a set  of real-world reference data are retained; alternatively,  distortions occurring in sets of real-world data can be  pinpointed and removed in order to avoid discrimination.  If the set of synthetic data contains no references to  persons, it is anonymous and does not fall within the  scope of the GDPR. The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should support research in the  field of synthetic data  on a number of different issues,  including the question of whether, to what extent and  in which contexts synthetic data might replace realworld data in processing operations, and how closely the  synthetic data should resemble the real-world data in  terms of their properties. The Data Ethics Commission  recommends further investigations into the creation and  use of synthetic data, with a particular emphasis on topics  including data quality and the avoidance of bias and  discrimination.
133 E 4. IMPROVING  CONTROLLED  ACCESS  TO PERSONAL  DATA 4.3  Controlled data access through data  management and data trust schemes 4.3.1   Privacy management tools (PMT) and personal  information management systems (PIMS) In an ever more complex environment, one of the major  challenges faced by individuals in exercising their data  rights is a lack of oversight over personal data  – data  subjects typically have no records documenting the times  when they have granted consent, for example. Sharing  of data by the original data controller can also result  in the “scattering” of data, with a significant decrease  in transparency and a corresponding increase in data  protection risks for the data subjects (→ see section 3.3.6 above  regarding the problem of data trading) . There are currently not  enough standards and software tools that data subjects  can use to track and control, on an ongoing basis, who  has been granted access and to whom data have been  transferred, which would be necessary for them to  exercise their data rights effectively. An increasing number of technical and institutional  measures are being proposed in response to this  problem. Privacy management tools (PMT)  range from  applications that make consent management easier  for users (dashboards, etc.) through to AI tools that  automatically implement individual user preferences  (“data agents”). Where the focus is not so much on the  provision of technical applications but rather on the  service end, it is more common to use the term personal  information management systems (PIMS) . Such services  range from single sign-on services, local data safes  and online storage systems through to offers (both  comprehensive and less so) for third-party management  of user data (data trust models). When designed as  data trust models, PIMS may support digital selfdetermination by shouldering some of the responsibility for exercising the data subject’s rights under data  protection law, such as granting and withdrawing consent  and exercising the right to information, the right to rectify  data, the right to erase data, the right to data portability  and the right to object. The Data Ethics Commission  recommends that the Federal Government should  promote innovation and standardisation in relation to  software tools and services of this kind. 4.3.2  Need for regulation of PMT/PIMS The above notwithstanding, privacy management tools/ personal information management systems may pose  risks  if they fail to comply with certain requirements,  some of which go beyond the scope of the GDPR. If  these tools or systems fail to be properly designed, for  example, there is a risk that data subjects will not be  empowered to exercise true self-determination, but will  instead unwittingly find themselves on a path of external  determination . In particular, privacy management tools/ personal information management systems that are  designed in such a way that data subjects “write a blank  cheque” by handing over the majority of decisions to  the operators of these tools/systems, or that result in  data subjects taking decisions contrary to their own  interests under the influence of these tools/systems,  would ultimately be inconsistent with the ethical value of  self-determination. Privacy management tools/personal  information management systems must be available as  aids for data subjects, but they must not usurp the power  of these latter to take self-determined decisions, and they  must certainly not manipulate them using dark patterns  et al. (→ see section 3.2.2. above) .
134 PART E | D ATA Given the significant risks that these systems and  tools may pose to fundamental rights and the lack of  options for data subjects to carry out quality assurance  measures themselves, the Data Ethics Commission  recommends that the Federal Government should  develop quality standards for privacy management  tools/personal information management systems and  introduce a certification and monitoring system . The  latter should apply in particular to systems that act  on behalf of or in place of a data subject, or that – as  a result of their technical design – play a major role in  steering and channelling the data subject’s decisions.  In cases where data are stored directly by the operators  of these tools/systems (i.  e. if they are not stored on a  decentralised basis and simply managed, which is also  possible), provision must also be made for the company’s  insolvency or liquidation. Privacy management tools/personal information  management systems can operate reliably only if  cooperation on the part of all relevant controllers is  guaranteed. The only possibility to achieve the wideranging coverage required is by imposing a legal  obligation  that applies (under appropriate conditions)  to controllers within the meaning of the GDPR, with a  view to ensuring that any access to personal data can be  monitored by the tool/system and that any information  that is relevant in terms of data protection reaches the  tool/system so that the tool/system can effectively  protect the data subject’s interests in relation to all of  his or her personal data. A sector-specific approach  –  for social networks, for example – might be a realistic  option to start with.In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, systems of  this kind could either be operated on a non-profit basis  and without any involvement of commercially motivated  actors – such as by charitable foundations  and similar  independent bodies – or organised as private-sector  enterprises  provided that the operator derives profits  from managing rather than from using the data. In  either case, the fiduciary duties that are owed to the  data subject must be precisely defined in legislation,  the involvement of parties with conflicting interests  must be ruled out, and appropriate opportunities for  oversight must be built into the system as a whole (such  as to minimise bias and discrimination). If the privatesector option is chosen, it will also be necessary to  ensure that the operator’s commercial motivations do  not undermine the role it plays as custodian of the data  subject’s interests, and that operators that have access  to personal data are based in the European Union. The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should lobby for appropriate  amendments to the GDPR  in the form of a clearer  and legally secure framework for privacy management  tools/personal information management systems. Steps  should also be taken (in addition to action on legal  matters relating to mandates, etc.) to prevent excessive  centralised storage of personal data, since arrangements  of this kind increase the level of risk for data subjects in  the event of cyber attacks or similar incidents. Machineinterpretable formats and communication protocols  must be standardised for the automated execution  of services.
135 E 4. IMPROVING  CONTROLLED  ACCESS  TO PERSONAL  DATA 4.3.3   PMT/PIMS as a potential interface with the  data economy Provided that the appropriate regulations are adopted,  privacy management tools/personal information  management systems could also serve a dual function. On  the one hand, these tools/systems might help individuals  to exercise their right to informational self-determination  effectively and to verify compliance with any limitations  on use that have been imposed; on the other hand,  however, they could also be used to release data from the  confines of “data silos” and allow them to be used within  the European data economy (in particular by exercising  the right to data portability granted by Article 20 GDPR).  The main idea underlying privacy management tools/ personal information management systems is to improve  an individual’s control over his or her personal data,  which does not in and of itself promote third-party data  access. An indirect data access function might, however,  be compatible with the principle underpinning data trust  schemes  if third parties were allowed to access the data  only to pursue certain purposes approved by the data  subject (→ in connection with research, for example; see section 4.1.3  above) , or if the economic exploitation of the data served  the data subject’s interests and took place with his or  her express consent (→ see section 3.3 above for a discussion of the  problems raised by treating personal data as an economic asset) . The Data Ethics Commission believes that – if it is  decided that privacy management tools/personal  information management systems should play a dual  role and also serve as a platform for legally secure data  access by companies – it must be ensured that these  qualified dual-function tools/systems do not ultimately  subvert the goal of protecting data subjects’ rights. Strict  compliance with the principles of privacy and ethics  by design must be enforced; in particular, the objective  pursued must not be the broadest possible exploitation  (and “scattering”) of data. The Data Ethics Commission  wishes to emphasise the fact that privacy management  tools/personal information management systems  must continue to serve as dedicated custodians of data  subjects’ interests, and that conflicts of interest must  be ruled out .
136 PART E | D ATA 4.4 Data access through data portability 4.4.1  Promotion of data portability The right to data portability granted by Article 20 GDPR  is a tool that a data subject can use to determine whether  companies should gain access to his or her personal data  which another company has already collected, and if so,  which companies. It includes the right to receive the data  provided in a “structured, commonly used and machinereadable format” or to have them transmitted directly to  another controller. The right to data portability has two  main implications: a) It prevents unwanted lock-in effects if data subjects  switch providers, thereby protecting both the  individual data subjects’ right to economic selfdetermination and free competition. b) Even if data subjects do not switch providers, it allows  them to ask the controller to make the data available  either to them or to other companies. This provides  the other companies with an option for gaining access  to data that might otherwise not have been available  to them, bearing in mind that they need a separate  legal basis for data processing under data protection  law (e.  g. consent or a contract).26 26 For an example of the debates on the requirement for a separate legal basis of this kind under data protection law, see Article 29 Data Protection  Working Party: Guidelines on the right to data portability, WP 242, rev. 01, last revised and adopted on 5 April 2017, p. 7 (available at: http:/ /ec.europa. eu/newsroom/document.cfm?doc_id=44099 ).Despite the fact that providing data in a “structured,  commonly used and machine-readable format” is  a basic prerequisite that must be met in order for  data subjects to exercise the right to data portability  effectively, to date this requirement has been subject to  an enormous range of varying interpretations in practice.  The Data Ethics Commission therefore recommends  that the Federal Government and the data protection  authorities – in implementation of Recital 68 of the  GDPR – should support the development of industryspecific codes of conduct and standards at European  level so that the right to data portability can be realised  uniformly and effectively in practice, to the benefit of all  parties involved. In the absence of new intermediaries (→ see section  4.3 above) , the stimulus to exercise the right to data  portability often stems from a company that has gained  a new customer. Companies that offer a convenient  and automated process for data subjects to exercise  their right to data portability are likely to be particularly  successful (e.  g. a provider of a map service that allows  data to be ported from a mobility service provider at the  click of a button). There are also grounds for assuming –  in view of the potential for network effects and effects  of scale – that the companies likely to benefit most from  the right to data portability, at least in the medium term,  will be those that already hold a dominant position in  the market and have accumulated huge amounts of data.  The Data Ethics Commission therefore recommends that  the Federal Government should observe developments  closely  and, in so far as it judges necessary, lobby at  European level for measures that specifically encourage  and facilitate the porting of data from market-dominant  and data-rich companies to other market participants,  including start-ups.
137 E 4. IMPROVING  CONTROLLED  ACCESS  TO PERSONAL  DATA 4.4.2   Should the scope of the right to data portability  be extended? Debates are ongoing on whether the scope of the right  to data portability should be extended in various ways,  in particular by expanding it to cover data other than the  (raw) data provided to a controller (e.  g. certain forms of  processed or derived data), or by widening it to include  a right to dynamic real-time portability (e.  g. real-time  streaming of data flows). As things currently stand, and  further to the above recommendation, the Data Ethics  Commission proposes that the Federal Government  should not lobby for amendments to the GDPR aimed at  extending the scope of the current right to portability;  given that the GDPR has been in force for such a short  period of time, a “wait and see” approach should instead  be adopted until more clarity has been gained on its  practical application, supervisory practice by the data  protection authorities and interpretation by the courts. 4.4.3   From portability to interoperability and  interconnectivity Network effects (e.  g. in the case of messenger services)  mean that data portability alone will not be sufficient  to mitigate the risks posed by existing and future data  and service oligopolies, or to lower the barriers to  market entry for new competitors to the extent that they  represent a serious challenge to the market-dominant  providers. The Data Ethics Commission therefore  recommends that the Federal Government should push  for the introduction of sector-specific interoperability  obligations , of the sort that have previously been  imposed for postal services and mobile telephony, for  example. At the same time, measures must be taken to  ensure that interoperability features comply with data  protection principles, such as privacy-friendly default  settings; examples include an option to use different and  changing identifiers instead of a single universal identifier,  a reduction in the use of central components to collect  large volumes of data, and other suitable examples of  interoperable technical interaction at different levels.Asymmetric interoperability obligations  could be  imposed on powerful companies and new market  entrants  respectively (for example, a market-dominant  provider of messenger services might be obliged to allow  customers of smaller providers to send messages directly  to its own customers and to allow its own customers  to send messages directly to the customers of smaller  providers); at the same time, however, it must be ensured  that interoperability requirements are not abused for the  purpose of increasing yet further the flow of personal  data towards data-rich and powerful companies. If  this risk can reliably be averted, it would be useful to  impose certain interconnectivity obligations, e.  g. for  short messaging services and social networks , with a  view to counteracting the concentration effects of these  networks and promoting the aims of data portability  more effectively (i.  e. healthier competition and easier  access for new market entrants to a data-intensive  economy). A model of this kind is also a prerequisite for  building up or strengthening certain basic services of an  information society in Europe, thereby promoting the  digital sovereignty of both Germany and Europe.
138 PART E | D ATA 4.5 Crowdsensing for the public good Crowdsensing has also been hailed as a way of opening  up new data resources for the data society and data  economy; in order to do so, it deploys users’ technical  devices in the form of “sensors” that collect data (in  a certain locality, for example) and forward them to a  higher-level instance that analyses the collected data.  The Data Ethics Commission acknowledges the potential  inherent to this technology, especially if it is put to  use for the public good . For example, crowdsensing  can be used in a smart city for real-time analysis of  traffic conditions, the state of repair of infrastructure,  air quality and so on. At the same time, however,  the Data Ethics Commission believes that achieving  an ethically appropriate design will be a significant  challenge. An analysis carried out using crowdsensing  techniques will typically have an extremely high level  of granularity, meaning that the data involved may fall  under the category of “sensitive” not only from the  perspective of the individuals that generated them, but  under certain circumstances also from the perspective  of anyone in their vicinity. Efforts must therefore be  stepped up to introduce standards for anonymisation  and pseudonymisation  (→ see section 4.2 above)  with a view  to preventing not only situations in which data can be  traced back to (non-consenting) users or potentially to  other persons affected, but also other forms of misuse.  Crowdsensing-related data transfers may also overstrain  the resources of users’ devices and raise security issues.Consideration must be given to these points even if users  participate voluntarily and intentionally in crowdsensing  programmes (“participatory sensing”), and thought  must therefore be given to the substantive limitations  to consent that exist in this connection (→ see section  3.2 above) . Even when data are used for purposes that  serve the public good, it must always be ensured that  the requirements outlined in legislation – in particular  data protection law and consumer protection law –  are complied with in full. In this case, it should also  be remembered that decisions and measures taken  by government agencies must not be based solely or  customarily on data collected using participatory sensing  techniques, since these data are necessarily incomplete   owing to the voluntary nature of participation, and it is  likely that they will also exhibit bias. The Data Ethics Commission believes that any discussion  of whether crowdsensed personal data should be  collected, forwarded and compiled without the user’s  knowledge (“opportunistic sensing”) ignores the  potential for such measures to violate the fundamental  principles of data protection. It believes that decisions  must be taken on a case-by-case basis as to whether a  legal obligation  can justifiably be imposed to force data  subjects to make available technical devices so that the  data from these devices can be collected and forwarded  automatically, if and to the extent that the analysis of  these data promotes vital public interests.
139 Summary of the most important  recommendations for action Improving controlled access to personal data 16 The Data Ethics Commission identifies enormous  potential in the use of data for research purposes that  serve a public interest (e.  g. to improve healthcare  provision). Data protection law as it currently stands  acknowledges this potential, in principle, by granting  far-reaching privileges for the processing of personal data  for research purposes. Uncertainty persists, however, in  particular as regards the scope of the so-called research  privilege for secondary use of data, and the scope of  what counts as “research” in the context of product  development. The Data Ethics Commission believes that  appropriate clarifications in the law  are necessary to  rectify this situation. 17 The fragmentation of research-specific data protection  law, both within Germany itself and among the EU  Member States, represents a potential obstacle to datadriven research. The Data Ethics Commission therefore  recommends that research-specific regulations should  be harmonised , both between federal and Land  level  and between the different legal systems within the EU.  Introducing a notification requirement for research-   specific national law could also bring some improvement,  as could the establishment of a European clearing house  for cross-border research projects. 18 In the case of research involving particularly sensitive  categories of personal data (e.  g. health data), guidelines   should be produced with information for researchers on  how to obtain consent in a legally compliant manner,  and innovative consent models should be promoted  and explicitly recognised by the law . Potential options  include the development and roll-out of digital consent  assistants or the recognition of so-called meta consent,  alongside further endeavours to clarify the scope of the  research privilege for secondary use of data. 19 The Data Ethics Commission supports, in principle, the  move towards a “learning healthcare system” , in which  healthcare provision is continuously improved by making  systematic and quality-oriented use of the health data  generated on a day-to-day basis, in keeping with the  principles of evidence-based medicine. If further progress  is made in this direction, however, greater efforts must be  made at the same time to protect data subjects against  the significant potential for discrimination that exists  when sensitive categories of data are used; this might  involve prohibiting the exploitation of such data  beyond  the defined range of purposes.
140 PART E | D ATA 20 The development of procedures and standards for data  anonymisation  and pseudonymisation  is central to  any efforts to improve controlled access to (formerly)  personal data. A legal presumption that, if compliance  with the standard has been achieved, data no longer  qualify as personal, or that “appropriate safeguards” have  been provided in respect of the data subject’s rights,  would improve legal certainty by a long way. These  measures should be accompanied by rules that – on pain  of criminal penalty – prohibit the de-anonymisation  of anonymised data (e.  g. because new technology  becomes available that would allow the re-identification  of data subjects) or the reversal of pseudonymisation,  both in the absence of narrowly defined grounds for  doing so. Also research in the field of synthetic data   shows enormous promise, and more funding should be  funnelled into this area. 21 Fundamentally speaking, the Data Ethics Commission  believes that innovative data management and data  trust schemes hold great potential, provided that these  systems are designed to be robust, suited to real-life  applications and compliant with data protection law.  A broad spectrum of models falls under this heading,  ranging from dashboards that perform a purely technical  function ( privacy management tools , PMT) right through  to comprehensive data and consent management services  (personal information management services , PIMS). The  underlying aim is to empower individuals to take control  over their personal data, while not overburdening them  with decisions that are beyond their capabilities. The  Data Ethics Commission recommends that research and  development in the field of data management and data  trust schemes should be identified as a funding priority,  but also wishes to make it clear that adequate protection  of the rights and legitimate interests of all parties  involved will require additional regulatory measures  at EU level . These regulatory measures would need to  secure central functions without which operators cannot be active, since their scope for action would otherwise  be very limited. On the other hand, it is also necessary to  protect individuals against parties that they assume to be  acting in their interests, but that, in reality, are prioritising  their own financial aims or the interests of others. In  the event that a feasible method of protection can be  found, data trust schemes could serve as vitally important  mediators between data protection interests and data  economy interests. 22 As far as the right to data portability  enshrined in Article  20 GDPR is concerned, the Data Ethics Commission  recommends that industry-specific codes of conduct and  standards on data formats should be adopted. Given that  the underlying purpose of Article 20 GDPR is not only  to make it more straightforward to change provider, but  also to allow other providers to access data more easily,  it is important to evaluate carefully the market impact of  the existing right to portability and to analyse potential  mechanisms by which it can be prevented that a small  number of providers increase yet further their market  power. Until the findings of this evaluation are available,  expansion of the scope of this right (for example to cover  data other than data provided by the data subject, or  real-time porting of data) would seem premature and not  advisable. 23 In certain sectors, for example messenger services and  social networks, interoperability or  interconnectivity   obligations  might help to reduce the market entry  barriers for new providers. Such obligations should be  designed on an asymmetric basis, i.  e. the stringency of  the regulation should increase in step with the  company’s  market share. Interoperability and interconnectivity  obligations would also be a prerequisite for building up  or strengthening, within and for Europe, certain basic  services of an information society.
141 E 5. DEBATES  AROUND  ACCESS  TO NON -PERSONAL  DATA 5. Debates around access to non-personal data The data economy will play a key role in the future  competitiveness of German and European companies;  the growing penetration of the Internet of Things (IoT)  and the Internet of Services (IoS) means that data  which are collected automatically by sensors and which  can potentially serve as a basis for developing new  business models and innovations are acquiring evergreater industrial significance. Germany is at the cutting  edge of developments  as far as many IoT/IoS-related  technologies are concerned (e.  g. sensor technology,  mechanical engineering and embedded systems), and  also plays a leading role in the broader field of industrial  production and the digital services that cater for this  sector; given the increasingly cut-throat nature of  international competition, it must build on this head start  in order to safeguard the country’s future prosperity. A  differentiated and robust research landscape, a diversified  economic structure and a reputation as a global leader  in key technological segments such as Industry 4.0 put  Germany in the perfect position to leverage the potential  associated with the data economy as a basis for creating  future value. 5.1  Appropriate data access as a  macroeconomic asset The Data Ethics Commission believes that providing  appropriate access to data for German and European  companies and decreasing the current level of dependency  on a small number of data oligarchs would go a long  way towards building a market-oriented data economy  that serves the public good, and towards strengthening  the digital sovereignty of both Germany and Europe.  In this connection, data access in the narrower sense  firstly relates to the extent to which the data required  for a particular business model or other project can be  used on a de jure  and de facto  basis . In order to benefit  from access to data  in this narrower sense, however,  stakeholders must have a sufficient degree of dataawareness  and have the data skills  that are necessary to  make use of the data. Also, access to data proves to be  disproportionately advantageous to stakeholders that  have already built up the largest reserves of data  and  that have the best data infrastructures  at hand. The Data  Ethics Commission therefore wishes to stress that the factors referred to should always receive due attention  when discussing whether and how to improve access, in  keeping with the ASISA principle  (Awareness – Skills –  Infrastructures – Stocks – Access) . The discussions in this section focus on non-personal  data. Genuinely non-personal data  hold enormous  potential for science, the economy and society, and yet  this potential is often underestimated. Most scientific  data can be categorised as non-personal; these include  data originating from the technical sciences (e.  g.  engineering and materials science), data from the fields  of physics (e.  g. data from particle accelerators), biology  (e. g. data from the plant and animal kingdoms), geology  and chemistry, environmental data, weather data and  ocean data right through to economic data (e.  g. data  from the financial markets). If they can be analysed (using  big data methods, for example) and used (to develop  AI applications, for example), these non-personal data  hold enormous value for science, the economy and  society; focused support must therefore be provided to  researchers using these data, and systematic efforts must  be undertaken to make data access an easier task. The broad nature of the GDPR’s definition of “personal  data” means that it can safely be assumed that a  substantial proportion of data repositories are mixed  in nature (i.  e. contain both non-personal data and data  that are or could become personal); at the same time,  the processing of personal data is a vital prerequisite for  certain activities that fall under the heading of the data  economy and that provide benefits for both individuals  and the general public. Any discussion of data access  that concentrates solely on non-personal data would  therefore appear counter-productive. A more appropriate  approach would be to work towards general data access  arrangements  that are superseded by data protection law   only in cases where personal data are processed (meaning  that activities falling under the heading of the data  economy would need to comply with the provisions of the  GDPR). Equally, it should not be forgotten that the GDPR  already allows the economic exploitation of personal data  in many circumstances; in addition to consent, for example  (Article 6(1)(a) GDPR), there are five additional justifying  grounds (Article 6(1)(b)–(f)), some of which are explicitly  tailored to economic interests and needs.
142 PART E | D ATA 5.2  Creation of the necessary framework  conditions 5.2.1  Awareness raising and data skills The use of data to create value presupposes that  operators (whether they belong to the private sector or  serve a public interest) are adequately well-informed  about the relevant options and risks, and also have  the data skills required (which may involve drawing  on technical, economic, ethical and legal knowledge;  (→ see Part D, section 3. above) . In certain areas of the German  economy , companies have still not tapped into the  potential that exists to make more productive use of their  data flows and repositories (in some cases for the benefit  of the public). The Data Ethics Commission welcomes  the steps that have been taken to raise awareness and  build digital skills by various stakeholders (e.  g. chambers  of industry and commerce, associations or vocational  institutions). A value-based approach to improving data  skills across the board is, however, required, for example  in the form of initial and continuing training courses . A  further objective of these courses must always be to raise  awareness of the risks posed to individuals and society  from the viewpoint of data protection law and ethics. Government bodies  have been slow to recognise the  import and implications of the huge volumes of data  they have already generated (for statistical purposes,  for example), and the advantages and risks entailed  by models in which they share data with businesses  (government-to-business (G2B) data sharing) or in  which the businesses share operating data with them  (business-to-government (B2G) data sharing). The current  reticence on the part of public authorities to utilise  these opportunities means that a large-scale shift in  mindset is required, modelled on forerunners in the field  of e-governance such as the Scandinavian countries or  Estonia. The Data Ethics Commission also recommends  that the Federal Government should support work in this  area by the relevant research institutions.5.2.2   Building the infrastructures needed for a databased economy Although Germany continues to occupy a leading  position in the field of science and technology research,  the tech companies providing vital data and analysis  infrastructures for the new digital economy primarily  hail from the USA (and increasingly from China). This  means that a great deal of European data – consumer  data, enterprise data and research data – is stored outside  Europe and analysed in third countries using software  belonging to non-European companies. This makes it  crucially important for Germany to develop a data-based  economy using home-grown infrastructures . The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should support the following  measures at European level , which have been initiated by  the European Commission:  a) establishment and expansion of the Support Centre  for data sharing; b) development of model contracts for the data  economy; c) support for forums and consortiums tasked with  developing open standards for legally compliant data  exchanges, in particular formats and programming  interfaces (APIs) that are tailored to data exchanges  and that increase the traceability of data flows; d) promotion of European platforms for legally  compliant data exchanges; and e) establishment of a European Open Science Cloud  (EOSC). Key precursors to the achievement of digital sovereignty  by Germany include access control  for sensitive data and  the option to carry out appropriate audits  on critical data  analysis software, which would require manufacturers to  disclose their source code and design criteria, for example.  Given the ethically problematic nature of these analyses,  they should, wherever possible, be carried out within the  geographical purview of the German legal system.
143 E 5. DEBATES  AROUND  ACCESS  TO NON -PERSONAL  DATA The Data Ethics Commission expressly welcomes  a number of initiatives  by the Federal Government  and other stakeholders aimed at creating secure  international data spaces (spearheaded by Germany) for  different application domains, allowing companies and  organisations of all sizes and from all sectors of industry  to retain sovereignty over their data and exchange data  securely with each other.The Data Ethics Commission also recommends the  setting up of an ombudsman’s office  at federal level  to provide assistance and support in relation to the  negotiation of problematic data access agreements and  dispute settlement. The competent data protection  authorities should be consulted on cases involving  personal data, and decision-making power must  ultimately rest with the aforementioned authorities in  order to avoid conflicting decisions. Establishment of data infrastructures The Federal Government’s initiatives  aimed at  establishing data infrastructures include the following: f) Efforts by the German Research Foundation  (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft)  to establish a  national research data infrastructure, the aim of  which is to implement a science-driven process  that systematically opens up data repositories  and provides long-term data storage, backup and  accessibility across the boundaries of different  disciplines and Länder . g) The open International Data Spaces Consortium  (IDS, formerly Industrial Data Space) promoted by  the Federal Ministry of Education and Research,  the aim of which is to provide the companies and  organisations taking part with a standardised  interface to a platform for exchanging data, based  on a federal architecture concept. h) An initiative to develop a comprehensive network  of big data and AI centres, with nodes distributed  throughout Germany, as part of a national and  generally accessible ecosystem. The aim is for  this network not only to provide access to a large  amount and variety of data on a 24/7 basis, but at  the same time for it to offer easy-to-use tools along  the entire data value creation chain (preparation,  analysis, visualisation, exploitation) and develop  them further on the basis of user feedback.In addition to these technical platforms, other  interesting developments include platforms developed  by the Federal Government in collaboration with  associations with a view to promoting coordinated  research and development and the standardisation  and practical implementation of data-hungry  applications in the form of socially and economically  innovative future projects, such as Industry 4.0, Smart  Service World and Learning Systems. At European level, the European Commission  is  implementing similar projects (e.  g. the futureoriented FIWARE project), and is currently developing  a freely available toolbox of open-source software  components that can be used to configure innovative  Internet services in a short space of time. The Big  Data Value Public-Private Partnership (organised by  the European Commission and the Big Data Value  Association, BDVA) has developed an interoperable  data-driven ecosystem at European level as a  launchpad for new business models using big data,  which has already delivered an impressive number  of flagship projects. Lastly, the European Institute of  Innovation and Technology (EIT Digital) has fostered  the emergence of a Europe-wide technical and  economic ecosystem involving 180 companies and  research institutions.
144 PART E | D ATA 5.2.3  Sustainable and strategic economic policy As far as the data economy is concerned, the biggest  challenges facing Europe include the lack of sustainable   funding that is so often a problem for research projects,  and a paucity of venture capital  (the latter being required  to make ideas that have already been developed marketready and inject capital at the appropriate points so  that start-ups can reach a competitive size). One of  the reasons why the USA has been so successful in the  field of digital products and services is because of the  country’s many “angels” willing not only to invest billions  into high-risk projects, but, in many cases, to forfeit  those investments. Another trend worth noting is that  innovative companies are often bought out  by foreign  companies or forced by international investors to move  their headquarters to other countries outside Europe. Thinking outside the box of the “European path”  explicitly endorsed by the Data Ethics Commission (→ see  Part G, below) , German start-ups must be given access to a  larger pool of funding  and better tax incentives  so that  Germany can continue to attract the brightest and the  best and remain at the cutting edge. Sectors such as education, public administration and  medicine are characterised by a high level of public  interest and the existence of mandatory values (as  expressed through the legal system and professional  ethics). At the same time, there is enormous potential  to achieve efficiency gains through digitalisation and  AI in these sectors, and global platforms have not yet  gained a stranglehold over the market to the same  extent as in other areas. The Data Ethics Commission  therefore recommends that public funding should be  channelled into these three areas in particular, and that  it should be used to incentivise the development of  platforms  in Germany that reflect our values and are also  internationally scalable. 27 This solution is endorsed in Preliminary Drafts no. 2 (February 2019) and no. 3 (October 2019) of the ALI-ELI Principles for a Data Economy  (see footnote 1 above), for example.5.2.4  Improved industrial property protection Also from the perspective of the data economy, the  Data Ethics Commission does not see any benefit in  introducing new exclusive rights  to data (often discussed  using the terms “data ownership” or “data producer  right”, → see section 3.3.2 above ). Rights of this kind, which  would need to be incorporated into (and aligned with) the  existing provisions of data protection law or intellectual  property law or the rules on the right of personality, trade  secrets, ownership rights to storage media, etc., would  do nothing but increase the (already significant) level  of complexity and legal uncertainty, without any clear  indication that rights of this kind would be necessary or  even particularly helpful in making data more marketable. The Data Ethics Commission does, nevertheless, believe  that the calls made by industry and government bodies  to afford limited third-party effects  to contractual  agreements (e.  g. to restrictions on data utilisation and  onward transfer of data by a recipient) are justified.  Under the legal situation as it currently stands, thirdparty effects of this kind are at most afforded in extreme  situations (unless protection under intellectual property  rights law applies, including the “sui generis” protection  of databases). Consideration should be given to extending  the scope of recognition of third-party effects, along the  lines of the model provided by Article 4(4) of the Trade  Secrets Directive (Directive (EU) 2016/943);27 according  to this approach, the acquisition, use or disclosure of data  would also be considered unlawful whenever a person,  at the time of the acquisition, use or disclosure, knew  or ought, under the circumstances, to have known that  the data had been obtained directly or indirectly from  another person who was using or disclosing the data  unlawfully. This approach would further the interests of  the data economy and also fit seamlessly into the existing  (primarily contract-focused) model.
145 E 5. DEBATES  AROUND  ACCESS  TO NON -PERSONAL  DATA 5.2.5  Data partnerships The Data Ethics Commission believes that cautious  development of the current legal framework would  also be appropriate in the field of anti-trust law . The  breakneck pace of developments in the data economy  poses fresh challenges for this field of law; in return,  the provisions of anti-trust law pose fresh challenges  for digital companies. The Data Ethics Commission  recommends that the Federal Government should pay  particularly close attention to the opportunities and risks  entailed by data partnerships ; consideration should be  given to the introduction of a mandatory but confidential  procedure for notifying data partnerships to the anti-trust  authorities and to the supervisory authorities under data  protection law (in the case of personal data). Mention  should also be made of the proposals presented by the  Commission of Experts on Competition Law 4.0 under the  headings of “data exchange” and “data pooling”.5.3  Data access in existing value creation  systems 5.3.1  Context Fair and efficient data access  plays a significant role in  modern value creation systems. The area of law most  suitable for regulating fairly and efficiently the ability  of various stakeholders to access data in a commercial  context is contract law , since this is the branch of the  legal system where the autonomy of private entities  (“private autonomy”) is expressed most explicitly. At the  same time, there is a general presumption that freely  negotiated agreements – except in cases of market  failure – achieve an efficient allocation of resources and  thus increase the general level of prosperity. Unfair and inefficient contractual arrangements  may  arise, however, as a result of imbalances of power and  information asymmetry; for example, certain issues  relating to data access are typically underestimated  during the negotiation process, with the result that they  are skimmed over or omitted entirely. Given the dynamic  nature of data-specific interests and the correspondingly  dynamic assessment of data rights and data obligations  (→ see section 2.1 above) , it is often difficult for parties to  determine what exactly a data access regime should  look like in order for it to remain fair and efficient for the  entire term of the contract. In a not insignificant number  of cases, it is accordingly found at a later date – after the  contract has been put to the test in the real world – that  the balance of interests has shifted in unpredictable ways  to benefit one or the other party, with a major impact  on the equilibrium of rights and obligations that was  originally agreed. Since one of the parties typically stands  to benefit from the new state of affairs, contracts are  often not renegotiated, and so there is no opportunity to  regulate data access properly and efficiently.
146 PART E | D ATA Particularly in complex value creation systems, there is  frequently no direct contractual relationship between  the party requesting access and the party that effectively  controls the data (because there is an interposing link  in the distribution chain, for example); in the interests  of fairness and efficiency, however, data access  arrangements would be desirable. In the B2B sector,  incursions into freedom of contract in the form of an  obligation to contract currently result almost exclusively  from the provisions of anti-trust law, as well as a small  number of general provisions of law in the case of  essential commodities and monopoly positions; generally  speaking, however, they are restricted to a small number  of extreme situations. 5.3.2  Presence of a contractual relationship In the estimation of the Data Ethics Commission,  the steps that should initially be taken with a view to  ensuring fair and efficient data access arrangements  include raising awareness and promoting digital skills   (→ see section 5.2.1 above) , practical support in the form of  model contracts  that provide for a fair distribution of  data access, and infrastructures and intermediaries  that  facilitate shared data use while ensuring protection of  trade secrets, for example (→ see section 5.2.2 above) . 28 European Commission: Towards a common European data space, COM(2018) 232 final, 25 April 2018, p. 10 (available at: https:/ /ec.europa.eu/ transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2018/EN/COM-2018-232-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF ).In cases where a contractual relationship already exists,  the principles of fair data access can be enforced primarily  through contract interpretation  (including by way of  gap-filling by the courts), for example by assuming the  existence of appropriate contractual ancillary obligations,  and through standard contract terms control  pursuant  to Section 307 of the Civil Code (“fairness test”). However,  one of the problems inherent to substantive fairness  tests is the virtual absence of default provisions that can  be used as a benchmark for these tests. Specific abusive  contractual practices could therefore be spelt out explicitly  as blacklisted contract terms (→ see section 3.2.3 above for  corresponding recommendations for B2C contracts) . If significant  changes occur since the conclusion of the contract it  may be possible for a party to invoke the provisions on  frustration of contract (Section 313 of the Civil Code). In this connection, the Data Ethics Commission wishes to  reiterate the general basic principles governing businessto-government (B2G) data sharing  as formulated by  the European Commission  in its communication of  April 2018 entitled “Towards a common European data  space”.28 These basic principles provide for the following: a) transparency regarding access rights and the purposes  for using the data; b) recognition that several parties have contributed  to shared value creation; c) respect for each other’s commercial interests; d) undistorted competition; and e) minimised data lock-in. Particularly with regard to repositories that potentially  include personal data as well as non-personal data,  consideration could also be given to expanding these  principles to include a right to informational selfdetermination for data subjects and the principle of “do  no harm”.
147 E 5. DEBATES  AROUND  ACCESS  TO NON -PERSONAL  DATA 5.3.3  Absence of a contractual relationship Where there is no contractual relationship at all  between participants in a value creation system,  despite any support provided, neither the rules on the  interpretation of contracts nor the substantive fairness  tests for standard contract terms apply, and it is also  impossible to rely on frustration. In the view of the Data  Ethics Commission, however, the simple fact that the  party requesting access has contributed to generation  of the data means that a special legal relationship exists  between this party and the party that effectively controls  the data (→ see section 2.1 above) ; this is all the more true if  the relationship exists within a value creation system  that is primarily shaped by contracts. This special legal  relationship may give rise to certain duties of a fiduciary  nature, including a duty to enter into negotiations  about fair and efficient data access arrangements . The  future legal framework should make explicit reference  to this fact.  The Data Ethics Commission therefore recommends  amending Section 311 of the Civil Code  to include a new  subparagraph mentioning the special relationship that  exists between participants in a value creation system  (e. g. as suppliers, manufacturers, brokers or end users),  which would entail certain relevant duties, including with  regard to data. The enormous significance of data for  general legal and economic relations means that there are  justified grounds for inserting a subparagraph in the law  rather than subsuming such relations under the general  heading of “similar business contacts”. This would neither  constitute a separate legal basis for the processing of  personal data, nor would it restrict data protection law in  any way. 29 For a discussion of personal data, see Louisa Specht: Datenrechte – Eine Rechts- und Sozialwissenschaftliche Analyse im Vergleich Deutschland –  USA, Teil 1: Rechtsvergleichende Analyse des zivilrechtlichen Umgangs mit Daten in den Rechtsordnungen Deutschlands und der USA, ABIDAGutachten [Data rights, an analysis from the perspective of the legal and social sciences based on a comparison between Germany and the USA,  Part 1: Comparative law analysis of data governance under civil law within the framework of the German and US legal systems], 2017, pp. 89 et seqq.  (available at: http:/ /www.abida.de/sites/default/files/ABIDA_Gutachten_Datenrechte.pdf ); for a discussion of non-personal data, see ALI-ELI Principles  for a Data Economy (above, footnote 1).Beyond this, consideration could be given to introducing  data-specific rules in the law of obligations  based on the  principles referred to above (→ in section 2) , aimed at judicial  “gap-filling” and for use as a benchmark when carrying  out substantive fairness tests on standard contract  terms.29 In particular, provisions for data contracts of this  kind might define the conditions under which parties are  entitled to access data and/or to request desistance from  data access or data use and/or to request the rectification  of data. However, the Data Ethics Commission was also  concerned that, if such rules were specifically spelt out in  the law (albeit as default rules only) this might give rise to  additional disputes. 5.3.4  Sector-specific data access rights If a need is identified for more extensive data access  rights within existing value creation systems, priority  should be given to sector-specific solutions. The Data  Ethics Commission therefore recommends that the  Federal Government should pay greater attention  to data access issues when adopting and/or revising  sector-specific regulations.
148 PART E | D ATA 5.4 Open data in the public sector  5.4.1  Preliminary considerations The recently revised Directive (EU) 2019/1024 on open  data and the re-use of public sector information (PSI  Directive) and (at national level) the [German] Information  Reuse Act ( Informationsweiterverwendungsgesetz , IWG),  the [German] E-Government Act ( E-Government-Gesetz ,  EGovG) and additional special acts provide a sound  legislative basis for the disclosure of public-sector data  on the basis of OGD concepts. The premise underlying  the concept of open government data is that citizens and  companies have already subsidised the generation of the  data through the taxes they pay , and should therefore be  allowed to share in the associated benefits rather than  incurring a double financial burden. Making public-sector  data available for reuse by the private sector also benefits  the European data economy; since open government data  often hold enormous potential for private-sector value  creation , companies can use them to develop new and  innovative products and services, helping to increase the  general level of prosperity in the process. Looking beyond the economy, access to government  data is also vitally important for democracy and an  open debate involving all of society , since it increases  administrative transparency, facilitates participation  and allows oversight and fact-based discussions. Open  government data can also be used in many different  shapes and forms for social initiatives and innovations  (for social or ecological purposes, for example). As a basic principle, therefore, the Data Ethics Commission  supports the Open Data Charter  adopted at the G8  Summit in 2013, which defines the following as central  principles for the governance of administrative data: a) open by default (the expectation that administrative  data will be made public without compromising the  right to privacy);b) quality and quantity (high-quality, timely and fully  described open data); c) usable by anyone (as much data as possible, in as many  open formats as possible); d) improved governance through open data (transparency  and sharing of expertise regarding data collection,  standards and publication procedures); e) innovation (user consultations and support for future  generations of creative minds). Ethically speaking, if a government body decided to  provide commercial operators with free-of-charge  access to its data instead of selling them for a profit or  otherwise exploiting them for economic purposes, this  decision would need to be justified (on an approximated  basis) by corresponding increases in prosperity  at the  macrosocial level. The Data Ethics Commission also wishes to draw  attention to a degree of tension between calls for privacy  by default on the one hand and open by default on the  other, and – in a broader sense – between the debate on  data protection  and the debate on open government  data . If personal data are made public in a legally  compliant manner on the basis of open-data concepts,  there is no guarantee that the security mechanisms  put in place to protect the right to informational  self-determination (in the form of explicit or implicit  restrictions on reuse or in the form of technical and  organisational protection measures) will continue to be  applied. The general provisions of data protection law  concerning reuse can also be an issue. Furthermore,  since Article 30 GDPR requires only the “categories of  recipients” to be documented, and government bodies  are almost never in a position to monitor compliance  with the “appropriate safeguards” required pursuant to  Article 89 GDPR, the disclosure of data that are, or might  at some point become, personal data can be regarded as a  potentially high-risk measure for data subjects.
149 E 5. DEBATES  AROUND  ACCESS  TO NON -PERSONAL  DATA When applying OGD concepts in this area, the right to  informational self-determination that is protected as a  fundamental right must always be weighed up carefully  against the public-good interests pursued under the OGD  banner, the right to freedom of information (which is  also protected as a fundamental right), and the freedom  of OGD recipients to exercise a trade or profession. The  Data Ethics Commission submits that, in cases of doubt,  priority should be given to the State’s duty of protection .  Compliance with this duty is all the more important  because individuals may not be able to decide freely  which data they entrust to government bodies, or may be  particularly apt to believe  that government bodies will  refrain from forwarding personal data to third parties. 5.4.2  Legal framework and infrastructures  The Data Ethics Commission welcomes the Federal  Government’s National Action Plan to implement the  G8 Open Data Charter and the efforts on the part of  the Federal Government and the governments of the  Länder  to include OGD concepts when digitalising  their administrations. It recommends that the Federal  Government should take action to ensure across-theboard implementation of an obligation to publish  structured unprocessed data (open by default)  and  to allow these data to be used without limitations  and, in principle, free of charge, which already applies  to the direct federal administration (Section 12a(1)  E-Government Act). Given the aforementioned tension  between open government data and data protection, the  obligations imposed by Section 12a of the E-Government  Act should only apply in relation to certain types of  data (in particular those that have undergone effective  anonymisation procedures).The Data Ethics Commission welcomes the legislator’s  attempts to change the data governance culture within  the administration, and acknowledges that this is a  task made significantly more challenging by the highly  fragmented nature of the current legal situation . It is  often difficult – both for authorities and for potential  OGD users – to forge a path through a tangled regulatory  thicket made up of different legal regimes that set out  general and specialised rules on access to data, reuse of  data and e-governance at both Federal Government and  Land  level. A further complicating factor is the interplay  between these regulations, data protection law and  intellectual property rights (in particular copyright law),  which is often fiendishly complex in practice. In this  connection, the Data Ethics Commission recommends  merging  and synchronising  the various legal bases that  exist in Germany, as well as clarifying  the demarcation  lines between the various legal arrangements. Another obstacle that stands in the way of the culture  change that needs to take place is the fact that it is  currently all but impossible to verify reliably whether the  authorities are, in fact, complying with the data provision  obligations already in force. For example, Section 12a(1) of  the E-Government Act imposes an obligation on the direct  federal administrative authorities to provide public access  to data, but explicitly states that parties requesting access  have no enforceable right  to the data being made publicly  available. Companies that wish to access data are therefore  deprived of effective avenues for forcing the authorities to  comply with the statutory obligation of making data open  by default. In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, the  introduction of a right to request publication of data  might  encourage a more proactive approach to the provision of  open data on the part of the administrative authorities,  within the limits placed on their obligation to do so by the  E-Government Act and the Information Reuse Act. The quality standards  that must be achieved in respect  of the data provided by government bodies are another  question that is left open under the current legal situation.  In particular, the E-Government Act states that the  obligation to provide access to data can be met by handing  over unprocessed data, but data can be reused easily and in  a manner that complies with the OGD objectives only if a  high level of data quality is guaranteed.
150 PART E | D ATA Aside from the legal framework, establishment or  expansion of an infrastructure framework  (e. g. open  government data portals such as GovData) is also  essential, particularly at local level (e.  g. in the form  of municipal platforms), and the same applies to  investments in appropriate quality assurance tools. 5.4.3  The State’s duty of protection Keeping in mind the State’s duty to protect all of the data  entrusted to it, appropriate precautions  must be taken  to ensure that central interests of private individuals  (e. g. those relating to personal data, operating and trade  secrets or other sensitive data, such as confidential  information relating to public procurement procedures)  are given the same comprehensive level of protection as  key public interests (e.  g. security interests or interests  relating to national sovereignty). The ethical premise  underpinning the OGD concept – that citizens and  companies have already paid for the data through their  tax contributions – places certain constraints on reuse .  In particular, care must be taken to ensure that data are  not used by the private sector to develop services and  products that may ultimately restrict the freedom of  citizens and businesses and/or be available only to them  under unfair conditions.The Data Ethics Commission therefore recommends  that the Federal Government should make use of the  opportunity afforded by Article 8 of the recast PSI  Directive by developing model conditions  for standard  licences, including restricted-use agreements and  conditions for the transfer of data to third parties;  alternatively, it should lobby for such conditions to be  introduced at European level. It may even be advisable  to make these model conditions mandatory , at least on  a sector-specific basis, and they should be based on a  number of key considerations, including the following: a) pursuant to Article 8(1) of the PSI Directive, the  conditions must be objective, proportionate, nondiscriminatory and justified on grounds of a public  interest objective; they shall not unnecessarily restrict  possibilities for re-use and shall not be used to restrict  competition; b) the rules imposed on companies should contain  clearly defined safeguards for the rights of affected  third-parties, and mechanisms that allow compliance  with these rules to be verified; c) any intellectual property developed using the data  must not be used to disallow activities carried out by  government bodies in the fulfilment of their public  remit or to make these activities subject to payment of  a licence fee; d) any product or service developed using the data  should be offered to government bodies under  preferential conditions;  e) companies with a large market share should be subject  to a reciprocal obligation to make data generated by  their operations available (under identical conditions); f) the data should be used only for business activities  that take place in the EU (or at a minimum for product  or service development processes that take place in  the EU).
151 E 5. DEBATES  AROUND  ACCESS  TO NON -PERSONAL  DATA As a basic principle, compliance with the agreed  safeguards and restrictions on use can no longer be  reliably verified once data have been transferred and  once the copies of the data sent to the recipient have  been stored on infrastructure controlled by the latter.  Given the duty incumbent upon government bodies to  protect data that may be used to harm third parties or  the public (even if such harm would be possible only  after de-anonymisation of the data or linking of the data  with other data sets), special consideration must be given  to a model under which government bodies allow only  supervised data access and supervised processing  of data  on infrastructures that they control. Any costs incurred  in this connection should be passed on to the companies  seeking access. 5.5 Open data in the private sector 5.5.1  Platforms and data use Operating data are generated by companies at all levels  of the German economy in the course of their everyday  business, and these data are enormously valuable for  innovation, particularly when combined with data  generated by other participants in the value creation  chain. The German economy has already established  sector-specific platforms for the express purpose of  linking these different types of data. Examples of different platform models include:  (1) merger of several different companies into a GmbH  (limited liability company); (2) in-house operation by  a single company with the involvement of partners;  (3) proprietary platform operated as a service for  third parties. The various sectors of the economy are increasingly  coming around to the idea not only of shared platforms,  but also of common regulatory approaches to data use.The Data Ethics Commission believes that it is reasonable  to assume that data use within value creation systems  will continue to be organised by industrial players  themselves on a sector-specific basis, and that new  market entrants and start-ups will continue to find  opportunities to innovate within this landscape, since  market participants themselves stand to benefit from  working together with trailblazing start-ups to develop  disruptive digital innovations, and from sharing their data  to this end. The trend for companies to club together to  establish platforms modelled along various lines should  be welcomed, as it allows them to build on the industrial  know-how that already exists in Europe and fosters  higher-quality data use (including higher standards of  data protection and information security). The Data Ethics  Commission proposes that the Federal Government  should lend its support to the emergence of an increasing  number of private-sector platforms , with a view to  achieving the necessary market size and effects of scale  and allowing German businesses to harness their shared  strength to compete on the international stage. 5.5.2  Additional incentives for voluntary data sharing There is already a large number of business models based  on private providers voluntarily allowing the public to  access their data. Example 14   Example 14  One case in point is the geoinformation  industries, which take basic geodata (in some cases  from official sources) and enrich them with other  information, allowing users to access specialist geodata  for a wide range of purposes. Examples include both  map services such as OpenStreetMap or Google Maps,  which feature not only purely topographical and  administrative information but also a wide range of  other interesting details, and also tailored offerings  such as weather forecasts or traffic predictions.
152 PART E | D ATA The Data Ethics Commission recommends that voluntary  data access arrangements of this kind should be  supported; in addition to the practical support measures   recommended in → section 5.2 above , consideration should  therefore be given to additional incentives  for voluntary  data sharing. For example, data transfers or releases and  open access strategies should be favourably viewed:  ●under tax legislation;  ●under procurement law;  ●when making grant awards (either inside or outside  the research sector); or  ●when carrying out authorisation procedures. Voluntary data sharing, data transfers or releases and  open access strategies should, however, be envisaged  in the fields referred to above only if there is no risk  of infringing confidentiality requirements under  procurement law, operating and trade secrets, or the  provisions of data protection law as a result. 5.5.3  Statutory data access rights By way of contrast to the debate on voluntary data  sharing, the main idea underpinning the discussion on  statutory data access rights is that a society should “get  something back” from the large repositories of data  that many members of that society have helped to build  up (in the case of social networks, for example). When  viewed in conjunction with the fundamental value of  social solidarity and the public-good interests that may  be relevant in specific cases, this concept could serve as a  basis for granting more extensive rights in respect of data  access and disclosure obligation s on the part of private  individuals.30 30 For further details, see Viktor Mayer-Schönberger / Thomas Ramge: Das Digital [english title: Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data], pp. 195 et seqq. 31 FRAND = Fair, Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory. 32 The “three-factor test” features in several international agreements as a basis for assessing whether an exemption (i.  e. a limitation on copyright)  represents an acceptable encroachment on the copyright holder’s rights. According to the test, exemptions of this kind are subject to three conditions:  (i) they may apply only to certain special cases; (ii) they may not be in conflict with normal exploitation; and (iii) they may not unreasonably prejudice  the legitimate interests of the right holder. Calls are increasingly being made for the test to include (iv) mandatory consideration of third-party  interests and general interests.One potential measure that is often discussed in the  context of improving general access to privately held  data repositories is the introduction of a general right  to portability  for non-personal data, modelled along  the lines of Article 20 GDPR. This would mean that  a business that has supplied raw data to a controller  would have a right to request the controller to make  the data available to the business in a commonly  used and machine-readable format, or to ask the  controller to forward them directly to a third party.  For reasons that are essentially similar to those cited  in its arguments against an extension to the scope of  Article 20 GDPR (→ section 4.4.2 above) , the Data Ethics  Commission recommends that the Federal Government  should initially adopt a “wait-and-see” approach  to  developments relating to the use and interpretation  of Article 20 GDPR . The complexity of this issue is  exacerbated yet further by the fact that the issue of  proper allocation of the portability right (i.  e. who is the  equivalent to the “data subject” with regard to nonpersonal data) would raise its head again. A range of other measures that are ultimately  synonymous with statutory data access rights are also  being discussed with a view to improving general access  to privately held data repositories. Potential options   in this respect include a statutory obligation to publish  reports containing internal data analytics, access  rights for private individuals (e.  g. mandatory licensing  that complies with the FRAND31 principles and/or  incorporates the three-factor or four-factor test under  copyright law32), or the disclosure of data to the general  public (open access) based on either a general model or a  market-share model. The Data Ethics Commission believes that at least the  following factors should be taken into account during an  initial examination of these options:
153 E 5. DEBATES  AROUND  ACCESS  TO NON -PERSONAL  DATA a) the need to protect the personal data or the operating  and trade secrets to which access may be given or  which may be disclosed; b) the need to ensure that any encroachment on the  fundamental rights of private entities affected by a  data access or disclosure obligation is proportionate;  this relates in particular to the freedom to exercise a  trade or profession; c) the need to avoid any negative impacts on competition  resulting from access to data or the disclosure of data,  for example owing to strategic use by competitors  that may not themselves be obliged to disclose data  in return; d) the need to ensure that incentives still exist to invest  in business models for the data economy; and e) the need to protect the strategic interests of  German or European companies in the face of global  competition; in particular, consideration must be given  to whether these companies would still be able to  compete effectively on the international stage if they  were forced to provide access to their data repositories  and the digital giants – which already stand head  and shoulders over other companies in terms of their  data proficiency, their data infrastructures and (in  particular) the volumes of data they hold – were to  exploit this open-door policy. Having regard to the above, the Data Ethics Commission  recommends that preference should be given to a  sector-specific approach . As far as spatial information  is concerned, the INSPIRE Directive and the provisions  transposing it into national law already set out sectorspecific data access rules; these rules apply only to  government bodies, however. One of the first privateenterprise applications of an sector-specific data access  right can be found in the payment services industry,  and the Data Ethics Commission proposes that steps  33 Jacques Crémer / yves-Alexandre de Montjoye / Heike Schweitzer: Competition policy for the digital era, Special Advisers’ Report for the European  Commission, pp. 87 et seqq. (available at: https:/ /ec.europa.eu/competition/publications/reports/kd0419345enn.pdf ). 34 A New Competition Framework for the Digital Economy, Report by the Commission ‘Competition Law 4.0’, September 2019 (available at: https:/ /www. wettbewerbsrecht-40.de/KW40/Redaktion/DE/Downloads/a-new-competition-framework-for-the-digital-economy_.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=3 ).should be taken to identify the level of demand and  implementation options in a number of other selected  industries, for example the media, mobility or energy  sectors . 5.5.4  Role of competition law Although the framework of competition law that  is currently in place contains almost no provisions  relating to data, its general thrust also applies to the  data economy. For example, the essential facilities  doctrine  (EFD) can be used (in a slightly modified  form if necessary) if a market-dominant company  holds exclusive control over a resource (e.  g. a  network/infrastructure) that is crucially important for  competition on a neighbouring market. The aftermarket  doctrine  relates to cases in which lock-in effects mean  that consumers of a primary product are unable to  exercise in full their freedom to choose on a secondary  market (e.  g. market for repairs/spare parts), or in which  a third-party provider on a secondary market of this kind  faces anti-competitive barriers.33 yet the uncertain legal  situation, the stringent requirements that apply, and  the amount of time and money involved in the relevant  procedures means that supervisory efforts to prevent  abuse cannot currently be regarded as a fix-all solution  to data access problems. The applicable provisions of  competition law (either individually or in their entirety)  could, however, act as a central building block in a new  framework of digital economic law , one of the crucial  components in which should be a range of solutions to  data access problems. The findings of the Commission  of Experts on Competition Law 4.0 should be taken into  account in this respect.34
154 PART E | D ATA 5.6  Data access for public-sector (B2G) and  public-interest purposes Thought should be given to whether controllers  should be subject to an obligation to grant access to  specific subsets of data in order to allow their use  either by public-sector bodies  or for certain publicgood purposes , and the scope of any such obligation.  Rights to access data belonging to private entities  or obligations to disclose data might be particularly  relevant in the research  sector, and easier access to data  might lead to general advances in science, provided that  the access arrangements are designed appropriately and  take due account of data subjects’ rights. Corresponding  access rights to private-sector data might also make it  easier for NGOs, the media and similar institutions to  deliver on their social remit, thereby helping to protect  the democratic polity . Particularly priority must also be  given at all times to the averting of risks  (e. g. issuing  storm warnings). In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, preference  should again be given to a sector-specific approach   that tailors the design of data access and disclosure  obligations to the specific requirements of constitutional  law that come into play on the one hand, and to the  practical circumstances that characterise the relevant  sphere of activity on the other. The health sector , the  mobility sector  and the energy sector  should be regarded  as particular priorities for action in this respect. The Data  Ethics Commission also calls for a broad-based, societywide debate as a precursor to decisions on more general  obligations to provide access to data, e.  g. in connection  with research projects that serve the public good. The Data Ethics Commission wishes to reiterate the basic  principles governing business-to-government (B2G)  data sharing  set out by the European Commission in  its communication of 25 April 2018 entitled “Towards a  common European data space”:35  35 European Commission: Towards a common European data space, COM(2018) 232 final, 25 April 2018, pp. 13 et seq. (available at: https:/ /ec.europa.eu/ transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2018/EN/COM-2018-232-F1-EN-MAIN-PART-1.PDF ).a) proportionality (i.  e. justified by clear and demonstrable  public interest and proportionate in terms of details,  relevance and data protection); b) purpose limitation (i.  e. clearly limited for one or  several purposes and assurances that the data  obtained will not be used for unrelated administrative  or judicial procedures); c) “do no harm” (i.  e. respect for legitimate interests  such as data subjects’ right to informational selfdetermination, trade secrets, commercially sensitive  information and exploitation interests); d) acknowledgement of the public interest goal when  agreeing on conditions for data reuse (preferential  treatment for government bodies, non-discriminatory  conditions for government bodies, reduction in the  overall burden on citizens and companies); e) data quality management (an obligation to offer  reasonable and proportionate support to help assess  the quality of the data for the stated purposes, but no  general obligation to improve the quality of the data); f) transparency and societal participation in respect of  parties to the agreement, their objectives, insights and  best practices. These basic principles may serve as a good starting point  not only when drafting the provisions of freely negotiated  contracts on data exchanges, but also when designing  more extensive sector-specific statutory measures to  improve data access.
155 Summary of the most important  recommendations for action Debates around access to  non-personal data 24 Access by European companies to appropriate non-   personal data of appropriate quality is a key factor for the  growth of the European data economy. In order to benefit  from enhanced access to data , however, stakeholders  must have a sufficient degree of data-awareness and  have the data skills that are necessary to make use of the  data. Also, access to data proves to be disproportionately  advantageous to stakeholders that have already built up  the largest reserves of data and that have the best data  infrastructures at hand. The Data Ethics Commission  therefore wishes to stress that the factors referred to  should always receive due attention when discussing  whether and how to improve data access, in keeping with  the ASISA principle  (Awareness – Skills – Infrastructures –  Stocks – Access) . 25 The Data Ethics Commission therefore supports the  efforts already initiated at European level to promote  and improve data infrastructures in the broadest sense  of the term (e.  g. platforms, standards for application  programming interfaces and other elements, model  contracts, EU Support Centre), and recommends to the  Federal Government that these efforts should continue  to be matched by corresponding efforts at national level.  It would also be advisable to set up an ombudsman’s  office at federal level to provide assistance and support in  relation to the negotiation of data access agreements and  dispute settlement. 26 The Data Ethics Commission ascribes enormous  importance to a holistically conceived, sustainable  and strategic economic policy  that outlines effective  methods of preventing not only the exodus of innovative  European companies or their acquisition by thirdcountry companies, but also an excessive dependence  on third-country infrastructures (e.  g. server capacities). A  balance must be struck in this context between muchneeded international cooperation and networking on  the one hand, and on the other a resolute assumption of  responsibility for sustainable security and prosperity in  Europe against the backdrop of an ever-evolving global  power dynamic. 27 Also from the perspective of boosting the European  data economy, the Data Ethics Commission does not  see any benefit in introducing new exclusive rights  (“data ownership”, “data producer right”). Instead, it  recommends affording limited third-party effects to  contractual agreements  (e. g. to restrictions on data  utilisation and onward transfer of data by a recipient).  These third-party effects could be modelled on the new  European regime for the protection of trade secrets. The  Data Ethics Commission also recommends the adoption  of legislative solutions enabling European companies to  cooperate in their use of data, for example by using data  trust schemes, without running afoul of anti-trust law  (“data partnerships” ).
156 PART E | D ATA 28 The data accumulated in existing value creation systems  (e. g. production and distribution chains) are often of  enormous commercial significance, both inside and  outside that value creation system. In many cases,  however, the provisions on data access that appear in the  contractual agreements concluded within a value creation  system are unfair and/or inefficient, or lacking entirely;  in certain cases, there is no contractual agreement at all.  Efforts must therefore be made to raise awareness among  businesses  in sectors far outside what is commonly  perceived as the “data economy”, and to provide practical  guidance and support (e.  g. model contracts). 29 The Data Ethics Commission furthermore recommends  cautious adaptations of the current legislative  framework . The first stage in this process should be to  make explicit reference in Section 311 of the [German]  Civil Code ( Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch , BGB) to the special  relationship that exists between a party that has  contributed to the generation of data in a value creation  system and the controller of the data, clarifying that such  parties may have certain quasi-contractual duties of a  fiduciary nature. These duties should normally include  a duty to enter into negotiations about fair and efficient  data access arrangements. Consideration should also  be  given to whether additional steps should be taken,  which could range from blacklisting particular contract  terms also for B2B transactions, to formulating default  provisions for data contracts, to introducing sector-   specific data access rights. 30 The Data Ethics Commission believes that open  government data (OGD) concepts  hold enormous  potential, and recommends that these concepts should  be built on and promoted. It also recommends a series  of measures to promote a shift in mindset among public  authorities  (something that has not yet fully taken place)  and to make it easier in practice to share data on the  basis of OGD concepts. These measures include not only  the establishment of the relevant infrastructures  (e. g.  platforms), but also harmonisation and improvement of  the existing legal framework that is currently fragmented  and sometimes inconsistent. 31 Nevertheless, the Data Ethics Commission identifies  a degree of tension between efforts to promote OGD  (relying on principles such as “open by default” and “open  for all purposes”), and efforts to enhance data protection  and the protection of trade secrets (with legally enshrined  concepts such as “privacy by default”). The Data Ethics  Commission submits that, in cases of doubt, priority  should be given to the duty of protecting  individuals and  companies who have entrusted their data to the State  (often without being given any choice in the matter, e.  g.  tax information). The State must deliver on this duty  by implementing a range of different measures, which  may include technical as well as legal safeguards against  misuse of data.
157 E 5. DEBATES  AROUND  ACCESS  TO NON -PERSONAL  DATA 32 In particular, it would be beneficial to develop standard  licences and model terms and conditions  for public-   sector data sharing arrangements, and to make their use  mandatory (at least on a sector-specific basis). These  standard licenses and model terms and conditions should  include clearly defined safeguards for the rights of third  parties who are affected by a data access arrangement.  Provision should also be made against data being used in a  way that ultimately harms public interests, and also against  still greater accumulation of data and market power on the  part of the big players (which would be likely to undermine  competition) and against the taxpayer having to pay twice. 33 As regards open-data concepts in the private sector ,  priority should be given to promoting and supporting  voluntary data-sharing arrangements . Consideration must  be given not only to the improvement of infrastructures  (e. g. data platforms), but also to a broad range of potential  incentives; these might include certain privileges in  the context of tax breaks, public procurement, funding  programmes or licensing procedures. Statutory data access  rights and corresponding obligations to grant access  should be considered as fall-back options if the above  measures fail to deliver the desired outcomes. 34 Generally speaking, the Data Ethics Commission  believes that a cautious approach should be taken to the  introduction of statutory data access rights; ideally such  rights should be developed only on a sector-by-sector  basis . Sectors in which the level of demand should be  analysed include the media, mobility or energy sectors.  In any case, before a statutory data access right or  even a disclosure obligation is introduced, a full impact  assessment needs to be carried out, examining and  weighing up against each other all possible implications;  these include implications for data protection and the  protection of trade secrets, for investment decisions  and the distribution of market power, as well as for the  strategic interests of German and European companies  compared to those of companies in third countries. 35 The Data Ethics Commission recommends considering  enhanced obligations of private enterprises to grant  access to data for public interest and public-sector  purposes  (business-to-government, B2G). A cautious and  sector-specific approach is, however, recommended in  this respect as well.

Part F Algorithmic systems
160 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 1. Characteristics of algorithmic systems Numerous products and applications these days, from  voice assistants and automated lending right through  to “autonomous” (driverless) cars, are based on more or  less “smart” algorithms. Due to the many different forms  that these types of technical systems can take, it seemed  advisable to the Data Ethics Commission to base the  considerations on the general concept of “algorithmic  systems” . (→ see Part C, section 2.2.5 above) . The key questions  presented by the Federal Government regarding the  topics of “algorithmic prognosis and decision-making  processes” as well as “artificial intelligence” will therefore  be discussed below together as questions concerning the  use of algorithmic systems. However, the following distinctions  in particular must  be taken into account as part of any ethical and legal  assessment of individual algorithmic systems :  ●From a technical perspective , different algorithmic  systems have different characteristics. The spectrum  ranges from systems which operate on a completely  deterministic basis right through to systems which  use machine learning to develop action plans  independently in order to achieve the goal specified by  the operator of the algorithmic system.  ●Where algorithmic systems are used as social  informatics systems, ethically and legally relevant  processes can be established at different system  levels , i. e. from the level of the pool of data used or  the algorithm in the technical sense right through  to the level of human individuals involved in the  development, implementation, assessment or  correction of the system. ●The purpose and consequences  of using algorithmic  systems can vary considerably. Where algorithmic  systems support or replace human decision-making  and prognoses, they often have a direct impact on  individuals’ rights and interests. Examples include  automated lending and automated administrative acts.  However, algorithmic systems are also used where  such a link to human decision-making can, at most,  be indirectly established. This is the case, for example,  with various processes which constitute “autonomous”  driving or with predictive maintenance in mechanical  engineering.  ●Algorithmic systems affect different ethical and  legal principles  depending on the context in which  they are used. As such, the externally visible and  discernible “action” of “autonomous” cyber-physical  systems, for example, typically raises questions. This is  a key aspect, for example, in the debate surrounding  the use of robotics in healthcare. Principles such  as that of human-centred design are essential for  the assessment of such systems. Where algorithmic  systems are not “physically embodied” in a similar  way, it is conversely often the system’s externally  invisible method for making the “decision” that is  the focus of attention. Discussions may, for example,  centre on the system’s transparency or the principle  that the final decision should be made by a human in  accordance with Article 22 GDPR. An example of this  is automated credit checks. However, the distinction  between “action”-oriented and “decision”-oriented  perspectives becomes relative upon closer inspection,  because every visible “action” by a system is, at some  point, preceded by a human “decision”, for example in  the construction of the system, and every “decision”  has an impact because another system component  (including a human) will base its “action” on it.
161 F 1. CHARACTERISTICS  OF ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS The Data Ethics Commission believes that further  distinctions  should be made in particular where  algorithmic systems are closely involved in human  decision-making processes . An algorithm itself cannot  make a decision in an ethically substantial sense, since it  has no value-based preferences of its own accord. Three  different levels of the involvement of algorithmic systems  in human decision-making can be distinguished based  on the specific distribution of tasks between humans  and machine:  ●Algorithm- based  decisions are human decisions based  either in whole or in part on information obtained  using algorithmic calculations. Examples include  clinical decision support systems which provide a  doctor with treatment recommendations using patient  data from electronic medical records and based on  an assessment of scientific literature. Taking this  recommendation into consideration, the doctor then  makes the decision together with the patient as to  which treatment option should ultimately be selected.  Algorithm-based decisions can nevertheless subtly yet  significantly influence human decisions, for example  if the algorithmic system collates information on  humans/objects/procedures which contain a value  judgment of which the user may not necessarily be  aware.  ●Algorithm- driven  decisions are human decisions  shaped by the outputs of algorithmic systems in such  a way that the human’s decision-making abilities  and capacity for self-determination are effectively  restricted, in particular because the decision can be  made only within algorithmically determined and  prescribed paths. One such example is an Industry  4.0 application whereby, as part of human-machine  interaction, a robotic system provides the human  involved in the production process with only limited  room for manoeuvre. ●Algorithm- determined  and hence fully automated   decisions are, prima facie, made independently of a  human. In fact, the outputs of an algorithmic system  trigger consequences automatically; no provision  is made for an explicit human decision. Examples  of applications range from price differentiations in  e-commerce and fully automated administrative  acts up to what are known as autonomous weapons  systems. Human decisions are nevertheless involved  in the sense that a human must have decided to use  the algorithmic system for such a purpose and in such  a way. Example 1    The differences can be illustrated by an algorithmic  system being used in the process of selecting  candidates for a job: if an algorithmic system simply  collates information on the individual candidates for  the employer in question on the basis of which the  employer will then make their decisions, this constitutes  an algorithm-based decision-making process. The  system will lead to algorithm-driven decisions if the  information provided to the employer contains an  evaluation of the individual candidates (for example  a ranking), as this could significantly influence the  likelihood of the individual candidates being selected.  The actual restriction of the employer’s ability to make  decisions becomes even more apparent if the system  already screens the candidates in advance, meaning  that the employer no longer even sees some of the  applications. In the case of an algorithm-determined  selection process, each notification regarding the  acceptance or rejection of an application would be  automatically provided by the algorithmic system  without a human ever checking the selection.
162 PART F | ALGORITHMIC SYSTEMS Classifying an algorithmic system as one of these  three types is often difficult, and hybrids are possible within complex software architecture. The level of determination for humans at the same point can also be different depending on the way the system works: in the example above, a decision-making process in which an algorithmic system filters out individual candidates in advance and rejects them is algorithm-determined from the point of view of the candidates who were filtered out but algorithm-driven for all the remaining candidates.There can be overlaps in the practical operation of the systems on account of what are known as automation bias and default effects. Even in the case of algorithm-based decisions where humans have full decision-making authority, they may tend to simply go with the algorithmic system’s recommendation without carrying out a sufficiently critical check, as otherwise they would feel an uncomfortable need to justify their decision and would get the impression that the risk of being blamed for any wrong decision would increase. Nevertheless, the fundamental distinction is relevant for assigning responsibility for a risk assessment and therefore also for regulation.Figure 7:  Characteristics of algorithmic systems DESIGN   IMPLEMENTATION    ADAPTATIONALGORITHM-DETERMINED ALGORITHM-DRIVEN ALGORITHM-BASED DECISION
163 F 2. GENERAL  STANDARDS  FOR  ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 2. General standards for algorithmic systems General ethical and legal principles , primarily human  dignity (→ see Part B, section 3 above) , constitute the  benchmark for the design and use of algorithmic systems.  In terms of the principle of prospective responsibility ,  the intentional and unintentional effects on the users  and the individuals affected by the use of an algorithmic  system must be taken into consideration as part of the  assessment of specific algorithmic systems. It is also  necessary to think about and plan for social consequences  depending on the intended purpose and context of their  use, especially with regard to network effects, effects of  scale and effects of scope. These consequences range  from the positive effects of social innovations right  through to the (sometimes subtle) negative effects, for  example on diversity and the culture of social debate as  an essential condition for a functioning democracy. On  that basis, the Data Ethics Commission believes that the  following key requirements for the design and use of  algorithmic systems can be set out which, in terms of the  governance perspective  taken up here, must be met in  the interplay of, especially, developers, companies, users  and state bodies. 2.1 Human-centred design At the centre is the requirement to strive for algorithmic  systems with a human-centred and value-oriented  design  which takes fundamental rights and freedoms  into consideration. The Data Ethics Commission believes  that the human-centred approach must permeate the  entire design process. It must be ensured by means of  a wide range of different measures, which may also and  in particular involve i nclusion and participation in the  development  of algorithmic systems.Human-centred design requires in particular taking  into account changes in self-perception and self-design  resulting from the individual’s confrontation with  algorithmic systems. Gains and losses in expertise in using  the systems, effects on people’s own lifestyles and the  formation of opinions as well as on physical well-being  must be taken into consideration as early as in the system  development stage. Attention should also be paid to the emotional  state  of the affected individuals which may differ (in  both directions) depending on whether humans and  conventional technology or algorithmic systems are used.  This is significant not only for the individual affected by  a decision but also for the user. Consideration should be  given for example to the fact that direct interpersonal  interaction fulfils a variety of functions which go far  beyond “good decision-making”. Example 2   Where medical diagnoses are supported by algorithmic  systems, the accuracy of diagnosis can be identified  first and foremost as the intended purpose. However,  the need for human care and contact in consultations  concerning treatment (with corresponding significance  for the success of the treatment) can be strong and  must not be disregarded, nor should the need for  doctors to be able to contribute their own medical  experience. Conversely, in certain situations, for example  in case of embarrassing symptoms, they may find it  more comfortable not to have to confide primarily in  another human person.
164 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS These functions include, for example, the satisfaction of  a basic human need for communication , the feeling, in  principle, of being able to assess the other person’s line of  thinking and reactions and to be understood by the other  person, the opportunity to convince the other person of  one’s own point of view, as well as the certain control  effect arising from the fact that the other human being  is directly confronted with the reaction of the individual  affected by the decision. Example 3   Emotional aspects also play a major role where  algorithmic systems are used in human-machine  interaction. For example, the use of a system which  is intrinsically intended to support employees may  be perceived by the employees to be invasive or  patronising, since the system analyses employees’  behaviour, takes certain tasks off their hands which  they have actually come to enjoy or makes them think  that their own performance is inferior to that of their  “robotic colleague”. The well-being of all individuals affected by technology,  including for example in the use of robotics in nursing,  is a central guiding value which absolutely must be  taken into consideration as part of an ethical approach  to technology design. It is important to note here that  well-being is extremely subjective and not static but can  change depending on the context and over time and  therefore needs to be constantly reassessed . 2.2  Compatibility with core societal values Depending on their area of application, the impacts  of algorithmic systems may be relevant for society as  a whole: for example they may affect the democratic  process , citizen-centred state action , competition ,  the future of work  and also the digital sovereignty  of  Germany and Europe.Example 4   In the development of smart systems, providers which  are able to build their business model on large amounts  of data have a privileged starting position, since many  applications of algorithmic systems depend on such  amounts of data. The more data that can be analysed,  the more likely correlations and findings are to be  generated. Taken together with the network effects,  effects of scale and effects of scope which are typical  for platform markets, the market power of companies  begins to strengthen and monopolies are formed, once  a certain threshold is reached. This ultimately enables  companies to prevent new players from entering the  market and to interfere with the market-regulating  forces of competition. Depending on the area of  application, companies can then control social opinionforming processes and market behaviour. In order  to counteract that and create framework conditions  for fair competition, the competition law control  mechanisms must be readjusted and, where necessary,  subsequently tightened. The Data Ethics Commission is of the view that these  supra-  individual consequences often cannot be handled  by state bodies or with legislative measures alone.  Instead, they need to be taken into consideration in all  phases of the design and use of algorithmic systems.  To that extent, developers, companies and users  have a (shared) social responsibility.  In particular  where corresponding consequences seem likely, for  example in the case of algorithmic systems which affect  communication between people which is relevant to  democracy, it is necessary already in the design process  to thoroughly assess the purposes and the unintended  indirect consequences of the system in question and  to examine the extent to which the system can affect  democracy, fundamental rights, secondary law and the  basic principles of the rule of law. As far as possible,  a culture of “incorporating” the basic principles of  democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights into  the system architecture should be established for the  process of designing technology.
165 F 2. GENERAL  STANDARDS  FOR  ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Many aspects of the interplay between technology  and society are admittedly still unclear. The Data  Ethics Commission believes that more research is  therefore necessary to shed light on the social impacts  of algorithmic systems and develop corresponding  strategies to limit any negative effects. 2.3  Sustainability in the design and use of  algorithmic systems Any assessment of the personal and social effects of  algorithmic systems must also be global in nature  and not limited with regard to time. For this reason,  when deciding on the use and design of algorithmic  systems, sustainability  and human skills retention  in  particular must also be taken into consideration. These  are important for remaining human control functions  (e. g. the “human-in-the-loop” principle), for the failure  of algorithmic systems in exceptional circumstances  (e. g. in the event of a disaster or cyber attacks) and for  ensuring the innovative prowess of future generations  (e. g. development of new digital technologies). It is, first  and foremost, a question of basic and advanced training,  as well as education in the sense of lifelong learning,  ensuring that future generations also have the necessary  general skills and not limiting training only to the  user’s perspective. Teaching and developing digital skills also promotes  social sustainability . Social framework conditions,  for example in institutions and procedures, must be  organised in such a way as to ensure the promotion of the  participatory and inclusive design of algorithmic systems  and their use to serve the public interest. Sustainable development also includes the ecological  dimension . Irrespective of the positive contribution  which algorithmic systems can make to environmental  protection, a key ethical requirement is reducing the  need for electricity and for certain resources such as  “rare earths” and using them efficiently.Economic sustainability  requires a perspective which  looks beyond exclusively short-term economic profits  and also takes the long-term effects into consideration.  Short-term commercial success can have long-term  disastrous consequences, as demonstrated by the global  financial crisis several years ago. This should not limit the  freedom of economic activity but should focus attention  on the responsibility associated with economic activity  within the context of a social market economy. The principle of prospective responsibility as well as  considerations of fairness and solidarity must, with  regard to sustainability, be specifically taken into  consideration in the design and use of algorithmic  systems. As is the case with the handling of data, the  risk assessment  is of crucial importance for ecological,  economic and social sustainability in the design and  use of algorithmic systems. 2.4  High level of quality and performance Algorithmic systems must work well and reliably in  order to achieve the goals pursued with their help. If  the systems are also used to promote ethical aims, then  technical and legal specifications, designed to improve,  further develop and safeguard the state of the art , will  take on an ethical quality. Where such systems support or  replace human activities, they are deemed, irrespective of  the intrinsic value of human activity, to be implementing  ethical principles better than previously. Example 5   Any ethically sound use of algorithmic systems in the  healthcare sector firstly requires the technology to have  the necessary medical quality, i.  e. the accuracy of the  assessment of findings, the accuracy of the diagnosis,  the probability that the recommended treatment will be  successful or the success rate of a medical intervention,  etc. must, when the system is used, be at least as good  as and (in view of the sensitive usage context) ideally  better than if conventional technology and humans  were used.
166 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Quality and performance can be improved through a  wide range of different measures. These include, for  example, appropriate risk models, the, as inclusive and  participatory as possible, development of standards,  systemic management and control approaches, and  process design which is aimed at the continuous  improvement of the entire system. The role of humans  who are part of an algorithmic system understood as  a social-informatic ensemble (→ see section 1 above)  must  always be taken into consideration in this context.  After all, a number of algorithmic systems still rely  on input from critical experts to perform optimally.  Quality-oriented system design therefore also includes  mechanisms which help enhance human capabilities   and prevent or counteract any reduction in skills and  any critical ability and readiness to reflect, for example  in connection with automation bias. Examples of  productive interaction between humans and machines  which is also designed to ensure skill retention can be  found in algorithm-supported diagnostic imaging in the  healthcare sector.2.5  Guarantee of robustness and security Algorithmic systems must be robust and secure, otherwise  the legitimate goals they are used to pursue will not  be achieved or will be achieved only at the expense of  potential harm to ethically and legally protected rights and  interests. From an ethical perspective, it can be said that  robust and secure system design and appropriate system  usage therefore affect the respective purposes of a system  and the need to protect the data used by the system. As a  result, the robustness and security requirements are not  identical for all systems. The specific requirements can  differ based on the specific need for protection and the  usage context . Example 6   Systems which are not robust or secure which are  used in control systems can pose an immediate threat  to people or the environment, for example if they  control the emission of pollutants from industrial  plants, control robots or steer autonomous (driverless)  cars in traffic. A failure here could even cause harm  to important legally protected rights such as life and  limb. In order to prevent this, processes should be put  in place to define the current state of the art, legal  rules and regulations should be enacted which make it  mandatory to follow the state of the art, and measures  should be implemented which guarantee the effective  enforcement of standards.
167 F 2. GENERAL  STANDARDS  FOR  ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Robust and secure system design involves not only  securing the system  against external threats (e.  g. by  means of encryption or anonymisation, etc.), but also  protecting humans and the environment against any  negative influences from the system (in particular  through a systematic risk management approach, e.  g. on  the basis of a risk assessment). It must also incorporate  all phases of data processing and all technical and  organisational components. Risks can arise not only in the  technical design but also as a result of errors caused by  human decisions taken when using algorithmic systems.  As algorithmic systems and the way they are incorporated  in an organisation’s other information technology are  not static, a management system  is also required which  checks and ensures the effectiveness of the measures  in view of changing conditions, for example newly  discovered risks. 2.6  Minimising bias and discrimination as a  prerequisite for fair decisions A key aim in regulating algorithmic systems is to ensure  that the decision-making patterns upon which the  algorithmic systems are based do not have any systematic  distortions (bias) leading to discriminatory and unfair  decisions. It should, first of all, be noted that biased,  discriminatory and unfair decisions can also be found  where conventional technology and humans are used.  Conversely to prejudiced decisions of individual humans,  algorithmic systems however bear the danger that using  the system on a large scale will have a broad impact  which individual human decision-makers could never  cause. With that in mind, the discussion surrounding  bias and discrimination by algorithmic systems should,  in the view of the Data Ethics Commission, also be seen  as an opportunity  to detect existing problems in existing  decision-making contexts and, in general, achieve better  decision-making processes.Example 7    An algorithmic system used to detect skin cancer was  trained predominantly on patients with white skin, and  so the probability of its correctly detecting skin cancer is  therefore significantly higher in the case of patients with  white skin than in the case of patients with different  coloured skin. As a medical device, such a system would  be permitted for use only on patients with white skin.  The same effect would admittedly also be noted if a  dermatologist did their training and practised as a  clinical professional exclusively in a specific cultural  environment. Ultimately, in both cases, steps would  need to be taken to ensure that all patients, irrespective  of their skin colour, receive proper medical care. Even in cases where there is no direct intention to  discriminate when developing algorithmic systems,  discriminatory decisions may still be made, i.  e. decisions  which systematically put certain groups at an unfair  disadvantage. In particular in the case of machine  learning, the problem is rather that the systems learn  models by using available data. The resulting predictions  and recommendations extrapolate the past into the  future , whereby existing social injustices can be obscured  through incorporation into seemingly neutral technology,  and potentially amplified. Example 8    An algorithmic system used to assess applications for a  managerial position was trained with data of managers  who had proven themselves at the relevant company  over the past few decades. Since predominantly male  managers had been employed over the past few  decades, the system, which was trained with this data  set, consistently assesses male candidates as being better  than equally qualified female candidates.
168 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS The keyword bias covers a range of different types of  systematic distortions  with a range of different causes.  In the case of human decision-makers, both cognitive  bias and social preconceptions, prejudices or stereotypes  can negatively affect the decision-making process. In  the case of algorithmic systems, bias can refer to the  technical reproduction of those social preconceptions,  prejudices or stereotypes. This reproduction can take  place at various points primarily within the context  of machine learning. Often, an insufficient level of  representation or a low number of cases of a social group  in the training data leads to distortions whereby the  specific characteristics of this group are not sufficiently  recognised during the development process and are  therefore not taken into account. In addition to the  training data used, other technical and methodological  decisions, e.  g. regarding the target variables or labels,  can also lead to discriminatory models and therefore  to unfair decisions. Lastly, problems may not arise until  the systems are actively used in practice for example  if algorithmic systems are used in changing social  framework conditions or in unforeseen usage contexts. Algorithmic systems which directly  use categories of  data which are legally explicitly recognized to be  highly  sensitive , such as gender or origin, are particularly critical  from the point of view of discrimination. Direct use of  sensitive information may, depending on the area of  application, be important for correct data processing and  is also often permissible within legal limits. Example 9   Many systems for diagnosing diseases know the  patient’s gender and age and take them into account.  Sensitive characteristics may also be used within  the context of a business decision for implementing  business strategies, for example where a business is  expanding into a specific age group, occupational  group or region, if the characteristics define a customer  segment, for example, for which simplified acceptance  criteria apply.The use of information which indirectly  codes sensitive  categories can, however, also be problematic. Example 10    Household income is used as information in  creditworthiness assessments. In Germany, the  average income varies between genders. As a result,  an algorithmic system which uses household income  may incorrectly assess the creditworthiness of the  men and women involved in terms of the distribution  between them. Fully preventing discrimination even in terms of legally  recognised categories such as gender or origin is difficult  within the context of algorithmic systems. Furthermore,  the use of algorithmic systems can lead to totally new  groups being thrown together based on coindicing  characteristics being excluded from socially protected  rights due to a certain classification system and without  any just cause, or being confronted with other negative  consequences. In the light of this, all those involved in  the development and use of such a system must be made  aware of the complex conditional discriminatory effects  so that they can prevent or counteract them as far as  possible (→ see section 4.2.4 below) . However, technical measures designed to minimise  discrimination have their limitations even where  continuous improvement processes are used, partly  because different technical fairness targets cannot  be achieved simultaneously. Which criteria for nondiscrimination and fairness are appropriate in which  context is not a technical but a social and political  question. Accordingly, as such, these decisions must not  be entrusted to technology developers alone. Instead,  they should be part of a future regulation of algorithmic  systems and be included in the operational obligations  of data controllers. The prerequisite for that is that the  criteria must be decided on specifically based on context  as well as democratically .
169 F 2. GENERAL  STANDARDS  FOR  ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Algorithmic systems are difficult to analyse precisely.  In order to be able to detect and prevent discrimination,  the data controllers and oversight bodies must have  the opportunity to gain an idea of any undesirable  discrimination effects that occur within an algorithmic  system, both within the context of its development  and its productive deployment. Such effects can be  identified through processes such as risk assessments  and output analyses . There is a tension between specifications to limit the  collection and storage of discriminatory characteristics  and the concern to retain the possibility to detect  any discriminatory effects or be able to prove nondiscrimination. These different requirements must  be balanced on a case-by-case basis, which may  have an influence on tests in different phases of the  system development lifecycle; standard collation of  all potentially discriminatory and therefore sensitive  information for the sole purpose of proving that, as a  result, no discrimination is taking place would not be  justified. Greater efforts are needed here to produce  practical concordance between anti-discrimination law  and data protection law .2.7   Transparent, explainable and comprehensible  systems In order to be able to carry out a reliable ethical and  legal assessment of an algorithmic system, it is essential  that enough information be available about its scope,  functionality, pool of data and data analysis. Only a truly  transparent system can be examined to determine  whether it is pursuing a legitimate purpose.  The  transparency principle can have further key functions  depending on the type and addressee of possible  transparency obligations. With regard to the public,  sufficient transparency must be created so that sufficient  information is available for socio-political discourse on  algorithmic systems. Supervisory authorities or other  oversight bodies must be able to decide whether the legal  and technical specifications are being or have been met  where algorithmic systems are being used. Individual  citizens must be able to take informed and confident  decisions regarding the use of algorithmic systems and,  in the event of negative effects on their freedoms and  rights, be able to assess whether and to what extent they  wish to exercise their rights. That too is a consequence of  the ethical principle of digital self-determination. In view of the increasing complexity of systems, the  demand for transparency is, in practice, confronted with  the fact that even experts are hardly able to go through  all the individual components of a system fully, look at  how they interact and comprehend  everything within a  reasonable amount of time. In particular in the case of  individual machine learning methods, it is difficult, with  today’s state-of-the-art science and technology, to state  which input led to a specific output of the system. There  is also the fact that even technically simple algorithmic  systems are often incorporated into complex social  informatics ecosystems, i.  e. information and worksharing processes in which numerous manufacturers and  operators are involved.
170 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Example 11    The visual display of a personalised online advert is  the result of complex processes in which the advert is  delivered and paid for on the basis of behaviour-based  analysis and segmentation. In particular, analytics  services are used which are deployed by site owners  across websites by incorporating the corresponding  program code (such as JavaScript code for tracking).  The components of such systems are also not fixed  but can change, for example if manufacturers provide  new versions or if they are adaptive and/or selflearning systems. Legal aspects can also limit  certain forms of information  disclosure via algorithmic systems. Source codes and  hardware designs are often protected as trade secrets.  Operators also often have a legitimate interest in  preventing their systems from being manipulated.  Where algorithmic systems process personal data, data  protection law can also limit the interest of the public or  other affected citizens in information. However, where  the transparency requirement regarding the system  concerns the disclosure of the source code, which as such  does not contain any personal data, data protection law  does not stand in the way of disclosure. However, the ever-present complexity cannot refute the  goal of designing algorithmic systems to be transparent,  nor can it justify any lack of transparency. Just like the  aforementioned legal grounds, these aspects must  nevertheless be taken into account in the drafting of any  information rights and transparency obligations, which  must be based on what is legally and actually possible.  The principle of transparency  also requires continuously  developing technology to make the disclosure of  information easier (for example through the use of opensource software and open hardware) and developing  approaches which reduce complexity. Research is also  required here. Under the banner of “explainable AI”,  researchers are working with increasing success on  producing meaningful findings on the internal processes of  algorithmic systems.The demand for transparency must always take the  different levels of expertise  of the parties potentially  interested in transparency into account. For example,  the disclosure of the computer code to supervisory  authorities carrying out necessary checks, may make  it much easier for them to understand the system.  Conversely, laypersons often need clearly and  comprehensibly prepared information on a system’s  basic characteristics which enables them to carry out a  risk assessment suitable for everyday purposes. At the  same time, their interest is seldom limited to the system  “itself”. In order to prevent any negative decisions in the  future, an explanation  is rather also required as to how  the decision specifically concerning them came about  and which factors had what weighting. The specific  drafting of the specifications on transparency and  explainability should be based on the affected individuals’  level of understanding and always be comprehensible   for them. In that sense, rules on transparency and  explainability will safeguard citizens’ capacity to act and  their self-determination.
171 F 2. GENERAL  STANDARDS  FOR  ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 2.8 Clear accountability structures Just as having control over data implies the obligation  to be accountable for such power, the opportunity to  control algorithmic systems must also be accompanied  by willingness to answer for one’s own actions , i. e. to be  liable  where necessary. Again, it is the complexity of algorithmic systems which,  in practice, can make it difficult to assign responsibility.  Hardware or software manufacturers, data providers,  algorithm developers, operators of individual components,  clients and users (either as the organisation or its individual  employees) contribute to the system. Components are  often used which can change without the knowledge or  control of the user, for example as a result of important  updates required for information security purposes. Those  involved are often also located in different parts of the  world. Efforts are required at all levels in order to prevent  any diffusion of responsibility and establish accountability  structures , starting with the technical design of the  systems right through to legal specifications, for example  in the form of the concept under data protection law of  “joint control” (Article 26 GDPR).2.9  Result: responsibility-guided consideration Assessing the ethical aspects of algorithmic systems is,  in practice, extremely complex . This is due to the large  number of factors which need to be taken into account  as well as the fact that, in a specific area of application,  different individuals may be put in a “better” or “worse”  position. The same can be said of social consequences and  sustainability aspects which can rarely be unequivocally  classified as either “positive” or “negative”. However, this  does not mean that humans can surrender all judgment.  In cases where it is difficult to weigh everything up,  everyone is required to take particular care with their  assessments and decisions. Where algorithmic applications  may potentially develop such phenomenally impressive  performance and scope that questions are raised  concerning the future of mankind, weighted assessments  of the opportunities and risks will increasingly reach their  limits, and more fundamental anthropological and ethical  discussions will be required. This is precisely where the  principle of prospective responsibility is of fundamental  importance. With regard to all this, the democratic process  provides  ways and means for balancing conflicting convictions,  ideally supported by special deliberative processes  and institutions through which society can ensure,  in as inclusive and participatory a way as possible,  that the challenges presented by algorithmic systems  are addressed.
172 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS It should only rarely be the case that human activity  and the use of an algorithmic system do not need to be  weighed up against each other because the latter, in all  ethically relevant respects, achieves a “better” result than  humans using conventional technology. Where this is the  case however, the Data Ethics Commission believes that  the use of algorithmic systems is  ethically commanded ,  because a general ethical preference for human activity  over the use of machines at the expense of the protection  of important legally protected rights is not justified in  the view of the Data Ethics Commission. However, with  regard to the question as to whether human or machine  activity is preferable (→ see Part B, section 1 above) , other  factors will routinely need to be taken into consideration,  such as the emotional well-being of people, human skills  retention and sustainable development, which ultimately  requires weighing up the options. This may go against or  in favour of the algorithmic system. Example 12   If the use of a diagnostic algorithmic system in a  specific clinical area leads to just 2% of patients dying,  whereas 10% of all patients would die as the result  of human misdiagnoses, the use of the system would,  depending on the circumstances of the specific case,  be ethically advisable even if, as a result, minor but  tolerable reductions in patients’ emotional well-being  occurred and additional measures would have to be  taken to ensure human skills retention.However, if, taking all circumstances into account, the  use of an algorithmic system, at the expense of important  legally protected rights, leads to an inferior result than  the use of conventional technology and humans (for  example because more wrong decisions are made) and  there is only an increase in efficiency or convenience, the  use of algorithmic systems must, in principle, be rejected  for ethical reasons . However, ethically defensible  exceptions could be made in this case based on economic  considerations if there would be only a minimal  impairment but an exceptionally high potential saving  which would benefit the public good.
173 F 3. RECOMMENDATION  FOR  A RISK -ADAPTED  REGULATOR y APPROACH 3. Recommendation for a risk-adapted  regulatory approach From a regulatory point of view, the fact that algorithmic  systems need to be assessed very differently from an  ethical perspective, depending on their intended purpose,  performance, robustness and security as well as in terms  of their impacts, suggests that a  risk-adapted regulatory  approach1 is required. It follows the principle that the  greater the potential of algorithmic systems to cause  harm , the more stringent the requirements and the more  far-reaching the intervention  by means of regulatory  instruments. The risk spectrum of algorithmic systems  therefore ranges from systems, the application of which  involves low risk, right through to systems which could  lead to irreversible harm for individuals and society.  Causes of risks can, for example, be inadequate models,  an unsuitable pool of data, in particular in the case of selflearning systems, or inappropriate basic assumptions and  weighting (→ see sections 2.3 and 2.6 above) . Potential harm  caused by algorithmic systems can  vary in nature and can include financial loss, nonmaterial damage and physical harm. For example,  individual applications can cause potentially serious  financial loss (for example lending or insurance terms),  affect opportunities for participation (for example  discrimination in hiring) and involve violations of  fundamental rights and risks to the life and health of  consumers (for example in the case of robotic nurses or  mobility applications). 1 Compare in particular Tobias Krafft / Katharina Zweig: Transparenz und Nachvollziehbarkeit algorithmenbasierter Entscheidungsprozesse  [Transparency and traceability of algorithm-based decision processes], Studie im Auftrag des Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband e.  V. (vzbv)   [Study commissioned by the Federation of German Consumer Organisations (vzbv)], 22 January 2019, pp. 18 et seqq.   (available at: https:/ /www.vzbv.de/sites/default/files/downloads/2019/05/02/19-01-22_zweig_krafft_transparenz_adm-neu.pdf ). 2 Sarah Fischer / Thomas Petersen: Was Deutschland über Algorithmen weiß und denkt – Ergebnisse einer repräsentativen Bevölkerungsumfrage  [What Germany knows and thinks about algorithms – results of a representative population survey], Bertelsmann Stiftung, 2018   (available at: https:/ /www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/de/publikationen/publikation/did/was-deutschland-ueber-algorithmen-weiss-und-denkt/ ).The overarching objective of regulating the use of  algorithmic systems is to prevent detrimental effects at  the individual and supra-individual level. In particular  where algorithmic systems affect matters which are  sensitive in terms of fundamental rights, legal provisions  concerning the design of the systems are also needed.  Regulation should strive to intervene as much as  necessary and as little as possible in order not to hamper  innovation and creativity while at the same time ensuring  the protection of fundamental rights, freedoms and  values. Efficient and proper regulation  can help increase  public trust in the use of algorithmic systems: The public  perception of self-learning systems in particular is that  they are not controllable, which adds to corresponding  scepticism towards technology.2 The Data Ethics Commission takes the view that  the primary addressees of regulation should be  the manufacturers  and operators  of algorithmic  systems. Due to the State’s direct obligation to uphold  fundamental rights, it is necessary to differentiate,  however, between private and state use  of algorithmic  systems (→ see section 7 below in particular)  when the regulation  is drawn up in more detail. Given the model and role  model character of state action, the Federal Government  is advised to exercise particular care when using  algorithmic systems for state purposes. 3.1 System criticality and system requirements A risk-adapted regulatory approach can be made more  concrete by orienting it towards the criticality model of  an algorithmic system. System criticality  is based on the  system’s potential to cause harm, which is determined  based on the likelihood that harm will occur and on the  severity of that harm.
174 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS The severity  of harm that could potentially result, for  example from a faulty decision, depends among other  things on the significance of the legally protected rights  and interests affected (in particular, for example, the right  to determine the use of one’s personal data, to freedom  of expression, the fundamental right to life and physical  integrity, as well as to equal treatment) and the extent  of the potential harm resulting from an infringement.  Furthermore, the assessment of the severity of the  potential harm must take into account the specific  sensitivity of the data used, the level of potential harm  for individuals or groups (including non-material harm  or loss of utility that are hard to calculate in monetary  terms), the number of individuals affected, the total  figure for the potential damage and the harm to society  as a whole, which may go well beyond a straightforward  summation of the harm suffered by individuals. The  consequences of using an algorithmic system should,  based on its area of application, be considered in terms  of its ecological, social, psychological, cultural, economic  and legal dimensions. The general ethical values and  principles (→ see Part B above)  set the standard with regard to  the assigned value. The likelihood  that harm will occur is also influenced by  the following system properties, and factors:  ●the role of algorithmic calculations in the decision-   making process (from the mere inspiration of humans  without any claim to accuracy up to algorithmdetermined decisions, → see section 1 above );  ●the complexity of the decision to be made (from  a simple deterministic depiction of reality or a  probabilistic appraisal of reality up to the multifactorial  and non-determinate prediction of a future reality);  ●the effects of the decision (from a purely abstractly  conceivable context of action or a specific context of  action up to direct implementation); and  ●the reversibility of the effects (from full reversibility up  to irreversibility).The likelihood of the potential harm and the severity of  that harm may also depend on whether it is a state or  private  party taking action and, particularly in economic  contexts, on the market power of the party using the  algorithmic system. This is due to the fact that the state  or private nature of the action and market power are  not only relevant in terms of the obligation to uphold  fundamental rights and potential harm to society as a  whole. They also determine possible alternative options  for those affected. Where affected persons depend  on  an algorithmic system, for example in terms of access  to markets, goods and services, the criticality increases.  The limitation of options can be due to various different  causes, for example network effects, effects of scale and  effects of scope which can, in turn, be reflected in market  power and (a lack of) equivalent alternatives. The greater the system criticality, the stricter the  requirements  that have to be imposed on the system  from a regulatory perspective. These requirements are  being formed out, in particular, by a) corrective and oversight mechanisms; b) specifications regarding the transparency of  algorithmic systems and the explainability and  comprehensibility of the results; and c) rules on the assignment of responsibility and liability  within the context of the development and use of  algorithmic systems (→ see sections 4, 5 and 8 below) .
175 F 3. RECOMMENDATION  FOR  A RISK -ADAPTED  REGULATOR y APPROACH The variety, complexity and dynamics of algorithmic  systems pose major challenges for regulation which  cannot be based on a limited toolbox but must,  depending on the system’s criticality, implement very  different corrective and control instruments at different  regulatory levels  in order to achieve the objectives  of regulation and ensure that the risks involved in the  systems are manageable. The spectrum of possible  instruments ranges from forgoing special legal provisions  and “soft” incentives for self-regulation, giving authorities  the right to monitor, and requiring any final decision to  be taken by a human, up to banning certain intended  purposes and contexts for using algorithmic systems. Provisions regarding the transparency  of systems and  the explainability  and comprehensibility  of their results  (→ see section 2.7 above)  are key components of a corrective  and control regime for algorithmic systems. Also, to that  extent, the criticality of a system determines the scope  of any rights to information and obligations to provide  information. How the information requested can be  comprehensibly communicated varies depending on the  addressees of the system and hence also the intended  purpose and usage context. From an ethical and legal perspective, it is crucial, for all  dealings with algorithmic systems, that responsibility  for  their impacts can be clearly assigned to human decisionmakers at all times. Rules on liability  are, in particular,  also of key importance here, while the question of the  proper organisation of a liability regime for certain  digital products, content and/or services must also be  addressed with a view to the criticality of the system   (→ see section 8 below) .In terms of the governance perspective adopted by  the Data Ethics Commission, all relevant stakeholders   (the State, companies, developers and the public)  must participate in specifying and drawing up  these  differentiated regulatory requirements . The Data Ethics  Commission points out that, even without any special  regulation, the use of algorithmic systems must be  measured against general legal norms. These include in  particular civil liability law, which fundamentally states  that compensation is mandatory in the event of action  which infringes legally protected interests. The provisions  of existing regulation against unfair competition also  apply, for example in the event that consumers are  misled, as well as criminal law if crimes are committed  with the help of algorithmic systems. When examining  the conditions of these norms, the criticality of the  systems and the resulting system requirements also have  legal significance in accordance with general standards. Algorithmic systems are used in order to fulfil specific  functions. In order to assess system criticality, the  ethical assessment of the intended purpose  is therefore  also of crucial importance. If the intended purpose is  ethically indefensible, for example because it infringes  fundamental rights and freedoms or breaches the free  democratic basic order, then there are “red lines” and  “absolute limits” – both for algorithmic systems and for  humans. For example, an algorithmic system used for  political manipulation, fraud or collusive price-fixing must  be seen per se as ethically objectionable.
176 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS The intended purposes are often multifaceted, and  individual facets, in particular regarding secondary  purposes, may each need to be assessed differently  from an ethical perspective. Identifying an intended  purpose which is decisive for the assessment often, in  that sense, requires difficult value judgments . Assessing  the intended purpose of algorithmic systems is further  complicated in the case of digital products because the  development and market launch phases increasingly  overlap; the intended purpose of a product may also  change after it has been launched on the market due to  updates or deployment in other usage contexts. Complex intended purposes in the  case of media intermediaries A number of media intermediaries, such as  search engines, are essential in the Internet  age because they provide access to information  online, channel the flood of information and  actually enable individuals to use the Internet  in the first place. To that extent, their purposes  are desirable and unproblematic in ethical terms.  However, media intermediaries can be ethically  problematic in terms of their specific design.  Their systems provide users with a personalised  selection of information which leads to selection  of the displayed content. However, since as a  result the overwhelming majority of content is  not displayed or is only displayed with a lower  priority, the individual’s spectrum of perception  is narrowed. As such, the intermediary decides,  through programming, over the user’s head as to  what the user sees. As far as the business models  of media intermediaries are driven by advertising,  as is the case with major social networks, there is a  risk that operators will have an economic interest  in disseminating also ethically questionable or  even extremist content because it promises to  keep users on the platform longer, thus increasing  advertising revenue. Due to the interplay of the  sorting and narrowing of what is seen and the  additional danger of influencing the user through  non-transparent third-party interests, there is the  possibility that influence will be non-transparently  exerted, for example over the political decisionmaking process, and could even result in political  manipulation. This is a significant danger for the  free formation of opinions as a basic foundation  of democracy.
177 F 3. RECOMMENDATION FOR A RISK-ADAPTED REGULATORY APPROACH 3.2 Criticality pyramid The Data Ethics Commission recommends consistently  determining the degree of criticality of algorithmic systems using an overarching model. The degree of criticality should guide legislators and society when seeking suitable regulatory thresholds and instruments, but can also provide developers and operators with guidance for assessing their products and systems themselves and finally also be used in basic, advanced and further training to educate and increase awareness amongst various stakeholders. To that extent, with regard to the potential of algorithmic systems to cause harm, the Data Ethics Commission differentiates, both for private and for state operators, between five levels of criticality: Figure 8:  Criticality pyramid and risk-adapted regulatory system for the use of algorithmic systems Level 1Applications  with zero or   negligible  potential for  harmno special measuresBeginning of specific regulationLevel 2Applications with some  potential for harmmeasures such as formal and   substantive requirements (e. g. transparency obligations, publication of a risk  assessment) or  monitoring  procedures  (e. g. disclosure  obligations towards  supervisory bodies, ex-post controls,  audit procedures)Level 3Applications with   regular or significant   potential for harmadditional measures such as   ex-ante approval proceduresLevel 4Applications with serious  potential  for harmadditional measures such as live  interface for “always on“ oversight by  supervisory institutionsLevel 5Applications with an untenable   potential for harmcomplete or partial ban of an   algorithmic system Ban
178 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS In unproblematic usage contexts, it will normally not be  necessary to require developers, clients or operators to go  through specific ethical and legal oversight procedures.  For the many applications with zero or only negligible  potential for harm , i. e. on the lowest level (Level 1) of  the criticality pyramid, the Data Ethics Commission sees  no need for special oversight which would go beyond  the general quality requirements which apply even to  products without algorithmic elements. Example 13   The algorithms used in a drinks vending machine do  have a certain potential for harm, since a user could,  for example, not receive any goods and lose his or  her money. However, this potential for harm does not  exceed the threshold for specific potential for harm  within the algorithm context. It is sufficient here to rely  on the general mechanisms which oblige contractual  partners to fulfil their contractually undertaken  performance obligations or manufacturers to produce  devices which function properly.In the case of applications with some potential for harm   (i. e. on Level 2 of the criticality pyramid), regulation can  and should be implemented. However, the scope of the  necessary measures is limited here. In view of the low level  of criticality, any excessive burden on manufacturers and  operators should specifically be avoided here in order not  to excessively hinder technological or social innovations or  market development. Measures which could be offered at  Level 2 include for example ad-hoc ex-post controls (for  example in the form of an input-output control), if there  is reason to suspect that the system is malfunctioning.  Furthermore, there should be an obligation to produce and  publish an appropriate risk assessment (→ see section 4.1.3  below) . In addition, on a sector-specific basis, obligations to  disclose information to supervisory institutions (including  establishing an interface for a supervisory institution to  carry out input-output controls), increased transparency  obligations as well as access rights for individuals affected  (→ see section 4.1 below for more details)  may be useful. Codes  of conduct should also be considered which would be  developed specifically for each industry and then approved  by the competent supervisory authorities. Compliance  would then need to be tested by the supervisory  authorities using spot checks as well as on an ad-hoc basis  (→ see section 5.2 below) . Criticality in the case of smart mobility applications A provider of smart mobility applications has access  to a data pool generated using all vehicle and mobility  data. If these data are used exclusively for predicting  traffic jams, the level of criticality should be classified  as negligible. However, the flow of traffic can also be  controlled using smart mobility. If algorithms can, for  example, identify which route is the optimum route  for travelling from A to B based on the overall usage of  the mobility system consisting of road, rail, water and  air transport determined in real time using the vehicle data, a corresponding route can be suggested to the  user based on the user’s preference (e.  g. fastest/ most environmentally friendly/cheapest, etc. route).  However, there is also the question as to whether  the State can stipulate certain routes for the user in  consideration of state-prescribed criteria. Here, in  view of the changed potential for harm, the level of  criticality would be higher and would therefore require  stricter regulation as appropriate. 
179 F 3. RECOMMENDATION  FOR  A RISK -ADAPTED  REGULATOR y APPROACH Example 14   Dynamic pricing (for example based on the criteria  of supply and demand) in e-commerce, which  however does not involve any personalised pricing,  has a potential for harm that is generally low but still  exceeding the threshold of relevance, for example  concerning covert discrimination. In the case of applications with regular or tangible  potential for harm  at Level 3 on the criticality pyramid,  in specific cases, in addition to the mechanisms already  required for Level 2, an ex-ante control in the form of a  licensing procedure may be justified (→ see section 4.2.5 below) .  On account of the fact that many algorithmic systems are  highly dynamic, a regular review will be required in the  event that a licence is granted.Example 15   Price algorithms for setting personalised prices  (i. e. setting a price based on criteria which are tailored  to the individual customer and usually estimate  their maximum personal willingness to pay) involve  appreciable potential for harm, for example concerning  discrimination against particularly vulnerable groups.  At best, it should be possible to use them only after they  have undergone a licensing procedure. The same must apply for applications with significant  potential for harm  at Level 4 as applies for Levels 2 and 3.  However, here, additional oversight and transparency  obligations, which may extend all the way through to the  further publication of information on the factors that  influence the algorithmic calculations and their relative  weighting, the pool of data used and the algorithmic  decision-making model in a comprehensible format,  should be required or even “always-on” oversight via a  live interface should be provided for. Further protective  measures to prevent harm are also necessary. Differentiated criticality in the case of media intermediaries With the help of their algorithmic filtering systems,  media intermediaries process and communicate  both content relevant for the formation of opinions,  which is relevant for the democratic decision-making  process, and content used for advertising, purchase  recommendations or entertainment. They therefore  represent the perfect example of situations in which  the use of the same algorithmic system has differing  potential for harm. In the case of user interaction in  the consumer goods sector (in particular advertising  or purchase recommendations), depending on  the personalisation model used, there will be a low to high potential for harm. As soon as balanced  variety must be produced (in particular in the case  of topics relevant to the formation of opinions) on  account of overarching interests in maintaining the  free democratic basic order, the potential for harm  is already higher right from the outset due to the  content. As a result, the regulatory requirements  change simultaneously. In the case of consumption  and entertainment offerings, depending on the  personalisation criteria used, the usage contexts or the  welfare effects to be expected, more or less stringent  regulation must ensue. 
180 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Example 16   Algorithmic systems, for example of players with  huge market share, which are used to determine the  creditworthiness of an individual consumer or company  must be classified as Level 4. Whether a person receives  a loan or not can have a decisive bearing on that  person’s fate. The high level of system criticality is also  justified by the market concentration with few providers  and the tendency for a lender to rely on the judgment  of a particular player. With regard to the system criticality criteria, it may  ultimately be worth considering a complete or partial  ex-ante ban on the use of an algorithmic system for  applications with untenable potential for harm  (Level  5). An ex-post ban may also be used as a consequence for  breaches of applicable law or non-fulfilment of the system  requirements set out for the specific system criticality. Example 17   Lethal autonomous weapons systems are often seen as  a “red line”, as machines should not be allowed to kill  people. However, that can apply only on the basis that  they are algorithm-determined killings. Where lethal  autonomous weapons simply provide human soldiers  with support in recognising objects or are merely used  to keep a missile on track in the face of crosswinds,  an ethical “red line” is not being crossed. The classification of an algorithmic system in the criticality  pyramid must, where necessary, be regularly reviewed  in  the light of the dynamic nature of these systems.3.3  EU regulation on algorithmic systems  enshrining horizontal requirements and  formed out in sectoral instruments Algorithmic systems are infiltrating more and more  areas of our personal and social lives. The purposes of  algorithmic systems and the areas in which they could  potentially be used are therefore not set in stone. For  example, a facial recognition system developed for  use with private photos could also be used by state  investigative authorities for law enforcement purposes  or to prevent threats. This suggests addressing the  challenges posed by algorithmic systems following the  example of data protection law in the form of horizontal  regulation , i. e. through a legal instrument, the material  scope of which covers algorithmic systems in general,  and which applies to private and public players  alike. In  addition to the considerable symbolic power, another  point in favour of horizontal regulation is the fact that  gaps in protection would be eliminated and dangerous  situations which currently cannot be foreseen would be  covered. One of the main arguments in favour of such  overarching regulation which sets out basic principles  for all algorithmic systems is also the fact that citizens  would, as a result, have a clear idea of what to expect in  all areas, and (European) legislators could complete this  task within a reasonable period of time. As a result, the Data Ethics Commission recommends  that the Federal Government should work towards  drawing up horizontal basic regulation at the European  level in the form of an EU Regulation on Algorithmic  Systems (EU-ASR) . In addition to the key basic  principles for algorithmic systems developed here as  requirements for algorithmic systems, the horizontal  legal instrument should group together general  substantive rules – informed by the concept of system  criticality – on the admissibility and design of algorithmic  systems, transparency, the rights of individuals affected,  organisational and technical safeguards and supervisory  institutions and structures.
181 F 3. RECOMMENDATION FOR A RISK-ADAPTED REGULATORY APPROACH Figure 9:   EU regulation on algorithmic systems enshrining horizontal requirements and specified in sectoral instrumentsSektor 1 Specifying/supplementary rules and requirementsSektor 2 Specifying/supplementary rules and requirementsSektor 3 Specifying/supplementary rules and requirementsSektor 4 Specifying/supplementary rules and requirementsFederal Government  and European Union EU Regulation on Algorithmic Systems (EU-ASR) Key basic principles for algorithmic systems, general substantive rules on  the admissibility and design of algorithmic systems. Rules on transparency, organisational and technical safeguards, and supervisory institutions and structures.European Union At the same time, the Data Ethics Commission recommends that the Federal Government should also advocate sectoral rules on the European level and, outside the competences of the EU itself and within its own legislative and administrative competences, enact appropriate sectoral legal acts which are oriented towards system criticality. (Fig. 9). An overarching EU-ASR will have to be limited to few basic principles, as otherwise European legislatory powers would be overburdened. Legislators would, if rules were too detailed, in particular face the issue of how to deal, in a general legal instrument, with the wide variety of systems of which it is now almost impossible to keep track and the highly dynamic development of technology. From the perspective of those affected, general legal instruments also carry the risk that the administrative obligations will also apply in cases where there is not sufficient potential for harm, because a horizontal legal instrument cannot distinguish between risky and less risky operational aims (as well as potential exceptional configurations) with the same level of detail that they have in reality. With regard to both points, the supplementary recourse to sector-specific legislation which would be limited in terms of scope but would therefore be easier to form out would relieve some of the burden. Any supplementary sector-specific approach would also have to take into consideration the legislative and administrative powers distributed in accordance with applicable law between the EU, the Federal level and the States (Bundesländer). An additional fact is that, with regard to the official oversight and supervisory institutions and structures, for various reasons there could be no question of consolidating and assigning the “overall task” to one single authority  (→ see section 5.1 below) . Therefore, in addition to the EU-ASR it will be necessary to enact several legal instruments with specific provisions for individual sectors or potentially harmful situations. In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, combining a general basic regulation with further sector-specific legal instruments has the major advantage of enabling differentiation between the different needs for protection involved for individual systems and usage contexts. This is in line with the basic concept behind risk-adapted regulation, according to which the regulatory requirements for algorithmic systems should be determined based on the specific system criticality. 
182 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Even in data protection law, in the public sector, there  are numerous special laws which supplement the  general provisions of the GDPR for different sectors.  The basic idea behind data protection law is that, in the  case of automated data processing, there is no longer  such a thing as “inconsequential” data, which is why it is  hardly possible any more to differentiate meaningfully  between personal data on the basis of worthiness of  protection or criticality in the absence of common basic  rules. Nonetheless it is also true that a variety of special  provisions ensures an increased level of protection in the  wide range of areas of state activity. Similarly, there is an  according need for supplementary sectoral provisions for  algorithmic systems. The application of such regulation  also does not have to fall short as a result of the fact  that their purpose and usage context could change. After  all, firstly, such a change would be, especially in more  complex systems, inherently limited. Secondly, the issue  could be addressed from a regulatory perspective by the  fact that the legal instruments would not be materially  linked to the original purpose or original usage context  but the current functionality of the system or the new  intended purpose  of the system. In this way, any changes  in purpose and context would, if necessary, result in the  application of a differentiated regulatory framework. However, these primarily pragmatic considerations  in no way affect the requirement for the standardsetting body or bodies to ensure the greatest possible  coherence between legal instruments  in their respective  undertakings. This will apply not only to the regulatory  approaches developed here, i.  e. in particular the notion  of system criticality, and the rights of data subjects;  regulatory infrastructures and processes should also be  designed as uniformly as possible.
183 36 The Data Ethics Commission recommends adopting  a risk-adapted regulatory approach  to algorithmic  systems. The principle underlying this approach should be  as follows: the greater the potential for harm, the more  stringent the requirements and the more far-reaching the  intervention by means of regulatory instruments. When  assessing this potential for harm, the sociotechnical   system as a whole  must be considered, or in other  words all the components of an algorithmic application,  including all the people involved, from the development  phase – for example the training data used – right  through to its implementation in an application  environment and any evaluation and adjustment  measures. 37 The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  potential of algorithmic systems to harm individuals and/ or society should be determined uniformly on the basis  of a universally applicable model . For this purpose, the  legislator should develop a criteria-based assessment  scheme  as a tool for determining the criticality of  algorithmic systems. This scheme should be based on the  general ethical and legal principles presented by the Data  Ethics Commission. 38 Among other things, the regulatory instruments and  the requirements that apply to algorithmic systems   should include corrective and oversight mechanisms,  specifications of transparency, explainability and  comprehensibility of the systems’ results, and rules on  the allocation of responsibility and liability for using the  systems. 39 The Data Ethics Commission believes that a useful first  stage in determining the potential for harm of algorithmic  systems is to distinguish between five levels of  criticality .  Applications that fall under the lowest of these levels  (Level 1) are associated with zero or negligible potential for  harm, and it is unnecessary to carry out special oversight  of them or impose requirements other than the general  quality requirements that apply to products irrespective of  whether they incorporate algorithmic systems. 40 Applications that fall under Level 2 are associated  with some potential for harm , and can and should be  regulated on an as-needs basis; regulatory instruments  used in this connection may include ex-post controls,  an obligation to produce and publish an appropriate  risk assessment, an obligation to disclose information  to supervisory bodies or also enhanced transparency  obligations and access rights for individuals affected.Summary of the most important  recommendations for action Risk-adapted regulatory approach
184 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 41 In addition, the introduction of licensing procedures  may be justified for applications that fall under Level  3, which are associated with regular  or significant  potential for harm . Applications that fall under Level  4 are associated with serious potential for harm ; the  Data Ethics Commission believes that these applications  should be subject to enhanced oversight and transparency  obligations. These may extend all the way through to the  publication of information on the factors that influence  the algorithmic calculations and their relative weightings,  the pool of data used and the algorithmic decision-making  model; an option for “always-on” regulatory oversight via a  live interface with the system may also be required. 42 Finally, a complete or partial ban should be imposed  on applications with an untenable potential for harm   (Level 5). 43 The Data Ethics Commission believes that the measures  it has proposed should be implemented in a new EU  Regulation on algorithmic systems enshrining general  horizontal requirements (Regulation on Algorithmic  Systems, EU-ASR) . This horizontal regulation should  incorporate the fundamental requirements for  algorithmic sytems that the Data Ethics Commission  developed. In particular, it should group together general  substantive rules – informed by the concept of system  criticality – on the admissibility and design of algorithmic  systems, transparency, the rights of individuals affected,  organisational and technical safeguards and supervisory  institutions and structures. This horizontal instrument  should be fleshed out in sectoral instruments  at EU and  Member State level, with the concept of system criticality  once again serving as a guiding framework. 44 The process of drafting the EU-ASR (as recommended  above) should incorporate a debate on how best to  demarcate the respective scopes of this Regulation  and the GDPR . A number of factors should be taken  into account in this respect; firstly, algorithmic systems  may pose specific risks to individuals and groups even  if they do not involve the processing of personal data,  and these risks may relate to assets, ownership, bodily  integrity or discrimination. Secondly, the regulatory  framework introduced for the future horizontal  regulation of algorithmic systems may need to be  more flexible and risk-adapted than the current data  protection regime.
185 F 4. INSTRUMENTS : OBLIGATIONS  OF DATA  CONTROLLERS  AND  RIGHTS  OF DATA  SUBJECTS 4. Instruments: obligations of data controllers and  rights of data subjects In order to provide individuals and groups with  effective protection against the dangers of algorithmic  systems, the Data Ethics Commission believes that both  transparency requirements (→ see section 4.1 below)  and further  specifications for algorithmic systems with a view to  effective protection against substantively inappropriate  decisions and unfair decisions (→ section 4.2.)  are advisable. 4.1 Transparency requirements 4.1.1  Mandatory labelling (“if”) A key tool for creating transparency is mandatory  labelling . Because a mandatory labelling scheme  requires little detailed information, infringements of the  fundamental rights of system operators, in particular with  regard to their business secrets, are also less serious than  in the case of access rights. The Data Ethics Commission  believes that this justifies establishing labelling in the  case of critical systems (as from Level 2) as a blanket  obligation for system operators and not as a requestbased right for the individuals affected. Due to the comparatively narrow scope of Article 22  GDPR (relating to a decision based solely on automated  processing), to which the duties to provide information  refer, the Data Ethics Commission believes that the existing  labelling obligations of the GDPR3 are insufficient . In  particular, significant impacts for affected individuals  can arise even below the threshold of Article 22 GDPR.  That applies for algorithm-based and algorithm-driven  decisions, i.  e. situations in which the humans taking the  decisions run the risk of accepting algorithmic information  and proposed decisions without reflection and by  default (in particular in areas where human assessment  is expected) or only following algorithmically determined  and prescribed paths. 3 Article 13(2)(f), Article 14(2)(g) and Article 15(1)(h) in conjunction with Article 22 GDPR.Because the Data Ethics Commission sees the  authenticity of interpersonal communication as a  fundamental condition for trustworthy interaction within  society, a mandatory labelling scheme should always  apply if there is any risk of confusion  between human  and machine and should therefore apply irrespective of  system criticality. This applies, for example, to digital  voice assistants and chatbots which these days are  sometimes hard to identify as such. Labelling may, in  the case of voice assistants for example, be carried out  both by means of a regular reminder of the assistant’s  mechanical nature (even during ongoing communication)  and also through the use of a mechanical-sounding voice.  Conversely, the Data Ethics Commission considers that  there is no risk of confusion (and therefore also no need  for a mandatory labelling scheme) in areas where the  nature of the information is irrelevant or the recipient  expects a mechanical voice anyway, such as in the case of  loudspeaker announcements at railway stations. 4.1.2   Duties to provide information, duties to provide  an explanation and access to information (“how”  and “what”) Whilst mandatory labelling schemes require system  operators to ensure transparency regarding as to whether  and the extent to which algorithmic systems are used  (“if”), duties to provide information and rights of access   are regularly focused on more detailed information  regarding the decision-making mechanism (“how”) and  the data used (“what”) by the algorithmic system.
186 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Duties to provide information and rights of access  regarding the behaviour of algorithmic systems and  the way that decisions are made inside the systems are  important from the perspective of citizens for them to  be able to understand decisions and review them and/ or have them reviewed individually. Only with their help  can data subjects exercise their rights and challenge a  decision on an informed basis. The following transparency  requirements apply equally to private and state operators  of algorithmic systems. Special requirements with regard  to the transparency of systems used by the State will be  covered in more detail in section 7 below. 4.1.2.1   Duties to provide information and   rights of access Articles 13, 14 and 15 GDPR already set out duties to  provide information and rights of access where personal  data are processed. In the event of automated decisionmaking within the meaning of Article 22 GDPR, the  GDPR grants the data subject a right to “meaningful”  information about the “logic involved”, as well as the  “significance” and the “envisaged consequences” of  the processing.4 The Data Ethics Commission takes the view that, just as  in the case of the mandatory labelling scheme (→ see section  4.1.1 above) , the legal concept behind these norms should  also apply outside of the narrow scope of Article 22(1)  GDPR and be an integral part of the EU-ASR suggested  here (→ see section 3.3 above) . The extent of such a duty to  provide information will depend on the criticality of  the system . In the case of applications with negligible  potential for harm, brief statements on the logic behind  decisions will suffice, for example on the pool of data  used or the general weighting of certain factors with  regard to the result. The more risk a system involves, the  more extensive the duties to disclose information will  essentially be. 4 Article 13(2)(f), Article 14(2)(g) and Article 15(1)(h) GDPR.The more sensitive a decision is in terms of personality,  the more detailed information relating to the individual  case is needed. However, it should also be borne in mind  that providing detailed information regarding the factors  and their weighting could also have potentially ethically  questionable influence on the private lifestyle of the data  subject. Furthermore, the data subject could also use the  acquired information to undermine an algorithmic system  which performs an important function. The technical and organisational requirements  which  must be met in order to be able to fulfil these extensive  duties to provide information must be incorporated in the  design of algorithmic systems right from the outset, as it  will be possible to ensure that the systems are operated  lawfully only if the corresponding necessary “meaningful”  information can also be provided when the system is used. When defining duties to provide information and rights of  access in order to increase the transparency of algorithmic  systems, care should be taken to ensure that no special  technical skills or knowledge are required of consumers.  Whenever rights of access are expanded, it should be  borne in mind that, from the perspective of data subjects,  this will increase transparency only if the information is  prepared in a way which is suitable for the recipient .
187 F 4. INSTRUMENTS : OBLIGATIONS  OF DATA  CONTROLLERS  AND  RIGHTS  OF DATA  SUBJECTS 4.1.2.2  Duties to provide an explanation At least in certain areas of complex algorithmic systems, it  may be appropriate, in addition to the general explanation  regarding the system’s logic and significance, to require  an explanation of the specific reasons why the system  made a recommendation or decision. Such a specific  explanation is required above all if the decision concerns  areas which are sensitive in terms of personality or  otherwise is of particular significance in terms of  fundamental rights or socioeconomics. It is important,  in such cases, for data subjects to be informed in a  comprehensible, relevant and clear manner. The Data  Ethics Commission therefore welcomes the technical  efforts to improve the explainability of algorithmic (in  particular self-learning) systems (explainable or explicable  AI), and encourages the Federal Government to promote  such projects. The Data Ethics Commission believes that, in certain  situations, it is worth considering an entitlement to  “counterfactual explanations” as is sometimes discussed  in the literature.5 In such cases, data subjects are  informed of the factors in the decision-making process  which, in the case of a (negative) decision for them,  would have made the positive difference, i.  e. would have  actually led to the desired outcome. In a case where an  application for a loan has been rejected based on the  use of an algorithmic system, the data subject would, for  example, be entitled to learn from the system operator  which of the factors taken into consideration by the  system would have had to have been different, and in  what way, for the application to have had a positive  outcome. However, the Data Ethics Commission points  out that this approach quickly reaches its limits in the  case of more complex systems, as the data subject  would have to be provided with a whole host of different  “counterfactual” scenarios here in order to be given a  reasonably complete picture; otherwise there would be a  danger of misinformation, questionable steering or even  manipulation by focusing on certain aspects for strategic  or educational reasons. 5 Sandra Wachter / Brent Mittelstadt / Chris Russel: Harvard Journal of Law & Technology 2018 (31), pp. 841 et seqq.In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, given the  current state of technical development, the concept of  “counterfactual explanation” is therefore not suitable  for use as a general component of any regulation of  algorithmic systems; however, it could be considered for  special processing situations. 4.1.2.3   Access to information for not directly affected  persons In addition, the Data Ethics Commission considers that,  in certain sectors in which not only individual but also  social interests are affected to a significant extent, it is  advisable even for individuals not directly affected to  be granted a right of access to information regarding  the algorithmic systems. This would apply, in particular,  if their use were relevant for public opinion-forming   or had major welfare effects  for the population. Such  rights would, first and foremost, be worth considering for  journalistic and research purposes and would also have to  be accompanied with adequate protective measures for  any affected interests of system operators. Under certain circumstances, in particular in the event  of the State’s use of systems with significant potential  for harm, unconditional rights of access to information  and publication requirements are also conceivable in the  view of the Data Ethics Commission.
188 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 4.1.2.4   Requirements for defining duties and rights,   in particular in consideration of system  operators’ rights When defining duties to provide information and  explanations and rights of access, it must always be  borne in mind that these may also affect the legally  protected interests of the operators  of algorithmic  systems, as well as of those who use their outputs. This  includes, most notably, the protection of business secrets  and the interest in preventing any manipulation of the  systems and manipulative use of the systems. Private  system operators can, in principle, invoke the fact that  they define their own free-will decisions and contractual  decisions based on the outputs of an algorithmic system.  However, that does not release them from monitoring  required to check whether they are acting in accordance  with the law, as the fundamental right to freedom of  action is restricted by bans on discrimination (in particular  the General Act on Equal Treatment), the fundamental  rights of the data subjects or third parties and, in general,  the provisions (and specific contractual provisions) of  the legal system. Furthermore, transparency rights must  always be balanced with the provisions of data protection  law relating to the protection of the personal data of third  parties stored in the system. The Data Ethics Commission therefore believes that it is  appropriate for legislators to accompany transparency  obligations with rules which, at the initiative of the  system operators or also possibly affected third parties,  enable the conflicting rights and interests to be weighed  against the transparency interests of the data subjects or  other private individuals entitled to claim rights. However,  in the view of the Data Ethics Commission, rigid rules  of priority , for example a general preference for the  protection of business secrets over transparency interests,  are not appropriate for the matter concerned , despite the increase in legal certainty they might bring. Where  system operators or third parties invoke conflicting  interests, meticulous checks must be carried out to see  whether such interests cannot be taken into account  with specific protective measures before a transparency  obligation is completely rejected. If private individuals  have rights of access to information, the requirements  regarding the protective measures and the demonstration  of their existence must be devised so that they do not  act as a barrier preventing vulnerable consumers and/ or citizens from acquiring information. Interests of third  parties must be protected for example by means of  anonymisation. 4.1.3  Risk impact assessment The impact assessment within the meaning of Article  35(1) GDPR concerns only information on the impacts  for the protection of personal data ; however, it does not  include a comprehensive risk analysis of an algorithmic  system. In the case of algorithmic systems, as from  a certain level of potential for harm, it is, however,  appropriate and reasonable legally to require the  provider/user to produce and publish an appropriate risk  impact assessment in order to assess the risk involved  with the system. The more critical the system is, the more  comprehensive the risk impact assessment must be. It  should also cover an assessment of the risks relating  to self-determination, privacy, bodily integrity and  personal integrity, as well as assets, property and nondiscrimination , and also include methods for gauging the  quality and fairness of the data and the model accuracy,  for example the bias or the rates of (statistical) error  (overall or for certain sub-groups) exhibited by a system  during forecasting/category formation.
189 F 4. INSTRUMENTS : OBLIGATIONS  OF DATA  CONTROLLERS  AND  RIGHTS  OF DATA  SUBJECTS Use Case: Personalised prices I – transparency requirements The increasing use of pricing algorithms in  e-commerce presents challenges not only for  consumer protection law but also for competition  law: pricing algorithms can review the market in  order to adjust prices in line with demand and  competitors’ offers in real time. In e-commerce, providers can therefore apply  personalised prices (for individual users or groups)  directly or via individual discounts. Algorithmic  systems can, for example, be used specifically to  cash in on consumers’ maximum willingness to  pay or encourage users not to abort a purchase  transaction. This personalisation is based on scoring  processes, for example using real-time analyses of  users’ surfing habits or data collected in another  way. The underlying algorithmic systems are usually  “black boxes”, meaning that the pool of data used  and logic behind the decisions on pricing are not  comprehensible to outsiders. There is therefore a  risk of price discrimination, for example relating to  protected population groups within the meaning of  the General Act on Equal Treatment. The potential for harm to be caused by the  implementation of higher personalised prices for  individual consumers can vary greatly. Nevertheless,  even small price increases for individual goods and  services can, when added together, lead to significant  welfare losses for the individuals and population  groups affected. In particular, learning systems,  which may, for example, use signalling, can also lead  to quasi-collusive high market prices. If competitors deviously collude on prices or conditions via  algorithms, this has a negative effect on competition,  the innovative prowess of the economy and ultimately  consumers; this applies both to the intentional use of  algorithms to influence prices and also where parallel  behaviour and high prices (tacit collusion) occur by  means of learning algorithms without such specific  intention and where no direct price-fixing was  undertaken by humans. It would not suffice for this overall high level of  criticality to merely trigger transparency requirements  and labelling obligations for pricing systems. A  comprehensive impact assessment could also help  to identify the discrimination risks of an algorithmic  pricing system: if the pool of data being used to  calculate personalised prices is known, independent  experts should be able to check whether they  correlate with protected population groups (known  as proxies), i.  e. whether, for example, women or  certain religious groups have to pay higher prices.  If consumers are also made aware, via labelling  obligations, that prices and/or discounts are  personalised, the affected parties could exercise rights  of access to check the data used for “their” price for  accuracy or potential discriminatory factors. Transparency regarding price-relevant factors is also  important in order to observe the steering effects of  personalised pricing on the behaviour of individual  consumers, as they may be of a scale which is relevant  for freedom.
190 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 4.1.4  Duty to draw up documentation and keep logs The more complex, dynamic and dispersed the process  is by which individual IT systems convert an input into  an output, the more important it is, from a regulatory  perspective, to make the specific causes of a particular  decision comprehensible. Only then can errors be  detected and infringements of rights be penalised  effectively. One approach to better understand how  software-based processes work is to record individual  program steps digitally and use them for test purposes.  This may be required for personal data processing in  accordance with data protection law in order to fulfil the  accountability requirement. Firstly, such a requirement to document and log the data  sets and models used, the level of granularity, the retention  periods and the intended purposes should be specified  in data protection law so as to provide controllers and  processors with greater legal clarity. Secondly, systems  which have a significant potential for harm (Level 4) should  be required to document and log program processes. The  data sets and models used should be described in such  a way that they are comprehensible to the supervisory  institutions carrying out oversight measures (as regards  the origin of the data sets or the way in which they are  prepared, for example, or the optimisation goals pursued  using the models).4.2  Other requirements for algorithmic systems 4.2.1   General quality requirements for algorithmic  systems System operators should be required by standards to  guarantee a minimum level of quality, from both a  technical and a mathematical-procedural perspective .  The procedural criteria imposed must ensure that  algorithmically derived results are obtained in a correct  and lawful manner. For this purpose, quality criteria can  be imposed, in particular as regards the mathematical  model, specific processing methods, corrective and  control mechanisms or data quality and system  security. To strike a balance between the conflicting  fundamental rights of the software operator and the  subjects of decisions, the requirements for the validity  of mathematical models and the relevance of the  underlying data should become stricter as the potential  of algorithmic systems to cause harm increases . In the case of algorithm-based and algorithm-driven  decisions, skill sensitivity  should also be built into  the design , for example by deliberately mandating the  completion of certain training modules . In situations  where decision assistants are used, for example, it  has proven particularly helpful to introduce systemimposed role changes at certain intervals, or in other  words to assign the user the task of making the initial  decision before he or she sees the algorithmically derived  proposal. Attention tests  are another option, albeit one  which the individual user may perceive as more onerous;  they require him or her to detect incorrect decisions  which the computer has deliberately interspersed among  correct ones – and therefore also require the true nature  of the proposals in question to be identified in good time  before anyone suffers harm.
191 F 4. INSTRUMENTS : OBLIGATIONS  OF DATA  CONTROLLERS  AND  RIGHTS  OF DATA  SUBJECTS Steps should also be taken to ensure that improvement  processes are carried out fairly and with regard to the  interests of everyone affected; particular attention should  be paid to ensuring that suitable feedback loops  take the  interests of the data subjects and not just of the system  operators into account. With regard to data quality, it  would also be advisable to specify the extent to which  the use of estimated or “proxy” data (→ see Part C, section 2.2.2  et seq. above)  should be permitted or forbidden for certain  areas of application. In addition to the requirements placed on the algorithmic  system by the actual processing purpose, the security   requirements should also be fulfilled at the design  stage. The individual requirements of all parties involved  should be taken into consideration in order to ensure  that appropriate design-related decisions are taken  as part of conceptualisation, implementation and  operation. Although the system operator usually has the  main responsibility for the risk assessment, the system  operator can fulfil this responsibility only with access to  sufficient documentation, e.  g. the manufacturer’s risk  impact assessment. There also needs to be clarity as to  who is responsible for which area. For areas identified as  critical, the Data Ethics Commission recommends setting  out legal specifications relating to  ●minimum standards for the required security and the  measures to be taken;  ●specific details regarding how and under what  conditions manufacturers or system operators must  design and conduct test procedures (for example to  identify bias and/or discriminatory distortion);  ●legal consequences in the case of security gaps or  other errors;  ●duties to draw up documentation on functionality  and on tests which users receive in order to be able to  assess risks; 6 Cf. Article 22(3) GDPR. 7 Cf. Article 13(2)(f) GDPR, Article 14(2)(g) GDPR and Article 15(1)(h) GDPR. ●obligations to carry out system updates within a  specified time frame and to report on them. 4.2.2   Special protective measures in the use of   algorithmic systems in the context of human  decision-making Humans must not become an object of technology. This  key principle for the regulation of algorithmic systems  is particularly pertinent where algorithmic systems are  used in order to support human decisions or automate  decision-making processes, i.  e. replace human decisionmaking with technical processes. Article 22 GDPR codifies this principle in applicable  existing law for certain algorithmic systems which fall  within the scope of the GDPR: no one can be subject to a  decision based solely on automated processing, including  profiling, which produces legal or other significant  effects concerning him or her – unless it is necessary for  entering into, or performance of, a contract, is based on  the data subject’s explicit consent or is authorised by law.  Where such a fully automated decision is permitted, the  data controller must implement protective measures in  order to safeguard the data subject’s rights and interests6  Stricter duties to provide information and rights of access  also apply.7
192 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS The Data Ethics Commission believes that various aspects  of these rules currently require further clarification .  The duties to provide information and rights of access  connected with Article 22 GDPR (“including profiling”)  should refer to automated profiling as such . Individual  credit reference agencies, for example, do not consider  themselves subject to these rules, claiming that they  apparently simply conduct profiling, while the “decisions”  are made by the companies which, for example, request  a credit score. The Data Ethics Commission believes this  argument does not sufficiently take the intention of the  GDPR into account, as the long-term effects on the data  subjects of such profiling could, firstly, be significant, and  secondly, the GDPR particularly emphasises profiling.  Where the data protection authorities and the courts  are able to apply the applicable law to the appropriate  extent by means of an interpretation based on the  protective purpose of the GDPR, this is to be welcomed.  However, at the same time, given how sensitive this issue  is in terms of fundamental rights, the democratically  legitimised legislator is called upon to further specify  the legal framework conditions soon in order to create  legal certainty as quickly as possible. The Data Ethics  Commission recommends that the Federal Government  should advocate for this as part of the evaluation of  the GDPR. Clarification and specification is also needed  regarding  the question as to when a decision pursuant to Article  22 GDPR  is “based solely” on automated processing of  personal data and the scope of the term “similar effect”  and of the protection rights under Article 22(3) GDPR.  The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should advocate, in the evaluation of  the GDPR, for the scope of Article 22 GDPR to be fleshed  out. The potential for harm caused by the algorithmdetermined decision-making systems, which was the  original guiding principle of Article 22 GDPR, does not,  in particular, categorically differ from that of many  algorithm-driven decision-making systems. In particular,  the tendency of the humans involved simply to accept  the recommendations of algorithmic systems and not  exercise discretion plays a role.In view of the fact that the potential for harm of  algorithm-based systems varies heavily in the detail, the  Data Ethics Commission does not believe that it would  be appropriate to generally broaden the prohibitory  principle of Article 22 GDPR. In particular, the principle  of human final decision-making pursuant to Article  22(3) GDPR is not suitable for all algorithmic systems in  equal measure. As such, for algorithmic systems where  no “decision” is taken by the system within the meaning  of the current wording of Article 22(1) GDPR, a right to  having the final decision made by a human would often  not be very practical and also often not desirable. Instead,  the Data Ethics Commission recommends a risk-adapted  regulatory regime which provides individuals with  appropriate safeguards (in particular against profiling)  and opportunities to defend themselves if mistakes are  made or if their rights are jeopardised. The legal notion that humans must not become a mere  object of technical systems should also form a central  legislative anchor point  within the horizontal EU legal  instrument of a EU-ASR (→ see section 3.3 above)  on the  risk-adapted regulation of algorithmic systems, which  the Data Ethics Commission recommends, and within  the accompanying sectoral legal instruments. These legal  instruments should therefore include provisions which  also set out specifications for algorithm-based decisionmaking systems outside of the scope of Article 22 GDPR.  In so far as the new layer of regulation also covers  algorithmic systems which also fall within the scope of  Article 22 GDPR (which may have been modified in light  of the recommendations made here), the regulatory  systems  must be precisely synchronised .
193 F 4. INSTRUMENTS : OBLIGATIONS  OF DATA  CONTROLLERS  AND  RIGHTS  OF DATA  SUBJECTS 4.2.3  Right to appropriate algorithmic inferences? The Data Ethics Commission believes that the processes  involved in the data-based generation of algorithmic  inferences  on the supposed interests, tendencies and  character traits of individuals, in particular consumers,  deserve maximum social and political attention. The  digital economy is awash with such inferences. They  are very characteristic of many digital business models  which are geared towards the detailed personalisation  of certain offers or services. Many consumers appreciate  the convenience of such offers and services; however,  they can also lead to risks if inferences are made based on  an incorrect pool of data or if results with inappropriate  contents are obtained on account of the inadequacy of  other system components. In order to prevent the risks which could be posed by  certain algorithmic inferences, many want to grant data  subjects a legal “right to appropriate inferences”.8 That  proposal sets out a comprehensive package of measures  which would give each data subject an effective tool for  monitoring the inferences concerning them generated  by operators of algorithmic systems. In addition to a  substantive right to be subject to appropriate inferences,  it sets out an obligation on the part of the system  operator, without having to be requested for the  information, to inform the individual concerned that the  inferences drawn were “appropriate” and the reasons why  that is the case. The Data Ethics Commission welcomes the debate which  the proposal of such a “right to appropriate inferences” has  triggered. However, it points out that such a right could  affect constitutionally protected interests of operators  of algorithmic systems. In the view of the Data Ethics  Commission, any regulatory development of the proposal  should take these protection aspects into consideration,  for example by limiting the scope to systems which have  a high level of criticality due to their relevance in terms of  participation and fundamental rights. 8 Omer Tene / Jules Polonetsky: Northwestern Journal of Technology and Intellectual Property, 2013 (11:5), pp. 279 et seq.; Sandra Wachter / Brent  Mittelstadt: Columbia Business Law Review, 2019 (2), p. 1, et seqq. The proposal consists of a material component and a procedural component.4.2.4  Legal protection against discrimination One of the main aims of the regulation of algorithmbased, algorithm-driven and algorithm-determined  decision-making systems is to prevent discrimination  against an individual based on a characteristic set out  in Article 3(3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic  of Germany and/or Article 21(1) of the Charter of  Fundamental Rights of the European Union, as well  as any objectively unjustified discrimination, and to  protect the personal integrity of individuals concerned.  Whilst state bodies have a direct obligation to uphold  fundamental rights  when undertaking any kind of state  activity and are therefore subject to a comprehensive  prohibition on discrimination, a sub-constitutional basis  is required for private actors. The technical legal starting  point for this is essentially the German General Act on  Equal Treatment , also serving to incorporate according  EU directives into German law, alongside general clauses  in German private law, for example on unconscionable  contracts. For discrimination between private individuals to fall  under the General Act on Equal Treatment, firstly the  discrimination must be on the grounds of a sensitive  characteristic  (race, ethnic origin, gender, religion,  disability, age or sexual orientation); secondly, the  situational scope  must be open (employment context or  access to goods and services, including housing, which  are available to the public).
194 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS In principle, the provisions of the General Act on Equal  Treatment already cover discrimination by algorithmic  systems in accordance with applicable law. However, not  all matters susceptible to discrimination are included in  the scope of the General Act on Equal Treatment, and  that Act does not cover all sensitive situations where  algorithmically established results trigger or facilitate  discrimination (e.  g. in the case of a mortgage offer based  on an individual risk assessment). It is therefore worth  considering to, for example, broaden the situational  scope of the General Act on Equal Treatment  to include  all automated decision-making processes or additionally  incorporating individual areas relating to algorithmic  inferences which are particularly sensitive in terms of  personality.9 This primarily concerns areas which could  have a long-lasting negative effect on a person’s way  of life, such as consumer contracts drawn up based on  scoring or on high-risk procedures, facial recognition  methods or price discrimination in certain areas of life  such as healthcare. The contractual partner’s general  freedom of action which is equally constitutionally  protected must also be properly taken into consideration. 9 Mario Martini, Juristenzeitung (JZ), 2017, p. 2021.It is also necessary to discuss whether, in the context  of algorithmic systems, legislators should remove  the restrictive reference to specific grounds for  discrimination. The discriminatory effects of algorithmic  systems only sometimes reflect bias which exists within  society with regard to classic grounds for discrimination ,  for example in so far as the bias is in the training data or  in the model used. This would, for example, be the case if  a system which is used to select candidates was trained  using the data of successful managers from the past who  were overwhelmingly male. However, the potential for  algorithmic systems to discriminate extends far beyond  this, for example if a disadvantage is systematically  associated with group attributes against which  discrimination is not prohibited by law (e.  g. home address  in a specific district) or with correlations determined by  means of pattern recognition but which are really more  random. To some extent, these situations can already be  managed in the form of indirect discrimination . In that  respect, a suitable relaxation of the rules relating to the  burden of proof may also possibly be required. To some  extent, however, entirely new issues of fairness also arise.  These concern not only the distribution of opportunities  to the detriment of traditionally marginalised  communities but also the exclusion of groups which have  been thrown together based on more or less coincidental  attributes: the specific characteristics of machine learning  are creating new grounds for discrimination  which,  however, could have enormous widespread impacts on  account of the fact that trained algorithms are also used  in other areas of application.
195 F 4. INSTRUMENTS : OBLIGATIONS  OF DATA  CONTROLLERS  AND  RIGHTS  OF DATA  SUBJECTS It is therefore appropriate to consider broadening  protection to include every systematic and objectively  unjustified type of discrimination based on a group  attribute. The Data Ethics Commission recommends  that the Federal Government should also examine  appropriately adjusting the General Act on Equal  Treatment or alternatively anchoring protection in  any future specific algorithm legislation . A particular  regulatory problem is that there is a (fundamentally evergrowing) plethora of group attributes which could lead to  such algorithmic discrimination, and hence the systematic  nature would be the sole criterion for differentiating  between prejudices which are relevant and irrelevant in  terms of discrimination law. Any corresponding regulation  for substantive protection against discrimination would  therefore, in any case, have to be accompanied, on the  one hand, by corresponding duties of disclosure and  duties to state reasons and, on the other, by various  internal and external oversight mechanisms for which  the new regulation would provide the substantive  examination criteria. The consequences of such regulation  on all the parties involved would, in any case, have to be  meticulously assessed and weighed up. Irrespective of the issue of broadening the definition  of the offence, thought should be given to whether the  rules on the burden of proof already sufficiently reflect  the characteristics of algorithmic systems. Ascertaining  indirect discrimination requires neither proof of any  intent to discriminate nor any unambiguous proof of  causality. In fact, all the injured party has to prove is a  correlation between the decisions and sensitive criteria.  Where algorithmic systems are used, however, this proof  is generally difficult for the affected parties to provide.The Data Ethics Commission therefore recommends  that legislators should enact legislation clarifying the  requirements for providing proof of discrimination  by operators of algorithmic systems and lower such  requirements further for affected parties as needed. For  this reason, the General Act on Equal Treatment should  always be considered together with rights of access and  duties to state reasons  (→ see section 4.1.2)  without which  the injured party would often be unable to exercise his or  her rights. The protection interests of third parties and of  system users affected as a result must be given sufficient  consideration. 4.2.5   Preventive official licensing procedures for   high-risk algorithmic systems In the case of algorithmic systems with regular or  appreciable (Level 3) or even significant potential for  harm (Level 4), in addition to existing regulations, it  would make sense to establish licensing procedures or  preliminary checks carried out by supervisory institutions  in order to prevent harm to data subjects, certain sections  of the population or society as a whole.
TEIL F | ALGORITHMISCHE S ySTEME Summary of the most important  recommendations for action Instruments 45 The Data Ethics Commission recommends the  introduction of a mandatory labelling scheme  for  algorithmic systems of enhanced criticality (Level 2  upwards). A mandatory scheme of this kind would oblige  operators to make it clear whether (i.e. when and to what  extent) algorithmic systems are being used. Regardless  of system criticality, operators should always be obliged  to comply with a mandatory labelling scheme if there  is a risk of confusion between human and machine that  might prove problematic from an ethical point of view. 46 An individual affected by a decision should be able to  exercise his or her right to “meaningful information  about  the logic involved, as well as the scope and intended  consequences” of an algorithmic system (cf. GDPR) not  only in respect of fully automated systems, but also in  situations that involve any kind of profiling , regardless of  whether a decision is taken on this basis later down the  line. The right should also be expanded in the future to  apply to the algorithm-based decisions themselves, with  differing levels of access to these decisions according  to system criticality. These measures may require the  clarification of certain legislative provisions or a widening  of regulatory scope at European level. 47 It certain cases, it may be appropriate to ask the operator  of an algorithmic system to provide an individual  explanation  of the decision taken, in addition to  a general explanation of the logic (procedure) and  scope of the system. The main objective should be to  provide individuals who are affected by a decision with  comprehensible, relevant and concrete information.  The Data Ethics Commission therefore welcomes the  work being carried out under the banner of “Explainable  AI” (efforts to improve the explainability of algorithmic  systems, in particular self-learning systems), and  recommends that the Federal Government should fund  further research and development in this area. 48 In view of the fact that, in certain sectors, society as a  whole may be affected as well as its individual members,  also particular parties who are not individually affected   by an algorithmic system should be entitled to access   certain types of information about it. It is likely that rights  of this kind would be granted primarily for journalistic  and research purposes; in order to take due account  of the operator’s interests, they would need to be  accompanied by adequate protective measures. The Data  Ethics Commission believes that consideration should  also be given to the granting of unconditional rights to  access information in certain circumstances, in particular  when algorithmic systems with serious potential for harm  ( Level 4) are used by the State.
197 F SUMMAR y OF THE  MOST  IMPORTANT  RECOMMENDATIONS  FOR  ACTION 49 It is appropriate and reasonable to impose a legal  requirement for the operators of algorithmic systems  with at least some potential for harm (Level 2 upwards)  to produce and publish a proper risk assessment ; an  assessment of this kind should also cover the processing  of non-personal data, as well as risks that do not fall  under the heading of data protection. In particular,  it should appraise the risks posed in respect of self-   determination, privacy, bodily integrity, personal  integrity, assets, ownership and discrimination. It should  encompass not only the underlying data and logic of  the model, but also methods for gauging the quality  and fairness of the data and the model accuracy, for  example the bias or the rates of (statistical) error (overall  or for certain sub-groups) exhibited by a system during  forecasting/category formation. 50 To provide controllers and processors with greater legal  clarity, further work must be done in terms of fleshing  out the requirements to document and log  the data sets  and models used, the level of granularity, the retention  periods and the intended purposes. In addition, operators  of sensitive applications should be obliged in future to  document and log the program runs of software that may  cause lasting harm. The data sets and models used should  be described in such a way that they are comprehensible  to the employees of supervisory institutions carrying out  oversight measures (as regards the origin of the data sets  or the way in which they are pre-processed, for example,  or the optimisation goals pursued using the models). 51 System operators should be required by the standard-   setting body to guarantee a minimum level of quality,  from both a technical and a mathematical-procedural  perspective . The procedural criteria imposed must  ensure that algorithmically derived results are obtained  in a correct and lawful manner. For this purpose, quality  criteria could be imposed, in particular as regards  corrective and control mechanisms, data quality and  system security. For example, it would be appropriate  to impose quality criteria on the relationship between  algorithmic data processing outcomes and the data used  to obtain these outcomes. 52 The Data Ethics Commission believes that a necessary  first step is to clarify and flesh out in greater detail the  scope and legal consequences of Article 22 GDPR in  relation to the use of algorithmic systems in the context  of human decision-making. As a second step, the Data  Ethics Commission recommends the introduction of  additional protective mechanisms for algorithm-based  and algorithm-driven decision-making systems , since  the influence of these systems in real-life settings may  be almost as significant as that of algorithm-determined  applications. The prohibitory principle followed to  date by Article 22 GDPR should be replaced by a more  flexible and risk-adapted regulatory framework that  provides adequate guarantees as regards the protection of  individuals (in particular where profiling is concerned) and  options for these individuals to take action if mistakes are  made or if their rights are jeopardised. 53 Consideration should be given to expanding the  scope  of anti-discrimination legislation  to cover specific  situations in which an individual is discriminated against  on the basis of automated data analysis or an automated  decision-making procedure. In addition, the legislator  should take effective steps to prevent discrimination  on the basis of group characteristics  which do not in  themselves qualify as protected characteristics under law,  and where the discrimination often does not currently  qualify as indirect discrimination on the basis of a  protected characteristic. 54 In the case of algorithmic systems with regular or  significant (Level 3) or even serious potential for harm  (Level 4), it would be useful – as a supplement to the  existing regulations – for these systems to be covered by  licensing procedures or preliminary checks  carried out  by supervisory institutions, in the interests of preventing  harm to individuals who are affected, certain sections of  the population or society as a whole.
198 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 5. Institutions The Data Ethics Commission takes the view that the  burden of responsibility for the ethically justified and  lawful use of algorithmic systems must be shared and  rest on several sets of shoulders. The institutions and  supervisory structures which currently exist are not  sufficiently prepared to effectively oversee monitoring  of algorithmic systems at various levels. The Data Ethics  Commission therefore urges the Federal Government  to expand and reorient the competences of existing  supervisory institutions and structures and set up new  institutions and structures where necessary. 5.1 Regulatory powers and specialist expertise 5.1.1   Distribution of supervisory tasks within the   sectoral network of oversight authorities The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the  Federal Government should in principle entrust  regulatory supervisory tasks and oversight powers in each  case to authorities which already have sector-specific  expertise . In the view of the Data Ethics Commission,  the same should apply to matters which fall within the  administrative competence of States ( Bundesländer ). Specifically, the Data Ethics Commission believes that  it would make sense to entrust oversight of the use of  algorithmic systems by private parties in the sectors of  the digital economy in which authorities with sectorspecific responsibility already exist to those existing  authorities . As examples, authorities such as the  Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( Bundesanstalt  für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht , BaFin), the Federal  Network Agency ( Bundesnetzagentur , BNetzA), the  Federal Office for Information Security ( Bundesamt für  Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik , BSI) and the Federal  Motor Transport Authority ( Kraftfahrtbundesamt , KBA) come into mind. Furthermore, the Federal Cartel Office  (Bundeskartellamt , BKartA) and the data protection  supervisory authorities would have special status, as they  both have horizontal responsibilities, i.  e. responsibilities  which span the various different sectors of the economy.The Data Ethics Commission believes that a national and  EU-level “oversight network for critical algorithmic  systems”  should be set up in order to coordinate the  activities of the authorities entrusted with algorithm  supervisory tasks. In particular, rules on the distribution  of responsibilities within the network, the exchange  of information, the organisation of administrative  procedures carried out by the network and legal  protection would be appropriate for such purposes. In order to prevent any gaps in supervision, the Data  Ethics Commission urges the Federation and the  Länder  to identify areas where there is currently no  sector-specific authority with sufficient expertise  to  which oversight tasks could be assigned for monitoring  critical algorithmic systems. In the view of the Data  Ethics Commission, in such cases, it will often be  appropriate, in the event of a corresponding need for  oversight, to entrust matters to one of the existing  authorities with horizontal responsibility. In the case of  algorithmic systems which process sensitive personal  data, the data protection authorities, for example, may  have the adequate expertise. However, the Data Ethics  Commission believes that, in particular cases, it may be  necessary to create completely new regulatory control  structures. In the light of ever-changing technical  developments, the Federation and the Länder  should  regularly review the situation. Authorities are faced with a structural challenge in  effectively executing their algorithmic system oversight  tasks: the object which is the focus of their oversight work  is technically highly complex and is subject to dynamic  change. The Data Ethics Commission therefore believes  that providing the authorities with practical skills  will  be particularly important. It firmly recommends that the  Federal Government should provide the federal authorities  with the financial, human and technical resources  required. The draft Salary Structure Modernisation Act  (Besoldungsstrukturenmodernisierungsgesetz ), which is  expected to increase the salaries and bonuses of publicsector IT professionals and establish new regulations for  them as from 2020, is without doubt a welcome first step.  However, in the light of how difficult it is to attract welltrained professionals to the public sector, further measures  will soon be required.
199 F 5. INSTITUTIONS The Data Ethics Commission also recommends that  the Federal Government should set up an official unit  in the form of a competence centre for algorithmic  systems  to provide the sectoral authorities with support  in monitoring algorithmic systems. The responsibility  of such a body should not only acquire, analyse, further  develop and impart the technical methodological  knowledge required for supervising critical algorithmic  systems. It should (in coordination with and at the  request of the sector-specific authorities) also primarily  support the sector-specific supervisory authorities  in building up the expertise needed to carry out their  tasks and assess the criticality of algorithmic systems.  This will extend in particular to the centre’s task of  further developing criteria, processes and tools  for  the oversight of algorithmic systems. This will also  include  standards for assessing criticality  and checking  the compliance of critical algorithmic systems. Such  a centre of competence will also have an important  intermediary advisory role : as far as possible, it will  advise not only bodies of the Federation, the Länder  and  municipalities, but also manufacturers, system operators,  system users and data subjects with regard to the use  and development of algorithmic systems. It will also  be involved in international and European initiatives  designed to build up sufficient oversight expertise  including standardisation procedures. However, the  competence centre should not have its own supervisory  powers. These remain with the sectoral supervisory  authorities. The service unit should either be created as  a new, autonomous federal authority or be attached to  an existing cross-sectional authority, such as the Federal  Office for Information Security. The Data Ethics Commission considers that it would  also make sense to establish a corresponding body at  European Union level  in the future, for example in the  form of an agency, and the Federal Government should  work towards achieving this. 10 For example, Article 58 GDPR governs the investigative powers relating to data protection supervision and Section 32e of the [German] Act against  Restraints of Competition ( Gesetz gegen Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen , GWB) governs sector inquiries by the Federal Cartel Office. Oversight of  high-frequency trade by financial supervisory authorities is based on Section 6(4) of the [German] Securities Trading Act ( Gesetz über den Wertpapi erhandel , WpHG) and Section 3(4)(4)(5) of the [German] Stock Exchange Act ( Börsengesetz , BörsG) amended version in conjunction with Section 7(3) of  the Stock Exchange Act.In principle, the Data Ethics Commission sees no  reason why state bodies should not be able to make  use of the expertise of private individuals or entities  in carrying out their tasks and in building up their own  in-house expertise or to involve private individuals or  entities in the execution of their tasks, as long as such  cooperation complies with the general constitutional  and administrative specifications applicable to such  cooperation. Conversely, corresponding cooperation,  for example also by entrustment, may be used in order  to deal with the current lack of qualified specialists and  expertise in the public sector. 5.1.2   Definition of oversight powers according to  the tasks involved The regulating body should, by law , clearly assign   the relevant competent authorities the powers of  intervention , including rights to information and rights  of inspection and access, required for the supervision  of algorithmic systems. Blueprints for such regulatory  powers for content control can be found in various areas  of the law.10 The competent supervisory authorities must, at all times,  be able to examine  algorithmic systems in sensitive areas  of application or those with a high potential for harm.  The audit and test procedures used in doing so must,  in particular, cover systems where there is interaction  with the user. This may, for example, take place via  standardised interfaces. Such access can be used to  carry out what are known as input-output tests, which  check, for example, whether an algorithmic system  systematically discriminates against groups. This is  particularly useful in the case of learning systems which  adapt their internal rules over time. Steps must be taken  here to ensure that any testing of learning systems does  not lead to a change in the system of rules whereby the  system learns from the test data during the test.
200 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS When assigning legal authority, steps must be taken to  ensure that the supervisory authorities have the power,  in the event of a proven breach of the law, to force  operators of algorithmic systems to configure systems  in compliance with the law (for example by adapting the  pool of data used) and, where necessary, apply penalties .  Provided that it is commensurate with the case in  question, the supervisory authorities should also be able  to impose official bans  on the use of unlawful algorithmic  systems (or their components). 5.1.3  Criticality-adapted extent of oversight All elements of an algorithmic system  must be taken  into account in order for its behaviour to be effectively  audited. An audit conducted by authorities may, and  potentially must, extend to the training data and learning  processes used, the final rule-based model as well as  the input and output data underlying the decisions.  Quality indicators regarding the pool of data used and  model accuracy (training model, final decision model)  can also be taken into consideration in order to identify  a system’s bias or rates of (statistical) error (overall  or for certain sub-groups). From a methodological  perspective, a test may be carried out by analysing large  amounts of data, reviewing the weighting of factors in  complex multidimensional systems and analysing inputthroughput-output. Due to the complex nature of the subject matter and  amounts of data involved, the use of control algorithms  can significantly increase the efficiency and effectiveness  of the audit. They can systematically look for conspicuous  patterns in the pool of data used and the results of an  algorithmic system which can, for example, shed light on  a case of discrimination.The extent of oversight required in each specific case  should be determined based on the area of application  and system criticality. In the case of systems which have  only some potential for harm (Level 2), it may suffice for  legislators to limit regulatory oversight to an inspection  of the results in the event of a system’s documented  failure. However, in areas with a high potential for harm,  it may be necessary to stipulate that system operators  must use a standardised interface. In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, the question  as to whether regulatory oversight affects system  operators’ trade and business secrets  or third parties’  privacy rights  is not an issue at any level of the criticality  pyramid. As supervisory authorities are obliged to treat  all information obtained as part of their oversight work as  confidential due to professional secrecy, these aspects do  not represent any legal obstacle to far-reaching powers  for full and detailed audits. The proper interpretation of test results is, from a  technical perspective, anything but trivial. In particular,  it is not always clear whether they really unearth an  error by an algorithmic system. This restricts their ability  to provide evidence. The quality and informative value  of the different test procedures and audits therefore  also need to be agreed on – in particular with regard  to their probative value in court proceedings in order  to enforce the rights of the parties affected. The Data  Ethics Commission therefore recommends that the  Federal Government should support initiatives to develop  statistical technical standards for test procedures  and audits , where necessary differentiated by areas of  application. The competence centre for algorithmic  systems (→ see section 5.1.1)  should take a leading role in  such endeavours.
201 F 5. INSTITUTIONS Use case: Personalised prices II – ex-post controls by supervisory institutions 11 Cf. Gesellschaft für Informatik: Technische und rechtliche Betrachtungen algorithmischer Entscheidungsverfahren. Gutachten der Fach gruppe Rechtsinformatik der Gesellschaft für Informatik e.  V. im Auftrag des Sachverständigenrats für Verbraucherfragen [Gesellschaft für  Informatik: Technical and legal considerations regarding algorithmic decision-making processes. Report by the Legal Informatics expert  group of Gesellschaft für Informatik e.  V. at the request of the Advisory Council for Consumer Affairs], Berlin, pp. 63 et seqq. (available at:  www.svr-verbraucherfragen.de/wp-content/uploads/GI_Studie_Algorithmenregulierung.pdf ).Supervisory institutions could check whether  algorithmic pricing systems used in e-commerce comply  with the law or discriminate, for example, against  protected population groups (within the meaning of the  General Act on Equal Treatment). Supervisory authorities  could look for conspicuous patterns in the pool of data  used and the issued prices, which may shed light on a  possible case of discrimination. To do so, those carrying out the supervision do not  have to comprehend the (potentially highly complex)  rules of the underlying algorithm by analysing the code. Effective oversight can be carried out with the  help of statistical tests which analyse how, all other  things being equal, issued prices change depending  on input data which are associated with certain  population groups. If, for example, the system issues  higher prices for consumers when only the gender  is changed from “male” to “female” in the input  data or if the issued prices correlate with attributes,  protected under equality legislation, of individual  population groups (for example via proxies), this can  be mathematically statistically determined.11 5.2  Corporate self-regulation and co-regulation It is neither possible nor necessary for the legislator to  implement blanket regulations covering all algorithmic  systems. Instead, various models of self-regulation and  co-regulation could also essentially provide sufficient  responses for certain situations. Co-regulation involves  regulatory approaches which navigate between state  regulation and private self-regulation and is characterised  by the combination of a public/state component and a  private/institutional component.5.2.1  Self-regulation and self-certification The Data Ethics Commission recommends selfregulation in the form of an internal audit conducted by  the manufacturer or operator of the algorithmic system  for the lowest level of the criticality pyramid. This could  be supported by self-certification of manufacturers  and operators on the basis of specific standards for  algorithmic systems. The particular advantage of such a  system would be that the self-certification bodies would  have the necessary know-how on account of their close  connection to the specific topics . As a result, experts,  even from the companies in question, could take the  legal standards and monitoring of compliance therewith  into consideration, including at the development stage,  and, where necessary, also incorporate their corporate  expertise into the regulatory mechanisms institutionally.  Admittedly, purely internal and voluntary self-regulation  would not constitute an independent monitoring and,  in the event of breaches, would not ensure any effective  implementation of penalties.
202 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS The self-regulation architecture could be supplemented  with a model involving regulated self-monitoring, which  would set out external standards for quality and risk  management of self-monitoring which could also be  externally monitored. A similar system is set out in the  GDPR, in which Article 40 establishes the option to  specify general clauses of the GDPR and make them  applicable to specific real-life circumstances which are  significant to the parties subject to the codes of conduct  as well as set minimum standards specific to the sector  in question. In order to be able to guarantee that the  regulation would be as effective as intended, effective  monitoring must ensure actual compliance with the  approved codes of conduct pursuant to Article 40 GDPR.  Not only would the codes of conduct themselves have  to be drawn up, but the procedural rules relating to  monitoring, control and the implementation of penalties  for cases of non-compliance would also have to be  set out. Where a provider signs up for voluntary self-monitoring  and verifiably demonstrates compliance with the  agreed procedures, the standard-setting body may  grant privileges in terms of supervisory measures.  Such an approach would be based on the condition  that, in exercising their corporate responsibility and  in cooperation with a private self-monitoring body,  providers would have to develop procedural standards  which would be recognised by the supervisory authority.  The involvement of civil society organisations in the  preparatory work would be essential in order to be  able properly to represent the interests of citizens and  consumers and take them into consideration. 12 Mario Martini, Juristenzeitung (JZ), 2017, p. 1022 et seq.5.2.2  Creation of a code of conduct For the concept of regulated self-regulation, it would  be worth considering including an Algorithmic  Accountability Code , adopting a “comply or explain”  approach which is well-established in other parts of the  legal system. It could oblige parties subject to regulation  to state whether or not and the extent to which they  are following the recommendations of the code.12 False  statements would be subject to sanctions. As such,  a code to be drawn up could be binding in nature by  holding companies and authorities responsible for the  consequences of the use of algorithmic systems. It could,  for example, be developed based on corporate digital  responsibility guidelines (→ see Part D, section 2 above)  or  conversely also help to shape such guidelines. What level  of granular detail for codes and guidelines is practical  and/or the sector-specific ethical challenges for which a  specific code would be useful will become clear. The quality of the defined requirements and the  framework conditions, i.  e. the opportunities for  independent external parties to carry out checks  and the ability to impose penalties in the event of  breaches, would be essential in ensuring that a code  had a control function. Responsibility for developing  such a code should be assigned to an independent  commission with equal representation of manufacturers,  operators, the scientific community and civil society.  It remains to be seen whether the Government  Commission on the German Corporate Governance Code  (Regierungskommission Deutscher Corporate Governance  Kodex)  (www.dcgk.de ) could be a model for this. In addition or alternatively, binding statements by and  between manufacturers and operators of algorithmic  systems could be considered.
203 F 5. INSTITUTIONS 5.2.3  Quality seals for algorithmic systems Establishing quality seals for algorithmic systems  are sensible in order to support effective algorithm  regulation. They could take the form of voluntary or  mandatory evidence of protective measures which would  make the extent to which an algorithmic system meets  certain requirements clear to users. It would be important  to clarify who would define the requirements of a quality  seal and who would specifically be responsible for  fulfilling the requirements connected with the quality seal  and the extent to which breaches would be subject to  penalties. As in the case of an Algorithmic Accountability  Code, responsibility for defining the requirements of  a quality seal should be entrusted to an independent  commission with equal representation of operators of  algorithmic systems, the scientific community and civil  society. 5.2.4   Contact persons for algorithmic systems in  companies and authorities Companies and authorities which work with critical  algorithmic systems (as from Level 2) should (at least  starting at a certain size of company or authority) appoint  a contact person responsible for communications with  authorities and cooperation. In all cases, it must be  ensured that such a contact person has specific expertise .  He or she will monitor the use of algorithmic systems  internally and provide the company’s or authority’s  management team with advice and will be functionally  independent. As is the case with data protection officers,  the contact person could act as a link between the  supervisory authority, operators of algorithmic systems  and affected groups of people. This would also help to  ensure proper awareness of problems within companies  and authorities and increase oversight pressure  from inside.5.2.5  Involvement of civil society stakeholders In order to ensure that the interests of civil society and  affected companies are properly taken into account as  part of audits of algorithmic systems, advisory boards  should be set up within sector-specific competent  authorities, and civil society stakeholders should  also, for example, be involved in connection with a  code. Such advisory boards should feature a balance  of representatives of civil society organisations and  individuals appointed by companies in order to ensure  that both the interests of affected individuals and groups  and the interests of affected companies are properly  taken into account as part of audits. 5.3 Technical standardisation In the view of the Data Ethics Commission,  standardisation organisations such as ISO/IEC, IEEE,  IETF, ITU, ETSI, W3C, CEN and DIN, which set technical  standards for information and communications  technologies, could significantly help with forming  out sector-specific requirements for algorithmic  systems. Technical standards which take ethical and  legal requirements into consideration could provide  legal certainty for companies which develop and use  algorithmic systems. They could also easily translate the  requirements for the legality of algorithmic systems into  specific guidelines in individual sectors. The Data Ethics Commission believes that technical  standards would essentially be useful tools to bridge the  gap between “classic” state regulation and purely private  self-regulation. It therefore recommends that the Federal  Government should suitably work to develop and adopt  technical standards designed to prevent the risks posed  by algorithmic systems.
204 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS However, in the view of the Data Ethics Commission, the  Federal Government should also not lose sight of the  fact that technical standards have their limitations  (→ see  Part D, section 6 above) . Technical standards are no substitute  for defining clear legal requirements for algorithmic  systems or for regulatory supervision of the use of such  systems. For constitutional reasons, the principle that  the more citizens’ fundamental rights are affected,  the more detailed legal provisions should be, must be  upheld. In practice, this means that legislators must,  first of all, define the legal framework – not technical  standard-setting committees. This will not least ensure  that the integrity of decision-making will be protected,  as the active participation of representatives of sectors  and/or affected companies will ensure that, in addition  to impressive technical expertise, the interests of such  companies and/or sectors are, of course, also often  taken into consideration first hand when the technical  standards are drawn up. 5.4  Institutional legal protection (in particular  rights of associations to file an action) The system of granting competitors, competition  associations and consumer associations the right to file  an action has been an important feature of the German  legal landscape for many years, and could play a key  role in civil society oversight  of the use of algorithmic  systems. In particular, private rights of this kind allow  civil society players with a legitimate mandate to enforce  compliance with legislative provisions in the area of  contract law and fair trading law without needing to rely  on the authorities to take action and without needing  to wait for individuals to authorise them. This civil law  approach has particularly strong market focus and is  characterised by swift responses and is therefore, by  international standards, very successful. Associations are  essentially politically and administratively independent  and can therefore advocate, on their own authority and  in the common interest of consumers and companies,  for competition regulations and consumer rights to be  efficiently protected against unfair business practices  which are also damaging for consumers.Anyone who does not comply with regulatory provisions  will potentially benefit from an unfair competitive  advantage. In order to prevent any competitive edge being  gained by breaking the law, competition associations and  consumer associations should be able to stop such legal  infringements.
205 Summary of the most important  recommendations for action Institutions 55 The Data Ethics Commission recommends that the Federal  Government should expand and realign the competencies  of existing supervisory institutions and structures and,  where necessary, set up new ones. Official  supervisory  tasks and powers should primarily be entrusted to the  sectoral supervisory authorities  that have already built  up a wealth of expert knowledge in the relevant sector.  Ensuring that the competent authorities have the financial,  human and technical resources  they need is a particularly  important factor in this respect. 56 The Data Ethics Commission also recommends that the  Federal Government should set up a national centre of  competence for algorithmic systems ; this centre should  act as a repository of technical and regulatory expertise  and assist the sectoral supervisory authorities in their task  of monitoring algorithmic systems to ensure compliance  with the law. 57 The Data Ethics Commission believes that initiatives   involving the development of technical and  statistical  quality standards for test procedures and audits   (differentiated according to critical application areas if  necessary) are worthy of support. Test procedures of this  kind – provided that they are designed to be adequately  meaningful, reliable and secure – may make a vital  contribution to the future auditability of algorithmic  systems. 58 In the opinion of the Data Ethics Commission,  particular attention should be paid to innovative  forms of co- regulation and self-regulation , alongside  and as a complement to forms of state regulation. It  recommends that the Federal Government should  examine various models of co-regulation and selfregulation as a potentially useful solution in certain  situations. 59 The Data Ethics Commission believes that an option  worth considering might be to require operators by law  (inspired by the “comply or explain” regulatory model) to  sign a declaration confirming their willingness to comply  with an Algorithmic Accountability Code . An independent  commission with equal representation – which must be  free of state influence – could be set up to develop a  code of this kind, which would apply on a binding basis  to the operators of algorithmic systems. Appropriate  involvement of civil society representatives in the drafting  of this code must be guaranteed. 
206 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 60 Voluntary or mandatory evidence of protective measures  in the form of a specific quality seal  may also serve as a  guarantee to consumers that the algorithmic system in  question is reliable, while at the same time providing an  incentive for developers and operators to develop and  use reliable systems. 61 The Data Ethics Commission takes the view that  companies and authorities operating critical  algorithmic systems should be obliged in future to  appoint a contact person , in the same way that companies  of a specific size are currently obliged to appoint a data  protection officer. Communications with the authorities  should be routed through this contact person, and he or  she should also be subject to a duty of cooperation. 62 To ensure that official audits of algorithmic systems  take due account of the interests of civil society and any  companies affected, suitable advisory boards should be  set up within the sectoral supervisory authorities . 63 In the opinion of the Data Ethics Commission, technical  standards adopted by accredited standardisation  organisations  are a generally useful measure, occupying  an intermediate position between state regulation and  purely private self-regulation. It therefore recommends  that the Federal Government should engage in  appropriate efforts towards the development and  adoption of such standards. 64 The system of granting competitors, competition  associations or consumer associations the right to file an  action  has been an important feature of the German legal  landscape for many years, and could play a key role in  civil society oversight of the use of algorithmic systems.  In particular, private rights of this kind could allow civil  society players with a legitimate mandate to enforce  compliance with legal provisions in the area of contract  law, fair trading law or anti-discrimination law, without  needing to rely on the authorities to take action and  without needing to wait for individuals to authorise them.
207 F 6. SPECIAL  TOPIC : ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS  USED  By MEDIA  INTERMEDIARIES 6. Special topic: algorithmic systems used by  media intermediaries 6.1  Relevance for the democratic process: the  example of social networks For many people, it would be impossible to imagine life  these days without social networks, search engines and  the like: they enable users to keep up to date on the latest  news from around the world and from their circle of  friends in real time, are platforms through which people  can portray their lifestyles and communicate with each  other, and can also be used for entertainment purposes  and for business activity, including advertising. On the whole, they are becoming increasingly important  for private and public opinion-forming. In order to  manage the wealth of information available, providers  of such services use algorithmic systems which are  designed, amongst other things, to identify the interests,  tendencies and convictions of users, identify posts which  are of potential relevance to them, present them with  similar posts in order to encourage them to interact with  the network, and filter out illegal or offensive posts. The  economic aim is primarily to generate high advertising  revenue. Depending on their reach and content, media  intermediaries can have a profound impact on the  democratic process. More and more people are also  using social networks to keep abreast of politics and  world affairs. Social networks therefore offer users new  opportunities to participate in the information society  and, in that sense, constitute media and factors for the  exchange of information and opinions .At the same time, the fact that public debate is  concentrated on only a few private platforms also  poses a challenge for democracy. After all, as economic  stakeholders, private operators of social networks have a  vested interest in directing traffic to their networks and  gearing activity on them primarily towards economic  aspects rather than focusing on social interests in having  a multi-faceted opinion-forming process for the benefit  of the public good. The use of algorithmic systems which  are predominantly oriented on economic criteria  can  have negative consequences for the diversity of opinions  on social networks. The use of services can also lead to the manipulation  of opinions. On the one hand, this can happen  unintentionally due to certain characteristics of  underlying software, such as for example recommender  systems. On the other hand, these systems can be used  intentionally by various actors for manipulative purposes.  Up to now, operators of social networks have not  sufficiently guarded against such activities which threaten  the foundations of democracy. What is more, a regulatory  framework and social oversight are needed, in particular  in view of their high level of criticality .
208 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS The Data Ethics Commission believes that, in the future,  media intermediaries which have a gatekeeper role  can ultimately develop a high potential for harm to  our democracy and that there is a resulting need for  regulation . The Data Ethics Commission believes that it is  essential for legislators to create an appropriate regulatory  framework for the use of algorithmic systems by media  intermediaries. The Data Ethics Commission is of the  opinion that, first of all, the operators of such platforms  and providers of such services should themselves define  and implement basic rules to ensure fairness in the  opinion-forming process. However, this “digital domiciliary  right” has its limitations, in particular where the integrity  of the democratic process is affected. Depending on  the market share and gatekeeper role of such platforms  and services, operators have fundamental-rights-based  obligations on account of the indirect third-party effect.13  In the view of the Data Ethics Commission, these  obligations should be specified more precisely in subconstitutional law, in particular also with regard to the use  of algorithmic systems by and on platforms and by and in  services with a significant market share and a gatekeeper  role. This is also relevant for the EU-ASR recommended  by the Data Ethics Commission (→ see section 3.3 above) . Regulation is also needed to ensure regulatory fairness in  comparison to broadcasters. The Data Ethics Commission  recommends that the Federal Government should  examine how risks posed by providers which have a  particular power to influence opinions can be countered.  A whole range of measures are possible, from greater  transparency right through to ex-ante controls in the  form of a licensing procedure for algorithmic systems  which are relevant in terms of democracy. 13 Decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court 128, p. 249 (FRAPORT); 148, p. 267 et seqq., margin no. 32 et seqq. (Stadionverbot). 14 Cf. decisions of the Federal Constitutional Court 136, 9, 28 with further references.6.2  Diversity and media intermediaries:  the example of social networks The wide variety of roles played by social networks  and the predominantly high level of criticality of  the algorithmic systems they use present particular  challenges for the Data Ethics Commission’s suggested  approach of risk-adapted regulation of algorithmic  systems. The Data Ethics Commission believes that  positive legal provisions for social networks which,  for example, increase the transparency and range of  discussions held there and bolster the rights of users   would be particularly constructive. In any case, where social networks have dominant market  share, the Data Ethics Commission calls for further  measures to safeguard diversity , as defensive measures  alone will not suffice. Algorithmic systems which operate  in these types of networks and have impacts on the  freedom and diversity of opinion-forming which are  constitutive of democracy have an extremely high level  of criticality on account of their reach alone. The Data  Ethics Commission believes that legislators are therefore  under an ethical and constitutional obligation to establish  a binding normative framework  for the regulation of  media intermediaries in order to protect democracy.  This may require transforming the regulatory framework  governing the media. Legislators must take suitable measures to ensure  that the total range on offer reflects the variety of  opinions that exist and guarantees balance, neutrality  and freedom from bias in the information society .14  This applies in particular to media intermediaries with  a gatekeeper role and power to influence opinions.  According to the Federal Constitutional Court, to  safeguard pluralistic diversity, substantive, organisational  and procedural regulations are needed which are focused  on creating freedom of communication and are therefore  suitable for producing the desired effects of Article 5(1) of  the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany.
209 F 6. SPECIAL  TOPIC : ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS  USED  By MEDIA  INTERMEDIARIES In the light of this, the legislators in the Länder , which  are responsible for media law, are obliged to implement  the aforementioned provisions. The same applies to the  legislators of an EU Regulation on Algorithmic Systems  (EU-ASR (→ see section 3.3 above) . As media intermediaries,  video-sharing platforms (VSPs) are already subject to  the Audiovisual Media Services Directive15 because they  provide user-generated content for the general public.  The draft Interstate Media Services Agreement also  covers media intermediaries. The Data Ethics Commission  once again welcomes, in that respect, the provisions for  the transparency of social networks set out in the draft  Interstate Media Agreement (Medienstaatsvertrag,  MStV-E)  as an initial step in this direction. The legislators for the Länder  have plenty of scope and  freedom for drawing up the provisions. However, they  must decide on the regulation model themselves and  must not leave it to private individuals to agree on. The  Data Ethics Commission is of the view that plurality  obligations for media intermediaries should, in any case,  include the obligation to use algorithmic systems which,  at least as an additional option, also provide access to an  unbiased and balanced selection of posts and information  which reflect a diverse range of different opinions.16 Based on these considerations, the Data Ethics  Commission also recommends that the Federal  Government should investigate whether there are other  areas where, irrespective of the situation relevant to  democracy discussed here, a corresponding obligation to  establish requirements for neutrality and provisions on  diversity seems necessary. Protecting minors  from being  influenced by and on social networks, for example, is one  such consideration. 15 Directive 2010/13/EU of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member  States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (Audiovisual Media Services Directive). 16 Rolf Schwartmann / Maximilian Hermann / Robin Mühlenbeck, Multimedia und Recht (MMR), 2019 (8), p. 498 et seqq.6.3 Labelling obligation for social bots The democratic process is, in essence, based on people’s  freedom to form their own opinions and make their own  decisions. However, bots, i.  e. software programs which  give the impression that they are human users , are used  on various platforms. In the view of the Data Ethics  Commission, it is highly problematic if such bots are used  to manipulate individual users and/or public debate or  guide the result of a vote one way or the other where  political decisions are to be made. Firstly, the simulation  of human traits falsely suggests that the statements  made are the result of independent thought and of the  independent formation of political opinions. Secondly,  automation can massively increase the number and  frequency of expressions of opinion, making it harder or  even impossible to assess actual majorities of opinions.  The Data Ethics Commission believes that regulatory  intervention is required here. On that basis, the Data Ethics Commission recommends  implementing a measure to enhance transparency  in  the form of a labelling obligation for social bots on social  networks. Based on general considerations, the Data  Ethics Commission recommends that such a labelling  obligation should be implemented anywhere where there  is a risk that social bots could be mistaken for human  interlocutors (→ see section 4.1.1 above) . Given the particular  potential to jeopardise the democratic process, the Data  Ethics Commission furthermore believes, in any case, that  a labelling obligation for social bots which have an impact  on political opinion-forming processes is essential, even  irrespective of any real risk of confusion.
210 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 6.4 Measures to combat fake news A labelling obligation for social bots could help to combat  the automated spread of fake news. However, the Data  Ethics Commission also believes that the concept of fake  news is not suitable as a starting point for any regulation  relating to media legislation . The presentation of  a legal definition of fake news, which draws an  objective and distinct line between an exaggerated  or satirical expression of opinion and an intentional  misrepresentation of news is impossible due to the  complexity of human communications. Disinformation  and the manipulation of public opinion-forming, typically  associated with the term “fake news”, can also result  from true facts being presented selectively. The Data Ethics Commission also, in particular,  recommends to legislators that operators of social  networks should grant their users an easy-to-exercise  right of reply  requiring the network to post the  correction of a statement proven to be false (e.  g. an  invented quote) on the timeline or newsfeed, etc. of all  users whom the network, using available data, can trace  back to have been shown the false statement. The Data Ethics Commission emphasises that the State  must not create any incentives for collateral censorship  through social networks. To provide protection from  “overblocking”, the Data Ethics Commission therefore  believes it is necessary, in parallel to the obligations  imposed on the operators, to grant the affected  individuals prompt and efficient procedural protection  mechanisms. The Data Ethics Commission believes that  these should include in particular a right to an effective  process to reinstate deleted posts  provided that they do  not break any laws; any invocation by networks of their  own rules alone cannot suffice as grounds for permanent  deletion/blocking. In the view of the Data Ethics  Commission, such rights must apply to users with respect  to all social networks.6.5  Transparency obligations for news  aggregators Where social networks use algorithmic systems which  also aggregate, select and present journalistic/editorial  content of third parties in a generally accessible way,  they should have to allow users and interested third  parties enough insight into the technical procedure  they use to select and prioritise news to make clear how  a recommendation is arrived at in an individual case.  The democratic information interest would essentially  take precedence over any business secrets of media  intermediaries. In the interests of a fair opinion-forming  process and a fair exchange of opinions, such duties to  disclose information should also stretch to any economic  ties. For that reason as well, the Data Ethics Commission  welcomes the current thoughts on reforming the  Interstate Media Agreement (Medienstaatsvertrag,  MStV-E) which call for corresponding transparency  obligations for media intermediaries as soon as they have  a certain reach.
211 Summary of the most important  recommendations for action Special topic: algorithmic systems used by media intermediaries 65 Given the specific risks posed by media intermediaries  that act as gatekeepers to democracy , the Data  Ethics  Commission recommends that options should be  examined for countering these risks, also with regard to  influencing EU legislation (→ see Recommendation 43 above) .  A whole gamut of risk mitigation measures should be  considered, extending through to ex-ante controls   (e.g. in the form of a licensing procedure). 66 The national legislator is under a constitutional obligation  to protect the democratic system from the dangers to  the free, democratic and pluralistic formation of opinions  that may be created by providers that act as gatekeepers  by establishing a binding normative framework for  media . The Data Ethics Commission believes that the  small number of operators concerned should be obliged  to use algorithmic systems that allow users (at least as  an additional option) to access an unbiased and balanced  selection of posts and information that embodies  pluralism of opinion. 67 The Federal Government should consider measures that  take due account of the risks typically encountered in the  media sector in respect of all media intermediaries and  also in respect of providers that do not act as gatekeepers  or whose systems are associated with a lower potential  for harm. These measures might include mechanisms for  enhancing transparency  (for example by ensuring that  information is available about the technical procedures  used to select and rank news stories, introducing  labelling obligations for social bots ) and establishing a  right to post countering responses on timelines. 
212 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 7. Use of algorithmic systems by state bodies 7.1  Opportunities and risks involved in the use  of algorithmic systems by state bodies Citizens will rightly expect their State to use the best  technology available  to carry out its duties. Depending  on the type of duties, this will also include algorithmic  systems. Systems already exist which can relieve state  bodies of repetitive tasks (thereby expediting processes  and freeing up human resources for complex cases) and  which, in certain set-ups, improve the consistency and  quality of state activity or, in the form of chatbots or  voice assistants, for example, can facilitate citizens’ access  to justice. At the same time, when using algorithmic systems, state  bodies must uphold particularly high standards: firstly,  they have a direct obligation to uphold fundamental  rights as public authorities and secondly, state activity is,  in general, expected to set an example  for the whole of  society. The institutional capacity and expertise, which  the State must build up in order to ensure sufficient  oversight of algorithmic systems used by private parties,  must therefore also be used in order to guide and oversee  the work carried out by state bodies themselves. In  particular, the competence centre for algorithmic  systems called for by the Data Ethics Commission is likely  to play a key role in this context.The use of algorithmic systems by state bodies must  be treated in principle as particularly sensitive  within  the meaning of the criticality pyramid (at least Level 3).  Therefore, in the view of the Data Ethics Commission, a  comprehensive risk impact assessment must be carried  out as a mandatory requirement for any ethically sound  use of algorithmic systems. Furthermore, depending on  the criticality of the systems used by the State, where  necessary, other instruments discussed above and  designed to ensure that citizens are protected should  be put in place for such algorithmic systems used by the  State. Farther-reaching legal data protection requirements  will remain unaffected, as will other constitutional and  administrative specifications for the design of the systems.  Additionally, in the view of the Data Ethics Commission,  in certain sectors where the use of algorithmic systems  conflicts with constitutionally protected rights of  overriding importance, the use of algorithmic systems  should, irrespective of the protective measures taken  in the case in question, be permitted only under very  restrictive conditions or prohibited. This in particular  concerns the use of algorithmic systems for the purposes  of law-making and jurisprudence.  7.2 Algorithmic systems in law-making The use of algorithmic systems within the government  context of law-making is subject to restrictions. The Data  Ethics Commission sees the democratic process, in the  sense of people being able to form their own opinions  and make their own decisions as freely as possible, as  essentially sacrosanct. Automated support in law-making  is therefore acceptable at most for low-level ancillary  tasks  (e. g. detecting inconsistent use of terms) and/ or legal instruments which are far removed from the  democratic decision-making process  (e. g. catalogues  of technical specifications in subsequent regulations).  In both cases, the systems must meet extremely strict  requirements for quality and security.
213 F 7. USE OF ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS  By STATE  BODIES In this context, the Data Ethics Commission also, in  particular, opposes any demand that newly enacted legal  instruments should already be formulated with a view  to possible future automated application; in that regard,  technology must follow the law and not the reverse .  Only if, in accordance with conventional criteria for the  assessment of legislation (compliance with fundamental  rights and other higher-ranking law, impact assessment,  etc.), two equivalent versions are conceivable may the  argument that one version is easier to algorithmise tip the  scales in its favour. 7.3  Algorithmic systems in the dispensation  of justice The Data Ethics Commission is of the view that the  use of algorithmic systems in the dispensation of  justice is permissible only for peripheral tasks . Justice  is administered “in the name of the people”, and that  means, at least in contentious proceedings as well  as in administrative court proceedings and criminal  proceedings, always administered by human judges.  The pacification effect of court proceedings is achieved  not only through the judgment itself (fairness of the  finding) but also through the hearing and weighing up  of conflicting interests by humans and, in particular, the  structural processing of the facts and legal consequences  (procedural fairness), in contrast to an opaque blackbox decision. Due to the often high level of trust placed in the  supposed “infallibility” of technical systems (automation  bias) as well as the low level of willingness to make  divergent decisions, in particular if this is associated with  an additional burden of reasoning and proof and the risk  of a “miscarriage of justice” (default effects), even legally  non-binding proposals for decisions  for judgments by  algorithmic systems are generally highly problematic   from the perspective of the parties concerned. However, algorithmic systems can, provided that there  are strict quality control and high security standards in  place, be useful for preparatory work  which does not  directly affect the judicial decision (e.  g. file management  and document control).Lastly, the use of systems which retrospectively analyse  judicial decisions , are available only for voluntary use by  judges and are protected against access by third parties  with high-level security measures, is also conceivable.  Such systems could, for example, work out whether  decisions were influenced by external factors and, if so,  which ones in order to provide judges in future with  ways to prevent such distortions themselves and thus  contribute to better and more consistent dispensation of  justice. Researchers may also have a legitimate interest  in access to such systems, though sufficient safeguards  would be required here in individual cases. The use of  systems for the purpose of monitoring the path of judicial  decision-making or of checking the dispensation work of  judges against external targets (e.  g. average processing  time for a case) is, however, in view of objective judicial  independence, not permissible. In the pre-litigation domain  (for example, exercising  of air passenger rights) or also in a dunning procedure  or similar, in the view of the Data Ethics Commission,  fully automated handling of legal claims is permissible  provided that procedural rights of the individual parties  concerned are safeguarded as a result. However, this is  not the case if algorithmic systems create correlations  which do not follow the legal provisions and procedural  steps set out. With the current state of the art, only  systems based on classic deterministic algorithms can  therefore generally be considered which, for example,  make decisions by meeting formal criteria (which are  not open to assessment). From a systemic point of view,  impending losses of expertise are compensated for  here by the freeing up of human resources for complex  individual cases.
214 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 7.4 Algorithmic systems in public administration There is a potentially greater scope for the use of  algorithmic systems in public administration. The  increased automation of authorities’ routine cases ,  which can be included subject to precisely defined  conditions regarding facts and legal consequences, may  be advisable in the interest of efficiency (Section 10(2) of  the Administrative Procedures Act) in order to carry out  administrative procedures as appropriately and swiftly  as possible. Here in particular, it relieving administrative  staff of routine tasks frees up human resources which  can then be deployed to handle procedures which  cannot be automated. There is potential, in particular, in the provision of  services and benefits . The Data Ethics Commission  believes that algorithmic systems can and should be  used here to expand proactive procedure management  whereby, where all the required data are available for  the authorities, services and benefits will be increasingly  provided without the need for applications. Educationally  disadvantaged individuals and the needy in particular  could benefit from this (cf. family allowance in Austria  provided when a child is born without the need to apply  for it). However, in the case of intervention by authorities , the  use of algorithmic systems must be dealt with carefully  because fundamental rights are particularly affected.  As with judicial use, this applies not only to algorithmdetermined administrative decisions but also where  the use of the systems limits the authorities’ scope for  decision-making. In general, in assessing whether to  permit the use of the systems, the extent of the resulting  intervention and the reversibility of the decisions need  to be taken into consideration. Essentially, in designing  the systems, technology must be used which is most  easily accessible to oversight. Therefore, in sensitive  areas, public administration will often be allowed to use  only systems which are based on classic deterministic  algorithms. The use of proprietary software should be  avoided for the same reason.In the case of discretionary decisions  by the executive  and decisions with a margin of discretion which have  an external legal effect, the Data Ethics Commission  believes that it is currently necessary for humans to  make the final decision where the decision has more  than mere beneficial impacts. However, by forming  groups of cases and through further specification, it is  conceivable that discretion could be reduced to such an  extent that, from the view of the algorithmic system,  there is only one option in terms of the decision. The  Data Ethics Commission is of the view that Section 35a  of the German Administrative Procedures Act does not  sufficiently reproduce the range of different possible  types of cases and is too schematic. Taking into account  the safeguards required by constitutional law and  based on Article 22 GDPR, legislators should carefully  expand the scope of Section 35a of the Administrative  Procedures Act  and/or set out provisions, differentiated  in terms of specific legislation, for administrative acts  supported partially or fully by automation. Regulations  on the partial and full automation of administrative  procedures should be further developed as part of the  horizontal and sectoral regulations for algorithmic  systems recommended by the Data Ethics Commission  (→ see section 3.3 above) . 7.5 Algorithmic systems in public security law The public discussion is especially critical of the  use of algorithmic systems by security authorities.  As administrative measures in this area can have a  particularly profound effect on fundamental rights, the  use of algorithmic should generally be restricted .
215 F 7. USE OF ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS  By STATE  BODIES If algorithmic systems are used to predict crimes or threat  situations (predictive policing) , consideration must be  given to the fact that even systems which do not use  any personal data can directly have effects relevant to  fundamental rights. This is the case in particular if a  reference to a person can be (re-)created by means of  especially detailed location information. In addition,  “location-related risk prognoses” can lead to excessive  police checks in certain neighbourhoods identified as  hotspots and therefore to the ethnic or social profiling of  population groups living there. Such measures can also  trigger crime relocation and displacement effects. The  Data Ethics Commission therefore recommends making  the security authorities of such effects and incorporating  randomisations into the prediction systems in order to  reduce corresponding effects and other system-based  distortions; steps must also be taken to ensure that the  security authorities can still always carry out a human  review of more cases other than the risk cases selected  by the system (cf. Section 88 of the Fiscal Code of  Germany ( Abgabenordnung , AO)). Nor should the security  authorities be allowed to order further discretionary  intervention measures solely on the basis of locationrelated forecasts. Where risk forecasts relating to individuals  are allowed  by law in the area of security, such forecasts must not be  created fully automatically where doing so could have  negative legal consequences for the parties concerned. On  account of the risk of automation bias, even in the case of  algorithm-based decisions, support for human decisionmakers from algorithmic systems in such profiling may, if  at all, only be permissible within very strict limits. 17 Position paper as part of the 36th Conference of Freedom of Information Officers in Germany – “Transparenz der Verwaltung beim Einsatz von  Algorithmen für gelebten Grundrechtsschutz unabdingbar” [“Transparency Public Administration in the Use of Algorithms as Essential for the  Protection of Fundamental Rights”], Ulm, 16 October 2018 (available at: https:/ /www.datenschutzzentrum.de/uploads/informationsfreiheit/2018_ Positionspapier-Transparenz-von-Algorithmen.pdf ).7.6  Transparency requirements for the use of  algorithmic systems by state actors State decisions made using algorithmic systems must  remain transparent and justifiable . This is, generally  speaking, even more important than in the private sector  due to the obligation to uphold fundamental rights and  the need for democratic accountability of all authority  and power in the public sector. Therefore, not only do the  general transparency requirements (→ see section 4.1 above)  apply to state bodies, but state bodies must also strive  particularly hard to ensure openness. The Data Ethics Commission points out that, in many  cases, algorithmic systems used by state actors already  fall within the scope of existing freedom of information  and/or transparency laws. The Data Ethics Commission  also welcomes the position paper “Transparency in Public  Administration in the Use of Algorithms” ( “Transparenz  der Verwaltung beim Einsatz von Algorithmen” ) adopted  during the 36th Conference of Freedom of Information  Officers ( Konferenz der Informationsfreiheitsbeauftragten )  in Germany. According to this paper, state bodies  must have meaningful, comprehensive and generally  comprehensible information regarding their own data  processing and, where legally possible, should publish  it, including information (i) on the data categories of  the procedure’s input and output data; (ii) on the logic  involved, in particular on the calculation formulae  used including the weighting of the input data, on the  underlying expertise and on the individual configuration  deployed by the users; and (iii) on the scope of the  resulting decisions and on the possible consequences of  the procedures.17
216 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS With regard to specifying the corresponding transparency  obligations and/or duties to provide access to information,  the Data Ethics Commission also points out that  insufficient provisions on transparency can lead to a lack  of trust in the systems, which can lead to greater numbers  of appeals, thereby counteracting any efficiency gains  intended with the use of algorithmic systems. For that  reason, the Data Ethics Commission ultimately believes  that it is justifiable in no more than very few cases to rule  out access to information regarding public algorithmic  systems across the board by citing a risk of manipulation or  the protection of business secrets. As a rule, therefore, the  particular interests must be weighed against each other. The disclosure of information on a system’s general  functionality will not be sufficient in every case where  algorithmic systems are used by public authorities.  Often, decisions made by public authorities must also be  justified to the parties affected, i.  e. the “main factual and  legal reasons”  which led to the decision in the particular  case must be provided (cf. Section 39(1)(2) of the  Administrative Procedures Act). Where such an individual  explanation is required under constitutional or subconstitutional law but, due to the technical complexity  of the system, is not possible or is not possible in a way  which, in the course of an official complaint procedure  or before the court, enables an effective review of the  viability of the reasoning, the use of algorithmic systems  must be prohibited. Apart from that, the Data Ethics  Commission believes that the State is required to build  up sufficient expertise  within administration and the  courts to be able to ensure the necessary oversight of the  system-internal decision-making processes.The Data Ethics Commission points out that the  transparency of state activity can also be negatively  affected if the State uses proprietary software (closedsource software) of private providers in carrying out its  duties. Generally speaking, proprietary software makes  it difficult for users to make changes and adaptations,  which results in a dependent relationship. In addition, the  use of proprietary software leads to a lack of transparency  and can therefore threaten public acceptance of the  systems. Especially in areas which are sensitive in terms  of fundamental rights, such as public security law, the  use of proprietary software should therefore be avoided  if possible. Instead, state bodies should rely on opensource solutions  or develop their own systems ideally  through interdisciplinary teams of developers. Where this  is not practical, the Data Ethics Commission recommends  that the Federal Government should consider amending  public procurement law to minimise the aforementioned  negative effects of proprietary software. Where there is  no need to fear that the effectiveness of the system will  suffer as a result of transparency, i.  e. exploitation effects  can be ruled out, the software should be developed in an  open and consultative process with the inclusion of civil  society stakeholders.
217 F 7. USE OF ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS  By STATE  BODIES 7.7  The risk involved in automated total  enforcement The Data Ethics Commission refuses, from an ethical  point of view, to acknowledge any general right to  non-compliance with rules and regulations. However,  an automated total enforcement of the law raises a  number of ethical concerns. For example, citizens might  feel that full enforcement in practice places everyone  under suspicion, which in turn, reduces their general  willingness to obey rules and regulations. Furthermore,  with automated enforcement, there is the danger that the  complexity of real-life situations will not be sufficiently  portrayed and, in particular, that unforeseen exceptional  situations (for example, speeding in a private vehicle  taking a seriously injured individual to the hospital) will  not be sufficiently taken into consideration. Finally, many  laws were not originally enacted for total enforcement.  As a general rule, therefore, systems should be designed  in such a way that a human can override technical  enforcement in a specific case. In addition, each law  enforcement measure constitutes state intervention  and, as such, must be based on the principle of  proportionality .
PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Summary of the most important  recommendations for action Use of algorithmic systems by state bodies 68 The State must, in the interests of its citizens, make use  of the best available technologies, including algorithmic  systems, but must also exercise particular prudence  in all of its actions in view of its obligation to preserve  fundamental rights and act as a role model. As a general  rule, therefore, the use of algorithmic systems by  public authorities should be assessed on the basis of the  criticality model as particularly sensitive , entailing at the  very least a comprehensive risk assessment. 69 In the areas of law-making  and the dispensation of  justice , algorithmic systems may at most be used for  peripheral tasks. In particular, algorithmic systems must  not be used to undermine the functional independence  of the courts or the democratic process. By way of  contrast, enormous potential exists for the use of  algorithmic systems in connection with administrative   tasks, in particular those relating to the provision of  services and benefits. The legislator should take due  account of this fact by giving the green light to a greater  number of partially and fully automated administrative  procedures. Cautious consideration should therefore  be given to expanding the scope of both Section  35a of the German Administrative Procedures Act  ( Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz , VwVfG) (which is couched  in overly restrictive terms) and the corresponding  provisions of statutory law. All of these measures must be  accompanied by adequate steps to protect citizens. 70 Decisions taken by the State on the basis of algorithmic  systems must still be transparent , and it must still be  possible to provide justifications  for them. It may be  necessary to clarify or expand the existing legislation  on freedom of information and transparency in order to  achieve these goals. Furthermore, the use of algorithmic  systems does not negate the principle that decisions  made by public authorities must generally be justified  individually; on the contrary, this principle may impose  limits on the use of overly complex algorithmic systems.  Finally, greater priority should be accorded to opensource solutions, since the latter may significantly  enhance the transparency of government actions. 71 From an ethical point of view, there is no general right to  non-compliance with rules and regulations. At the same  time, however, automated “total” enforcement of the law  raises a number of different ethical concerns. As a general  rule, therefore, systems should be designed in such a  way that a human can override technical enforcement   in a specific case. The balance struck between the  potential transgression and the automated (and perhaps  preventive) enforcement measure must at all times meet  the requirements of the proportionality principle. 
219 F 8. LIABILIT y FOR  ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS 8. Liability for algorithmic systems 8.1 Significance Criminal responsibility, administrative sanctions and  liability for damages are vital components of any ethically  sound regulatory framework, especially for algorithmic  systems and other digital technologies. From an ethical  perspective, the Data Ethics Commission also highlights,  in particular, the role of tort law, which serves both  for compensation for and prevention of damage and  therefore very significantly contributes to the protection  of legally protected interests in line with fundamental  rights . From an ethical perspective, the following requirements,  inter alia , must be set out for a liability system which  needs to keep up with new digital technologies: a) sufficient compensation  for victims, in particular in  the case of legally protected interests which are highly  relevant in terms of fundamental rights and where  compensation in a comparable situation involving  humans or conventional technology would be owed; b) provision of the right behavioural incentives , whereby  damage is paid for by the actors who caused the  damage through avoidable and undesirable behaviour  or out of whose sphere the risk in question resulted; c) fairness , whereby the actors liable to pay damages  are those who, for example, placed the system on the  market or who exercise control over the system and  benefit from its use; d) efficiency , whereby costs are covered (internalised) by  the actors who can avoid or insure such costs with the  least amount of effort.8.2  Harm caused by the use of algorithmic  systems 8.2.1  Liability of the “electronic person”? The Data Ethics Commission expressly advises against   granting robots or autonomous systems legal personality  (often discussed using the keyword “e-person” ) with  the intention of making the systems liable themselves  (e. g. a self-driving car with no registered owner, which  “operates itself” as a mobility service). Such a measure  would not achieve allocation of responsibility and liability  for harm to those who are responsible for the use of the  system and ultimately benefit economically from such  use. In fact, the measure could, conversely, be used to  evade responsibility. The legal personality of machines as  a new type of legal entity would not enable any desirable  outcome to be achieved which could not be achieved  more freely and easily another way (for example with the  help of company law). Treating autonomous machines  even in analogy to natural persons would be a dangerous  mistake. 8.2.2  Vicarious liability for “autonomous” systems The Data Ethics Commission believes, however, that harm  caused by autonomous systems should be attributed to  those operating the systems according to the same rules  of vicarious  liability as would apply in the case of human  auxiliaries (cf. in particular Section 278 of the [German]  Civil Code). An actor which uses such a system in order  to broaden its range of activities (for example a hospital  which uses a surgical robot) should, in the event of a  malfunction, not be able to release itself from liability  because an actor which uses a human vicarious agent (for  example a human surgeon) will be liable for any culpable  misconduct of the vicarious agent, which is treated  as behaviour on the part of the actor. This becomes  particularly important in the case of liability for an  algorithmic system , where otherwise liability loopholes  will easily occur if no breach of duty of care by the person  behind it can be proven in the use and monitoring of the  algorithmic system.
220 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Example 18    A surgical robot at a hospital makes an operational  incision which is too long and causes complications. Or:  an algorithmic system incorrectly derives the score for  the creditworthiness of a bank’s customer, which is why  the customer cannot take up a one-off attractive offer  relating to a property. It may occasionally be difficult to establish an adequate  equivalent to “standard of care” for autonomous systems,  in particular as soon as the abilities of a machine exceed  those of a human. In the majority of cases, however,  malfunctions will be distinguishable from normal  functions, and therefore this cannot, in general, be cited  against the operator’s liability. The standard must then  be defined based on comparable systems available on  the market, whereby the question as to the use of which  technology could be expected of the operator must  be decided on based on general principles (e.  g. in that  respect, the question as to what quality of surgical robot  was to be used does not differ from the question as to  what quality of x-ray device was to be used). 8.2.3  Strict liability It is essentially a well-known fact that the rules relating  to classic fault-based liability are not always sufficient  for resolving the legal issues which arise in the case of  dangerous products. The legal system has so far come  up with a range of different answers to this challenge. In  particular, these include:  ●modification of fault-based liability  (for example  through adaptations of the standard of care and  various ways of easing the burden of proof right  through to the reversal of the burden of proof);  ●various bases of strict liability  (i. e. for facilities and  activities which typically cause harm but which, on  account of their benefit for society as a whole, should  not be prohibited); and ●product liability  in accordance with the [German] Act  on Liability for Defective Products ( Gesetz über die  Haftung für fehlerhafte Produkte , ProdHaftG); it acts  as a special form of liability regardless of fault which  differs from strict liability on account of the fact that  it requires, inter alia , a product defect and therefore  comes fairly close to fault-based liability. Steps must be taken to ensure that these answers lead to  legally watertight solutions in terms of compensation for  harm caused by dangerous digital applications. The operation of digital applications currently involves  legal uncertainties and liability loopholes , which  primarily result from the unpredictability of harmful  events, including when the applications are placed  on the market (and hence possibly a failure of classic  fault-based liability). They also result from the fact that,  when various different actors and applications interact,  generally speaking, it is almost impossible to prove where  an error occurred and/or what the cause of the error  was. The open and dynamic nature of digital ecosystems  and the close functional interplay of products, digital  contents and digital services also present a challenge.  These legal uncertainties are, from the perspective of both  companies and consumers, obstacles to innovation and  to the acceptance of new technologies . If harmful events  cannot routinely be assigned in terms of liability and  compensated for, the impact on the market intended to be  achieved through liability provisions cannot be achieved.  In order to create an appropriate balance of interests, the  legislator must provide for transparency and responsibility.  Only if the responsibilities are clarified will it be possible  to insure against harm or damage in practice.
221 F 8. LIABILIT y FOR  ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS The Data Ethics Commission cannot solve at this point  the complex technical legal questions that arise, and  cannot pin down the right solutions in terms of liability  law, especially as, in some instances, the chances of  finding a solution at European level should be explored  first. From an ethical perspective, it is crucial that legal  clarity and legal certainty, in particular with regard  to the liability principles described above , be created.  However, as the debate currently stands, it appears highly  likely that, in addition to appropriate amendments to the  Product Liability Directive (→ see section 8.2.4 below) , certain  changes may need to be made to the rules relating to  fault-based liability and/or new bases of strict liability  may need to be introduced. In the legislative process, it will firstly be necessary to  determine the liability regime that is most appropriate  for particular types of products, digital content and  digital services , and the exact shape that this regime  should take, depending, once again, on the criticality (→  see section 3.1 above)  of the relevant system, but also on other  criteria which are specifically relevant within the context  of liability. As such, strict liability (for example based on  the model involving the car owner’s liability) could be  most appropriate in cases regarding devices where the  operational risk is similarly uncontrollable and could  end up leading to harm to life and limb. As part of this,  the question of insurability and/or possible compulsory  insurance must always play a role. A decision must also  always be taken on which type of harm  should be the  subject of the liability (e.  g. personal injury and damage to  property, data loss, pure financial losses and non-material  damage). Ultimately, in each case, a decision will need to be taken  as to who, taking into consideration the liability principles  described above, is the right party to which liability  should be assigned . There will, in particular, be three  possible parties to which liability could be assigned, of  which two could possibly also be jointly and severally  liable: 18 For the liability concept of such differentiated liability of the operator in digital ecosystems, see the report entitled “Liability for Artificial Intelligence  and other emerging digital technologies” by the European Commission’s Expert Group on Liability and New Technologies (New Technologies  Formation), September 2019, no. [11], p. 40 et seqq. ●the individual registered owner  of the system (i.  e. the  owner or person who, in a similar position, uses the  system for their own purposes);  ●the manufacturer  of the system;  ●the operator  of the system (i.  e. whoever exercises  greater control over the system’s operation, the  individual registered owner as the front-end  operator or a back-end operator who may also be the  manufacturer but does not have to be).18 Determination of that party and of the type of liability  will always depend on the specific type of networked or  autonomous system and the identification of the specific  spheres of liability. 8.2.4  Product security and product liability Overall, it is currently important to highlight a paradigm  shift from a situation whereby products were simply  placed on the market to a situation whereby products are  placed on the market but additional services continue  to be provided for the products thereafter. As such,  ongoing product monitoring and product maintenance   are becoming more and more important. IT security  and data protection standards not only have to be  fulfilled when a product leaves the production plant  but also must continue to be met as part of subsequent  software updates. Conversely, in the event that security  gaps subsequently appear, the manufacturer should  (in accordance with the provisions of the directives on  digital content and digital services and trade in goods) be  subject to a duty to provide security updates  in line with  consumers’ reasonable expectations regarding service life.
222 PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Example 19   No security updates are provided for a smart home  system and, as a result, following a cyber-attack, the  house is broken into. The Product Liability Directive from the 1980s is no  longer able to cover the features of networked, hybrid  or autonomous products. The Data Ethics Commission  recommends that, as part of the evaluation and revision  of the Product Liability Directive  at European level, the  Federal Government should push for watertight and clear  legal provisions, in particular for the following aspects: a) inclusion of digital content and digital services,  including algorithmic systems, under the term  “product”; b) liability for product defects which do not appear until  after the product has been placed on the market and  are the result of self-modifying software, of provision  of updates or a failure to provide them, or of productspecific data feeds; c) liability for breaches of the product monitoring  obligation; d) inclusion of legally protected interests typically  affected by digital product safety, in particular  the right to informational self-determination, in  compensation regimes; e) adaptation of the development risk defence.8.3 Need for a reassessment of liability law Digital ecosystems throw up a variety of other issues in  connection with liability and responsibility. For example,  there is, to some extent, a liability loophole in current  tort law in cases of damage to data and digital products ,  provided that neither a recognised ‘absolute right’ has  been infringed (e.  g. ownership of the storage medium),  nor a statute that is intended to protect another person  breached (e.  g. provisions of criminal law), nor the  conditions of intentional damage contrary to public policy  met. New digital technologies often also involve the  opportunistic use of other people’s infrastructures  (e. g.  the systematic collation and use by third parties of sensor  data generated by private IoT devices or the direct use  of computing capacity or transmission functions), which  can create complicated liability issues. In contexts with  a stronger focus on contract law, major harm or damage  (in particular at the expense of consumers) can be caused  on account of the fact that the usability of high-value  goods  (real property, machines, cars, etc.) is becoming  increasingly dependent on the long-term provision of  digital services (software updates, user accounts, etc.)  and the provision of such services is not guaranteed and/ or can even be specifically suspended in order to put  individuals under pressure (electronic repossession) .
223 F 8. LIABILIT y FOR  ALGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Digital ecosystems are also, to some extent, characterised  by the interaction of numerous components and  operators, whereby it is often disproportionately difficult  for the injured party to prove which of several potential  tortfeasors  (e. g. hardware supplier, suppliers of various  software components, data feed provider or network  operator) caused the harm. On the other hand, digital  technologies not only create a new lack of transparency  with regard to the cause of harm or damage but can,  conversely, also help in documenting the course of  causal events in an unprecedented way. The question  therefore arises as to which actor is obliged to contribute  to providing clarification on the cause of the harm by  already logging data  ex-ante and to whom the data  actually recorded via logging should be disclosed in the  event of harm. The Data Ethics Commission therefore recommends  overall that the Federal Government should investigate  the extent to which current liability law has kept up  with the challenges of digital ecosystems  or needs  to be reworked. Priority must be given to striving to  achieve a solution at European level. The Data Ethics  Commission advises in this context against any tendency  towards a one-sided focus on specific technological  features, in particular the feature of machine learning.  Whilst machine learning creates certain additional  dangers and involves certain additional issues regarding  the assignment of liability, most challenges for liability  law are attributable to other factors (e.  g. intangibility,  interaction of numerous components, networking and  decentralisation).
PART F | A LGORITHMIC  SySTEMS Summary of the most important  recommendations for action Liability for algorithmic systems 72 Liability for damages, alongside criminal responsibility  and administrative sanctions, is a vital component  of any ethically sound regulatory framework for  algorithmic systems. It is already apparent today that  algorithmic systems pose challenges to liability law as  it currently stands, inter alia  because of the complexity  and dynamism of these systems and their growing  “autonomy”. The Data Ethics Commission therefore  recommends that the current provisions of liability law  should undergo in-depth checks and (where necessary)  revisions. The scope of these checks and revisions should  not be restricted on the basis of too narrowly defined  technological features, such as machine learning or  artificial intelligence. 73 The proposal for a future system under which legal  personality would be granted to high-autonomy  algorithmic systems, and the systems themselves would  be liable for damages ( “electronic person” ), should not  be pursued further . As far as this concept is, by some  protagonists, based on a purported equivalence between  human and machine it is ethically indefensible. And as far  as it boils down to introducing a new type of company  under company law it does not, in fact, solve any of the  pertinent problems. 74 By way of contrast, if harm is caused by autonomous  technology used in a way functionally equivalent to the  employment of human auxiliaries, the operator’s liability  for making use of the technology should correspond  to the otherwise existing vicarious liability regime of a  principal for such auxiliaries  (cf. in particular Section 278  of the German Civil Code). For example, a bank that uses  an autonomous system to check the creditworthiness of  its customers should be liable towards them to at least the  same extent that it would be had it used a human employee  to perform this task. 75 As the debate currently stands, it appears highly likely  that appropriate amendments will need to be made to  the Product Liability Directive  (which dates back to the  1980s), and a connection established to new product  safety standards; in addition, certain changes may need to  be made to the rules relating to fault-based liability  and/ or new bases of strict liability  may need to be introduced.  In each case, it will be necessary to determine the liability  regime that is most appropriate for particular types of  products, digital content and digital services, and the exact  shape that this regime should take (once again depending  on the criticality of the relevant algorithmic system).  Consideration should also be given to innovative liability  concepts currently being developed at European level.
A European pathPart G
226 PART G | A E UROPEAN  PATH The Data Ethics Commission has examined a great many  different questions, and discussions on these questions  have raised new ones in turn; this alone should indicate  that this Opinion can serve only as one out of many  building blocks in the larger edifice of a broad-based  debate on the future of ethics, law and technology  that  we must return to again and again. This debate must be  interdisciplinary from the outset, and encompass a broad  range of sciences and a diverse mix of representatives  from the worlds of the economy, civil society and politics.  In view of the immense economic pressure and the  fast-paced nature of technological change, the findings  that emerge from this debate must be integrated on an  ongoing basis into the activities of the parties involved at  all levels, so that we can shape a technological future that  is founded on values. Data transfers and the use of algorithmic systems  transcend national boundaries, which means that a  forward-looking discussion of the ethical and legal issues  arising in connection with data and algorithmic systems  must not be restricted to the national level. We need to  view problems from a global perspective , and accordingly  strive to present our findings and perspectives more  than before on a pan-European debate as well. Lessons  learned from implementing the GDPR have shown that  the economic clout of the European Economic Area  and its significance as a market for the operators and  providers of algorithmic systems may ultimately mean  that these latter are prompted by economic interests  to comply with the EU’s basic requirements when  developing and implementing their products and services.  These European requirements are also being used by ever  more non-European governments as a reference point  when drafting their own regulatory frameworks.The debate that needs to take place should therefore be  a priority topic on the agendas of international forums  (EU, OECD, Council of Europe, United Nations, G7 and  G20). With this in mind, the Data Ethics Commission  recommends that the Federal Government should make  its voice heard within these international bodies. In  particular, the German Presidency of the EU Council   in the second half of 2020 should be utilised as an  opportunity to promote the measures to deal with  data governance and algorithmic systems as proposed  in this opinion on the European level. The Data Ethics  Commission also believes that the Federal Government  should be actively involved (both in the early stages of the  process and on an ongoing basis) in the establishment of  an International Panel on Artificial Intelligence (IPAI) as  initiated on the level of the G7. In the global contest for future technologies, Germany  and Europe are being confronted with value systems,  models of society and cultures that differ widely from our  own. This has prompted a debate whether Germany and  Europe are to adapt to one or the other non-European  models in order to remain competitive. The Data Ethics  Commission supports the “European path”  which has  been followed to date. It is often referred to in debates  as a “third way” that strikes a balance between the  US and Chinese positions, and which asserts that the  defining feature of European technologies should be  their consistent alignment with European values and  fundamental rights, in particular those enshrined in the  European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights and  the Council of Europe’s Convention for the Protection of  Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. In order to remain actively involved in the future debate  on the interplay between ethics, law and technology,  the digital sovereignty of Germany and Europe must  be preserved to the greatest extent possible. When  used in reference to nation states or organisations, the  term “digital sovereignty” encompasses every aspect of  data processing, i.e. control over the storage, transfer  and use of the sensitive data held by these bodies, and  autonomous decisions on who can access them. 
227 PART G | A E UROPEAN  PATH A globalised world in which people, states and  companies co-exist side by side requires cross-border  flows of data, and the Internet – which serves as  the conduit for these flows – is a global “network of  networks”; this distributed global structure, which  embraces very different legal and societal systems,  renders complete sovereignty an impossible task. The  debate on digital sovereignty must therefore tackle  vital questions relating to technical infrastructure,  including hardware, networks, control components such  as routers or address servers, and data centres. With a  view to preserving the digital sovereignty of Germany  and Europe, and given the huge extent to which we are  reliant on foreign products, the Data Ethics Commission  believes that there is an urgent need to take action at  German and European level through investments into  developing and safeguarding appropriate technologies  and infrastructures . Virtually all of the most important and basic Internet  infrastructure components that are used in Germany (and  indeed in Europe as a whole) can be procured only from  other continents at present, and so efforts to preserve  sovereignty must be restricted for now to the two main  avenues open to us; the first of these is the critical  analysis and assessment of the basic components being  used, and the second is the application of the highest  possible security standards when operating them in  order to minimise the risk of misuse by foreign states  and organisations. Looking to the future, however, the  Data Ethics Commission believes that it is important  for Germany and Europe as a whole to develop a higher  level of digital sovereignty , right down to the level of  technical infrastructure . Support should be available  for R&D work on systems that comply with the highest  possible standards of security. Work of this kind would  include both the design of new components to replace  previous systems, and attempts to engineer integrated  solutions that use existing components and that achieve  the required level of protection in spite of known or  suspected inadequacies or security risks.The digital sovereignty of a nation state should be  viewed not only in relation to other nation states, but  also in relation to non-state actors that wield significant  amounts of power. As the data economy grows, there  is a trend for economic power to be concentrated  in  the hands of a few, and the emergence of new power  imbalances  is apparent. To an ever greater extent,  R&D work on algorithmic systems and other digital  technologies is being carried out within a framework  established by a small group of digital giants; what is  more, these companies often act as an important source  of public research funding and therefore have a say in  this research. Over the past few decades, intermediaries  have played an increasingly important role in forming  opinions, and therefore in influencing the sociopolitical  discourse; this means that the associated risk of abuse  has also increased. Given the importance of ethical and  legal fundamental values and freedoms and to preserve  the digital sovereignty of Germany and Europe, the Data  Ethics Commission believes that there is an urgent need  to closely monitor the shifts in power structures, as those  are vital for the functioning of a democratic State and a  social market economy, and to efficiently regulate the  according areas wherever needed. Excessive dependence on others turns a nation into a rule  taker rather than a rule maker, resulting in the citizens  of this nation being subject to requirements imposed by  players elsewhere in the world. Embarking on efforts  to safeguard digital sovereignty in the long term  is  therefore not only a politically far-sighted necessity, but  also an expression of ethical responsibility.

Appendix
230 APPENDI x 1. The Federal Government’s key questions to the  Data Ethics Commission Coalition Agreement: “We will set up a data ethics commission that within the next year will provide  the government and parliament with proposals on how to develop data  policy and deal with algorithms, artificial intelligence and digital innovation.  Clarification of data ethics questions can add impetus to the process of digital  development and can help define an approach towards resolving social  conflicts within the area of data policy.” Key questions for the Data Ethics Commission: Digitisation is fundamentally changing our society. New  data-based technologies can be beneficial for people’s  everyday lives as well as for industry, the environment,  science and society as a whole. Their potential is enor mous. At the same time, digitisation also clearly brings certain  risks. Numerous ethical and legal questions are raised,  particularly concerning the effects of these develop ments and the desired role of new technologies. If digital  change is to benefit the whole of society, we need to  examine the possible consequences of new technologies  and establish ethical safeguards. One challenge is to develop 21st-century law in a way  that protects human dignity (“a human being must not  become a mere object”) and guarantees fundamental and  human rights such as the general right of personality, the  right to privacy, the right to informational self-determi nation, freedom from discrimination, freedom of science,  freedom to conduct a business, and freedom of expres sion and information – bringing all of these rights into  equilibrium with one another. There are complex tensions between the principles of the  common good, progress, innovation and solidarity. The task of this Commission – having identified the  current state of discussion and legislation at the Euro pean and international level, ascertained the possibilities  for positive action at the national level, and given special  consideration to sensitive areas – is to develop ethical  standards and guidelines for the protection of individuals,  the preservation of social cohesion and the safeguarding  and promotion of prosperity in the information age. The  Commission is also tasked with providing the Federal  Government with recommendations and regulatory  proposals on how ethical guidelines can be developed,  respected, implemented and monitored. These propos als should also include a description of the underlying  concepts used, as well as assessments of the possible  consequences and side effects. The public is to be appropriately involved in the work of  the Commission. In order to help the Data Ethics Commission carry out its  work, the Federal Government has provided it with the  following key questions in three areas:
231 1. THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT ’S KEy QUESTIONS  TO THE  DATA  ETHICS  COMMISSION I. Algorithmic decision-making (ADM) Advanced automation systems are increasingly shaping  economic and social realities and people’s everyday  lives. Data collection and analysis enable the develop ment of innovative interpretation models, which are  also used to make or prepare algorithm-based decisions.  Algorithms make it possible, for example, to recognise  patterns and differences in the behaviour of different  groups. Whether it is a matter of setting individual  prices in e-commerce, assessing creditworthiness or  selecting candidates in recruitment procedures, people  are being evaluated by technical processes in more  and more areas of life. Data evaluation and predictions  about individual behaviour can offer opportunities  (e.g. aiding research, strengthening innovation within  industry, increasing the efficiency of data processing  processes), but they also harbour risks (e.g. for individual  freedom and self-determination, for participation and  equal opportunities among certain individuals and social  groups). Social inequality and discrimination against  individuals or groups of individuals can be perpetuated  if biases are incorporated into the programming of an  algorithm or its training data. These risks are particularly  acute in participation-relevant and personality-sensitive  ADM processes. Against this background, the following  questions arise, especially with regard to consumer  protection:  ●What are the ethical limits to using ADM processes?  Or what ethical limits should there be?  ●Can it be ethically necessary to use ADM processes?  ●Are there characteristics, criteria or certain kinds of  data that should not be incorporated into ADM pro cesses – due to their age or origin, for example?  ●How can we determine which prejudices and distor tions in which areas are ethically undesirable? What  effects can the use of ADM processes have on social  groups?  ●What regulatory approaches could be used to prevent  manipulation, unequal treatment and discrimination? ●Is it advisable to have a graduated regulatory frame work based on the risk to social participation or the  potential for discrimination?  ●How can the reliability, reproducibility and scrutiny of  ADM be guaranteed?  ●Are there limits to the use of ADM if its use and crite ria cannot be explained to the people affected?  ●Are there test methods that can make self-learning  ADM open to scrutiny? II. Artificial Intelligence (AI) With the development of AI, industrial and administra tive environments are deploying more and more highly  automated systems that use AI methods and have the  ability to “learn” through the use of training data. In  addition, work is being done on simulating the cognitive  functions of the human brain. The developments in the  field of artificial intelligence raise the question of how  the dignity, autonomy and self-determination of the  individual can be safeguarded and fostered. This leads to  questions such as the following:  ●What fundamental ethical principles must be observed  when developing, programming and using AI?  ●Where do the ethical boundaries lie for using AI and  robots, especially in special areas of life such as care/ assistance and dealing with particularly vulnerable  groups (children, the elderly, people with disabilities)?  Can it be ethically necessary to use AI?  ●Is “ethics by design” possible for AI? If so, how could it  be implemented and monitored?  ●How can it be ensured that machines working on an AI  basis can be controlled?
232 APPENDI x  ●To whom are the creations/inventions generated by AI  to be ascribed? Who should bear the responsibility for  malfunctioning systems? How can the responsibility of  the actors involved in the development and use of AI  systems (programmers, data scientists, clients, etc.) be  made transparent?  ●What else will be necessary in the future to sustainably  guarantee the freedoms and fundamental rights upon  which our society is based? III. Data Digitisation is characterised by an increase in the volume  of data (big data), by a vast accumulation of data by  individual actors, by the high speed of data processing  (real time), by connectivity (internet, complex networks  of actors, Internet of Things), by the increasing ubiquity  and permanence of data, and by the further development  of various methods of data analysis. As the amount of  available data increases, so too does the ability to un dertake more granular analyses. Data is used to develop  new business models and change value-added chains and  work processes. By some, data is regarded as a commodi ty that enables value creation (“data economy”). At both the national and European level, there are current  laws (e.g. the General Data Protection Regulation, open  data legislation) and numerous legislative initiatives that  concern the handling of data (e.g. the ePrivacy Regula tion, legislative proposals regarding the free flow of data).  On the one hand, these are intended to safeguard funda mental rights such as the right to informational self-de termination, while on the other hand they are intended  to enable useful and innovative data processing. Further  proposals are discussed as to whether and how access to  data, use of data, trade in data, and rights to data could  be regulated for the first time or be better regulated.In the process, the following questions may arise regard ing the handling of data in general, data access and the  use of data:  ●What are the ethical limits to the economization   of data?  ●Who should be permitted to derive economic benefit  from data?  ●Should there be an obligation to offer payment models?  ●Is it advisable to have uniform rules that apply equally  to all data? Or should preference be given to rules  that apply to specific areas (e.g. for brain data)? What  should be the connecting factor for rules that apply to  specific areas?  ●What consequences do existing access and exclusivity  rights to data have for competition and innovation?  And what consequences would additional access and  exclusivity rights to data have?  ●Is there a need for the state to offer support as part of  its provision of general public services so that citizens  can navigate the internet and social networks in a  responsible, competent and confident manner and  learn how to handle data? Can the provision of data, in  particular open data, become part of the provision of  public services by the state?  ●How much transparency is necessary and appropriate  to safeguard the right to informational self-determina tion and to enable citizens to participate in economic  life in a self-determined manner?  ●Do particular life circumstances require special protec tion concepts for specific user groups?  ●Are the existing institutions in sensitive areas sufficient  to ensure data is used ethically? How can adequate  stakeholder representation be ensured in the long term?
233 1. THE FEDERAL  GOVERNMENT ’S KEy QUESTIONS  TO THE  DATA  ETHICS  COMMISSION  ●What effects can extensive data collections have on  the functioning of the market economy (e.g. compet itiveness, information asymmetry between suppliers  and consumers, the possibility of developing inno vative products) and democracy (e.g. recording and  analysing behaviour in social networks)? If necessary,  how can action be taken against data power/data silos  (especially intermediaries)?  ●Should data or access to data be declared a public  good in certain cases? In which cases and under which  ethical criteria?  ●The use of non-personal data can have collective  effects. For example, individuals or certain population  groups may be placed at a disadvantage because data  analysis shows that payment habits are worse in a par ticular neighbourhood. What regulatory instruments  would be needed for this? In which sectors?  ●Are statutory regulations on improving access to data  possible, necessary and advisable?  ●Should data processing be prohibited in certain cases  for ethical reasons, for example in cases involving  certain types of data (e.g. political views; brain data) or  certain areas of use (e.g. profiling for political purposes  or for use in elections)?  ●Under what circumstances can there be an ethical  obligation to use data?  ●Does the legal system sufficiently recognise the  possible benefits that data processing can have for the  common good? If not, how can this be achieved? ●Is it possible and advisable to create experimentation  clauses for testing new applications or new regulatory  instruments?  ●Does it make sense to invest in data infrastructures? If  so, in which ones?  ●How can the constitutionally protected interests of  individuals, enterprises, science and art be reconciled  with the public interest in the use of data?
