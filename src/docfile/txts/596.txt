             AI Principles of Telefonica     Approved by Executive Committee           TELEF ÓNICA, S.A.                                                               October  2018                 
Introduction  Big Data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are helping people, teams and organizations, through  the use of large amounts of data and complex algorithms, to take more objective, datadriven decisions. There are many great examples of AI1  showing improvements in business,  life and society, such as improved medical diagnosis, self-driving cars, automatic translation,  personalisation of products and services, supply-chain optimization, management of  humanitarian disasters, climate change, to name just a few.   Telefonica has been using AI for several years to optimize its business processes, to improve  the customer relation and experience, and to help improve operations of our B2B customers.  We see an increasing role for human-machine collaboration to bring our businesses to the  next level.   With all those opportunities also comes great responsibility. The application of AI  technology may lead to unfair or discriminatory results if the person or team that designs or  implements the services is not cautious and aware of potential unwanted outcomes.   We are strongly committed to respecting Human Rights, as is stated in our Business  Principles and our Human Rights Policy, as well as all other internal policies that have been  derived therefrom. We are committed to developing products and services aimed at making  the world a better place to live and mitigating any negative impacts technology may have  on society or the environment. Technology should contribute to making society more  inclusive and offer better opportunities for all, and we believe AI can contribute to these  goals.  In this document, we describe the principles Telefonica abides when designing, developing  or using AI. We are committed to implementing them in our products and services. For this,  we are implementing a methodology “Responsible AI by Design”, to be used internally.   Fair AI  We seek to ensure that the applications of AI technology lead to fair results. This means  that they should not lead to discriminatory impacts on people in relation to  race, ethnic  origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, disability or any other personal condition.  We will  apply technology to minimize the likelihood that the training data sets we use create or  reinforce unfair bias or discrimination.  1 Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems that display intelligent behaviour by ana lysing their  environment and taking actions – with some degree of autonomy – to achieve specific goals. AI -based  systems can be purely software -based, acting in the virtual world (e.g. voice assistants, image  analysis software, search engines, speech and f ace recognition systems) or AI can be embedded in  hardware devices (e.g. advanced robots, autonomous cars, drones or Internet of Things applications)  -https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/communication-artificial-intelligence-europe
When optimizing a machine learning algorithm for accuracy in terms of false positives and  negatives, we will consider the impact of the algorithm in the specific domain.    Transparent and Explainable AI  We will be explicit about the kind of personal and/or non -personal data the AI systems uses  as well as about the purpose the data is used for. When people directly interact with an AI  system, we will be transparent to the users that this is the case.  When AI systems take, or support, decisions we take the technical and organizational  measures required to guarantee a level of understanding adequate to the application area.  In any case, if the decisions significantly affect people's lives, we will ensure we understand  the logic behind the conclusions. This will also apply when we use third-party technology.   Human-centric AI  AI should be at the service of society and generate tangible benefits for people. AI systems  should always stay under human control and be driven by value-based considerations.  Telefonica is conscious of the fact that the implementation of AI in our products and  services should in no way lead to a negative impact on human rights or the achievement of  the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals. We are concerned about the potential use of AI for  the creation or spreading of fake news, technology addiction, and the potential  reinforcement of societal bias in algorithms in general. We commit to working towards  avoiding these tendencies to the extent it is within our realm of control.   Privacy and Security by design  AI systems are fuelled by data, and Telefonica is committed to respecting people’s right to  privacy and their personal data. The data used in AI systems can be personal or  anonymous/aggregated. When processing personal data, according to Telefonica’s privacy  policy, we will at all times comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and  transparency, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, integrity and confidentiality.  When using anonymized and/or aggregated data, we will use the principles set out in this  document.   In order to ensure compliance with our Privacy Policy we use a Privacy by Design  methodology.  When building AI systems, as with other systems, we follow Telefonica’s  Security by Design approach.   We apply, accor ding to Telefonica’s privacy policy, in all of the processing cycle phases, the  technical and organizational measures required to guarantee a level of security adequate to  the risk to which the personal information may be exposed and, in any case, in accordance  with the security measures established in the law in force in each of the countries and/or  regions in which we operate. 
Working with partners and third parties  When we deliver AI-based products and services to our customers in collaboration with  partners or third parties, we contractually reserve the right to verify with our suppliers that  the logic and data used as declared by the suppliers are true.
