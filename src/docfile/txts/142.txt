     4    Introduction:     This study is the result of a Tender awarded on 10 May 2019 by the Directorate General of  Democracy (DG2) of the Council of Europe and Eurimages to commission a study explo ring the  feasibility of the Council of Europe’s interv ention in the sector responsible for producing and  distributing Television series .       The se ries sector has changed dramatically in the last few years with the recent development of  online video platfo rms (“OTT platforms”) offering large catalogues of con tent accessed via pay  subscription models (“SVOD” offers).  These offers have gained many cus tomers worldwide and are  strongly changing the way content is consumed and produced.  Even though local SVOD platforms  are now emerging throughout Europe, the rapi d penetration and success of global platforms like  Netflix and Amazon in most markets raise i ssues on their disruptive approach to marketing and  content production. This study and analysis will focus on  the growing fictional series segment which  is hencefo rth referred to as “Series” in this Study. 1    This study will provide key research elements and analysis of the series sector in key Eurimages member markets.  It will also present recommendations to as sist Eurimages position itself as a  potential new play er in this market segment.   If Eurimages is also willing to explore its potential role within the framework of it s prerogatives i.e  supporting cultural diversity of all its member States and defending t he fundamental values of the  Council of Europe in the audio -visual sector, there may be a larger role for Eurimages to play. In this  respect, a specific analysis on ne w AI methods has also been highlighted in this report which  estimates their potential imp act in this segment and which also contains our counse l and proposed  recommendations.     The team selected to respond to the study consists of 2 companies with in -depth  experience in the  audio -visual sector:   - Consortium leader Peacefulfish UG (Thierry Baujar d supported by Axel de Swarte) from  Berlin, Germany wi th the support from TV and series expert Remi Tereszkiewicz  based in  Paris   - Digital Media Finland company lead by TV expert Timoteus Tuovinen     The methodology used was primary and direct, based on interv iews with more than 50 producers,  public institution r epresentatives and professionals in the audio -visual sector (a complete list is  contained in Appendix 5 ) This research was completed by meetings at “Série Series” Workshop in  Fontainebleau in June 2019 and a visit to the International Broadcasting Conventi on (IBC) fair in  Amsterdam in September 2019.  It is important to note that global platform players lik e Netflix,  Amazon and HBO were contacted for this study, but they did not respond to our inquiries.   In addition, we have conducted secondary research bas ed on many studies, reports and trade  press articles dealing with the global platform sector issues and  have also included our analysis on  potential factors and issues for this study     The different chap ters of this study will bring a clear snapshot of the series sector and point out  what is needed and what are the best practices.     1 Series  is defined precisely  in 2.2.1  
     5    The first chapter  deals with the Artificial Intelligence usage in the audio -visual sector, describes its  evolution t rends and evaluates its potential threat to the divers ity of content and the free access to  information of the citizens of the member  States.     The second chapter describes how the series sector system works, its specificities compared to the  more na tionally focussed  fiction segment  and how it is  evolving with the growing penetration of  international platforms and their series offers.     The fi nal part of this report analyses the challenges, levers and needs of the series players based on  the f indings of the previous chapters. Based on these eleme nts, 5 recommendations of actions for  Eurimages and the Council of Europe are proposed with several steps in order to help the institution  to enter the series sector with clear -sightedness and efficiency.                                                                      
     6    1. Artificial Intelligence  in the audio -visual sector     1.1.Introduction     Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)3 and machine  learning4 have  implications  on the media  industry  as a  whole.  In this study  we focus  on television  and cinema.  We analyse  how  AI influences  viewers’   demand  (bottom -up) and on the other  hand,  how  it shapes  what  is offered  to them  (top-down).  The  balance  between  the two has implications  on the diversity  of TV and cinema  sector.  This part of the  study  looks  at the current  role and uses  of AI in television  and cinema  and the impact  it makes  on  the viewers  and the broadcasting  and internet  media -ecosystems.     The first part of this study  aims  to answer  three  key questions:     • What  is the effect  of AI on the cultural  diversity  of series  and cinema  content?   • What  is the role of regulation  and are there  specific  measures  or actions  needed?   • What  are the current  uses  of AI in TV and cinema?     Although  still in the early  stages,  the uptake  of AI has influenced  people’s  viewing  behaviour . AI  adoption  has raised  questions  about  the balance  of programming  libraries  on offer,  in regard  to the  countries  of origin,  programming  genres  and the titles  recommended.  The proliferation  of new   video -on-demand  services  increases  the urgency  to address  the current  and future  AI ramifications.      Secondly,  we  take  a look  at the different  aspects  of regulating  the use of AI in television  and cinema;   what could  be done  in orde r to ensure  that AI is used  in a fair and ethical  manner  and that it will not  violate  the basic  human  rights,  freedom  of expression,  access  to a balanced  information,  right  for  privacy,  data  protection , etc.. .    The AI policy  landsc ape is still in its infan cy. Some  policymakers  see this moment  as the beginning   of an AI arms  race  in need  of public  funding  and regulation.  Others  are calling  for comprehensive   guidelines  that address  ethical  algorithms,  data  protection,  retraining,  antit rust and transparency.   National  AI strategies  are becoming  more  common  and more  companies  are adopting  codes  of AI  conduct.     At the same  time,  emerging  regulations  around  data  privacy  will also impact  AI and may  limit  its  growth  because  it affects  how  compan ies operating  globally  can use data  generated  across   territories.  Europe’s  General  Data  Protection  Regulation  and California’s  Consumer  Privacy   Act (coming  in 2020)  both  give individuals  the right  to see and control  how  organizations  collect  and  use their  personal  data —as well as corrective  actions  should  they  suffer  damages  due to bias or  cybersecurity  breaches.5      3 AI (Artificial  Intelligence):  Simulation  of human  intelligence  processes  by machines,  especially  computer  systems.   They  include  learning,  reasoning  and self-correction   4 Machine  learning:  Appl ication  of AI that provides  systems  the ability  to automatically  learn  and improve  from   experience  without  being  explicitly  programmed   5 http s://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/artificial -intelligence -predictions -2019.html  
     7    The third  question  of the study  examines  the current  uses  of AI. We analyse  the role of AI in  production  and distribution  of television  series  and films,  with  a specia l emphasis  on its impact  on  the viewers.     Systems  and applications  worldwide  gather  various  kinds  of data  all the time . AI tries  answering  the  big ques tion about  data:  how  to create  value  with  it. Data  is like fuel to an AI engine;  without  data  there  is no AI. Data  in itself  is useless  if it isn’t  analysed , categorized,  combined  with  other  data  and  so on; AI brings  purpose  to gathering  data.  AI and analytics  systems  provide  strategic  insights  from   data  for decision  making and improving  oper ations.  AI tools  have  become  an important  technology   for many  media  companies.  At the same  time,  the growing  role of AI has raised  concerns.      Television  and cinema  sectors  are still in the early  stages  of AI adoption , but as more  data  is fed into  AI systems  the more  the development  and adoption  speeds  up. It is obvious  that AI will be a  disruptive  technology  with  profound  impact  in the media  industry.        AI in Cinema     Artificial intelligence has  been a theme in popular culture for decades. People have been caught up  between fascination and fear in movies, such as Star Wars, Blade Runner and Matrix . Stanley  Kubrick’s 2001 Space Odyssey  featured the infamous computer Hal, who  controlled all the sys tems  of the Discovery One spacecraft and spoke with the ship’s astronaut crew. In the end of the film Hal   has to be  shut down  to save the human crew. Generations of spectators have been left wondering  whether  AI is our friend or enem y. Definitions and exam ples currently provided in  public debate or  depicted by  Hollywood movies often are fairly vague, even conflicting at times. The questions about  AI remain today, as we start to face the impact of AI use in our everyday lives.             1.2. How  Artificial  Intelligence  is used.     1.2.1. Description  of Artificial  Intelligence  technologies      The use of AI in the media  sector  has enabled  personalization  on a mass  scale.  AI is based  on models   and techniques  that,  in turn,  are often  based  on a decisio n tree.  This means  that the AI-engine   monitors  and sometimes  controls  the data  flow  based  on user defined  rules  and provides  decisions   and recommendations  based  on certain  decision  points.  The system  learns  and can get better  in  time  as it processes  data.  Another  form  of AI used  in machine  learning  forms  the basis  of advanced   neural  nets.  A neural  net is based  on pattern  recognition  algorithms  and its aim is to find answers   from  classifying  data  over  and over  again.  This forms  the basis  for deep learning  application s. For  examp le, it is possible  to train  AI to recognize  an image  of a dog or identify  a person  on a video.      Algorithms  are further  explained  in Appendix  1.   
     8    1.2.2. Examples  of Artificial  Intelligence  uses     Content  marketing     A large  propor tion of investments  in series  and films  is allocated  to marketing  them.  Studios  are  increasingly  using  AI to help  them  in creating  promotional  movie  trailers.  Machine  vision  systems   examine  trailer  footage  frame  by frame,  labelling  objects  and even ts, and then  compar ing them  to  data  generated  for other  trailers.  The idea  is that movies  with  similar  sets of labels  will attract  similar   types  of people.     20th Century  Fox has partnered  with  Google  to use the company’s  servers  and the open -source  AI  framework  TensorFlow  in order  to create  their  experimental  movie  attendance  prediction  and  recommendation  system,  called  Merlin.   Merlin  works  as follows.   First, Merlin scans the trailer, labelling  objects like “facial hair,” “car,” and “forest”.  One criterion  is  the f requency of these labels, but the actual data generated is more complex. It takes into account  how long these objects appear on -screen and when they show up the trailer.   20th  Century  Fox’s engineers  say that this temporal , or time -based  informati on is particularly  rich  because  it correlates  with  a film’s  genre.  “For  example,”  they  claim,  “a trailer  with  a long  close -up  shot  of a character  is more  likely  in a drama  movie  than  for an action  movie,  whereas  a trailer  with   quick but freque nt shots  is more  likely  in an action  movie.”  An example  of this is 20th Century  Fox’s   2017  dark  superhero  film Logan . Its trailer  features  lots of slow  shots  of the main  character  Hugh   Jackman  looking  bloody  and beaten.  By comparing  this information  with analyses  of other  trailers,   Merlin  tries  to predict  what  films  might  interest  the people  who  saw Logan.     Merlin  gets quite  a few of the films  correct,  including  other  superhero  movies  like X Men:   Apocalypse , Doctor  Strange , and Batman  v Supe rman:  Dawn  of Justice . It even  correctly   identifies  John  Wick:  Chapter  2 as a pair for Logan.  That’s  an impressive  inference  since  John  Wick  is  certainly  not a superhero  movie.  However,  it does  feature  a similarly  weary  and jaded  protago nist  with  a comparably  rugged  look.  All in all, Merlin  identifies  all of the top five picks,  even  if it does  fail  to put them  in the same  order  of importance.   What’s  more  revealing,  though,  are the mismatches.  Merlin  predicts  that The Legend  of Tarzan  will  be a big hit with  Loga n fans  for example.  Neither  Google  nor 20th  Century  Fox offers  an explanation   for this,  but it could  it have  something  to do with  the “forest,”  “tree,”  and “light”  found  in Logan,   elements  which  also feature  heavily  in the Tarzan  trailer.    Similarly,  The Revenant  has plenty  of flora  and facial  hair,  but it was a drama -heavy  Oscar  winner   rather  than  a superhero  movie.  Merlin  also misses  Ant-Man  and Deadpool  2 as attracting  the same   audience.  These  were  superhero  films  with  quick -cut trailers,  but they  also took offbeat  approaches   to their  protagonists,  similar  to Wolverine’s  treatment  in Logan.   As the researchers  behind  Merlin  explain  in a paper  published  in October  20186, this is exactly  the  sort of data  movie  studios  love.  (They  already  produce  lots of similar  data  using  traditional  methods   like interviews  and questionnaires.)  Understanding  detailed  audience  composition  is important  for    6 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.08189.pdf  
     9    movie  studios  that invest  in stories  of uncertain  commercial  value.  In other  words,  if they  know  who   watches  what,  they  will know  what  movies  to make.7  Aside  from  Google,  20th Century  Fox had partnered  with  IBM two years  earlier.  In 2016  Fox used   IBM’s  AI service  called  Watson.  The goal  was to produce  a promo  trailer  with  the help  of AI for a  horror  film called  Morgan . The trailer  team  first fed promotional  trailers  of 100 horror  films  into  Watson  and labelled  each  segment.  Watson  then  made  a visual  analysis  of the characters,  objects   and locations.  Each  segment  was assigned  an emotion  and once  Watson  “understood”  the  mechanics  of horror  scenes,  the team  helped  Watson  to pick up ten scenes  to compose  the traile r.  Human  work  was involved  in the editing  of the trailer  and adding  music  to it. One scene  was also  rejected  on the basis  that it did not fit the story.8  In addi tion to promotional  trailers,  still images,  called  thumbnails,  are also important  in promoting   series  and films.  In Appendix  3, we will have  a closer  look  at how  Netflix  uses  AI in its programme   promotion  via thumbnails.     Content  creation     Script writing i s a creative area where we have seen AI “in action”.  AI has been used for simple  factual text creation (sports and news reports produced by robots), but AI has also been applied to  writing fictional stories. Automation has reached a  level where AI starts to play a more prominent  role in the content creation, although we are still in th e early stages of this development.      Sunspring is an experimental short film, based on an algorithm and produced previously  in 2016.  Americans Oscar Shapin  and Ross G odwin programmed a computational system they named  Benjamin, and fed it  with  science -fiction movie scripts, including X-Files, Star Trek and 2001, A Space  Odyssey . Benjamin analysed  similarities and repetitions in the scri pts, drew up scenarios and  created a dialogue. It even composed a part of the soundtrack , based on 30.000 pop songs.             The end credits of the film reads: «  WRITTEN BY Benjamin, a system -on-chip (SOC) computer with  graphics processing unit (GPU), runnin g a “long short term me mory (LSTM), Recurrent neural  network (RNN) ” .9 Another AI script developer commented the film : Sunspring  is the perfect  example where the A.I. failed to recognize deeper plot logic  causing it to not make any sense.10    Another example  of AI script writing i s a horror film called Impossible  Things .  The project is an AI  co-written feature film, taking a step forward in human -computer collaboratively created  original  content. Impossible Things  is engineered using big data and artificial intelligence. The film raised  financing  on the crowd -sourced  funding  platform  Kickstarter,  but we conclude  the campaign  failed     7 https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/2/18055514/fox -google -ai-analyze -movie -trailer -predict -success -logan   8 https://www.lexpress.fr/actualite/sciences/video -watson -l-intelligence -artificielle -d-ibm-a-cree -une-bande annonce_1826667.html   9 https://www.journaldugeek.com/2016/06/13/sunspring -court -metrage -intelligence -artificielle/   10 https://www.kickstarte r.com/projects/970954017/impossible -things -worlds -first-ai-co-written -featu  
     10    to attract  the projected  goal  of 30.000  Canadian  dollars.  The latest  funding  activity  was dated  in  Decembe r 2017.11    Interactive  stories  have  been  around  for a long  time.  Brazilian  company  Globo  introduced  an  interactive  television  format  in the early  1990’s.  The format  was called  You Decide,  and it was a TV  series  in which  the audience  could  choose  between  two different  endings  to the story.  The choice   was decided  by the number  of viewers’  telephone  calls  favouring  one or the other  ending  of the  story.      These  days , the level  of viewer  interaction  has intensified  with  the help  of AI. Complex  story  lines   with varying  levels  of audience  interaction  are introduced.  One recent  example  is the British  series   Black  Mirror , airing  on Netflix.  The last episode,  called  Bandersnatch , became  availab le in December   2018.  It allowed  the viewer  to choose  the upcoming  scene  from  an array  of choic es. The viewer   could  choose  between  story  options  and control  the fate of the main  protagonist - a game  developer   named  Stefan.   And this is where  Netflix  user  data  kicks  in: Stefan’s  first dilemma  was whether  to  eat Sugar  Puffs cereal  or Kellogg’s  Frosted corn  flakes  for breakfast.  60 % of the viewers  opted  for  Frost ed Flakes . The choice  is non-relevant  to the story  of Bandersnatch,  but it does  provide  Netflix   with  data  it can combine  with  user  profiles  and use it as market ing research.12    Netflix’s House  of Cards  vs. Amazon  Studio’s  Alpha  House     An example  of using  data  to make  strategic  choices  for Netflix  original  productions  is the  development  of the series  House  of Cards . The main  advantage  in using  and benefitting  from  the  user  data  was to identify  viewer  profiles  and viewer  preferences.  This enabled  Netflix  to make  a  connection  between  a large  potential  audience  and content  that would  match  the viewers’   expectations.     In 2011  Netflix  invested  nearly  100 million  dollar s in the first two seas ons of House  of Cards , which   was an adaptation  of a British  series  by the same  name.  (The  original  House  of Cards  was broadcast   on BBC in 1990.)   The new  version  of the House  of Cards  is produced  by David  Fincher  who  also directed  the first  episodes.   The investment  was a risky  one and it was based  on audience  data  Netflix  had been   gathering  from the 33 million  subscribers  it had at the time.  The data  showed  that the original  British   version  of House  of Cards  was very  popular  and that most  viewers  watched  director  David  Fincher’s   feature  film Social  Network  from  the beginning  to the end;  this showed  interest  and commitment   to Finche r’s work.  Lastly,  the data  showed  that films  starring  Kevin  Spacey  were  very  popular.  By  combining  these  findings , Netflix  ende d up producing  an extremely  successful  American  version  of  the House  of Cards .    Netflix  also chose  a data -driven  marketing  campaign  for the House  of Cards . The main  poster  image   was designed  by a machine  learning  system  and it replic ated  the style  and colo urs of earlier   successes,  such  as the film Macbeth . Promotional  trailers  were  also produced  with  the help  of data   analysis.  Season  five of the House  of Cards  had ten different  trailers,  each  targeted  at a specific   audience  segme nt. For the fans  of Kevin Spacey  the trailer  showed  him in action,  whereas  fans  of    11 https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/970954017/impossible -things -worlds -first-ai-co-written -featu   12 https://www.telerama.fr/series -tv/avec -black -mirror -bandersnatch, -cest-prouve, -netflix -vous -suit-bien -a-latrace,n6132462.php  
     11    Thelma  and Louise  were  shown  trailers  with  the female  characters,  such  as Robin  Wright  starring  as  Claire Underwood.     Netflix’s  competitor  Amazon  Studios  had a different  approach  to using  audience  data.  Amazon   produced  pilot  episodes  of several  series.  Based  on the audience  reaction , Amazon  decided  which   pilots  were  turned  into longer  series , thereby  the decision  rests  on the audience  acceptance  and  not Amazon  Studios  itself. In addition  to audi ence  comments,  each  pilot  is evaluated  on the  following  criteria:   • Moments  when  viewer  pauses  viewing .  • Scenes  which  are watched  more  than  once .  • Skipping  over scenes .  • Scenes  which  create  a specific  reaction .  • How  well is the casting  liked by viewers .    By comb ining  data  from  these  points  Amazon  concluded  that out of the pilot  episodes,  the audience   wanted  a situation  comedy  about  four  republican  US senators,  - and from  that,  the Alpha  House   series  pilot  went  into production.  The series  concept  relied  on audienc e data  and that gave  little   creative  freedom  to the talent  behind  it.    The comparison  between  Netflix  and Amazon  Studios  indicates  that while  the audience  data  is  important,  more  crucial  is the way it is used.   Amazon  decided  to produce  a series  which  was  statistically  tailored  to match  the tastes  and expectations  of the viewers,  whereas  Netflix  provided   the creators  data  and conclusio ns which  would  help  them  in guiding  creative  choices,  and,  most   importantly  it allowed  more  risk taking.  House  of Cards became  an emblem  of success,  while  Alpha   House  had a lukewarm  reception  from  the audience.13        Audio,  speech  and text    Before  TV series  and films,  AI has had an impact  in the music  industry.  It is used  to create   personal ized playlists  for online music  services,  such  as Spotify.    Today  the use of audio  has evolved  further  into voice -controlled  devices,  smart  speakers,  and  services.  Although  AI still is in early  stages,  first audio -based  consumer  products  and services  have   entered  the market.  Voice controlled  services,  such  as Alexa,  Siri and Google  Assistant  have   expanded  as the number  of smart  speakers  has gone up. The forecast  for the global  smart  speaker   base  will grow  82,4  % from  114 million  units  sold in 2018  to 207.9  million  units  sold in 2019.  The US  accounts  for over  40 % of the uptake  of smart  speakers.14    While  the audio  sector  is not the focus  of this study,  voice  AI cannot  be separated  from  it. Voice   control  technology  is emerging  as an important  user  interface  (UI)15 for people  to acce ss to series     13 https://pubosphere.fr/lecon_de_big_data_par_netflix/   14 Canalys,  https://www.canalys.com/newsroom/canalys -global -smart -speaker -installed -base -to-top-200-million -byend-of-2019   15 UI : The means b y which the user and a computer system interact, in particular the use o f input devices and  software.    
     12    and films  on various  devices.  Therefore,  voice  as a UI must  be consi dered  in the marketing  and  distribution  of series  and films.     In Europe,  intelligent  voice  services  are still used  mainly  by early  adopters,  but the role of audio  and  voice  recognition  will gain  momentum  as one of the important  media  sectors  to use AI. This may   pose  a challenge  for the small  language  areas  in Europe.  The market  will first serve  the large r  language  areas,  such as English,  French,  Spanish  and German . Likely  speakers  of Finnish  or Bulgarian,   for example,  will have  to wait  longer  to get voice -based  services  in their  native  tongues.  It is obvious   that the choice  of languages  in speech -based  services  has an impact  on the spee d of uptake  of new   user  interfaces  and even  entire  services  in small  language  countries.     One of the early  uses  of AI in television  content  has been  transcribing  spoken  language  into written   words.  An example  of this is an automated  subtitling  workflow  project with  the Belgian  Public   Broadcasting  Station  VRT.  In a project  called  STON,  the consortium  partners  built  a platform  to  automa te the subtitling  workflow  by means  of speech  and language  technology.  AI technologies   involved  aimed to answer  thes e questions:      • Speech  detection:  when  are they  speaking?    • Speaker  clustering:  who  speaks  when?    • Language  detection:  which  language  is being  spoken?    • Speech  recognizer:  what  is being  said?    • Synchronization  module  for the alignment  of the script16 on video    • Post processing  to stylize the subtitles  according  to the VRT standard      The focus  within  the STON -project  lies on the automat ed subtitling  of documentaries  and online   news  content,  but the results  of the project  are also valuable  for other  applications,  such  as the  automat ed annotation  of audio -visual  content.  17        Speech  to text is especially  important  among  public  broadcaster s who  often  are required  to serve   viewers  with  disabilities,  be they  hard  of hearing  or otherwise  impaired  and in need  of closed captioning,  or subtitles.     Naturally , all production  companies  benefit  from  being  able  to machine -produce  transcripts  from   spoken  words.  The user  interface  operation  by speech  (voice  control)  is an invaluable  addition   impr oving  accessibility  to all users .    Speech  recogni tion AI has been  trained  to write  down  even  punctuation  marks.  Speechmatics  Inc.’s   service  can deliver  accurate  placement  of full stops,  commas,  question  marks  and exclamation   marks.  The service,  Advanced  Punctuation,  has been  trained  on over  2.5 billion  words  using  other   neural  networks.  The languages  Advanced  Punctuation  covers  are: Global  English,  Spanish,  German   and French.18        16 Script:  scenario  (of a film,  a show),  including  the technical  breakdown  and dialogues   17 https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/metadata/rv3_ AME%20scenarios.pdf   18 RapidTv  news,  25.8.2019  
     13    Metadata     Metadata  means  a set of data  that describes  and gives  inform ation  about  other  data.  It is a central   element  of a content  management  strategy.  Adding  metadata  to content  does  not make  it  interesting  but makes  it useful  and provides  information  on data  usage,  preferences,  viewer   behaviour , etc. Metadata  is key in finding  and organi zing material  in digital  archives.  The European   Broadcasting  Union’s  (EBU) Principal  Project  Manager  Jean -Pierre  Evain  summarized  the problem   of knowing  what  is in the archives  and using  them  as an asset:  “If you don’t  find it, you don’t  have   it.”       The EBU is world’s  oldest  professional  broadcasting  organization  with  77 active  members.  It  operates  a Media  Cloud  and Microservice s Architecture  project.  Its purpose  is to minimize  the effort   required  to deploy,  adapt,  scale  and benefit  from  cloud -based  workflows  and AI-driven  services.   The project  aims  to address  both  the need  for tools  for business  purpose s and the ad-hoc, manual   use of AI-tools  in the use of text-to-speech,  captioning  and dubbing  applications . The metadata  can  also be applied  to material  administration:  transfer,  transform ation  and repository  management.   This is done  by using  classification  categories  to facilitate  discoverability  of the content.     Programmati c Advertising     Commerci al VOD -platforms ’ raison  d’être  is to turn  profit  from content  production  and distribution.   Monetiz ation  is achieved  in various  ways -the main  sources  of income  being  subscription  sales  and  advertising  revenue.  This is mainly  achieved  by prog rammatic  advertis ing, which  relies  heavily  on  AI, used  to deliver  advertisements  to target  audiences,  but at the same  time,  estimating  advertising   costs  and revenues  has become  complicated.  More  details  about  this field  are in Appendix  2.    1.2.2. Who  uses  Artificial  Intelligence      Independent  production  companies  have  very  limited  use of AI. Much  of the development  work  is  left for the public  service  companies,  - in addition  to the big corporations  whose  business   decisions  are based more  and more  on AI technology.     To analyse  AI users,  first we’ll take  a look  at the public  service  sector,  followed  by cases  from   Netflix  and YouTube.     Public  Service  Broadcasting  (PSB ) is faced  with  the need  to reinvent  itself  as new  video -on-demand   services  change  the media  market.  The main  challenges  for PSB are:    • Losing  young  audiences .  • (Public)  funding  is insufficient .  • Traditional , schedule -based  broadcasting  of TV channels  turns  into platform  management . This  brings  up the need  to understand  the business  of distribution:  where,  when  and how  viewers  find  content.  Broadcasters  are learning  about  multi -platform  distribution,  instead  of broadcasting  only   on a linear  TV channel .  • Understanding  audience  behaviour  and attention  driver s (motivational  factors ). 
     14    • Objectivity  of news  service,  trustworthiness .  • New  production  tools  and processes  create  new  working  cultures .    EBU representatives  claimed  at the International  Broadcasting  Conference  on 13.9.2019  that for  broadcasters  to stay relevant,  they  must  gain  access  to data  that social  media  companies  hold,   especially  for their  younger  audiences.      The EBU asked  regulato rs to get tougher  on the companies  known  as FAANG’s  (Facebook,  Amazon,   Apple,  Netflix,  Goog le) saying  that now  ”we have  an unregulated  social  media  sector,  dominated  by  four  or five big companies  that have  an unprecedented  amount  of control.”19    Many  European  public  broadcasting  services  have  experience  in adopting  AI tools  and services.   Broadcas ters’  online  platforms  have  been  treat ed as valuable  from  early  on and many  online   services  achieve  large  audiences.  Especially  Swedish  and Finnish  public  broadcasters  SVT and YLE  who  are noted  for their  success  in growing  their  young  online  audience s.    Aside  from  the EBU,  which  is an important  cooperati ve platform  for public  broadcasters,  other   alliances  are taking  place  among  the broadcasters.  One of the recent  ones  is the Associated  Press,   Al Jazeera  and the Irish  public  broadcaster  RTÉ joining  together  to collaborate  in creating  an AI  solution  to manage  their  on-air content.  They  use AI visual  analysis  in order  to carry  out fact  checking  on both  new  and archived  content  for both  regulatory  compliance  and editorial  value.  In  an era when  accuracy  is becoming  incre asingly  important  and demonstrating  bias or posting   inaccurate  information  can cause  both  reputational  and financial  damage,  broadcasters  are looking   for ways  to speedily  index  on-air content.20 Collaboration  takes  place  in Hollywood,  as well.  All the  major  studios  are involved  in joint  projects  to agree  on data  storage  specifications,  file formats  and  security  issues.      Yleisradio,  YLE, Finnish  Broadcasting  Company     The Finnish  public  broadcaster  has an extensive  history  in using  AI in recommendation21 engines,   robot  journalism  and many  other  applications.  Although  AI is widely  used,  a public  broadcaster  is  not motivated  by purely  commercial  considerations.  According  to YLE, they  focus  on the end user   experience.  The consumer  needs  to gain something,  and it needs  to align  with  the values  of YLE. YLE  experiments  with  many  AI uses,  but the system  needs  to be transparent  to the consumer.     Both  YLE and its Swedish  counterpart  Sverige’s  Television  (SVT)  are successful  in OTT22 competition.   Since  the 2010’s  YLE has been  migrating  towards  a comprehensive  online  offer.  By repositioning  its  distribution  strongly  online , YLE has been  able  to gain  an impressive  78 % reach.  Its own  Areena     19 The IBC Daily,  14.9.2019   20 The IBC Daily,  14.9.2019,  page  24  21 Recommendation  algorithm:  System  that seeks  to predict  the "rating"  or "preference"  a user  would  give to an item.   They  are primarily  used  in com mercial  applications.  The user  will be first confronted  to items  that the system   considers  as relevant  for the user  (and  in accordance  with  the service  provider  strategy).   22 OTT:  Over -The-Top : a term  used  to refer  to content  providers  that distribute  streaming  media  as a standalone   product  directly  to viewers  over  the Internet,  bypassing  telecommunications,  multic hannel  television,  and broadcast   television  platforms  that traditionally  act as a controller  or distributor  of such  content  (Examples  of OTT : Netflix,   Amazon  Video,  Hulu).

     15    platform  clearly  attracts  younger  viewers  (49 % were  15 to 44-year -olds).23 Part of this success  is  contributed  to the use of data -driven  AI.    Mr Jarno  Koponen,  Head  of AI and Personalization  at YLE described  the role of AI:  Distribution  business  is a relatively  new  area  for us. We need  to understan d distribution,  because  we  don’t  want  to externalize  it to a third  party.   AI is moderating  and summing  up audience  responses,  it is used  in chat  bots  and it is a content   recommendation  tool.  We do try to avoid  creating  “bubbles ”. We tested  an early  Netfli x algorithm   and it clearly  favoured  entertainment  and drama,  but not factual  or documentaries.  An objective   media  company  must  present  a many -sided  representation  of reality.  Journalistic  decisions  are  behind  all algorithm  devel opment  here.  Localization  algorithm s for example  can push  news  from   nearby.   AI must  support  the core  mission  of the company.”       Netflix      The subscription  video -on-demand  giant  was founded  in 1997  as a DVD  mail  order  company.  Since   then  it has grown  to be the world’s biggest  Over-The-Top (OTT)  operator,  covering  over  190  countries  and 139 million  subscribers.24 Netflix ’ influence  in the series  market  is very  important   and will be also addressed  and detailed  in part 2 of this report.     Netflix’s  challenge  is the large content  librar y, which  is constantly  changing  and is overwhelming  for  a user  to consume.  What  is the best  way to help  the user  to choose  from  the program  library  and  maximize  subscriber  loyalty?     Recommendation is one of the best -known features of Netfli x: users who wat ch A are likely to watch  B. Netflix follows consumer’s viewing choices and recommends similar programs, mainly based on  similar genres.   This could be analogous to how users who like  romantic comedies  could also like  parody or  satire  movies  because they bo th involve  laughing. Netflix also uses the view ing history of other users  with similar tastes to recommend to you what may be most i nteresting to watch next. This makes it  convenient for the user to narrow down the enormous choice s in the programming library. At the  same time, the diversity of the content offer is thusly reduced.     The recommendation  system  of Netflix  is based  on the following  criteria:   • Interaction  with  the service  (viewing  history  and rating  of the titles) .  • Selections  by other  people , whose  tastes  are similar  to yours .  • Title  information:  style,  genre,  categories,  actors,  release  year .  • Time  of the day you watch  content .  • Which  devices  you use to watch .  • How  long  you watch .    When  a viewer  creates  a profile,  Netflix  asks  the user  to choose  a few favourite  titles.  This phase  is  optional,  but these  choices  form  the basis for the recommendations.  If the user  selects  no titles,     23 https://www.meta -media.fr/2019/ 09/11/battre -netflix -cest-possible -la-tv-publique -finlandaise -la-fait.html   24 https://muchneeded.com/netflix -statistics/  
     16    Netflix  will randomly  recommend  some  of the most  popular  titles.  When  the subscriber  starts   watching,  these  new titles  will replace  the initial  preferences.     Each  user’s  homepage  has sections  in which  the algorithms  optimize  the offers.  AI chooses  the titles   to be recommended  and the most  recommended  titles  are on the top of each  row of the top titles,  starting  from the left to the right. Each  time  a user  makes  a selection,  this data  is input  into the  system  and it will influence  the next  titles  Netflix  recommends  for him or her.    The algorithms  are meant  to learn  and become  more  relevant  with  each  selection  the viewer  makes.   In addition  to the genre  and style  of a title,  Netflix  attempts  to characterize  each  title by action,   location,  protagonists’  personalities,  characters’  actions,  plot line,  atmosphere,  music  and so on.  These  points  form  an individual  digital  path, along  which  each  viewer  is guided  on. The logic  of this  path  might  work  like this:  people  who  enjoyed  conspiracies  of the House  of Cards  might  find  interesting  Bloodline , a series  where  family  members  must  deal  with  important  secrets.  Bloodline   has characters  with  a question able  moral  compass , so watching  it might  lead  the viewer  on to  Daredevil , which  is a Marvel  series  about  a blind  protagonist  battling  with  moral  dilemmas.25    When  people  are given  a chance  to watch  television  anytime,  without  the limitations  of a program   schedule,  they  often  watch  several  episodes  at one time.  Even  entire  seasons  are watched  in a  matter  of a few days.  This phenomenon  is called  binge  watching  and it increases  the viewer   engagement,  thereby  supporting  the goals  of video -on-demand  operators,  such  as Netflix.   The  goals  of Netflix’s  recommendation  system  are:  • Increase  and maintain  viewership  of minutes  consumed .  • Increase  the number  of titles  explored  and the frequency  of logging  back  in.  • Exceed  whichever  minimum  threshold  that Netflix  has determined  as a success  metric .  • Increase  in monthly  subscription  (acquisition),  loyalty  and a decrease  in cancellations  (churn) .      YouTube     YouTube has evolved into world’s main video platform from quite modest beginnings.  Back in 2005,  when YouTube first started out, it had a uniform homepage for all users. This meant that every  YouTube user would see the same homepage and the creat ors who were feature d there  would get  a huge boost in their viewership. Their selecti on was based on their subscriber count, views and  user engagement metrics e.g. likes, comments, shares etc. This inspired other users to become  creators and start c ontributing content. In 2006 YouTube was bought by Google. The company  policies and homepage  started evolvin g gradually.   As adverts started showing on YouTube videos, the scenario changed quite quickly. Also, with the  rapid rise in user numbers, Google sta rted to curate the homepage as per each user’s watch history,  subscriptions, and likes. This  was a good move  in principle since it helped the users to see what they  wanted to see. As a part of their next level innovation, a  machine learning  model was created to  recommend videos to use rs. The goal of this deep neural network -based  recommendation  engine  was to increase watch time of every video so that users stay longer on the platform .26    25 https://usbeketrica.com/article/netflix -devoile -comment -son-algorithme -vous -rend -accros   26 Source:  https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/30/16222850/youtube -google -brain -algorithm -video -recommendation personalized -feed  
     17    YouTube has used machine -learning techniques for years, with a great success. Instead of basing its  algorithmic recom mendations on how many people had clicked a video, YouTube  would instead  base them  on how long people had spent watching it.     Google Brain  is the parent company’s artificial intelligence division, which YouTube began using in  2015. Brain w asn’t YouTube’s first attempt at using AI; the company had applied machine -learning  techniques to recommendations before, using a Google -built system known  as Sibyl . Brain,  however, employs a technique known as unsupervised learning: its algorithms can find relationships  between different in puts that software engineers never would have guessed. For an example, a  Brain algorithm began recomm ending shorter v ideos for users of the mobile app, and longer videos  on YouTube’s TV app.      It guessed,  correctly,  that varying  video  length  by platform  would  result  in higher  watch  times.   YouTube  launched  190 changes  like this one in 2016  and is on pace  to release  300 more this year.   Integrating  Brain  has had an immense  impact:  more  than  70 percent  of the time  people  spend   watching  videos  on the site is now  driven  by YouTube’s  algorithmic  recommendations.  Each  day,   YouTube  recommends  200 million  different  videos  to users,  in 76 languages.  And the aggregate  time   people  spend  watching  videos  on YouTube’s  home  page  has grown  20 times  larger  than  what  it was  three  years  ago.27   In Appendix  4, we will examine  the offensive  content  filtering  policies  of YouTube .  1.2.3. Artificial  Intelligence  ethics     Ethics  as a philosophical  area  deals  with  the good  and bad in humans.  AI ethics  can be viewed  from   several  points:  data  protection,  freedom  of expression,  cultural  diversity,  productivity  and  economics,  social  justice,  individual’s  happiness,  human  autonomy  and uniqueness,  stability  of  society  and so on.  An ideal  way to apply  a dynamic  AI-impact  evaluation  is that certain  principles  are recognized   categorically  (AI must  not threaten  human  lives  or health  and not to invade privacy,  etc… ) and some   others  are activated  case  by case,  depending  on the use conte xt.    The trustworthiness  of AI is important  for all stakeholders.  The following  five areas  are especially   important  in creating  a responsible  AI. Every  AI user  should  take these  into consideration.  28    1. Fairness:  Are you minimizing  bias in your  data  and AI models?  (Bias  means  interference  in  the outcomes  of AI by predetermined  ideas,  prejudice  or influence  in a certain  direction.   Data  can be biased  but so can the people  who analyse  the data.  When  data  is biased,  we  mean  that the sample  is not representative  of the entire  population.)   2. Interpretability : Can you explain  how  an AI model  makes  decisions?  Can you ensure  those   decisions  are accurate?     27Source:  https://hub.packtpub.com/is -youtubes -ai-algorithm -evil/   28 http://explore.pwc.com/aipredictions2019/pw -c-2019 -artificial -2?eq=CT13 -PL1300-DM2 -CN_ai2019 -ai19 -exesum foot&utm_campaign=ai2019&utm_medium=org&utm_source=pwc_ai2019  
     18    3. Robustness  and security : Can you rely on an AI system’s  performance?  Are your  AI systems   vulnerable  to attack?   4. Governance : Who  is accountable  for AI systems?  Do you have  the proper  controls  in place?   5. System  ethics : Do your  AI systems  comply  with  data  privacy  regulations?  How  will they   impact  your employees  and customers?           An increasing  number  of companies  are overseeing  responsible  AI through  ethics  boards  or chief   ethics  officers  for technology,  with  AI as part of their  remit.  This encouraging  trend  is expected  to  acceler ate in the futur e. New  job roles  are created  that combine  technical  expertise  with  an  understanding  of regulatory,  ethical  and reputational  concerns.29      Several  studies  on the use and impact  of AI have  been  conducted  in Europe  this year.   The Institute   of Information  Law published  in March  2019  Implications  of AI-driven  tools  in the media  for freedom   of expression . It highlights  a number  of points  and the need for further  initiatives.  Among  them  is  the role of news  distribution,  development  of professional  algorithmic  ethics, importance  of value centric  design,  automated  filtering  and freedom  of expression.  The study  also refers  to the European   Convention  of Human  Rights  (ECHR).  Article  10 of ECHR  sets out the freedom  of expression  and  information:  Everyone  has the right  to freedom  of expression.  This right  shall  include  freedom  to  hold  opinions  and to receive  and impart  information  and ideas  without  interfer ence  by public   authority  and regardless  of frontiers.        The exercise  of these  freedoms,  since  it carries with  its duties and responsibilities,  may  be subject   to such  formalities,  conditions,  restrictions  or penalties  as are prescribed  by law and are necessary   in a democratic  society.  Article  10 signals  the need  to promote  AI driven  tools  in a way that is  compatible  with human  rights  and fundamental  freedoms.30    Council  of Europe  work  on Artificial  Intelligence  is summarized  in an information  document  and it  lists the past  and future  actions  of the Council  of Europe  in regards  of AI.31 Discussing  the added   value  of AI the document  recounts  the many  initiatives  already  taken.  A recent  study  listed  around   60 such  initiatives.  In general  terms  most  of these  are oriented  towards  indicative,  ethical  guidelines   and self-regulation.    They  include,  among   others:  the Ethics Guidelines  for Trustworthy  Artificial  Intelligence32 published   on 8 April  2019  by the independent  High -Level  Expert  Group  on AI, set up by the European   Commission;  the Recommendation  published  on 22 May  2019  by the OECD  Council  on Artific ial  Intelligence ; Ethically  Aligned  Design  published  by the IEEE  (Insti tute of Electrical  and Electronics   Engineers)  on 25 March  2019;  the human -centred  AI Principles  adopted  by the G20 on 9 June  2019;   the 2018  Montreal  Declaration  for a Responsible  Develo pment  of Artific ial Intelligence.     29 https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/ library/artificial -intelligence -predictions -2019.html   30 Implications  of AI-driven  tools  in the media  for freedom  of expression,  IViR,  page  3  31 Council  of Europe  work  on Artificial  Intelligence,  Information  Documents,  SG/Inf(2019)21   32 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/ethics -guidelines -trustworthy -ai 
     19    1.3. Impact  of Artificial  Intelligence     Key points  of AI impact  are:    AI use is rapidly  expanding  in media;  its commercial  motives  are clear,  but also public  stakeholders   are active  in developing  and using  AI.   • Distribution  is an integral  part of the new  business  models;  broadcasters  must  learn  the dynamics   of multi -platform  distribution  (using  audience  data,  publishing  sequence  and platforms,  reactive   scheduling,  etc.)    • The two main  AI uses  currently  are to guide  consumer  decis ion making  (recommendation)  and to  target  advertising .  • Adverse  effect s of AI are recognized;  concerns  especially  on data  protection,  on freedom  of  expression  and cultural  diversity  are expressed .  • Discussions  on regulatory  needs  are under  way.  • Ethics  of AI has a positive  reaction  in the interviews.  However,  ethical  rules  are complex  since   following  them  is voluntary.  Rules  are based  on autoregulation  and there  are no enforceable   penalties  for breaking  them.     AI solutions  rely on the amount  and accuracy  of data being  fed into them.  There  is no “intelligence”   in the systems  as such,  and there  is a risk trying  to use AI for purposes  it cannot  solve.  Another   challenge  for companies  using  AI is that it takes  a long  time  to feed  sufficient  data  into the system   and let AI to learn problem  solving.  Perfecting  algorithms  is a time -consuming  task.     AI has brought  new  opportunities  in the series  and cinema  sector  in a very  short  time.    Media  companies  now  have  new  possibilities  to better  serve  viewers  and expand  the service  and  business  side of media.  Companies  currently  use AI to help  with  strategic  decisions,  inventing  new   business  models  and creating  personalized  and data -drive n products  and services.     To benefit  the most  from  AI, media  companies  put the strategi c needs  as drivers of AI: the machine   language  models  used,  what  data  is collected  and processed,  what  types  of partnerships  are  needed,  etc. Personalization  is not provided  just because  it is interesting  technology,  but it needs  to  be linked  to a business  problem  and compared  with  other  priorities  of the company.     1.3.2. Impact  on Production     AI has many  interesting  areas  in production  that it adds  value  to. While  it is hard  to recognize  specific   break throughs,  this study  shows  that AI use in content  production  is on the rise.  AI has been  around   for a long  time but only  recently  has AI been  applied  for production  use. Many  producers  and  broadcasters  are experimenting  with  AI in early  deployments,  pilots  and demos .     Futurists  dream  about  a movie  entirely  written  by a machine.  We already  have  created  music   composed  by AI in the style  of Johann  Sebastian  Bach  which  was passed  off as the genuine  thing.   The same  is slowly  taking  place  in video  production  as well.  There  have been  early  tests  of AI-created  
     20    video  content,  for example , virtual  news  anchors.33  However,  behind  every  success  is the ”human   factor”  and it is very  difficult  to predict  the commercial  success  of any creative  work.  34    The use of AI in production  is a high  priority  in broadcasting  communities  and working  groups  have   been  formed  around  AI to disperse  information  and practices  on AI usage.  For example,  the EBU has  five strategic  AI-programs  which  are:          1. Pre-production   2. Production   3. Infrastructure,  cloud,  IP netw orks,  media  cybersecurity   4. Distribution,  platforms   5. Spectrum,  frequency     The exchange  of information  and sharing  experiences  among  EBU members  is considered   important.  Many  of the joint  projects  have  been  on speech -to-text, includ ing tests  on facial  recognition  and improvements  on the use of metadata.       Examples  of AI in pre-production     AI is used  in many  phases  of content  production.  Predicting  the future  success  of video  has been   attempted.  If we can measure  the financial  gain  and critical  reception  of a film or series,  why not  apply  the resulting  data  to predict  success  based  on define d variables,  such  as: celebrity  status  of  the cast,  genre,  budget,  length,  key plot events,  etc.?      Some  companies  offer  AI technology  as a “wise  producer”  and license  historical  data  about  movie   performances  over  the years.  The data  is then  cross -referen ced with  information  about  a film’s  genre,  theme  and key talent.  Machine  learning  is used  to find out hidden  patterns  in the data.    Some  software  lets users  play with  their  movie  script,  inputting  a cast,  then  swapping  one actor  for  another  to see how  this affects  a film’s  projected  box office  revenue.     Los Angeles -based  start -up Cinelytic  is one of the many  companies  promising  that AI will be a wise   prod ucer.  It licenses  historical  data  about  movie  performances  over  the years,  then  cross -references   it with  information  about  a film’s themes  and key talent,  using  machine  learning  to find out hidden   patterns  in the data.  Its software  lets customers  input  a cast,  then  swap  one actor  for another  to  see how  this affects  a film’s  projected  box office.     33 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/nov/09/worlds -first-ai-news -anchor -unveiled -in-china   34 The novelty,  or ”newness”  of a film was analyzed  in 2013 study  (Quantitative  analysis  of the evolution  of novelty  in  cinema  through  crowdsourced  keywords,  https://www.nature.com/articles/srep02758 )  on analyzing  crowd  sourced   key words  on Internet  Movie  Database  (IMDb).  The study  shows  the novelty  of a show  (female  nudity,  martial  arts)   mean s higher  box office  returns,  but only  up to a point.  We are put off by the banal,  but also hate  the radically   unfamiliar.  The very  best  films  sit in the narrow  sweet  spot  between  ’new’  and ’not too new’.  Source  Hannah  Fry,  Hello  World,  p.216,  Penguin  Random  House  UK, 2018   Another  study  from  2005  used  neural  network  trying  to predict  the performance  of films  before  their  cinema  release.   They  study  categorized  films  into nine  categories  but failed  to yield  any positive  predictive  results.   https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417405001399  
     21    Say you have a summer blockbuster in the works with Emma Watson in the lead role. You could use  Cinelytic’s software to see how changing her f or Jennifer La wrence might change the film’s box  office performance.   Cinelytic isn’t the only company hoping to ap ply AI to the business of film. In recent years, a number  of firms ha ve sprung up promising similar insights. Belgium’s ScriptBook, founded i n 2015, claims its  algorithms can predict a movie’s success just by analysing  its script. Israeli startup Vault, founded  the same year, promises clients that it can predict which demographics will watch their films by  tracking (among other thin gs) how its tr ailers are received online. Another company called Pilot  offers similar analyses, promising it can forecast box office revenues up to 18 months before a film’s  launch with “ unrivalled  accuracy.”35    The actual  use of AI in content  prod uction  is still quite  rare.  Some  of the production  areas  where   early  signs  of AI use can be detected,  are reviewed  in Appendix  5:  - Script  evaluation  and predictive  AI.   - Location  scouting .  - Production  budgeting .   - Production  planning .  - Production  hardware .    Examples  of AI in post -production      Post -production  means  editing  the raw material,  finalizing  video  (colour  correction,  special  effects,   on-screen  graphics)  and mixing  audio.  The best -known  AI element  of post -production  is the special   effects.  Special  effects  and com puter -generated  imaging  have  been  around  for a long  time,  but the  use of AI can streamline  the process  of creating  digital  sets,  effects,  even  entire  characters.   Computer  generated  imaging  has introduced  audio -visual  media  to endless  possibil ities of  manip ulating  both  picture  and sound.  AI is complementing  post -production  also with  material   management,  rushes  and adding  metadata  to all material  produced.  AI address es specific  points  on  content  tailoring,  moderating  and tagging  material.  AI mak es it easier  to compile  different  kinds  of  content  from  the same  original  material.     Movie  editing  can use historical  data  to see where  quality  control  checks  have  failed  in the past,  for  example , in syncing  the sound  with  movements.  AI can help  to repla ce manual  chec ks in what   otherwise  could  be a very  time -consuming  and laborious  process.      Post -production  has already  been  impacted  by video  intelligence  applications.  This means  that  based  on pre-trained  models,  AI can automatically  classify  and organiz e video  conten t, detect   brands  and logos,  blur explicit  content , extract  material,  and transcribe  and translate  it. As a result,   image  recognition  becomes  a part of the post -production  process.  For example,  an editor  can ask  AI to point  out all scenes  with a blue  car, or a certain  actor.  This will make  post -production  work   faster  and more  accurate.         35 https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18637135/hollywood -ai-film-decision -script -analysis -data -machine -learning    
     22    1.3.2.  Impact  on Distribution:  Filter  Bubbles       The most  visible  and the best -known  use of AI are recommendation  engines.  This means  that  personalization  algorithms  store  and analyse  what  individual  content  consumers  are watching.   Based  on the program  choices,  viewers  are recommended  similar  content,  which  usually  is based   on content  genre;  romance,  thriller,  etc. In the core  of recommendations  are also preferences  of  others  with  similar  profile s, or their  behaviour .    This creates  a bubble,  also called  an echo  chamber.  The viewer  has no surprise  offering  because  a  loop  of recommendation  is based  on previous  choices.   It is more  of the same,  and there  is little  content  diversity  offered  to the viewer.  Some  broadcasters  are aware  of this and they  provide   additional  content  recommendations  aside  from  algorithms.  For example,  a random  news  topic  will  be inserted  by human  editorial  decision s into the news  stream  recommended  by AI. It also is  noteworthy  that creating  too narrow  bubbles  or isolating  the viewer  from  a wider  selection  of  content  is not a commercial  interest  either.  Media  isolation  has been  recognized  as a threat  for  content  diver sity. It can be argued  that media  literacy  is a tool to combat  the lack of diversity  and  viewpoints.  Isolation  leads  to ignorance,  so educating  audiences  from  early  on is considered   important.     Controlling  filter  bubbles  is a complicated  task as can be seen in the case  of the Filter  Bubble   Transparency  Act (FBTA).  The US senate  has introduced  a bill in early  November  2019  which  aims   to counter  digital  filter  bubbles  by letting  people  to opt out of those  echo  chambers.  According  to  the bill, large  com panies  would  have to notify  users  if they’re  delivering  content  — like search   results  or a news  feed  — based  on personal  information  that the user  didn’t  explicitly  provide.  That   could  include  a user’s  search  history,  their  location,  or information  about  their device.  Sites would   also need  to let users  turn  off this personalization,  although  the rules  don’t  apply  to “user -supplied”   data  like search  terms,  saved  preferences,  or an explicitly  entered  geographical  location.     The FBTA  doesn’t  make  platforms  explain exactly  how their  algorithms  work.  It doesn’t  prevent   them  from  using  arcane  and manipulative  rules,  as long  as those  rules  aren’t  built  around  certain   kinds  of personal  data.  And removing  or disclosing  a few factors  in an algorithm  doesn’t  make  the  overall  algorit hm transparent.  This bill isn’t  aimed  at systems  using  hidden  algorithms,  or so called   “black  box”  algorithms.   Despite  this,  the bill fights  “secret  algorithms”  rather  than  micro -targeting   or invasive  data  mining.36    Viewers  have  started  to criticize  ultra -personalization  and the lack of diversity  brought  about  by  algorithms.  This has resulted  in some  OTT operators  adding  a human  touch  to the  recommendations:  Netflix  introduced  in August  2019  a test functionality  called  Collections.   Collection s regroup s content under  characterizations  such  as  ”just  for laughs”  and the content  is  pooled  together  by humans.  According  to Netflix,  Collections  is only  available  on iOS, and being  a  test,  it is not availabl e for all users.     In summer  2019 , HBO  launch ed in the US a new  website  called  Recommended  by Humans.     36 https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20943634/senate -filter -bubble -transparency -act-algorithm -personalization targeting -bill   
     23    It provides  video  suggestions  and fan tweets  to recommend  different  series  or documentaries  that  people  should  watch.  There  are 50 free episodes,  movies,  and documentaries  available  on the site,  whic h makes  the site a marketing  tool designed  to give potential  customers  a taste  of HBO  shows   in order  to get them  to sign up.    A major  distribution  challenge  is audience  churn,  meaning  customers  leaving  a service.  Reducing   churn  is a central  goal  of audienc e data  collect ion. Personalization  tools  are used  to foresee  the  action  points  which  imply  that a viewer  is about  to discontinue  the service.                                                                                  
     24             Independent content producers:  social media hacking via algorithms — Case Norsemen     The extensive use of recommendation algorithms hasn ’t happened without reaction from   independent stakeholders. There has been a lot of talk about ” hacking YouTube algorithms ”  but essentially , it is a  question of maximizing the visibility of the (video ) content . The same, but  in a more refined way , applies to this example on the TV series, The Norsemen.     YouTubers who upload video content on this global social platform vary from first time video  jockeys to big corporations. Both have the same goal: to get as much exposure as possible.  Both need to find out what are the key indicators, according to which YouTube r evaluates the  value of the content.   There are several key criteria in categoriz ing video content of YouTube. The length of the  video, its genre is important but so are the timing of re lease, frequency of new releases, and all  the social media characteristics such as likes, sharing options and other viewer engagement  actions. Sea rch Engine Optimization (SEO) also is crucial in the marketing of a video by offering  large amounts of keyword s for the video to appear in as many searches as possible. There are  many sites offering advice  on how to best use the presumed YouTube algo rithms. Some of  those suggestions are general observations -  what works in the online publishing environment  and standardized recommendations .  Others are more in -depth tips on how to upgrade the ”  algorithmic visibility ” of a video.   If too many people  are using, or manipulating the same algorithmic key points, will it distort  the outcomes in any way? Is it a good thing that content publishers learn to use new means  available in marketing their content? Reaching the right audience seems to remain a cent ral  challenge in the YouTube economy in the days to come.     Independent producers can become slaves to the algo rithms. With the amount of content  available , it is extremely difficult  to get attention at the launch of a series. A good example of  proactive marketing is the Norwegian Anders Tangen, who sold his Viking -comedy , Norsemen ,  to Netflix in 2017. For  Netflix, Norsemen seemed like a perfect counterbalance to the  gloominess of HBO’s Game of Thrones.   Anders Tangen took initiative and planne d a de tailed social media campaign, focusing on major  US cities: LA, New York, Miami and Chicago, with additiona l pushes in states with a large  Norwegian descendent population s. Each separate target group got their own tailored  Facebook campaign.   In less th an a month, Norsemen marketing reached 5.5 million Facebook users and generated  two million views. Netflix's a lgorithm had started to kick in. Fans who had become aware of  the show through Tangen's campaign began recommending it to their friends. Norsemen  started appearing on Netflix's recommendation carousel. Tangen invested a further $15,000 to  promote the show on Facebook worldwide, using what he had learned during the in itial U.S.  campaign.             When  Norsemen  came  up for a season  two renewal,  Netflix  upped  its commitment,  making  the  show  a "Netflix  Original,"  meaning  more  in-house  marketing.  Season  3 is current ly in production   and will go out on Netflix  worldwide  in 2020.     The Norsemen  is an example  of the producer ’s drastically  expanded  tool kit. Not only  does a  producer  need  to know  how  to create  and manage  a globally  successful  product,  but expertise  
     25    1.3.3. Impact  on Consumers     Data  issues  are in the centre  of the impact  of AI on individual  content  users.  From  a consumer   point  of view,  AI usage  on different  platforms  should  meet  the following  criteria:   • Use of data  only  by the original  request  maker  (data  is not given  out to third  parties) .  • Informing  what the data  is used  for and how  long  is it stored .  • Consumers’  access  to data  and the ability  to change  it or take  it out.  • Explanation  on how  data  must  be different  in order  to change  a decision  made  by AI  (How  to change   viewer  profile s in order  to avoid  certain  content  recommen dations) .  • AI service  providers  must  follow  regulations  on data  privacy .    A technical  consideration  of AI is that platforms  operate  in the cloud,  where  enforceable   international  regulation s are  almost  non-existe nt. In practice,  it is difficult  to define  where  certain   information  is located - it can also be stored  in several  different  locations.     In addition  to the media  industry , AI has had other  effects  on consumers  on a larger  societal  scale,   such  as the change  of work  life. AI replaces  human  workl oads and thereby  creates  unemployment   as well as new  work  opportunities.  These  consequences  have  an ethical  side (enough  income  for all)  and a political  one (shortening  the working  hours).     1.4. Future  of Artificial  Intelligence , New  Services  and Business  Model s    To describe  the future  of AI, we see two paths  of deve lopment.      The first one we have  been  witnessing  for some  time,  is the organic  and commercially  driven  path:   AI is used  for whatever  purpose  makes  strategic,  business  (or political)  sense.      The other  path  is the way of regulation.  Under  the commercial  realities  of AI, we have  started  to see  the need  for regulation  and rules.  But can rules  be applied  to the practicalities  of AI use today?     Many  businesses  are already  using  AI to improve  operations  and enhance  the customer  experience,   but AI implementati ons are still in early  stages  and AI continues  to be a learning  proce ss for all.  Looking  into the future  of AI, the following  challenges  are identified:       • Lack  of uniform  ethical  code;  nobody  is in charge.  EU and national  authorities  address  multiple   levels of AI issues,  including  AI’s impact  on data  protection,  access  to information  and cultural   diversity,  but a set of actions  are missing.     • Commercial  deployments  of AI are taking  place,  industry  standards  are set “on the fly” and  companies  will not necessarily  adhere  to ethical  standards.   • Global  competition  is intense,  and most  AI tools  and platforms  in use are not owned  by Europeans.   • AI should  follow  the same  rules  as any other  part of society:  human  rights  and freedom  of  information.     The current  thre e top uses  of AI in media  are: 1. Company  management,  2. Content  prod uction  and  3. Content  publishing  and distribution.  Media  companies  often  externalize  AI work , and this seems  
     26    to be the state  of things in the future  as well.  Over  40 % of the respondents  in a recent  International   Trade  Association  for Broadcast  & Media  Technologies’  study37 said they  rely on cloud  service   providers  for AI capabilities.  Over  30 % responded  that they  use a specialist  AI platform,  and the  rest leverage  specific  AI functionalit ies in solutions  of the vendors  and other  service  providers.38    At the moment,  the greatest  gains  from  AI come  from  productivity  gains  and enhancements,  as  businesses  use AI to automate  processes  and help  employees  make  better  decisions.  But the  majority  of AI’s economic  impact  will come  from  the consumption  side,  thro ugh higher -quality,   more  personalized  and more  data -driven  products  and services.  This is clearly  exemplified  in the  recommendation  systems of video  on-demand  operators,  such  as Netflix.     AI is based  on machine  learning,  which  in turn,  depends  on data  input - the amount  and quality  of  data.  The two footholds  of AI in the future  are better  and faster  learning  technologies  and control   of data. The deep  learning  in neural  networks  will resemble  more of human  reasoning.  New   applications,  such  as machine  vision and image  recognition,  when  combined  with  the faster  learning   machines,  will produce  new  tools  with  a wide  range  of uses.  In the media  context,  they  can help  in  tagging  metadata  onto  archives  and bringing  them  back  to use. However,  the same  technologie s  can be also used  for detailed  surveillance  of people.  There  obviously  is a need  to closely  follow  the  current  and future  uses  of AI and take appropriate  measures  to prevent  unjust  use, when  need ed.  Another  AI growth  area  in series  and films  is the measur ement  activity.  There  are early  pilots  of AI  used  in measuring  people’s  moods  by sensors  detecting  heartbeat,  sweating,  breathing,  etc.  Matching  content  offer  based  on viewer’s  mood s is still in early  experimental  stages,  but it brings   content  recommendation  to a new  level.    Today,  the challenge  is to get user  figures.  With the rapid  growth  of new  content  distribution   platforms  and the high levels  of consumer  fragmentation,  the old measurement  services  in the  industry  are falling  behind  everywhere.  It becomes  more  difficult  to know  who  is consuming  what   and when.    The solution  to the industry's  difficulty  in navigating  cross -platform  fragmentation  is through   measuring  global  content  demand.  Demand  for content  is what  drives  consumption  on all platforms   — linear  and OTT alike.  Pooling  the user  information  together  on several  different  service  platforms   has been  challenging.  New  commercial  services,  such  as Parrot  Analytics  propose  to solve  the  problem.    Consumers  express  their  demand  for content  through  multiple  "demand  expression  platforms”.   They  include  video  streaming,  social  media,  photo  sharing,  blogging  and micro -blogging  platforms,   fan and critic  rating  platforms,  peer -to-peer  protocols  and file sharing  platforms.  Parrot  Analytics   captures  the expressions  of demand  from  these  sources  and combines  them.  they  use  AI to  combine  a single  weighted  measure  of demand  called Demand  Expressions.  Business  models  need   business  information  and pooling  expressions  together  with  demand  is important  for programmatic   and targeted  advertising.39       37 https://www.theiabm.org/ibc -2019/   38 IAMB  Head  of Insights  and Analysis  Mr Lorenzo  Zanni  at ICB session  The AI/ML  Effect  on 16.9.2019   39 https://www.parrotanalytics.com/insights/  
     27    Publicly  funded  broadcasters  have  little  need  for business  models,  but they need  a sufficient   audience  share  to justify  their  fund ing. In the competition  for audience , non-profit  broadcasters  are  forced  to uptake  various  AI applications  in order  to stay relevant.     It is likely  AI ecosystem s will polarize  many : the big corp orations  will get bigger  and there  is a  growing  number  of small  players.  New  companies  will enter  the ecosystem,  mainly  from  the coding   and technical  side,  and various  new  service  and solution  providers  will also enter  the market.     Aside  from  direct  busine ss implications,  AI demands  are felt in the work place. Most  media   companies  have  gone  through  drastic  changes  during  the last decade  in their  work force,  in numbers   and needs  for capabilities.  Lay-offs and organizational  restructuring s have  been  commonplace,  and  many  work  tasks  have  changed.     Accordin g to PriceWaterhouseCoopers , training  non-AI professionals  to work  with  AI has become  a  crucial  part of workforce  strategy.  Programming  AI is becoming  easier  and new  tools , including   automated  machin e learning,  are becoming  available.  This process  streamli nes and automates   creating  AI models.  But user -friendly  AI is still complex.  Even  with  basic  training,  people,  who   sometimes  are in charge  of the company’s  AI strategy,  may  not fully  understand  diffe rent  AI  algorithm ’s parameters  and performance  levels.  As a result,  the wrong  algor ithms  could  be applied,   with  unintended  results.40     It is estimated  that AI will contribute  15.7  trillion  USD  to the global  economy  by 2030,  driven   primarily  by productivit y gain  and AI-fuelled  product  innovation s.41 The media  sector’s  main  use of  AI most  likely  will continue  to be focused  on consumer  analysis  and content  production  for many   years  to come.     40 http://explore.pwc.com/aipredictions2019/pw -c-2019 -artificial -2?eq=CT13 -PL13 00-DM2 -CN_ai2019 -ai19 -exesum foot&utm_campaign=ai2019&utm_medium=org&utm_source=pwc_ai2019   41 http://explore.pwc.com/aipredictions2019/fast -company -pwc-AI-wont -take -your -job?eq=CT13 -PL1300 -DM2 CN_ai2019 -ai19 -exesum -foot&utm_campaign=ai2019&utm_medium=org&utm_source=pwc_ai2019  
     28    Key Findings of Chapter 1   Digitalization  has transformed  the TV and film industries  with  increasing  speed  during  the past  decade.  The production,  distribution  and consumption  of audio -visual  content  has also been   affected  by the increasing  adoption  of Artificial  Intelligence  (AI).    AI is already  in wide  use in various  business  areas  and other  functions  of society.  The use of AI in  media  is especially  important  as it challenges  some  of the commonly  shared  values,  such  as freedom   of expression,  access  to information,  cultural  diversity  and data  privacy.      Some  of these  threats  can be identified  because  of the use of AI.  For example , personalized  content   recommendations  can contribute  to the narrowing  of content  offered,  because  recommendations   are based  on a viewer’s  previous  viewing  choices  or viewing  patterns  of others  with  similar  viewing   behaviour.     Another  very  common  use of AI also involves  personalization,  but instead  of program   recommendations,  personalization  is used  for targeted  advertising.  As more  and more  personal  data   is gathered  by AI, the more  targeted  advertising  will become.  Media  industries  in general  are mov ing  away  from  mass  audiences  into smaller,  and more  specialized  and perhaps  engaged  audiences.   Furthermore,  there  is an increasing  competition  in Europe  on collecting  consu mers  data,  and US  digital  companies  are taking  the lead.   This may  in turn  have  a deleterious  effect  on the issues  of  personal  data  protection.     This report  studies  the impact  of AI on various  levels  of production,  distribution  and consumption   of series  and films.  There  are early  signs of AI adoption  in production.  Many  companies  already  use  the AI-enabled  tagging  of metadata  to more  effectively  index and identify  their  content,  thus   maximizing  the use of their  digital  archives.  AI applications  utilizing  voice  recognition  are also  appearing  as the numbers  of voice -controlled  smart  speakers  and other  media  terminals  are rising.   AI can also be used  for original  content  creation.  The first robot -generated  news  clips  have  now   appeared,  and there  have  even  been  fully  computer -generated  new s anchors  on the air. However,   these  are still trials  and therefore,  have  not had any significant  impact  on the media  industry  yet.    Program  distribution  and content  recommendations  remain  the main  AI uses  today.  Personalization   can be a valuable  feature  for consumers  in finding  content  relevant  to them.  The study points  out  that it also can be beneficial  to both  consumer s and advertisers  not to have  people  exposed  to nonrelevant  advertising.      For now,  the main  development  and uptake  of AI takes  place  amo ng the large  media  companies.   Smaller  companies  typically  are solution  providers  focusing  on single  products  or functi onalities.   The push  for AI among  commercial  media  companies  is done  to increase  viewership  and loyalty  and  to maximize  revenues.  Public  sector companies  are more  focused  on user  experience  and the  transparency  of the AI. There  is also a need  for sharing  information  and experiences  about  AI among   professional  organizations  such  as the European  Broadcasting  Union.     As highlighted  in several  interviews  and background  materials  for this study,  the concerns  of fair AI  use are evident.  However,  enforcing  rules  or regulations  directed  toward  the AI itself  is challenging,   if nothing  else,  for technical  reasons.  AI uses  proprietary  algorithms  which  are the core  of the AI  system.  This code  is highly  confiden tial and also has intellectual  property  rights.  Advanced  neur al  nets  use AI in a way,  which  can make  it impossible  to open  up the logic  of the machine  learning  
     29    process.  This is the “black  box”  probl em in which  even  some  developers  don’t  know  why the AI  system  “learned”  what  it learned.     In the absence  of internation al or European  AI regulations,  this study  raised  the importance  of AI  ethics  being  applied  much  more  globally.  While  many  companies  alrea dy are imposing  auto regulation  of AI, there  is a need  for general  European  wide  guidelines  to ensure  the trustworthine ss  of AI. Numerous  AI ethics  related  studies  and codes  of conduct  already  exist.  One key finding  was  that there  is a desire  among  the various entities  using  AI for a European -wide  guidance  gathe ring  generally  accepted  rules  on AI ethics.                                                                            
     30    2. The growing series  market     2.1. A new market context paving the road to series     2.1.1.  New Convergent usage   TV usage  has dramatically  changed  in a few years.  With  the increase  of broadband  access,  the high   penetration  of connected  devices  (TVs  and phones)  and the arrival  of new  video  offers  like the  SVOD70 (Subscription -Video -On-Demand)  platforms  provided  by new  entrants  like Netflix  or  Amazon,  video  is consumed  anytime,  and anywhere.  The video  market  now  goes far beyond  the TV  market  and embraces  all kind  of usage : linear  TV, non-linear71 SVOD,  free streaming,  personal   content… etc.   In this global  video  market,  overall  TV viewing  remains  stable  while  SVOD  grows  (from  5% to 9%  between  2016  and 2018)  at the expense  of broadcast  viewing  (79%  to 74%,  still at 3 hours  45  minutes  per day on average72), fortunately  TV players  are also developing  their   own  non-linear   usage  (“catch  up” or “replay”  services  : 4%).  Series  are particularly  watched  in a non-linear mode ,  boosting  the overall  series  audience  by 13%  in France  and up to 46%  in the UK73.   There  is a disparity  between  the countries  reflecting  the broadband  penetration  and their    associated  new  services.  For instance,  the split  of TV viewing  versus  SVOD  viewing  is 56%/23% in  Denmark  where as TV viewing  is still predominant  in Poland  (91%)74.

     31    There  is also a disparity  between  the generatio ns with  SVOD  initially  driven  by the youngest  viewers   and now  driven  in Western  Europe  by the 55-64 demographic , the core  of TV audience.  The OTT  platforms  address  in particular  these  differences  of content  demand  thanks  to their   reco mmendation  engines  as detailed  in Part 1 of this report  and also with  adapted  content  sourcing.    With  the production  of period  drama  pieces  like “The Crown ” or the increasing  commissioning  of  documentaries,  Netflix , for instance,  addresses  and skews  more  for its elder  demographic  users.     2.1.2.  New players accele rating convergence and content production     The new  non-linear  and online  usages have  been  addressed  by new  entrants  and their  SVOD   services,  competing  therefore  against  European  Pay-TVs:  43%  of European  Internet  users  subscribe   now  both  to Pay TV and SVOD.   Even  if incumbent  Pay TV revenues  still represent  30%  of the TV  market  and SVOD  new  services  only  5%, these  service s are growing  fast and are expected  to reach   25%  of Pay TV revenues  by 2023  and almost  half of the subscriptions  (SVOD  has a lower  Average   Revenue  Per User than  Pay TV : 6,7€/month  versus  20,4)75. “Cord  cutting”  (cancelling  a subscription   to a Pay TV service)  is expected  in Europe  like it has happen ed in the US.      i.e. Netf lix usage  growth:  from  5% to 45%  of series  viewing  share  in France  in 5 years  on the 1,3M   community  of BetaSeries  fans  of series  (source  BetaSeries,  September  2019)     These  new  players  have  been  initially  US tech  companies  (“FAANGs ”) but the competition  they have   created  in their  domestic  markets  has given  birth  to new  services  developed  for by US media  groups   with  international  sales  strategies  (Disney+,  the recently  announced  Peacock  AVOD76 (advertising based  Video On Demand)  service  from  NBCUniversal,  Viac om’s  BET+).       75 Trends  on the EU VOD  Market, European  Audiovisual  Observatory,  September  2019  76 Advertising  Video  On Demand.

     32    Notwithstanding  the already  existing  US Pay TV services  now  accelerating  their  OTT and  international  offers  (i.e. HBO  combined  with  Warner  for an “HBO  Max ” service  or AMC).  The  diagram  on page  26 presents  these  US players  and their  parent   companies  and a benchmark  to the  UK players  thus  dem onstrating  the important  gap of valorisation  between  them.     Despite  the growing  number  of SVOD  players  (220  services  in Europe  at the end of 2018),  the  duopoly  Netflix  / Amazon  represent  74%  of the SVOD  European  revenues  with  Disney  expected  to  join soon  the third  position77.   Most  of them  are described  as “OTT players ” as they  do not own  the Internet  technical   infrastructure , they  also don’t  sell access , but they  are start ing to have  distribut ion agreements  with   telecommunication  operators  (“telcos ”) and other  distributors  as they  become  “must  have”  services   and as such,  also need  extended  distribution,  hence  the mutual  interest.    In parallel,  free-TV station s see a progressive  migration  of their audiences  to these  OTT players  and  are now  start ing to react  by offering  content  and other  offers  targeting  younger  audiences  and their   core  audiences  who  are choosing  to go online.      In this dynamic  environment  with  corresponding   new  demand s, new  offers  from  both  new  entrants   and incumbent  players , competition  is intense.  User  experience  and pricing  are key elements  of the  marketing  mix, but content  is used  as the main  differentiator  to recruit  and retain  customers , and  many  audio -visual  professionals  interviewed  state d that series  is the main  category  sustaining  most   of the market  growth.    With  Netflix  and Amazon  spending  12,5$bn  in 2018  (from  “only”  2,8$bn  in 2014)  and planning  to  significantly  increa se their  efforts  with  other  players  like Disney  or Apple,  European  broadcasters   have  to reinvent  their  production  strategies  with in an important , but flat and   segmented  content  budget  for the last 10 years  (24,8$bn)  78.      77 Digital  TV Research  estimates , Septembe r 19  78 Ampere  Analysis’  presentations  at Series  Series,  July 19

     34    2.2. Towards a new series  segment   2.2.1.  Definition     An audio -visual  series is a set or sequence of related programs. In this study, the word “ series ” will  refer to live action drama series , meaning fictional series , in which live actors are playing and lasting  at least a minimum of 20 min utes  per episode. As many series  are not provided uniquely by “TVs”  (broadcasters), we will not use the term TV series in this report as it would be too restrictive .  Anim ation series or short format  series are also not included in this report  as this format is produced  differently, and partially has other needs and receive s other kind s of support .     Why have series become so important?   Series  have  exist ed almost  as long  as TV has exist ed. If they  were  primarily  used  by private   broadcasters  to create  loyalty,  maximize  audiences  and therefore , sell more  advertising .  A Pay TV  entity , HBO,  has started  in the 90’s to use series  as an exclusive  differentiator  and invested  in a new   high  qualit y and costly  category  of series  for demanding  clients  (“The Wire ”, “Six Feet  Under ” and  today  “Games  of Throne ”, “Chernobyl ” or “Little  big Lies”), attracting  more  and more  high  profile   talent  and proposi ng edgy  and innovative  stories  which  creat es buzz  and more  subscriptions .     Progressively,  their  production  process  has been  optimized  to deliver  high  quality  content  to appeal   to the US but also in the territories  where  HBO  was expanding.  The writing has been  put front  and  centre  in the process  with  a generation  of “showrunners”  creating  more  and more  series  also for  HBO  competitors,  such  as SVOD  platforms  looking  for “product s” to enable  the recruitment  and  retention  customers  efficien tly.    Traditional  domestic  fiction  on European  local  televisions  was initially  not considered  high -profile   series  but they  have  start ed to react  and produce  or purchase  similar  high  qualita tive content  for  their  Pay TV units , but also for their  free stations  suffering  from  decreasing  viewership . A new   segment  has now been  born:  the “international”  series,  with  potential  for local  audience s but also  capable  of gener ating interest  and … sales  abroad.  This is the segment  covered  by this report.  They   are in some  cases  categorized  as “high  concept  series ”, or “drama  fictions ” which  sometimes   restric ts the genres.  We will use the term  “series ” to cover  them  all.     2.2.2.  Main Figures   Series  is the growing  investment  from  commissioners,  from  both  OTT platforms,  Pay TV and Free   TV.   • Worldwide  expenses  in content  (sport s excluded)  have  increased  of 29%  between  2013  and  2018  (123€bn  spent  in 2018 ) 79. In the fiction  portfolio  of formats  diffused  throughout   Europe  (TV unitary  or two episodes  films,  soaps,  telenovelas,  series),  the growing  format   with  international  potenti al and marketed  by OTT players  or by TVs competing  with  OTT  players  is the series  format,  (mostly  series  of 3-13 episodes),  with  54%  being  new  projects  in  2018/1980. In the US only,  495 new  series  were  released  in 2018  versus  210 in 2009.       79 Ampere  Analysis’  presentations  at Series  Series , July 19   80 Production  and Circulation  of TV fiction  in EU28 , European  Audiovisual  Observatory  2018    
     35    • SVOD  players  and US networks  are driving  the growt h: currently  in 2019 , there  are more   than  230 shows  in development  or production  for Netflix  (100  hours  of fiction  per month),    54 on average  for US networks  and a maximum  of 40 for European  players  (37 for Germ an  PSB ZDF,  32 for French  PSB FTV,  15 for Italian PSB RAI).  Broadcasters  adapt  their  budget   towards  more fiction  as many  were  mostly  investing  in unscripted  formats  (live  shows):  RTL,  BBC or RTVE81 still spend  more  than  50%  on unscripted  formats  whereas  RAI, ZDF or TF1  favour  already  fiction.      Sourc e: Ampere  Analysis,  Series ,  July 2019     • Local content  is preferred  by local  audiences  in Europe.  2/3 of fiction  in prime  time  are  produced  locally  (+5%  in one year),  and 90%  of the “top  10” TV audiences  in the 5 biggest   markets  (DE, FR, GB, ES, IT) are local.  Overall  45%  of broadcast  hours  are EU28 TV fiction . In  8/12  of analysed  countries,  the most  successful  primetime  shows  are new  production s which   demonstrates  the growing  interest  for new  stories  (i.e. “Lifeline ” in Turkey,  “The Restaurant ”  in Sweden)82.   • Local  language s have been , for a long  time , an issue  preventing  local  series  productions  to  travel , but the growing  usage  of subtitles , especially  among  younger  audience s (requiring   subtitles  on their  mobile  usage  in noisy  envi ronment s) is changing  the behaviours : more  than   50%  of Netflix originals  are not in English.        81 RTVE:  Radiotelevisión  Española  is the state -owned  public  corporation  that assumed  the indirect  management  of the  Spanish  public  radio  and television  service   82 Scripted  Series  Report , Eurodata  TV Worldwide , Glance,  January  2019  
     36      Source  Ampere  Analysis,  Series  Series  keynote  July 2019   This is not yet happening  on local  free TV even  if RAI has proposed  to use subtitles  on their  series   productions  in a Neapolitan  dialect  “My Brilliant  Friend ” or decided  to shoot  “The Name  of the  Rose ” in English83. Co-productions  are also often  depi cting  multi -national  characters,  each  of  them  speaking  in his or her own  language  which  facilitates  localization  (many  examples  like  “Midnight  Sun” are covered  later  in this report  as a case  study).   • Drama  is the most  popular  genre  of series  (70%  of European  primetimes),  with  Crime  and  Thriller s alone  representing  40% , but there  is growing  interest  for “genres”  like sci-fi or  horror  among  younger  audience s, as pointed  out by several  TV commissioners  like at TF1 or  ZDF and as proven  by the local  success es of “Dark ” or “The Rain ” on Netflix84. Most   commissioners  and producers  believe  that international  potential  lies more  in the quality  of  writing,  and the capacity  to address  universal  human  themes  through  local and authentic   stories  for drama , or to be creative  for other  genres.  This has been  the recipe  of success  for  Nordic or Israeli  series  so far, and as analysed  later  on in the report .   There  is, therefore , a clear  appetite  with  European  audiences  for local  and fresh  high -end series   with  a focus  today  on drama s evolving  into more  segmented  genres.     • To match  this local  demand , and also, quotas  from  the variou s laws,  the trend  is to increase   localized  content  production  for OTT players:  only  45%  of Netflix  new  series  are produced  in  the US (7% in the UK and Spain,  5% in France,  4% in Germany…).  Amazon  is already  localizing   35%  of its productions.   • This competiti on on potential  abundant  choice s of new  local  content  stimulates  competition   in local  markets.  TV viewers  are solicited,  their  attention  become  scarce  and they  are  demanding  more  and more  quality.  European  broadcasters  then  react  and develop  more   series  growing  audience  awar eness  but also increasing  production  costs.     83 “My Brilliant  Friend ” is a common  project  RAI & HBO  (see case  study  in this Report)  and “The Name  of the Rose ” an  Italo  German  coproduction  commissioned  by RAI  84 “Dark ” is a local  German  production  and “The Rain ” is a local  Danish  production  for Netflix  Originals    
     37    • They  tend  to favour  original  productions  as oppose d to acquisition s, so that they  avoid  losing   against  bids from  the deep  pocket  OTT players  (60%  of their  budgets  are now  origina l  production s compared  to acquisition s. It was 50%  10 years  ago).    • As the gap to match  budget s per episode  remains  wide  (in many  coun tries,  TVs still produce   series  below  700k€/episode,  whereas  many  OTT series  start  at 1M€/episode  and can reac h  a lot more  like “Games  of Throne s” and the upcoming , record  breaking  “Lord  of the Rings ”  project  from  Amazon - having  spent  250M$  just for the rights  acquisition) , they  develop   projects  with  both  local  interest  and international  potential .   • They  create  alliances  and co-productions  to increase  their  budgets  per episode  and match   their  new  audience  expectations.  Only  9% of series  are co-production s85, today  mostly   originated  by “PSBs” (Public  Service  Broadcasters)  and with  various  countri es and unique   situations.    The lead  today  is clearly  in the Nordic  countries , followed  by the UK and Italy,  Spain  and France.   Country  specificiti es will be analysed  later  on in this report.  And as we will point  out in our TV  strategies  sectio n, this trend  is meant  to grow  as it is among  the only  option  to match  the OTT wave   of series  expected  soon  in Europe.     2.3. Main player  description s& stra tegies      2.3.1.  Description of  the series  ecosystem         Compared  to the difference s of the cinema industry  with  its media  chronology  consisting  of several   rather  fixed  windows  (theatrical  release,  home  entertainment  release,  pay TV, free tv, SVOD  …), the  series  chronology  is not as rigid  and depends  on each  “sales ” context.  For instance,  series   commissioned  mainly  by Pay-TV will have  a first window  on this Pay-TV and then  possible   distribution  on Free -Tv, whereas  series  ordered  by Publ ic Service  Provider s will directly  have  a Free TV window .   Historically,  series  were produced  for one broadcaster  owning  all the content  and which  consider ed  the producer  as a supplier,  and sometimes  even  producing  series  internally  or, in the case  where   the producer  kept  the rights,  having  a long  window  of right s and editorial  control  over  the content.    With  the growing  segment  of international  series  among  both  broadcasters  and OTT platforms , all  the distr ibution  options  (free  tv primetime,  pay-tv, SVOD  from  a local  media  group,  SVOD  from  OTT  players),  the rights  allocation  depend  on each  project’s  financing,  on the initial  ownership  (who  had  the initial  idea  and initially  carried  the developm ent costs)  and its international  potential.    The traditional  TV production  process  is therefore  deepl y affected  and needs  to reinvent  itself  to  adapt  to this new  complex  environment  also providing  many  possibilities  thanks  to enlarged   distribution  options and increased  production  value s.  These  new  market  issues  will be analysed  per  player,  with  high lights  on some  of the most  advanced  countries,  focus  on key business  issues  and  will result  in a set of recommendations  for the industry , and consequentl y for the Council  of Europe .          85 The produc tion and circulation  of TV fiction  in the EU28 , European  Audiovisual  Observatory,  2018    
     38    2.3.2.  Close -up analysis per player     2.3.2.1.  The Producers     The TV producer  is usual ly the origin  of a series project.  Until  now,  in a “local”  space,  s/he brings  an  idea  developed  with  an (several)  author(s),  present  it to a channe l he is familiar  with  in terms  of  marketing  needs  and budget  constraint.  S/he usually  gathers  the majority  of the budget  and  completes  the remaining  10 to 20%  with  local  public  funds  and/or  a distribution  agreement  for  international  sales  or second  window s sales.  In many  cases,  the channel  even  funded  the whole   project  and left the producer  a margin , but kept  all rights  on the series . Compared  to cinema,  a TV  producer  gets usually  less public  support  and relies  more  on “sales”  before  starting  the production .  S/he is often  the “success  factor”  where as the film director  plays  this role in cinema.  As most  series   conceived  in several  seasons  generate  profit  on seasons  2 and onwards,  an audience  needs  to be  there from  season  1 on, hence  a lot of pressure  on the first episode  and season ’s quality  and power   of attraction .    With  the growth  of international  series,  national  broadcasters  cannot finance  these  more  expensive   projects  by themselves  so the producer  needs  to set up more  complex  financing  with  co-producers,   other channels  for other  territories  or other  right s windows  (free  TVs, pay-TVs, SVOD ), and other   countries ’ public  support  (Europe an and national  public  supp ort models  are described  later  on in  this document).    To switch  from  a pre-financed  model  by one channel  to a complex  multi -player  financing  model,  the  producer  needs  to have  more  control  on the project  initially  and invest  more  in its developm ent. He  will then  split  the rights  versus  the different  financial  commitments  he can get from  each  of the  channels  and distributors.  As most  producers  are small  entities  without  important  available   investment  capabilities , the international  series opportunity  is addressed  by:   - teams  of co-producers  splitting  the risk for each  project , each  of them  bringing  channels,   public  support  and also artistic  and talent  input  to match  their  market  needs.  This  configuration  preserves  most  independent  producers  and pluralism . It is a common  model   in the cinema  industry , but it is not the predomin ant model  for TV. Smaller  countries  like the  Nordics  or Portugal  are more  concerned  as their  national  broadcasters  have less resources   than  in larger  terri tories;   - producers  belonging  to international  media  groups  (RTL,  ITV, BBC,  Canal+)  or independent   grou ps acting  as conglomerate  of producers  such  as Banijay,  Endemol  or Lagardère  Studios.   These  groups  enable  more  development  funding,  synergies,  better  barga ining  positions  and  integrated  distribution  arms  and usually  leave  a lot of independence  for their  producers  to  enco urage  creativity  and keep  motivation  going . For instance,  ITV Studios  gathers  55  producers  from  all over  Europe , combining  new  companies , like in Germany  and acquired   ones , like Cattleya  in Italy  (Gomorra)  or Appletree  in Denmark  (the Killing, the Bridge).   Lagardère  Studios  gathers  27 companies  worldwide  including  European  series  pioneer   Atlantic  Production  (Borgia,  Midnight  Sun).  Studio  Cana l aggregates  8 European  productio n  subsidiaries  with  autonomous  strategies  but nevertheless  synerg izes with  its Pay TV parent   company.     
     39    - a new  generation  of producers  has merg ed with  distribution  arms  like the German  EOS  (Events  On Screen,  backed  by distributor  Betafilm)  or financed  by private  funds  like  Federation  Entertainment  positioned  exclu sively  for international  series  (i.e. “Marseille ” for  Netflix,  “Bureau  des Légendes ” for Canal+).    - TV channels  initiating  the development  in partnership  with  other  channels  from  other   territories  or platforms  like FTV,  ZDF and RAI in their  alliance  or NordicVision  for the 5 Nordic   countries.  To be noted  are the predominance  of PSBs in these  alliances  partly  because  their   budget  constraints  are more  rigid than  private  TV.

This raises  the issue  of the  independent  producer  in this new industry:  will they  disappear,  or get very  specialized ? Will they   have  to change  their  business  model and give up their  IP (Intellectual  Property)  as this is a strong   ask from  OTT platforms,  as further  explained  in part 3.1.2.1 . Helping  producers  to retain  as much  of  their  ownership  rights  as possible  could  be an important  role for public  funds  and authorities.     
     40    Series  are also a real opportunity  for producers  to bring  power  and control  back  to them  in the  ecosystem  as a single  TV channel  can’t  be the only  client  financing  the higher  budgets  of series . The  produc er is then  a “project  coordinator”  assembling  several  TV channel s and distributors  on one  project.      S/he need s therefore  to keep  as much  of the series  ownership  as possible  in order  to make  an  adequate  margin  from  its production  budget  but also from  potential  upcoming  international  sales.   For this,  the quality  of the initial  project  should  be as high  and targeted  as possible  and development   funding , as well as relations  with  authors  are critical  issue s, especially  as authors  are key “asset s” in  series , as opposed  to the cinema  industry  which  is more  focused  on the film director  credits.      2.3.2.2.  The Distribut ors    Unlike  in the movie  industry  where  the distributor  is an essential  partner  in the initial  financing   round,  TV distributors  used  to intervene  at the end of the financing  process  to close  financing  gaps   of producers  mainly  targeting  their local  market s. In exchange , for instance , of 10%  of upfront   investment,  they  get international  exclusive  sales  mandates  and can generate  substantial  profit  in  this growing  international  demand . When  part of large  production  groups,  their role is also to bring  extra  revenues  from  catalogue  sales  which  further  generates  funding  possibilities  for new  sales   manda tes.  In this specific  international  series  segment,  professionals  from  local  channels  interviewed   reiterated  than  they  can’t  finance  the majority  of a production  anymore  as they  are now  more   qualitative  and expensive  to produc e. It also appears  that the numbe r of additional  projects  has also  created  a certain  talent  scarcity,  at least  on directors  or technical  expert s of this segment  and in  some  territories  (showrunners  for instance  all over  Europe  or even  film directors  or editors  in Spain,   Sweden , the UK or in specific  areas  like the Berlin  region  in Germany ) and inflated  production  costs   because  of these  unbalanced  market  conditions  (cf. UK country  benchmark  and talent  focus   chapters  in this report).    The distributor  can then  play an important  role at the genesis  of the project  financing.  This is the  case  for distri butors  integrated  in groups  where  they  play an important  role today  at the start  of  production  projects.    This is more  difficult  for independent  distributors  as they  take  more  risks  for IPs they  don’t  produce   and control  and for which  they  have  no specific  public  support  today . Another  risk is the fact that  OTT platforms  can also be considered  as financing  partners  for producers  (pre-sales  or coproducers)  and often  claim  worldwide  rights  which  is cutting  out distributors  from  their  revenue   pote ntial s . The same  can happen  when  co-producing  channel s request  their  internal  distributor  to  handle  the remaining  rights.    For all these  reasons,  distributors  now  consider  consolidation  in a larger  production  or distribution   group  or start to develop  production  activities  so that they  have  more  control  on content  and  ownership  of it. This is, for instance , the case  for French  About  Premium  Content  initially  as the  distributor  of international  series  and now  they  are proposing  and also doing  development  and  production  services.     
     41    Several  independent  producers  listed  in the previous  chapter  (i.e. Federation  Entertainment)  do  have  both  production  and distribution  activities  to align  their  strategies  and optimize  their  revenues   thus  blurri ng the limits  of production  and distribution.   Strengthening  this segment  of the industry  enable s more  content  propositions  in the market  and  avoid s the market  dominance  by a few worldwide  OTT players . It could  consist  of facilitating  dual   “producer -distributor ” companies  or more  specifically,  subsidising  independent  distributors.       2.3.2.3.  The Broa dcasters     Broadcasters  have  for years  dictated  the demand  for fiction  and initiated  projects  either  by defining   their  needs  and organizing  competitions  between  independent  producers  or producing  them   internally.  As explained  before,  they  were  able  to cover  almost  all the production  costs  and get in  exchange  full ownership  on the properties  or at least  the main  part of it. Some  countries  like France   or Italy  are forbidden  by law to produce  internal ly or to retain  all IP in order  to preserve  independent   producers , but even  in these  systems,  the channels  DNA  was so strong  that the potential  for  interna tional  sales  were  minimal . Indeed , the artistic  influence  of the TV commissioners  was so  strong  that the producers  usually  made  concessions  on the initial  format  and gave  up on important   selling  points  (choosing  for instance  a local  actor  fitting  in to the channel  identity , but not necessarily   suitable  for international  demand).  Many  formats  arose - like TV films  in one or two episodes  in  Germany  or in France.  But with the growing  emphasis  on series , broadcasters  have  started  to modify   their  programmin g and their  production.    European  broadcasters  today  are therefore  strong  commissioners  of local series . The top 10 list of  European  scripted  commissioners  for instance,  includes  8 broadcasters  (BBC,  ZDF,  RAI, YLE, SVT,   ORF,  FTV,  C+) and two OTT platforms  (Netflix  and HBO).  On a local  scale,  combined  yearly   investment  of local  channels  in series  (for instance  5,4 bn€ for France  all fiction  included)  is far below   Netfli x, Amazon,  Warner  Media,  Disney,  and Apple ’s combined  worldwide  investm ent  (35,5  bn€86)  but still much  higher  than  purely  local  production  spen d from  these  OTT players  (£280M  in the UK  for Netflix  and Amazon  in the UK in 2018 , representing  12%  of domestic  TVs spent  and growing  fast  with  +86%  between  2017  and 201887).  With  the international  series  trend,  and the need  of channel s to produce  them  against  the rising   influence  of OTT platforms,  production  costs  have  increased  and broadcasters  have  been  obliged  to  secure  their  series  and raise  their  split  of their  own  productions  versus content  acquisition  (49 to  60%  between  2007  and 2018),  sometimes  considerably  boosting  their  investment  in original   creations  (Norwegian  NRK  has for instance  doubled  its budget  for “originals”  , from  25M€  to 60M€   in a few years88).  They  have  also opened  their  financing  rounds  to other  partners,  usually  in other  countries,  via coproductio ns and partnerships.  It nevertheless  represents  only  9% of the produced  fictions  which  is  low compared  to the cinema  industry , but whic h is presently  boosted  by the OTT competition . This  is true  for Pay-TV directly  in competition  with  (pay ) OTT platforms , but also for Free  TV which  is  losing  their  audience  and therefore  building  their  own  OTT services  (i.e. RTL and its TVNow  service,   BBC and ITV launching  Britbox,  French  broadcasters  with  upcoming  Salto,  Prosieben  and Discovery     86 NPA  conference  Sept  19  87 https://amp.theguardian.com/media/2019/sep/06/netflix -and-amazon -double -their -spending -on-uk-made -tvshows   88 3 July 2019  Liberation,  interview  of NRK’s  CEO Thor  Gjermund  Eriksen     
     42    JV Joyn, etc.) . Series  are then  co-produced  for their  OTT services  as well as for their linear  offers   (where  they  are promoted  like exclusive  “blockbuster ” series) .   The International  cooperation  initiative  today  has been  mainly  driven  by PSBs who  had less  possibility  to increase  their  budgets  and could  also align  this way with their  mission  to educate   viewers  about  history  or Europe . In the meantime,  private  channels  have  developed  or acquired  a  lot of independent  production  subsidiaries  like Freemant le (RTL),  Newen  (TF1),  Altresmedia  or SKY  Studios.      Some  of them  have  started to consider  local  alliances  in order  to build  alternatives  to OTT platforms,   like Altresmedia  joining  forces  with  Movistar  (Telefonica)  in the joint  venture  “Behemoth ” dedicated   to series  and movies  production89.  Some  of them  like ZDF were  already  used  to co-producing  with external  producers  (inland  and  abroad)  and facilitated  this move.  UK broadcasters  also showed  the path  with  regular  coproductions , usual ly with  a US network  interested  in the creativity  and access  to talent  of BBC and  an independent  producer:  “The Night  Manager ” (prod  The Ink Factory,  BBC,  AMC),  “Taboo ” (BBC,   FX), “Downtown  Abbey ” (ITV,  PBS).  BBC can this way initiate  projects  with … a third  of the  investment.  Deals  with  OTT platforms  also occur , with  pre-sales  agreement  for worldwide  rights   (excl.  the UK) for “Chewing  Gum ” (E4, Netflix),  “Catastrophe ” (C4, Amazon).  In these  last cases,   despite  the mention  of “originals”  marketed  by the platforms,  these  agreements  were  not coproductions.    RAI has also demonstrated  its capability  to develop  with  independent  producer’s  series  achieving   major  audiences  on its channels  and also an Italian  “fame  for stories ” with  impact  abroad:  “the  Name  of the Rose ” (with  worldwide  pre-sales  to BBC,  AMC…),  “my Brillian t Friend ” (coproduced   with  HBO).  But some  major  European  channels  have  not started  yet (RTVE  or channels  in Eastern   Europe).   Larger  partnerships  also have  start ed to flourish.  This is the case  for the “Alliance”  between  FTV,   RAI and ZDF (and  maybe  RTVE), selecting  common  projects  together  every  two months  pitched  by  producers  to develop,  produce  and broadcast  them  together,  at least  2 of them  at a time  with  leadership  going  to one channel  in order  to avoid  losing  the focus  on the original  power  of the story   and generate  “Europudding ” content  . The criteria  for projects  is to be histories  of European  appeal   like “Leonardo ” (Luxvide  and Beta  for FTV and RAI), international  stories  taking  place  abroad  from   Europe  like “Mirages ” (Lincoln  TV, Cineflix,  Wild bunch  Germany  for FTV,  ZDF)  in Dubai  or genre   categories  like sci-fi or even  horror,  appealing  to young er generations  from  all countries , like Netflix   does.   This is also the case  for the Nordic  channels  and the Nord vision  project  delivering  12 series  per year   (200  episodes)  and strengthening  the Nordic  style  especially  skilled  for dramas,  crime  and politics.   By combining  their  budget  of a few hundred  thousand  euros  per country,  episode  budget s match   larger  countries ’ budgets  and even  OTT platform s, therefore  ensuring  a competitive  broadcast   locally  and with  possibilities  of sales  abroad.   ARTE  is by itself  a successful  partnership  betw een 2 countries,  extending  its reach  to other  countries   and languages  (Italian, Spanish,  Polish)  and with  a project  of progressively  building  a European   “Netflix”  on behalf  of broadcasters.  ARTE  develops  many  co-productions  (a minimum  of 3/ye ar) to  achieve  high -end series  (in 2020:  “Anna  “with  Sky Italia,  “Country  Men ” with  NRK,  “Black  Port ” with     89 San Sebastian  International  Film  Festival  release  on September  20th  2019  
     43    RUV,  “Paix à leurs  Armes ” with  ZDF),  even  pragmatically  including  Netflix  in its financing  (pre-sales   on “Au Service  de la France ” S2 2018).    There  are also many  examples  of cooperation  involving  private  broad casters,  mainly  between  two  countries  so that there  is no risk of competition,  and often  between  Pay TV/free  TVs, private/public.   This is the case  for “Midnight  Sun” (Canal+/SVT),  Borgia  (Canal+/ZDF).  It is also sometimes  the case   between  two potential  com petitors  in Pay TV like “Years  and Years ” (Canal+/HBO)  or between  TVs  and OTT platforms  like “La Casa  de Papel ” (Netflix  and Atresmedia  channel  Anten a 3).    In all these  more  comp lex co-productions,  initiatives  are often  taken  by independent  producers  like  Endemol,  Banijay,  EOS,  Federation  Entertainment,  Lagardère  Studios  or producers  within  media  &  TV groups  who  have  usually  also independent  strategies  (Studi o Canal,  ITV Studio).    This way they can set up complementary  co-production s & pre-sales strategies,  taking  care  of  alignment  between  each  partner.    In this model,  The Oligarch  Productions  has developed  “le Bureau  des Légendes ” with  Canal+  but  comple ted its financing  with  numerous  distribution  deals  worldwide.  This is, as highlighted  before,   an opportunity  for producers  to be central  in this new  market,  as long  as they  can define  clear  rules   with  their  distribution  partn ers on who  owns  what,  how  long  and where…  the risk being  to give up  all IP to OTT platforms  and lose any “backend ” financing  opportunity.     2.3.2.4.  Telecommunication operators (“telcos")  and Pay  TV Platforms     Historically,  European  TV distribution  has been  split  between  analogue  terrestrial,  cable and  satellite,  with  different  local  configurations,  some  of them  having  a wide  & almost  free analogue   cable  distribution  (Germany,  Netherlands),  with  some  others  with  limited  free channels  and growing   cabsat  services  (UK,  France).  With  the digital  rollo ut in the late 90’s and the development  of  numerous  thematic  channels,  Pay TV has grown  significantly , creating  large  Pay TV distributors  such   as Sky, Viasat  or Canal  Satellite  (Canal+  group)  for satellite  or UPC (Liberate),  Com  Hem  or ONO   (Vodafone)  for cable.    With  the deployment  of multicast  technology  on the ADSL (Asymmet ric Digital  Subscriber  Line)   networks  (calle d IPTV (Internet  Protocol  Television) ), Telco’s  have  started  to invest  in the pay TV  landscape  and develop  multiple -service  offers  (x-play offers) , using  television  offers  to complement   their  voice  and access offers:  acquisition  of new  customers  thanks  to exclusive  content  like football   games , and Average  Revenue  Per User (ARPU)  increase  with  channels  and VOD.  Even  if Telco’s  had  to invest  a lot in IPTV  networks  and high -end set top boxes  in order  to distribute  television,  they   grew  fast in underdeveloped  countries  with  cable  like France  (58%  penetration).  We have , therefore   today , a Pay TV distr ibution  more  or less split  in three  equivalent  market  shares  in Europe:  IPTV (still   growing)  and cable  offers  (owned  by « Telco’s  ») and satellite  offers  owned  by media  groups  (Digital   Terrestrial  Television  remains  small  for PayTV  offers).  Pay-tv’s primary  distribution  has often  been   satellite  (Sky,  CanalSat,  Viaplay) , but growth  today  lies in internet  networks  either  with  distribution   agreements  with  Telco’s  on their  IPTV  networks  (CanalSat  and Orange)  or directly  with  their  OTT  offers.   The arrival  of OTT players  distributing  SVOD  services  at a chea per price  than  their  offer  has  endangered  Pay TV revenues  for all these  players.  Pay TVs have  developed  their  SVOD offers  and  distributed  them  in their  existing  networks  or in OTT (Viaplay  from  Viasat,  Sky NowTV,  CanalSeries).  
     44    To be noted  is the important  role of Sky combining  Pay-tv and internet  access  (2nd largest  UK ADSL  provider ) and therefore  becom ing a convergent  player.   Telcos  had a more  global  approach  either  by developing  their  own  SVOD  services  (i.e. Elisa  Viihde   for Elisa  in Finla nd) , but also joining  forces  with  existing   vulnerable  Pay TVs (Telefonica  acquiring   Movistar  in Spain,  Telia  acquiring  Bonnier  group  including  CMore ) or finally  just distributing  Netflix   and/or  Amazon  to serve  all their  households  needs  (Dutch  telecom  operator  KPN giving  up on its  own  SVOD ).     Some  of them  have  adopt ed several  strategies  in parallel  like Orange,  distributing  Netflix  but also  proposing  its own  OCS channel  to subscribers  in its network,  and in OTT,  in linear  and SVOD  modes.    In parallel,  PayTV  operators  like Sky or CanalSat  have  start ed to adopt  similar strategies  proposing   their  own  channels  and SVOD  offers  but also starti ng to distribute  Netflix  or Amazon,  in order  to  retain  their  customers  and provide  them  with  the widest  choice s and also to anticipate  increased   competition  with  new  players  coming  in, like Apple  or Disney.    In this huge  consolidating  market,  serie s have  been  developed  considerably  by Telco’s  (like  they   have  been  for broadcasters ) as they  address  demand  in the market  and their  usage  (binge  watchin g,  multiscreen …) goes  well with  the Pay TV operators  (Telco’s and media  groups)  “anytime  anywhere ”  marketing  pitches.  Movistar  & Telefonica  (Hierro)  soon  joined  by Altresmedia  with  their  new  JointVenture  “Behemoth”,  Sky (Gomorra),  Orange  (OCS  Originals),  Elisa  (Man  in Room  301)  are therefore   important  commissio ners  involved  in series  production s and co-productions.  Being  part  of  international  groups,  they  can leverage  their  costs  in several  territories  (Sky in the UK, Germany,   Italy , Orange  in France,  Spain,  Poland,  Viaplay  in Nordic  territories)  and develop  European   alternatives  to FAANGs.  They  are, therefore , growing  clients  for producers.    With  100M€  investment s on content  originals  over  5 years,  Orange  has contributed  this way to the  launch  of the 26 minute  format  in France  (“Orange  signature”  collection),  discovered  a new   generation  of series  authors  and is becoming  part of several  international  successes  (“the Name  of  the Rose ” with  RAI, or the upcoming  “Spy” with  Sacha  Baron  Cohen  together  with  Netflix).  Recent   announcement s of a horror  series  for its Spanish  operations  may  open  the road  to an international   strategy.   Together  with  local  media  groups,  they  can constitute  local  alternatives  to the FAANGS  powerful   platforms  as they  access  millions  of subscribers  and can then  share  data  with  media  groups  to  develop  a good  understanding  of audience  expectations,  co-produce  targeted  content  (series,   sport s), aggregate  this new  generation  of OTT contents  and provide  next -generation   recommendations  based  on fair use of AI.    2.3.2.5.  The OTT Players      Last but not least,  we cover  the OTT players  who  are the key driver s of the series  market.  These  new   entrants  in Europe  are tech  companies  who  used  “over  the top”  distribution  to get directly  in touch   with  their  audiences,  to differentiate  between  traditional  media  players  and their  intermediaries   (cable,  satelli te, theatres …). These  “D2C”  (direct  to consumer)  models  enable  direct  feedback  and  personalization  of content  which  fits well with  new  user  internet  behaviours .   Regrouped  in the FAANG  denomination  (Facebook,  Apple,  Amazon,  Netflix,  Google),  the revolu tion  they  provo ked in the USA and the competition  they  create  against  studios  and US Telco’s  has 
     45    stimulated  the emergence  of OTT offers  from  these  players,  expected  in Europe  shortly  (AppleTV+   in the last quarter  of 2019,  HBO  Max  in Q1 2020,  NBCUniversal  Peaco ck announced  for Q2 2020…).   In China , huge  OTT players  (“BAT X” acronym  regrouping  the 4 main  players  Baidu,  Alibaba,  Tencent   and Xiaomi ) have  for the moment  not communicated  on European  expansion  plans .    Digital  TV Research  forecasts  September  2019     They all share  a technological  background,  an expertise  for user  experience  and innovation  (“user   drive n”) and huge  financial  resources  often  generated  by their  core  businesses  (e-commerce  for  Amazon,  hardware  for Apple,  advertising  and data  for Google  and Facebook).  This gives  them  a clear   competitive  advantage  to establish  their  new  media  brands:  i.e. in 2019,  29M€  of media  spent  on  promotion  for “American  Gods ” S2 from  Amazon  in France  versus  2,9M € for “Skam ”, one of the  most  promoted  shows  of FTV (France  Télévision s).91  Netflix  is the only  one clearly  positioned  in the television  of the future,  aiming  at developing  for  each  customer  a personalized  television  service.    Their  first mover  advantage  on these  OTT offers  made  them  dominate  this growing  market  (15%  of  PayTV  revenues  but 53%  of the subscribers  and  41%  year  on year  growth).  Initially  supplier s or  partners  to the media  industry,  they  have  become  competitors  and generate  local  reactions  and  alternatives  as described  earlier.    SVOD  becomes  the main  growth  driver  of the EU audio visual  sector  with  series  their  key asset.  These   powerful  communi cation  machines  have  generated  strong  impact  in the market  in just a few years :  they  are new  leaders  creating  buzz  (Netflix  and Amazon  which  represent  74%  of EU SVOD   revenues92), an abundance  of content,  scarcity  of user s’ attention,  a rise in acquisition  and  production  costs  …and local  players  reactions  in response  with  alliances  and consolidations   (broadcasters  OTT projects  Salto,  Britbox,  German  joint  venture  Joyn,  pan-European  services  CMore , Viaplay,  Horizon,  SkyNowT V).    91 NPA  September  2019    92 Trends  on the EU VOD  Market , European  Audiovisual  Observatory,  September  2019   
     46    European  Audiovisual  Observatory  – Trend  on the EU VOD  Market  – September  2019  – EUROVOD  Venice      In the series  market,  Netflix  is leading  the game  with  276 shows  in production  or development  in  2019  compared  to 95 for Amazon,  35 for Apple  (but growin g fast)  and 22 and 10 for Facebook  and  Google,  who  are exhibiting  more  reasonable  growth.  In 2018  SVOD  platforms  have  released  a  combined  300+  new  digital  originals - over  130 of these  premiered -on Netflix  alone93. Acquired   content  remains  the biggest expense  for Netflix  (83%94) because  part of the concept  lies in an  abundance  of content  where  Apple  (and  Disney)  communicates  more  on quality  and less volume,   even  reintroducing  one episode  per week  to limit  the exhaustive  watch  of its content  during a trial  period  (as opposed  to the binge  watching  effect  promoted  by Netflix).   Both  Netflix  and Amazon  produce  shows  internationally  (54%  and 35%)  and acquire  together  3000   hours  of content  per month , a clear  new  revenue  stream  for producers  for a few years  already.  With   the arrival  of new  platforms,  Netflix  market  share  has decline d slightly  but is compensated  by a price   increase  policy.  This expected  new  wave  of OTT services  can explain  why Netflix  made  a recent   partnership  on cross -distribution  with rival  Canal+.   Disney+  (launching  on 12 November  2019  in the US and already  in a Beta test in the Netherlands   since  12 September)  is today  considered  as the most  serious  challenger  to Netflix  and Amazon  with   an estimated  19M  subscribers  by 2024.  Netflix  in this scenario  would  decrease  its European  2018   market  share  from  54% to 42% 95.     93 Parrot  Analytics  2018   94 Ampere  Analysis  at Series  Series  July 19  95 Digital  TV Research  September  19  Pan-European: · C More & Viaplay · Horizon · Sky Now TV Local services: · Player & iplaPL · FilmoTV, Videofutur, SFR Play  · Maxdome/ JoynDE  · RTL TV Now Plus DE · Movistar+, FilminES · TIMVISION IT · RTL VideolandNL · Uncut BE & FR · FlimmitAT · VoyoCZ · (Salto & Britbox) Examples –European SVOD services launched by media players, traditional & pay-TV and telcos

Role of national and European institution s    2.3.3.1.  General Overview     With its important budget per episode impossible to finance by one single European broadcaster,  animation has started co -productions years ago. The cinema industry is also highly dependent on  co-productions with a European convention setting up a framework for all countries to work  smoothly together. With high end series, fiction is following the same trend , but th ere is no  convention to regulate international  agreements , even if many sources of financial support  exist s  at European, national and regional levels .    However, t he main difference between series and feature films is the iterative development aspect  of series. Contrary to feature films, each stage  of series creation and broadcasting occur several  times before the work  is fully finished . The scripts of each season  are not all written in advance and   might take into account some feedback  of the previous season before being written. The sam e goes  for the production and broadcast: these steps will occur again for each season  before the series is  fully finished . Furthermore, series are directly broadcast on TV or OTT platforms (Netflix, Amazon  Prime Video, Apple Video….), making their dis tribution and marketing strategy or their distribution  rights management very different too.       As a consequence, modern series tend to have a specific financing mix : when classic audio -visual   projects  such as documentaries or feature films  are usually financed by public funds and TV private  or public TV Channel s, modern  series tend to require  extra financing  (20-40%  or higher for premium    96 Based  on article s in Yahoo  Finance,  Variety  and local  UK and France  press    
     48    production s) from private investment, and most of the time the private investor is an Over -The-Top  (OTT)  or an International TV channel  or distributor actor for high end projects.     Therefore, modern series need specific support and financing scheme s which are different from the  ones dedicated to feature films and more traditional TV programs. However , there are almost no  institutions or public funds which are exclusively dedicated to series: most of the public su pport for  series are inherited from the ones dedicated to feature films, and only a few programs have been  recently created specifically for that matter. We will present below the main existin g public support  scheme from which  series  can benefit .

Almost a ll of them have a t least one public support that series can benefit from , with  a few exceptions that will be presented later.   In Appendix 6 , a mapping  of the public su pport s dedicated to series  available in each  Eurimages  Member St ates  can be found.   In Appendix 7 , the main automatic and selective  support  program mes for series  are further  described.     Now, we will present the most important points to know in order to understand how public  support  works for series .    There  are 2 main categories  of support:   • Automatic support:  to receive  automatic support, the project only has to comply with a set of  criteria clearly stated in the guidelines of the support, and once the compliance has been  confirmed, it will receive the funding.   • Selective support: to receive  selective support, the proje ct, like in automatic support, must   comply with some criteria, but this time  a jury will evaluate some aspects of it (cultural and  artistic quality, success potential… ). Only a few projects will then be selected to receive the  funding support  among those complying with the criteria .     The financial support can come in different forms - the main ones are :  • Repayable loan: a free loan repayable under conditions of income /profit .   • Tax relief / Cash Rebate : a part of  the “eligible  costs” spent during the production can be  refund ed to the production company. The definition of th ese “eligible costs ” are defined in  the guidelines .  • Direct subsidies: based on the financing and spe nding plan, the public fund provide s                            an amount of the required fund s, with some conditions of course.     In order to receive public funding, t he criteria to comply with , the objecti ves pursued by the  institutions, can be sorted into two main categories:   • Cultural Criteria (see the grey frame below  for more details ):   o These criteria will evaluate the artistic quality or cultural interest of the project s.   o The objectives are various: p romote local /minority  culture  and patrimony , support  artistically edgy projects,  defend the cultural exception and cultural diversity… etc.  • Business/Economic criteria:    o These criteria  will evaluate the act ivity the project will bring to the local audio visual sector  and its potential market success.    o The objectives are: support  local talent  and professionals of the audio visual sector  by attracting more activity, attract investment in the local ec onomy, raise interest  in the  local  cultural patrimony by showcasing it in the series  and attract tourism ,  make profitable investments with public funds .       
     51                     Cultural Criteria for public  support :    • Cultural profile : it is a list of mandatory criteria the project must re spect in order to  receive support. These criteria can be, for examples:   o The original language of the film   o The nationality of the producer and/or co -producer   o The financial share of the producers having a permanent residence in the  country/reg ion providing t he found   o The country where the project will be released first    Most of countries applies this kind of rule  in their selection process, the goal is to  support local production that would be firstly aimed at national auditors. It makes  even mor e sense when a support program goal is to promote specifically a minority  and cultural diversity.     • Cultural test : the ap plicant will have to comply with a minimum of conditions or  reach a minimum score to be eligible for public support. In this case, all t he aspects  of the cultural test are not mandatory, but the applicant have to follow a certain  amount of them. Most commo n criteria are, for examples:   o The action take s place in the country/region of the fund for the most part   o The language used in the origi nal version is an official language of the  country/region fund   o Some artistic content directly linked to the production a re linked to the  region of the fund (music, character, literature references, historical  figures…)   o Some of the most important people wor king on the pro ject come from the  region of the fund (producer, scriptwriter, main character actor, director….)   o Local hi storical events are presented in the project    The cultural test is most of the time the first condition to comply with before going  any f urther in the s elective support process. It serves both objectives of cultural  influence of the country/region of the fu nd and their will to target mainly local  audio -visual professionals. However, cultural tests tend to refer more to a European  culture th an a very local  culture, making things easier for European co -productions  looking for public support.    
     52    2.3.3.3.  Different Scal e of actions  of the public institutions      After reviewing most of  the public funds supporting series among the Council of Europe State  Members , it appeared that , depending on their scale of action, they tend to have different roles  and objectives which will be described here briefly.     Example of Transnational Funds, key actors stimulating co -productions in Europe :    Creative Europe – MEDIA – Co-production funds:   • What is it?   The MEDIA sub -programme of Creative Europe supports the EU film and series financially  in the development,  production  and promotion of their work. It focuses on  projects with a  European dimension and /or employing new technologi es.   It also helps  European films and audio visual  works including feature films, television drama,  documentaries and new media to find  markets at European and International scale.  Furthermore,  Creative fund s training and series or film development schemes .  • Support Programs for series :  o EU - MEDIA Support for TV Programming of Audio -visual  EU Works   o EU - MEDIA Support for Development (Slate Funding)   o EU - MEDIA Support for Development (Single Project)   ➔Creative Europe – Media is a key actor  (8,7 M€ in 2019)  in Europe supporting European medium  to high -end series productions by bringing extra financing to project s already supported by local  public funds  and in need of extra financing to reach their full potential .     Nordisk Film & TV Fund:   • What is it?   o Establishe d in 1990, and based in Oslo, Norway, Nordisk Film & TV F und’s primary  purpose is to promote high qualit y film and TV productions in the five Nordic  countries (Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden), by providing support  for the top -up financing of  feature films, TV fiction/drama series and creative  documentaries.   o Nordisk Film & TV Fond is funded by 1 8 partners; the Nordic Council of Ministers,  five national film institutes/funds and 12 public service and private TV stations  within the region.   • Suppo rt Programs for series :  o Production funding for TV fictions / series;   o Funding for dubbing;   o Funding for strategic development (only upon request by the Fund)   ➔Nordisk Film and TV Fund is an interesting and efficient in itiative that allowed the Nordics to  produce quality content by increasing co -productions and distri bution opportunities.        
     53    National public funds, close to the national  administration and film commissions :    • At the National/Federal level, the central public  funds tend to have a wider range of  support program s and more funds reserved for series creation and audio -visual  project s in  general   • In charge of developing the cultural influence of the country, they are more likely to  support riskier projec ts, with higher artistic value and originality, and p roject s in their early  stage (scriptwriting, development, new talents…)   • They are closer to the central administration and film commissions, so they have  greater  political influence on the audio -visual  sector.   o The members of the jury selecting the projects which will receive public support  tend to also be important actors in the audio -visual  sector in the country.   o They may be able to more easily unlock new funds or advocate for  new kin d of  support programs     • They are the first public funds to contact for new production s willing to launch  project s in  the member countries.   o They oversee the application of bi -national or multi -national co -production treaties   o They monitor t he national cash rebate program when there  is one.   o They can provide contact s and information to producers willing to shoot in specific  areas of the country or have close ties with the public institution in charge of these  missions .     Regional/Loca l Funds     • More business oriented, Regional funds will take less risk and tend to support project s  already backed -up by the central public fund or big market -oriented projects   • Their objectives are to increase the attractiveness of the region for  audio -visual  investments  and tourism, through tax incentives and specific criteria to receive the fund s  o Example: to receive support from the city of Prag ue, the city must be presented by  its name and some monuments be on screen.   • They might have mi nor program s to promote local culture specificity (language, cities,  historical figures…) and talent .  • Local funds are crucial contacts for location scouting, as well as provid ing an up to date data  base of the best shooting places in the region, help wit h administrative procedures and  providing contacts and services to facilitate the work with local professionals who could be  employed .   2.3.3.4.  Countries not supporting series     • Only a few countries are not providing public support to series creation  at all among the  Council of Europe members  States :  Albania,  Bosnia and Herzegovina,  Serbia,  Bulgaria  and Russia   • These countries tend to provide low public investment to the audio visual  sector in general  in recent years . 
     54    • However, in t he last 5 years, many countries who were not supporting series production  have set up at least one support program me, notably a cash rebate program me.   o For example, Ukraine has set up a Cash Rebate program me in 2019   • What may prevent these countries from su pporting series production s can be the difficulty  in changing the laws concerning Audio visual  public support.   2.4. Countries close ups and diversity     2.4.1.  Overall situation   This OTT revolution  and series  growth  is happening  with  different  intensity  in Europe.  Where   connectivity  is the lowest,  OTT platforms  had less influence  like in Poland  where  the national  TVs  still drive  the audience  and produce  local  fiction  for local  tastes  without  big change s in  commissioning  for the moment.  Pay TV is more reactive  there,  accompanying  the development  of  Netflix  (“1983 ” is their  first Polish  production  targeting  local  audiences)  and developing  a new   demand  for Polish  crime  series  (“Blinded  by the Light ” for HBO,  “Illegals ” for Canal+  Polska).    In general,  with  the growth  of Netflix  and their  local  production  roll-out almost everywhere  and the  following  roll out of Amazon  with  similar  strategies,  local  broadcasters  also are progressively   start ing to produce  qualit y series  stand -alone  or in co-prod uction s.   Some  countries , like the UK, the Nordic  countries  or Germany  had already  started  co-productions   for different  reasons  and are accelerating  with  the streamer’s  competition  (Germany  initially  more   to reduce  costs  whereas  the UK and the Nordic s identified  very  quickly the opportunity  to develop   international  sales).  They  were  followed  for a few years  by Spain,  France  and Italy  (boosted  by the  success  of “La Casa  de Papel ”, “Bureau  des Légendes ” or “Suburra ”) and Eastern  Europe  is now   making  the first moves.  The smaller  countries  (for instance  Finland  or Portugal)  or smaller  channels   (like  ARTE)  have  understood  for years  the interest  of going  international  to increase  their  budgets   for better  national  content.    Now  it is time  to think  “glocal ” (global  + local) :  develop ing fictions  targeting  their  local  audiences   but with  a potential  on the international  markets,  especially  with  the expanding  international   streaming  services.  In some  cases,  like Israel,  local  can be seen  almost  as a pilot case  servicing  an  international  project  as the main  objective  (see the upcoming  country  case  study  about  Israel) .  The series  having  success  most  of the time  address  universal  questions  to everyone  but within  local   and authentic  context.  The European  plurality  is a force  because  there  is so much  local  context  and  also so many  different  ways  to treat  universal  themes.      In the next  part,  we will describe  6 countries  best  practices  to be inspired  from:  the unique  creative   system  in Denmark,  the rise of series  co-productions  in the UK, Israel’s  Drama  Nation  branding,  the  Belgium  innovative  catch  up on series,  the French  political  shake  up and the “dizi” phenomenon  in  Turkey.              
     55    2.4.2.  Best practice countries: DK, UK , Israel, Belgium , Franc e    2.4.2.1.  The Unique Creative System in Denmark     Rapidly , Denmark  has been  identified  on the international  scene  as an exceptional  series  creative   environment  with  master  shows  like “The Killing ”, “Borgen ” or “The Bridge ” (co-produced  with  SVT).  This has been  the result  of writing  positioned  in the centre , which  is the key for successful  long   running  series.  Without  big budgets  available,  the focus  has been  on contemporary  stories  and a  new  dark  genre  has been  created  “Nordic  crime”,  also devel oped  in the other  Nordic  countries  with   similar  approaches.  These  shows  have  generated  many  worldwide  original  and format  sales  (even   in the US with  “the Killing ” for instance)  and inspired  other  “small”  countries  to have  international   amb itions  if the story is good  and the budget  not necessarily  at the US standards  (i.e. Belgium  case   hereunder).   Danish  PBS DR has been  a key driver  in this trend,  jumping  from  17 series  in development  in 2017   to 50 in 2018.  The internal  organization  is optim ized to develop  writing  quality  with  the PBS mission   in mind,  viewing  the world  thru  other’s  eyes  and helping  its audiences  to understand  its role in  society  (current  development s include  for instance  themes  like domestic  violence  – “A Family   Matter ” -, terrorism  risk – “When the Dust  Settles ”-). The channel  produces  internally  and works   with  independent  authors.  When  a short  script  generates  interest  from  DR, authors  are then   integrated  into DR’s  production  teams  so that there  is a very  synerg etic and efficient  collaboration.    Authors  are paid  for their  work  even  if the series isn’t  produced  and this enables  a clear  quality  focus   from  the very  first development  phases,  an element  often  missing  in the European  TV industry,   often  influenced  by cinema  and its “film  director  centric”  approach.     Private  competitor  TV2 has a similar  focus  for its series  but externalizes  its production.  With  10  series  per year  and half of them  being  “high  end”  with  increased  budget s, co-productions  and presales  happe ning  with  Netflix  and C-More , but the split  of windows  and territories  is becoming  more   problematic  as TV2 now  has its own  SVOD  service  to serve  (TV2Play).   To stimulate  creativity  at the country  level  brought  by digital,  Vision  Denma rk is a creative  business   alliance  which  has been  set up between  all creative  industries  (digital,  TV, cinema,  gaming,  XR…).  In  parallel,  Create  Denmark  takes  care  of collective  negotiations  notably  with  OTT platforms  to provide   talent  with  better  deals  and defend  their  rights , for instance  with  a limited  period  of holdback  by  platform s.  2.4.2.2.  The rise of series co -productions in the UK     UK high -end TV production  is at record  levels,  benefiting  more  jobs and producers.  Investment  has  doubled  since  2014,  rising to £1,7bn  in 2018  (+59%  of produced  hours)  97  making  the UK the biggest   high -end series  producers  in Europe98. International  revenues  (sales  abroad  and money  spent  from   overseas  broadcasters  in UK production s) have  specifically  jumped  90%  since  2013.     97 British  Film  Institute,  COBA  (Commercial  Broadcasters  Association),  PACT  (Producers  Alliance  for Cinema  and  Television)  – studies  September  19  98 The production  and circulation  of TV fiction  in the EU28  - Television  and VOD,  European  Audio visual  Observatory,   Strasbourg,  2019   
     56    This booming  sector  is fuelled  by a surge  in co-commissions  / co-productions  where  broadcasters   and OTT platforms  collaborate  at an early  stage  of the production  (16 in 2014  jumping  to 30 in 2018).   OTT platforms  have  also increased  their  commissions  from  2 in 2014  to 18 in 2018.  And the trend  is  accelerated  in 2019  with  Netflix  alone  producing  50 titles  for an investment  of 453M€99.  These  collaborations  mean  greater  budgets  for more  ambitious  shows  with  international  appeal :  “Chernobyl ” (Sky and HBO),  “Gentleman  Jack ” (BBC  and HBO),  “Fleabag ” (BBC  and Amazon),  “The  Night  Manager ” (BBC  and AMC),  and the upcoming  “Dracula ” (BBC  and Netflix).   Since  2014,  32 broadcasters  and SVODs  have  partnered  with  UK PSBs  with  BBC being  the bigge st  co-commissioner  (450  hours  of drama  per year).   OTT players  benefit  this way from  the established   expertise  of BBC in storytelling  and production,  and the BBC benefits  from  much  higher  production   budgets  by keeping  their  editorial  integrity.   This increa sing demand  has created  a scarcity  of available  talent  and a spend  per hour  that has risen   by 36%  since  2014  with  an average  show  now  costing  £2,3M  an hour.  Of course,  production  value s  have  also increased  as has the international  sales potential  of these  series,  but costs have   nevertheless  increased  thus  forcing  the market  players  to find solutions  to scale  their  industrial   capacity , for instance , with  training  plans  or regulation  (like  the demand  from  British  Commercial   Broadcaster s Association  COBA  to reform  the existing  apprenticeship  system).    Studio  space  is also becoming  scarce. With  40 productions  just for Netflix  alone,  the OTT giant  has  decided  to secure  a permanen t production  base  with  a deal  to take  over  Shepperton  Studios,  in this  way getting  more  autonomy  from  producers  and potentially  developing  direct  access  to talent .    Maintaining  this audio  visual  growth  for the whole  industry  and for each  of its players  is an even   more  import ant challenge  in the post -Brexit  economy  as many  international  media  groups  have   their  headquarters  in the UK and may  now  reassess  this choice .    2.4.2.3.  Israel, the Drama Nation     Another  example  is Israel  and its leading  series  export  strategy  under  the “Drama  Nation ” flagship   brand . In an environment  with  few channels  (Keshet)  and two pay-tv operators  (Yes and Hot)  all  with  limited  budgets,  Israeli  producers  have  for years  conside red export s as an essential  revenue   stream  and authors  become  “showrunners”,  as they develop  expertise  to address  with  much   sensitivity  the universal  human  choices  and drama  contextualized  in a modern  life context  and  combine  it with  realistic  management  of production  constraints.  Local  production  skills  and  numerous  natural sets enable  them  to also produce  at competitive  costs  and timelines.   They  took  advantage  of the opportunity  during  the US scriptwriter  strike  in 2007  to develop  fast  sales  capabilities  in the US with  powerful,  original  and creative  themes  fitting  with  the network’s   differentiation  needs,  then  taking  the leadership  in fiction  format  imports  to the US (15 Israeli  series -  more  than  UK exports).  Israeli  format  adaptations  have  generated  worldwide  successes  like  “Homeland ” (adapted  from  “Hatufim ”) or “In Treatment ” (“Be’Tipul ” from  HOT  in 2005)  with  its  French  adaptation  expected  for 2020  (ARTE)  and being  the 40th local  format  adaptation  after  its  HBO  format  kick off in 2008.  Current  series  are co-produced,  like “Fauda ” (Netflix & Yes) or  “Possessions ” (Canal+  & Yes, 2020).     99 Article  advanced -television.com  20 September  2019,  Royal  Television  Society  Conference  speech  of Reed  Hastings,   Netflix’s  CEO  
     57    With  the new  OTT platform  demands  and also a new  generation  of international  series  producers   and talents  all over  Europe , this expertise  on export s will be challenged . Initiati ves like the Franco Israeli  co-writing  residency  for drama  series,  or collaboration s between  producers  like the Drama   Team  and the Federation  Entertainment  partnership  should  sustain  the leading  Drama  Nation   position  in this global  race.     2.4.2.4.  The Belg ium innovation s in series development     French -speaking  Belgium  came  late to the series  stage.  Used  to accompany ing the film industry  in  co-productions  mainly  with  executive  producers  skills  and financial  benefits  (tax shelter s), there was  not clearly  editorial  expertise  for series  until  2013  when  PSB RTBF,  the only  commissioner  for series   in French -speaking  Belgium,   anticipated  the growth  of OTT usage  and their  high  end series  needs   and decided  to develop  with  Fédération  Wallonie  Bruxelles  a dedicated  fund   considering  writing  as  the priority  with  a whole  set of measures  to make  it possible  for independent  producers  to  considerably  reduce  and even  erase  their  risk at the development  stage.  Their focus is on local   stories  highlighting  people  and communities’  singularities  in very  moody  artistic  treatments  to  satisfy  both  local  audiences  and series  addicts  abroad.   The success  of “La Trève ”, locally , but also on FTV in France  and Netflix  have proven  the efficiency   of this strategy  and the current  goal  is to deliver  4 series  per year.      In parallel,  training  on writing  and production  tools  are developed  to support  the whole  ecosystem   and truly make  Belgium  an innovative  series  leader . RTBF’s  colleagues  of the Flemish  part (PBS  VRT)   had more experience  in fiction  and their  next  move  could  be to join forces  with  RTBF  for a coproduction  together  which  would  be a first between  the two channels.      2.4.2.5.  Politica l shake up in France     With  strong  public  support  for the film and the audio -visual  industry  via many  public  funds  (national,   regional)  and support  rules  set up by the French  state  agency  Centre  National  du Cinéma  et de  l’image  animée  (CNC ), high -end series have  also been  identified  as a priority  for the coming  years.   Hence , OTT usage  is growing  fast after  a slow  start  and Netflix  today  gathers  more  subscribers  than   Canal+.    In parallel,  after  years  of domination  of US series  on TV, local  productions  now  have  the lead  (more   than  88 of the best  100 audiences  of primetime  TV were  French  productions  in 2017,  compared  to  only  37 in 2013)  offering  real opportunities  to local  producers.  More  than  everywhere  else,  the  problem  lies in increasing  production  value s in order  to compete  against   OTT series  and sustain  the  whole  ecosystem  in order  to avoid  US mono polies  from  platforms  and defend  the cultural   exception,  considered  as a political  priority.   CNC  today  supports  series with  dedicated  funds  and the intention  is to go further  and accompany   the high -end segment  with  international  expansion  ambitions.  Several  reports  from  professionals   notably  recommend  to enable  private  funding  and reorganize  the sector  with  more  transparency   and aligned  interests  between  all players.  The claim  is also to put writing  at the centre  of the  process,  in a country  historically  dominated  by the film director  and used  to a high ly subsidized  
     58    cinema  economy  whereas  the series  producer  needs  successful  sales  to produce  and audience   success  of on its season  1 to be able  to produc e a season  2 which  usually  bring s in the first profits100.    The first dedicated  measures  to series  represent , for the moment , only  5% of the fiction  funds , but  aim at growing  and pinpoint ing exclusively  high  end series  problematics:  focusing  on originals  and  not adaptations,  supporting  a season  2 before  closing  the financing  rounds  with  the channels  so  that the season  2 can be on the air less than 18 months  after  season  1, supporting  more  of the series   having  from  the beginning  international  partner s and also upcoming  measures  to help  writers  in  their  development  phases.    These  measures  are aligned  with  the commitment  of French  PSB FTV to develop  series  at the  international  level  with  the Alliance  agreements  between  FTV,  ZDF and RAI, the French  Italian  recent   series  fund  announcement  or locally  with  the project  of Salto,  competing  against  Netflix  with  FTV  being  a dynamic  co-founder.  They  take  place  whereas  the new  audio -visual  laws announced  for late  2019  will revise  many  rules  in the TV and production  sectors  in order  to increase  competiti vity of  local  players  and include  OTT players  in this framework , for example  with  investment  quotas  in  production.     2.4.2.6.  The “dizi” phenomenon in  Turkey101    Lastly,  Turkey  is an example  of a country  having  developed  a specific  format  finding  huge  worldwide   viewership,  but not necessarily  in Western  Europe  or in the US.     What  Turkey  produces  for television  are not soap  operas,  or telenovelas,  or period  dramas:  they   are “dizi”, sweeping  epics  with  each  episode  usually  running  up to two hours  or longer.  Every  dizi  has its unique  narratives,  its own  original  soundtrack,  and can have  up to 50 major  characters.  They   tend  be filmed  on location  in the heart  of historic  Istanbul,  only  using  studios  when  they  must.   With  dizis,  Turkey  is second  only  to the US in worldwide  TV distribution  – finding  huge  audiences  in  Russia,  China,  Korea  and Latin  America.  At present,  Chile is the largest  consumer  of dizi in terms  of  number  of shows  sold,  while  Mexico,  then  Argentina,  pay the most  to buy them.    The success  of this format  began  with  2006’s  “Binbir  Gece ” (1001  Nights)  which  was sold in almost   80 countries.  But the real kick off was with  “Magnificent  Century ”, claiming  when  it first aired  in  Turkey  in 2011  one-third  of the country’s  TV audience.  The foreign  press  called  it an “Ottoman -era  Sex and the City”  and compared  it to a real-life “Game  of Thrones ”. It had multiple  historical   consultants  and a production  team  of 130,  with  25 people  working  on costumes  alone.  “Magnificent   Century ” has been  seen  by more  than  500 million  people  worldwide.  It was the first “dizi “bought   by Japan.      Since  2002,  about  150 Turkish  “dizi” have  been  sold to more  than  100 countries,  including  Algeria,   Morocco  and Bulgaria . The international  success  of dizis is just one sign of the way new  forms  of    100 Dominique  Boutonnat  report  for the French  government,  December  2018,  and Alex  Berger’s  report  for the French   CNC,  2019     101 Article from the Guardian Sept19, Adapted from  New Kings of the World: Dispatches from Bollywood, Dizi and K Pop by Fatima Bhutto    
     59    mass  culture  from  the east  – from  Bollywood  to K-pop – can  challenge  the dominance  of American   & pop culture  in the 21st  century.      By 2023,  expectations  of worldwide  sales  are $500m,  downsized  by the recent  loss of the Middle   East market.  Remake  rights,  expansion  in Latin  America  and the opening  of western  Europe  –  notably  Italy  and Spain  – should  compensate  and raise  these  formats ’ awareness  in Europe.     2.4.3.  National measures  to frame OTTs developmen t:   OTT platforms  tend  to be out of the traditional  parameters  of economical  regulations  of the  audio visual  sector,  such  as quotas  and taxes.  These  regulations’  goal  is to redistribute  the benefits   and foster  a sustainable  and healthy  audio visual  secto r. Consequently,  European  states  are now   taking  measures  to frame OTTs  strong  growth  in order  to settle  new  rules  for sustainable  balance   between  all actors.  We will present  below  the four  main  action  levers  that states  have  been   traditionally  using  to regulate  the audio visual  sector,  and show how  OTTs  are impacted  or not by  these  regulations  and what  states  are doing to change  the situation.  Given  the highly  political  nature   of the subject,  which  is under  the spotlight  right  now,  it is difficult  to go into too many  details  and  we enco urage  readers  to follow  future  developments  closely.  The objective  of this part is to give  some  key elements  to understand  the situation.   • Tax content  providers’  sales  revenue  to support  the creation  of new  content:   o Most  countries  have  a national  audio visual  institution  in charge  of providing  public   support  to audio visual  projects,  and its funds,  or a part  of them,  are coming  from  a  tax on audio visual  broadcasters’  sales  income   o However,  OTTs, which  are content  provider s of a new  kind,  tend  to be out of the  scope  of the guidelines  for these  taxes,  which  have  been  set up, for the most  part,  before  the internet  even  appeared,  or at least  before  its explosive  growth .   o Therefore,  OTTs  don’t  pay such  taxes:  this represent  an important  loss of income,   especially  when  they  are capturing  a growing  portion  of the broadcasters’  total   audience  share  and by doing  so, threatening  the level  of advertising  income    Countries  are now  changing  the regulations  around  this tax, in order  to include  the OTTs  in  the guidelines.  This is also a good  occasion  to update  partially  obsolete  regulations  and  provide  new  common  ground  for both  Internet  and traditional  TV broadcasters.    o Example:  France   ▪ In France,  where  new  laws  are being  discussed  to regulate  the audio visual   sector,  there  is a plan  to reduce  the TVS (Tax  on Video  Services)  for all  broadcasters , but in the meantime  to include  OTTs in the tax base . For now,   streaming  and VOD  platforms  are only  taxed  at 2% versus  around  5-6% for TV  broadcasters.   ▪ This law also plans  to tweak  the rules  concerning  advertising  on traditional  TV  channel s in order  the make  them  more  competitive  with  Internet  actors,  who   can have  precisely  targeted  advertising  for example.   o Example:  Canada   ▪ Canada is thinking  of extending  the Quebec  tax (TVQ  at 9,75%)  that has  already  been  set up for OTTs  and streaming  platforms  to the rest of the  country.  
     60      • Prevent  large  companies  with  a digital  activity  (especially  FAANG)  from  dodging  corporate   taxes  in the country where  they  operate:   o It is well known  that international  companies,  and especially  FAANG -like companies   with  mainly  digital  activities,  tend  to dodge  corporate  taxes  with  complex  tax  optimization,  exploiting  loopholes  and compe tition  between  countries.   o Google,  Amazon,  Apple  and other  FAANG -like companies  are increasing  their  activity   in the audio -visual  sector,  even  when  it was not their  core  activity  from  the start.  This  generate s unfair  competition  between  traditiona l audio visual  actors  of the sector   who  are complying  with  tax laws  and these  new  ones  who  have  the resources  to  navigate  around  the tax laws.     States  are taking  measures  to make  sure  FAANG -like companies  will pay corporate  taxes.   The first goal  of thes e measures  is of course  to increase  state  revenue,  but also to bring  fair  competition  between  players.    o Example:  France   ▪ France  is working  on a “taxe  GAFA”  (“FAAG  tax”)  to tax international  digital   companies  making  most  of their  revenue  with  advertisement s, based  on their  local  turnover .  ▪ For now,  Netflix  isn’t  included  in the guidelines  because  it doesn’t  have   advertis ing activity,  but we could  expect  an enlargement  of the scale  of this  measure.   ▪ Even  if this measure  isn’t  directly  aimed  toward  the protection  of the audio visual  fair competition,  it could  bring  a positive  side effect .  o Example:  Europe   ▪ Germany  or Italy  are following  the French  initiative  with  similar  taxes,  and  now  it is being  discussed  at the European  Union  level  to establish  new   European  guidelines .  ▪ The USA which at first criticized  this approach  is now  thinking  of adopting  a  similar  one.     • Investing  in local  production s to benefit  from  some  advantages  and agreements   o Broadcaster  licenses  are often  linked  to obligations  like inves ting a significant  part of  their  sales  revenue  in national  audio visual  production s. In return,  they  usually  can  benefit  from  advantages,  such  as a shorter  media  window  before  being  allowed  to  broadca st a feature  film or greater  access  to public  fundin g.  o OTT platforms  do not have  to apply  to such  TV licenses  and with  their  US origins  they   were  initially  more  likely  to invest  in English  speaking  productions  made  in the US,  Canada  or the UK and finance  their  original  series  and films  alone .   o Howeve r, OTTs  are perceiving  the appeal  to viewers  of locally  produced  series  and  films,  so they  are increas ingly  considering  investing  in local  productions .   States,  institutions  and corporations  are now  thinking  of finding  ways  to commit  OTTs   investment  in local  production   
     61    o Example:  France   ▪ In France,  broadcasters  complying  with  the rule of local  investment s can  benefit  from  a better  audio -visual  window  timeline s and receive  public  fund   support .   ▪ Now  the regulation  is changing,  especially  the window  before  a feature  film  can be broadcast  on SVOD  platform s for companies  complying  with  the  agreement,  in order  to raise  the interest  of OTT platforms.  In the new   agreement  (“Loi  audiovisuelle  2020”) , OTT platforms  would  have to spen d at  least  16%  of their  sales  revenue  made  in France  on French  production s.  • Quota:  Obligation  to have  a percentage  of local  production  in the catalogue:   o One other  way to support  local  production  is to set up a quota  of locally  produced   work  in the catalog ue of broadcasters.  Many  countries  have  such  regulation s, but  they  mostly  apply  to traditional  TV broadcasters .  o With  their  international  nature,  and mostly  US origins,  OTTs  tend  to have  a large   catalogue  of international  series  and films  that they  produced  in English  or bought  in  different  countries.  Consequently,  they  often  don’t  comply  with  the quota .   State s tend to make  these  types  of quota s mandatory  also for OTT platforms.  This fits with   their  goal  of having  a wider  offer  of locally  produced  series  and films,  because,  as said before,   it is what  the viewers  are looking  for and it is reinforcing  the local  production  economy.   o Example:  France   ▪ In France,  TV Broadcasters  must  have  60%  of their  broadcast  work  produced   in Europe,  and 40%  in French  language.    o Example:  European  Union  - Audio visual  Media  Services  Directive  (AVMSD)   ▪ In November  2018,  the EU finalized  the revision  of the AVMS  Directive   ▪ This revised  directive  is setting  up minimum  quota  of 30%  of European   production  in the catalog ue of SVOD  platforms  and they  must  assure   “prominence”  (good  visibility)  of such  content . They  have  2 years  to comply   with  it. The Graph  following  underlines  the expected  gap of local  content   needed  to be fulfill ed by OTT players.  They  can of course  just buy European   content  and circulate  it but local  demand  is so high  that local  production  is  also going  to be stimulated.   ▪ This would  only  be a minimum,  and members  States  might  set up higher   quotas  for SVOD  services  located  in their  country  (and  distributing  in other   European  countries  who  will have  to comply  with  these  quotas).   
     62      Estimated  percentage  of local  content  proportion  per platform  and country,  to be compared  to the  30%  quota  fixed  by the AVMS  directive.   Source : Ampere  Analysis,  Series  Series  keynote  July 2019       ➔ An increasing  number  of measures  are being  taken  to check  the growth  of OTT broadcasters  and  make  sure  traditional  TV broadcasters  are treated  equally,  but the revamp  of the old-fashioned   regulatory,  quota  and tax framework  will take  some  time.  Another  aspect  of the  high  growth  of OTT  broadcasters  is the recent  production  cost inflation  as Netflix,  Amazon  or HBO  are making  the studio   prices  of the skyrocket  by exploiting  most  of the talented  workforce  available  to produce  more  and  more  costly  series.  Faced  by this inflation,  traditional  audio -visual  actors  have  had difficult  times   keep ing up.        
     63      Key Findings of  Chapter 2     In the last few years,  European  media  marke ts have  been  deeply  affected  by new  demands  from  TV  users  migrating  to multi -screen,  personalized  and non-linear  video  usage.  New  non-linear  offers   sustained  by strong  marketing  and massive  content  investments  have  almost  reached  10%  of users’   TV viewing  shares  and are currently  growing  everywhere  with  positive  but differ ent growth  rates   between  countries.     Prioritized  by Subscription  Video  On Demand  (SVOD)  new  entrants,  International  Series  have  been   used  to build  differentiation  and loyalty  to their  servi ces in all age groups.  Local  free broadcasters,   pay TV, and telecommunication  operators  have  also joined  this trend  to compete  against  the SVODs   and retain  their  audiences  in particular  based  on their  viewers  growing  interest  in local  stories.   “Glocal ” (local stories  made  for a global  audience)  premium  series  with  international  distribution   potential  have  thus  become  a growing  strategical  segment  in the European  media  market.     Local  producers  and distributors  have  addressed  this booming  demand  but have  also had to face   several  challenges  to benefit  from  this opportunity.  OTT platforms  (global  providers  such  as Netflix   or Amazon)  tend  to impose  new  busines s models  considering  producers  as servicing  companies,   grabbing  all rights  and ownership  in return  for higher  upfront  payments.      In these  new  business  models,  talents  become  scarcer  for other  media  players  because  they  can be  captured  directly  by platform s through  exclusive  contracts.  Distributors  may  also see their  sales   revenues  in danger  of falling  becaus e worldwide  rights  deals  can be done  directly  by platform   players  or media  groups  which  can internalize  all aspects  of the deal.      On their  side,  broad casters  can’t  finance  projects  on their  own  anymore  due to higher  budgets  and  as such,  are trying  new  strategies  to join forces  (including  co-productions,  joint  ventures,  and  alliances)  opening  to producers  a new  central  position  as coordinators  of these  international  cooperations.  This dynamic  market  will be even  more  stimulated  by the upcoming  arrival  of new  players  such  as Disney+  or HBO  Max  who  are themselves  reacting  to Netflix  or Amazon ’s threats  of  predominance.     Institutions  start  to support  this segment  at the European,  national  and regional  levels  but with  far  less support  than  in the cinema  industr y. Tax shelters  or the European  Commission's  Creative   Europe  - Media  Sub-programme  support  are nevertheless  becoming  essential  financing   mechani sms in these  projects.  Development  phases  still remain  fragile,  but they  are very  important   in achieving  full international  potential.  Some  countries’  best  practices  are leading  the way:  the  recent  French  political  impulse,  the Belgi an initiatives  financin g almost  100%  of the development   phases,  or the Danish  focus  on the writing  phase,  all of them  aiming  to find growing  international   sales  opportunities  as already  addressed  by the UK or Israel  media  industries.  Institutions  work   fiscally  and at the legisla tive level  with  quotas,  obligations  of investment  in local  production  and  taxation  on SVOD  services , currently  in discussion  or in deployment  as permitted  by the AVMSD   (Audio -visual  Media  Services  Directive).        
     64    3. Analysis of the series  sector needs     This part analyses the key levers for European players to develop their series with healthy business  rules and  sufficient regard for  diversity and cultural pluralism. B ut before, here are a few case  studies showcasing some of the new production rules for success .    3.1. Commercial and editorial practice and needs     3.1.1.  Case studies with insights:     • “La Casa  De Papel ” phenomenon  (English  title “Money  Heist ”)      For three seasons , “La Casa de Papel ” is the stor y of a team of eight criminals holding 67 hostages  at the Royal Mint of Spain as they print the billions of Euros with which they hope to eventually  abscond.   From the start, “La Casa de Papel ” was a hit with viewers in its nati ve Spain. Mo re than four million  viewers watched its premiere, almost double the number of its closest competitor.  The multi dimensional characters, the narrative tension, the unique design and sets, the special attention to  female characters made a n innovative turnin g point for Spanish TV, with some journalists comparing  the show to Quentin Tarantino’s “Reservoir Dogs ”.   Though it was created for Spain’s Antena 3 network and intended as a limited series, its popularity  and worldwide pot ential caught the  eye of Netflix, which acquired it, re -edited it (from 70min to  52min per episode), dubbed it, and began streaming it in December 2017. “La Casa de Papel ” soon  became the service’s most -watched non -English -language series. In April 2018, it  even topped  “Stranger Things ” streams in the US and worldwide . Its success also prompted Netflix to sign a global  production deal with “La Casa de Papel ” creator, Alex Pina, and is  credited with helping the  streaming service to become a worldwide phenomenon , with brands cre ating special events and  fans developing huge social buzz. In fact, “La Casa de Papel ” is doing something even bigger: it’s  setting the bar for TV drama s that can appeal not just to its culture of origin, but to everyone.   And this was init ially a local broadcaster production proving European creativity in writing and  producing, but also the risk for broadcasters is to lose this credit as the show is in everyone’s mind  as a “Netflix Original”. Since then, Atresmedia (the own er of Antena 3) announced on 20 September  2019 during the San Sebastian International Film festival the creation of a content factory with  Telefonica -Movistar to produce films and series  with international ambitions as an alternative to  OTT productions.

     67    • “My Brilliant Friend/ L’Amica Geniale ” - 2018                       One season,  8 episodes of 50 minutes                           “My Brillia nt Friend ” is a RAI Fiction -HBO and TIMVISION series and a Wildside -Fandango  Production. It is produced by Lorenzo Mieli and Mario Gianani for Wildside and by Domenico  Procacci for Fandango (who initially brought the rights), in collaboration wit h RAI Fic tion, TIMVISION  and HBO Entertainment, and in co -production with Umedia. This series  received support from   Creative Europe. Oscar -winning director Paolo Sorrentino and Jennifer Schuur are the executive  producers. Fremantle is the in ternational distributor in association with RAI Com and  this  production has achiev ed sales in  more than 50 territories.   Synopsis   “My Brilliant Friend ” is the adaptation of the first book of Elena Ferrante’s successful quadr ology. It  is the long , passionate story of a Neapolitan friendship. World War Two has ended  and t wo young  girls from a working -class neighbourhood, Lila and Lenù, form a bond that last years, accompanying  their growth, dreams, difficulties, crossroads in life, choices and d ifferent destinies. It's a strong,  stubborn bond that never breaks.   The people  around them are lively, generous, angry, supportive and savage: families, fathers and  mothers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, neighbours, allies and enemies.   Part of its success is in its setting, in all its different aspects: places, habits, cu stoms and everyday  routine. The unmistakeably Italian world of working -class Naples is brought to life in all its splendour  and is the focus of the series : immersing th e audience in the atmosphere of the time required an  unusual effort on settings, casting and language options. Choosing the cast especially with two  heroines took director Saverio Costanzo eight months and about 8,000 auditions to find them.  Choosing diale cts as the series  language made the setting of the story plausible and was accepted  for the first time by HBO and RAI.   
     68    Elena Ferrante constantly took part in the screenplay alongside Costanzo, Francesco Piccolo and  Laura Pao lucci, adding  notes and stepping in with original tips that fit well into the context of a  series .    In summary, it is a series born of the Italian literary tradition and its ability to tell universal stories.                           A successful series   “My Brilliant Fri end” was on air in Italy on Rai1 from 27 November 2018 to 18 December 2018. It  got unique average viewing figures of 7.1 million and 30% of the audience share. On RaiPlay, Rai's  catch -up service, episodes averaged 5.3 m illion views after being up for just six weeks.   The series  had a great success also abroad with best performing foreign language drama on Sky and  excellent critics. A season 2 is now in production.     Insights   - This serie s is a unique, creative example of private and public broadcaster collabor ation,  making possible great production value (30M budget) serving the novel without  compromise , and the universality of its themes in a strong and preserved local identity.   - It also shows that local broadcasters can achieve world class pro ductions in accordance with  their tradition of public service - in this case,  narrating Italy and the diversity of  the country’s  territory. It is a way to deliver the best quality to its audience, export the Italian audio -visual   soft power while  managing to keep their local budget , thanks to  international production  financing (RAI paid less than half  of the overall production budget).                               
     69    • “Cannes  Confidential ” (under  development)                              A 10 x one -hour             “blue -sky” crime procedural                   (2020)         Created by Chris Murray (BBC “Midsomer Murders ”, Acorn TV’s “Agatha Raisin ”) and Patrick Nebout  (Canal +/ SVT’s “Midnight Sun ”, TV4 -ZDF's “Agent Hamilton ”), “Cannes Confidential ” is a 10 x 1  hour  high -concept “blue -sky” detective series revolving around  the sparring attraction  between  gutsy ,  no-nonsense  detective C amille Caron  (early 30s) and charming international conman H arry King   (mid 30s) when they are thrown together to solve crimes on the French riviera.    The series aspires to “Moonlighting ” in terms of wit and character, “The Night Manager ” in terms  of style and scale and “La La Land ” in terms of look and tone.      Insights    “Cannes Confidential ” is an atypical set -up, paving the way for a new wave of European projects :  • It is t he initiative of one producer (Dramacorp, a Beta Film Group company)  with no main  commissioning broadcaster. The producer has identified a marketing and editorial gap in the  marketplace, with the increasing lack of “lighter” crime series for European and international  audiences.  This way, the p roducer retains  control of the development for as long as possible, so as   not to depend on one main commissioning broadcaster. The development is funded internally until  the project is ready to be  shopped /pitched to the market a s a compelling  package. The idea is to  build the financing plan around two big pre -sale/coproducing broadcasters  and limit the number of  editorial voices around the table, then complete the financing through International distribution MG,  tax incentives (France’s 30% TRIPP), and po tentially  smaller deficit financing by the dis tributor or a  studio.    • The product o f a unique collaboratio n/partnership with a local public player (City of Cannes) . A series  filmed entirely in Cannes, boosting the local/ regional economy as well as  film TV production  industry , jobs and infrastructure. This win -win partnership between the city and the production  company illustrates how series projects can involve local economical and institutional partners in  Europe . With so many brands and places of interest to explore , this approach  has attraction potential  on the international market.   • A new generation of European series, with a simple pitch and proposition, shot in the English language, involving a mix of European talents (UK writer, Scandinavian d irector) but avoiding the  “Euro -pudding” risk.   3.1.2.  Focus on four main issues     
     70    3.1.2.1.  The US copyright model now e xpand ing in Europe and setting up new  rules     Apart  from  the recent  international  segment , series  are dealt  with  like any scripted  content  with  the  local  broadcasters : either  with  an independent , external  producer  (sometimes  it is even an  obligation  to protect  independent  producers  like in France  or Italy)  or internally,  and this is still the  case  today  for most  programming.   In many cases  the broadcaster  finances  the majority  of the  production  (even  from  the beginning ), with  specific  writing  funding . The production  deficit -financing   is filled  by public  support  and/or residual  distribution  deal  while  the production  margin  is left for  the producer.  The real part of the negotiation  lies in the rights  left to the producer , for him/her  to  generate  revenues  on the Intellectual  Property  (IP) through  international  sales,  format  sales,  other   windows  like SVOD,  etc. In many  cases,  the predominance  of the broadcasters  financin g leaves little   to the producer  if anything  (in this case,  the producer  is a supplier).    With  high  end series,  the broadcasters  can’t  finance  the necessary  higher  production  value  by  themselves . This is where  producers  have  an opportunity  to increase  their  role in the project  by  being  the intermediary , setting  up the financing  round  and distributing  percentages  of the upcoming   revenues  in function  of the importance  of each  player  (rights  claim ed per window  and territory,   arrival  in the project , and consequent  risk assessment).  The producer  is then  the main  project  manager  of the series,  he/she  is responsible  for seeing  the project  through , maximiz ing the  monetizatio n of it (for the partners  he/she  gathered ) and for his own  venture.  Producers  with  the  capacit y to cover  the deficit -financing  (until  the money  is paid  back,  oftentimes  from  a second   season  or international  sales)  are privileged . Because  of this,  it is importan t to develop  coproductions  with  a “richer”  producer  as a financial  partner , be part of a group  (independent  or not),  or to investigate   new  financing  tools  (for insta nce, Venture  Capital  funds  like IPR.VC  in Finland   already  spending  26%  of their  fund s on series).  The more  they  finance  these  gaps  and take  risks, the  less they  give away  (in percentages ) to partners , and therefore  the more  revenue  they  make  if it is  well executed . This brings  more  investment  capabilities , the ability  to take  more  risks  on the next   production  and so on.    On the other  side,  broadcasters  get to keep  a percentage  of the IP rights  and that perce ntage   increase s if they  use internal  production  capabilities  with  a capacity  to financially  engineer  these   productions  and use also an internal  distribution  entity:  Canal+ , for instance , orders  international   series  from  external  producers  but also from  its internal  production  companies  (present  in 6  territories ). When possible,  they  also give mandates  to their  distribution  company  to sell rights  out  of the Pay-TV footprint  (just  like HBO  does,  as an editor,  a producer  and a distributor).  The result  is  that that they  can benefit  from  the series  rights  for their  channels  (while  maintaining  good  editorial   control  at a good  price ) and from  monetization  by the distributor(s)  all along  the sales cycle  of the  series .  This opportunity  for producers  is partially  endangered  by the models  utilized  by one of their  most   important  new  clients,  namely  the OTT platforms.  These  platforms  commission  series   differently .  They either:    - purchase   the series  before  or after  production  (still  83%  of the hours  of TV seasons  on  Netflix)   - coproduce  with  other  broadcasters  and keep  exclusive  rights  for a list of territories   (increasing  betw een 2017  and 2019  from  3,8 to 6,6%  of the hours  of TV seasons  on Netflix) 
     71    - or produce  entirely  for themselves  and usually  calling  these  series  “originals”  (even  if there   are many  cases  baptized  this way and being  in fact a co-production  or even  a purch ase. For  example,  “La Casa  de Papel ” was initially  an Antena  3 production,  “Call my Agent ” is the  French  FTV production  “Dix pour  Cent ”). On Netflix,  this category  has jump ed from  5,6 to  10,2%  of the hours  of TV seasons  in 2019  and benefits  from  the biggest  marketing  pushes  of  the platform.102     In this last case,  they  usually  claim  the full rights  to it (all windows  and territories , in perpetuity ) like  studios  in the US have  done  for years  (the full period  of copy right ).  So, once  the deal  is done  with   the producer,  there  is no chance  for extra  revenues.  Hence  a better  margin  on the production   budget  is usually  conceded  to include  all these  missed  revenue  opportunities.   This model  is not  new,  it is also appli ed in US studios’  output  deals  with  the most  sought -after  talents in Hollywood   (actors,  scriptwriters,  and film directors ).   This is what  may  also happen  for European  talents,  where  OTT platforms  would  negotiate  these   agreements  with  writers  (including  the literary  industry),  directors,  demanded  technicians  (like  directors  of photography ) and bypassing  producers.  Some  OTTs  start  to have  these  discussions  in  the marke t with  the (rarely  experie nced) showrunners , or start  to take  over  production  facilities   which  could  be the beginning  of a studio  model.    Of course,  there  is no way to ban these  practices  but if talents  have  fair alternatives,  they  will be  independe nt and have  multiple  clients  (like showrunners  have  done  in the US). In additi on, there   are several  negotiations  taking  place, one example  being  in Denmark  (Create  Denmark  union)   between  the unio ns and platforms  to shorten  the rights  licens ing and leave  more  IP to the local   talent s103.   In a continent where the author s rights collection system prevails, switching to a model with no  long -term revenues  would need to re-evaluate th e overall  business models  in place  (and  the survival  of some players like independent distri butors) and imagine compensation s for several players in the  ecosystem to enable fair and growing business for ea ch. M easures could be discussed at collective  levels , like unions , to avoid unbalanced negotiations between small players (like independent  producers ) and giant platforms.     3.1.2.2.  Talent protection and grow th    Writing  is crucial  in series  projects,  espec ially in this very  demanding  international  series  segment .  More so than  in cinema  where  the film director  is usually  a guarantee  of success.  For this,  authors   need  to benefit  from  training,  resources  and motivation  to deliver  the best  work  in a close   partn ership  with  the producer  and the film director.  While  these  conditions  have  been  negotiated   for years  in the US by the local  unions  (the Writers  Guild  of America104 most  notably),  the situation   in Europe  is rather  fragmented,  the importance  of writing  is often  under -valued  and authors   regularly  complain  about  job insecurity,  instability  of income,  and poor  revenues  (if not unpaid   work ).    102 Ampere  Analysis  Series  Series  July 19  103 http://createdenmark.dk/   104 Download  the WGA  code  of working  rules  at https://www.wga.org/members/membership information/co nstitution/working -rules  
     72      What  do writing  tasks  represent  and what  is the profile  of a standard  European  TV author105 ?  Over 30,000  contracts  are signed  each  year  for the writing  and directing  of 11,600  episodes  of  television  fiction  and 1,700  feature  length  films  in Europe  (26 countries).  This copyright  material  is  at the base  of an industry  that employs  more  than  1.2 million  Europeans.    The profile  of a median  audio -visual  author  is:   - 46 years  old, Master’s  Degree,  has been  working  as an author  for 16 years.    - working  45 hours  a week  and 80 % of his or her income  is generated  as an audio -visual   author:  €19,000  after  tax, to be compared  with  $73,090 in the US106.  - 85 % of audio -visual  authors  work  freelance;  36%  of the audio -visual  authors  are female    Audio -visual authors, by definition, create copyright /author ’s rights by creating original work.   Varying considerably fro m one  Member State to another, authors generally have two main  sources of income:   - upfront payments at contract signature or during the life of the contract . This can include their  work in creation, payment for the transfer of rights to contractual c ounte rpart, advance  payment , or a buy-out for share of future exploitation revenues   - subsequent secondary payments for repeat screenings of the work (e.g. share of exploitation  revenues), and compensation for copyright exceptions.   This essential second s ource  of income stems from two major rights that are collectively  managed and result  in secondary payments for audio -visual authors in Europe: cable  retransmission (Directive 93/83/EEC  superseded  and modernized by the 2019 Copyright  Directive ) and pr ivate copying in the countries where levies exist. On a country by country basi s,  other secondary rights are administered collectively and result in additional payments that are  rather important for TV broadcasting in particular (on -demand uses, video  sales, rental and  public lending, educational uses, etc.).   Secondary  payments  provide  a continuous  stream  of income  to audio -visual  authors  over  the years,   based  on the success  of their  work.  They  even  out their  income  flow  in a very  unstable  enviro nment ,  and often  produce  an income  in later  stages  of their  careers.           105 Research commissioned in 2018 over 26 European countries and 3217 participants, by BVR Services GmbH from  CuDOS at University of Ghen t on behalf of FERA – Federation of European Film Directors and FSE – Federation of  Screenwriter s in Europe, with the financial support of AIPA, ALCS, VG Bild Kunst, LIRA, Norsk Filmforbund, SAA, SACD,  SGAE, SSA   106 2018 Bureau of Labor Statistics – Average annual wages Writers and Authors  
     73    What  problems  do international  series  bring  to the stage ?  The main  issue  is just to consider  more  than  ever  the important  role of writing  in these  very   demanding  formats  that satisfy both local  and international  audiences.      The arrival  of OTT platforms  has introduced  more  revenue  opportunities,  fast decision -making , a  real value attributed  to authors  (today  most  platforms ’ talent  deals  are done  with  authors),  and also  a competition  from  the advanced  US industry  used  to evolve  production  processes  and specific   rules.    • Hence , the necessity  of more  investment  in this phase:  in Europe,  series  budget s usually   dedicate  5 % for writing  (3,9%  in France,  around  6% in Germany)  while US series  invest  10%.   All players  involved  in a production  should  provide  for and finance  this crucial  stage  better .  More  investment  means  adjusted  payment  of the authors  for the work  they  provide.  In some   territories , like France,  authors  usually  just get payment  advances  on their  upcoming  rights   (and  no monthly  fee during  their  development  work  on a full-time  basis) . It is then  common   for them to get 10%  of their  fees for effectively  more  than  50%  of the work  being  done , as  most  of the fees are split  on a long  period  during  which  they  no longer  act (production,   release).    Some  development  work  is not even  paid  (which  is also true  for film direc tors)  and puts them   at risk in the event  the project  is not greenlighted  by the commissioner.  This is discouraging   risk-taking  on creativity.  Some  countries  (DR in Denmark,  ZDF in Germany,  YLE in Finland ,  etc.) have  developed  interesting  practices  to address  this,  for example,  ensuring  authors  a  monthly  payment  during  the development  period  (to be reimbursed  by the new   commissioner  to the one that paid  in case  he/she  has not greenlighted  the project ).    There  would  be an interest  to share  and try adapting  them  to improve  the author’s  overall    treatment  and maximize  investments  during  the upfront  writing  phase.  There  is also a need   to include  authors  in the negotiations  with  OTT platforms  (as describ ed in the previous   chapter ). As pointed  out by several  interviewed  producers  and authors,  collection  of  royalties  on author’s  rights  by collective  management  societies  provide s less revenues  and  transparency  when  compared  to US WGA  rules.  • It is also a very  demanding  new  format  with  a lot of skilled  worldwide  competition  using   different,  innovative  methods  to ensure  solid  and scalable  character /plot writing.  The more   long  and complex  the series  is, the less it is possible  for one author  to embrace  it all.  Collective  writing  with  strict  organization  is used  in advanced  industries  like in the US or the  UK and have  start ed to be used  in continental  Europe  (i.e. Nordic  countries  or “le Bureau  des  Légendes ” with  its “ADES”  method).    Different  models  exist  and have  proven  their  efficiency  (the US model  relies on a duo  showrunner /producer  whereas  some  European  configurations  prefer  a trio between  a “head   writer”,  film director , and producer).  There  is therefore  more  need  than  ever  to train   European  authors  on the subject  of collective  writing  and “showrunning”  (or “head  writing” )  and adapt  to these  new  methods . In doing  so, we will no longer  have  two categori es of  writers:  the over -demanded  ones  with  experience  and methods  (like  the UK showrunners)   and the others  lost in these new  rules  and miss ed opportunities.    With  a convergence  happening  between  cinema  and series,  accompanying  the numerous   European  film talents  in this series  world  is a real challenge , but also a clear  opportunity.  
     74    This is true  of film scriptwriters  but also of film directors  sharing  many  common  points  with   authors.        Finally,  training  should  also include  the English  lang uage  as many  potential  showrunner s’  careers  need  fluent  English  to guarantee  efficient  communications  with   producers /commissioners  and, more  generally , international  crew  members;  in countries   like Italy , for instance,  this is an obstacle  .   • In ecosystem s more  complex  than  local  traditional  commissioning,  authors  should  be more   involved  in the overall  production  process  and collaborative  with  the film director  and  producer  in order  to create  their  series  in the best  conditions.  Many  authors  complain  they   don’t  really  get to discuss  their  projects  with  commissioners.  Oftentimes,  however,  they  are  reluctant  to go on stage  and take  part in on set rewritings  during production  as their   contract s do not mention  it. Again,  all these  processes  are perfectly  well explained  and  adhered  to in more  advanced  industries . For years,  US guilds  have  negotiated  in  transparency  the rights, work  timing  and obligations  of each  stakeholder  to produce  the  highest  quality  content  with  minimal  delays , striving  to meet  the demand  for one season  per  year.      Sharing best practices, running collective negotiatio ns, and publishing guidelines all together  (authors, film directors, producers, commissioners, even distributors) would be important steps  for European talents  to seize  this market opportunity, work better together and to be considered  more than just “suppliers  cheaper than  the States” , given that European audio -visual industries  have been among the best in the world  thus far .    3.1.2.3.  The need for European platforms to ensure competitiveness and  pluralism     With  the growing  impor tance  of OTT platforms  in Europe  and the arrival  of new  ones  (AppleTV+,   Disney+,  HBO  Max,  Peacock , etc.), each  country  setting up local  rules  for its media  environment  will  have  to take  into account  and apply  the same  rules  and obligations  to avoid  unfair  competition.    Local implementation  of the European  AVMS  directive  will, for instance , be the occasion  for each   country  to apply  a minimum  level  of European  content  exposition  and re-evaluate  its positions   towards  author s rights,  protectio n of independent  production , or investment  in local  productions.   Obligations  for investment  in local  production  is under  implementation  in several  countries , e.g.  France,  preparing  for a minimum  of 16%  of local  revenues  to be invested  in local production  with   its new  audio -visual  law.   In the US, foreign  producers  and media  groups  must  comply  with  local  rules . Europe  needs  to  develop  a reciprocal  rule,  taking  into account  the importance  it accords  to cultural  pluralism  and  the protectio n of authors  rights .  But this isn’t  enough  to guarantee  a fair new  media  environment.  Scalability  is a clear  necessity  so  that bigger  local  platforms  can emerge  and benefit  from  similar  volume  to be able  to obtain  similar   business  conditions  and capable  of prod ucing  produce  competitive  high -end series.  Reciprocally,   authors  and producers  need  more  than  2 giant  clients  to build  their activities  in fair conditions.  
     75          Today,  the advantage  is more  on the side of OTT players.  In the UK alone,  Netflix  and Amazon  made   €1,24bn  revenues  with  their  SVOD  services,  more  than  twice  the revenues  by all local  channels ’  SVOD/catch  up services.  Netflix has more  subscribers  than  Sky, and Netflix  and Amazon  have  over   3 times  more  online  content  than  BBC iPlaye r and Sky Now  TV.    It is high  time  to react  and PSBs  can play an important  role here  as there is less competition  amongst   themselves  when  compared  to private  media  (Mediaset  and RTL operate  for instance  commercial   channels  in several  countries) . They can also negotiate  specific  budgets  with  their  respective   authorities  for “political”  projects  and they  usually  have  significant  dialogue  with  and valuable   access  to the netw ork of local  talents.  Most  of the time , they are also editorial  lead ers in their   countries  where  they  can launch  trends.  Successful  territories  with  their  series  on the international   stage  often  have  a powerful  local  PSB behind  the scene s (BBC,  DR, SVT,  ZDF).    This is why  the first set of initiatives  emphasi ses the important  participation  of PSBs:   - Alliances  on co-productions , like the one between  FTV,  RAI and ZDF.  By screening  projects   togeth er and going  in on them  with  at least  two commissioners,  costs  are divided  by two  and budgets  can increase  to serve  production  value.  Another  example  is Nordic12 , gatheri ng  Nordic  broadcasters  with  similar  objective s.  - Development  of platf orms  also involving  other  local  (commercial)  broadcasters  to develop   SVOD  services  with  possible  business  models , mixing  SVOD  and advertising  revenues  (like  the HULU  service  in the USA,  the upcoming  French  service  Salto,  LOVESTV  in Spain , or Britbox   involv ing BBC and ITV in the UK).  ARTE  is even  proposing  to set up a streaming  service   bringing  together  the “best  of European  public  channels”  in multiple  languages,  with  an  initial  focus  on documentaries  and magazine  programming  but including  fiction  at a later  stage.   In addition,  there  are several  private  capitalistic  moves  from  local  media  groups  in order  to get  bigger  internationally  (for example,  Mediaset  taking  10%  in Prosieben),  enlarge  their  advertising   networks  (i.e. joint  venture  between  competito rs RTL and Prosieben) , or develop  SVOD  offers   (Discovery  and Prosieben  launching  Joyn  service).   Being  able  to work  together,  with  or without  capitalistic  links,  in order  to create  alternatives  to  American  OTT players  in European  TV audiences  and especia lly for the youngest  audiences  is a  serious  issue  for Europe  in order  to develop  its media  industry  and preserve  its pluralism.  series  may   be one part of the solution  as co-productions  pave  the road  to international  cooperation.                      
     76      Key Findings o f the chapte r 3.1     As highlighted  in the several  cases  studies  presented  in the report,  there  is a need  from  all players   to work  at the institutional  and European  level  to ensure  fair conditions  and growth  in this strategic   segment,  in complianc e with  Euro pean values  on cultur al pluralism  and freedom  of expression.      Preserving  content  ownership  for producers  as much  as possible  in global  productions  involving  OTT  platforms  is a primary  challenge,  as platforms  models  dictate  full copyright  transfer  (as inhe rited  from  US studio  methods)  and acceptable  only  where  unions  have  precisely  negotiated  all the  conditions  necessary  to defend  talents  and producers.  As author ’s rights  prevails  in Europe,  this  requirement  has to be adapted  and integrated  in collective  negotiations  with  platforms.     With  international  series  giving  more importance  to the development  and writing  phases,   transparent  and fair commercial  and working  rules  should  be established  between  all stakeholders.   This is in order  to achieve  high  quality  at optimized  costs  and enable  writing  talent  fair compensation   and living  means,  which  today  are far below  US standards.  This implies  investment  is needed  more   in the early  stages,  along  with  training  and development  (notably  the new  “showrunning”  role)  and  adaptive  financial  treatments.     The ability  to avoid  monopolies  on OTT/SVOD  distribution  by a few US OTT platforms  is also a  condition  to preserve  European  cultural  pluralism  and enable  fair conditions  for producers  and  other  stakeholders.  Current  allianc es initiated  by allied  TV companies  for shared  production  and  local  OTT platforms  projects  are paving  the way and should  be further  encouraged.     3.2. First Analysis on the Impact of the Public Support Systems series     The series  production  sector  is quickly  chan ging, new  measures  are being  taken  by public  actors  at  different  levels  and private  companies  are reshaping  their  strategies.  Even  if most  of the series   support  programs  are very  recent  and no in-depth  analysis  has been  made  already  on their  impact,   it is possible  to perceive  a few trends  and relevant  points.  This report  collects  feedback  and figures   from  a few public  funds  (the regional  fund  Pictanovo  in France,  Canada  Media  Fund,  Creative  Europe   MEDIA,  the Estonian  Film Institute  and the Finnish  Film  Foundation),  a sample  of Eurimages   representatives  (through  an online  questionnaire) , and other  various  actors  of the sector  (see  interviews  list).  The goal  of this part is to sum  up the impact  of public  support  on series  production,   what  the trends  are and what  is still lacking.       • The series  sector  is in a concentration  phase:  fewer  projects  are being  made , but each  of  them  require  more  funds  than  before  in order  to reach  the new  quality  standards,  set by the  “high -end series”  of the big conten t providers  (HBO,  Netflix,  Amazon , etc.).  o For example,  the Canada  Media  Fund  told us they  are reducing  the number  of  project s they  support , but are granting  more  money  for each  in order  to keep  up with   the standards  of big content  providers.  This is a trend  we have  perceived  in much of  the feedback .  
     77    • Most  public  funds  for series  are not funded  enough  to support  high  end series  in Europe,   and the new  standard  of high  end series  tend s to make  top financing  from  private  investors   mandat ory.  o The financing  mix of public  fund  + National  Broadcaster  is no longer  adapted  to  ambitious  high -end series  project s. These type s of project s now  tend  to require  a top  financing  of 20-40%  from  big private  international  broadca sters  (HBO,  Sky, Netflix,   etc.)  • The development  phase  does  not receive  enough  public  funding,  even  as the phase  where   it could  be the most  efficient  and where  private  investment s are lacking  because  of high  risk.    o The development  phase  is critical to build  the basis  of a high  standard  project  and  subsequently  attract  investment .  o This phase  is less capital  intensive  in comparison  to the production  phase,  but it’s a  riskier  phase  because  everything  must  be written  from  scratch,  or almost.  That’s  why  private  investors  or broadcasters  poorly  finance  development.  The financing  is  consequently  missing  for many  projects,  which  must  be scaled  down  or abandoned.    o Most  of the contacted  funds  are willing  to increase  the budget  allocated  to this  phase.  For example:   ▪ The Estonian  Film  Institute  refocused  all its budget  for series  support  on  development,  considering  there  was enough  private  funding  on the market   for production,  and the priority  was to make  the projects  good  enough  to  attract  these  private  investments.    ▪ The Finnish  Film  Foundation  decided  to refocus  its budget  for series  towards   script  writing  and development,  where  it can have  a greater  impact  at lower   costs  than  production  support  (9 series  suppo rted  in production  in 2018  vs  only  2 in 2019) .  • Some  criteria  of the selective  support  program  tend  to be maladapted  to series  and might   need  to be reworked,  for instance  with  the cultural  criteria  and business  success   expectations  trade -off.  o  As it has been  explained,  most  support  scheme s for series  are inherited  from  feature   film supports.  Consequently,  the cultural  aspect  tends  to be largely  preferred  over   the business  success  expectations  of the project.   o However,  series  (which  are by nature  iterative  creations ) needs  to obtain  a minimum   market  success  to persist  to a next  season  and so on.  o That’s  why  some  selective  criteria  may  need  to be reassessed  in order  to include   more  commercial  aspects  important  for series  success .   • Cash  rebate mechanisms  (pay -back on  production expenses in the country/region)  have  been largely adopted, and some countries have implemented it very recently (for example ,  Ukraine in 2019). It’s a relevant mechanism to attract audio -visual projects of all kind s and  it is easy and clear to use for production companies. However, some issues must be looked  at:  o The grant being paid (except  in rare cases whe re a percentage  is paid in advance  based on spending expectation) once the productio n has been completed , it cannot  replace all other kind of supports, especially those coming in at earlier stage s of the 
     78    projects or production support paid in advance. Experienced produce rs with a lot of  financing support do not care so much, but smaller o nes might need the cash to pay   for the production, and if it comes after completion , they might run low on cash for  the production phase and have to reduce their ambition s.  o If all European countries  implement  this, then it won’t be a differentiating factor  anymore, and countries might be tempted to increase the rebate percentage to  become more attractive than their neighbour .  o The European Commission is evaluating the impact of this mechanism on the market  and might not renew its authorization depending upon whether  they consider  this  unfair competition. So, there is still a risk that such ambitions  would be removed.   • Co-production  and co-development  seem  to be success  factor s for ambiti ous series :   o It makes  the financing  phase  easier  by opening  new  sources  of public  support   (Creative  Europe,  co-production  agreements,  support  from  national  public  fund s of  each  of the involved  countries , etc.)  o It increases  the chances  of the series  to reach an international  audience  by, of course,   being  planned  to be broadcasted  in each  country  involved  in the co-production . Also,  because  of its multinational  form,  thinking  of a narrative  accessible  to a more  diverse   audience.   ▪ For example,  Nordisk  Film  and TV Fond  allowed  the Nordics  (Denmark,   Finland,  Iceland,  Norway  and Sweden)  to produce  high  end series,  reaching   an international  audience  and making  this region  attractive  for private   funding  too.  • Some  producers  tend  to have  difficult y clearly  understand ing how  public  support  work s for  series  (and the procedure s) are often  too heavy  and slow  in a market  where  things  are going   faster  and faster .  • Producers  from  low production  capacity  countries  (in term s of audio -visual  production  and  public  funding  in the sector ) tend  to have  great  difficulties  in obtain ing investments  and  financ ial backing . There  are just a few transnational  measures  right  now  that are aimed  at  them.   o For example,  Creative  Europe  mainly  does top financing  on already  well-developed   projects  in need  of extra  funding  to allow  them  to reach  their  level  of ambition .                     
     79        Key Findings  Chapter  3.2    Public  support’s  impact  analysis  shows  that most  of the funds  for series  are not large  enough  to  support  high-end series  in Europe.  In a growing  number  of countries , fewer  series  are, in fact,   supported,  but those  that are receive  higher  levels  of individu al support.     The development  phase  is underserved,  even  if it’s the phase  where  public  intervention  could  be  the most  efficient  and where  private  investments  are lacking  because  of its high  risk.      Some  criteria  of selective  support  programs  tend  also to not be adapted  to series  and might  need   to be reworked  taking  into account  the cultural  criteria  and busin ess success  expectations  trade -off.     Cash  rebate  mechanisms  have  been  largely  adopted  as it is a relevant  program  to attract  audio visual  projects  of all kinds  and it is easy  and clear  to use for production  companies.  However,  it  cannot  replace  early stage support  of the projects . Furthermore,  the European  Commission  is  always  reassessing  its authorization  due to unfair  competition  risks.  Finally,  co-production s seem  to  be the key success  factor  for ambitious  series  as they  boost  international  cooperation  on creativity,   financing  and distribution.     Producers  tend  also to have  difficulties  understanding  clearly  how  public  support  works  for series   and the procedure s are often  too complex  and slow  in a market  where  things  are going  faster  and  faster.      Apart  from a few countries  (mostly  the Nordics)  that have seized  the international  co-production   institutional  support  opportunities,  producer  form  countries  with  smal ler production  capacity  tend   to feel especially  underserved  and blocked  in their  international  projects.         3.3. European production stakeholders’ overall needs and options     In this report , we have  underlined  the international  series  opportunity  for European  producers  and  local  broadcasters.  It is also a necessity  to develop  European  leadership  in this segment  as it is  growing  and progressively  cannibalizing  the interest s of audiences  for traditional  local  productions   and broadcasters.  In our different  analyses  by country,  by player  and with  concrete  examples,  we  can identify  a numbe r of growth  levers  and threats  to circumvent  in order  to take  up the challenge.     - Adapt  our industries  to this new  demanding  and growing  segment  by developing  new   writing,  line production  and production  financing  methods.  Co-productions  are a key lever   to encourage  in our fragmented  markets.   - Define  and communicate  clear and transparent  rules  to better  share  the value  together  with   authors,  producers,  distributors,  broadcasters  and also the new  overseas  entrants  from  the  OTT world.  Be transparent  about  the ownership  shares,  the splits  of costs  and revenues,  the  obligations  and rights  of each  (as the unions  did in the US). 
     80    - Financially  supporting  the growth  by preserving  pluralism  and including  all countries.  PSBs   may  have  a leading  role in this mission.     A set of industry  findings , insights , and suggestions  collected  during  the interviews  and in the  documentation  (both  concrete  and long  term ) will be further  developed  and classified  in the next   part s. Even if it is clear that not all of them  fall within  the scope  of the COE and/or  Eurimages   missions , these points are intended for all the stakeholders of the audio -visual sector to raise   awareness on the existing challenges to deal with and opportunities to seize. For the  recommendations specifically for  the Council of Europe and  Eurimages, please refer to chapter 4.      3.3.1.  Seizing the AI opportunity for the media sector and avoiding its potential risks     • benchmark ing the most  ethical  AI codes  and practices  in use in the industry  and  making  them  available  for the media  industry  and stakeholders  in order  to adapt   media  laws.    • establish ing a body  of certification  to ensure  a fair use of AI in med ia. Certification   is challenged  by some  algorithms  being  hidden  for techn ical and business  purposes.   These  algorithm  codes  are intellectual  property,  owned  by someone.   • increasing  education  and awareness  among  the media  ecosystem ’s stakeholders  on  AI. Cooperation  between  them  should  be encourage d through  workshops  to share   best  practices  and the use of common  certified  tools.     3.3.2.  Developing a common cultural identity     Promotion  & training   • Organizing  mixed  stakeholders  think  tanks  of editorial  subjects of interest  for  Europeans  (like  the one “Inspired  by Neighbours ” initiative  in Copenhagen)107  • Sharing  and promoting  tools  to understand  market  demand  (data  mining , A/B  testing  of pilots,  focus  groups)  gathered  and promoted  by a “creative  series   agency”   • Training  on the series  market  practices  especially  for low production  capacity   countries   Legal  framework   • Carefully  controlling  quotas  with  respect  to real time  methods   • Measuring  and boosting  cross  border  circulation  and portability  implementation   • Encouraging  full optimization  of media  chronology  (ultimately  eliminating  piracy   and maximizing  content  exposition)     107 http://cphfilmfund.com/en/storytelling -seminar -what -unites -and-separates -us-in-europe/    
     81    • Rethinking  the singl e territory  model  with  the development  of international   distribution  models.  Upcoming  discussion  on geoblocking  rules  should  aim to  protect  content  revenue  potential  without  limiting  content  circulation.     3.3.3.  Catching the international serie s market opportunity     Moving  the industry  towards  a more  efficient  production  model  (repositioning  of writing  in the  middle  and adopting  new  processes  based  on international  best  practice ). Initiatives  can cover:     • Financing  guilds & unions  in order  to inform  them  on the production  of guidelines /white   papers  to be promoted  and transformed  into “industry  rules”:  transparent  relations  setting   up rights  and obligations  for players,  including  IP management  and success  fees, as seen  in  the US WGA  agreements.    • Financing  could  come  from  unallocated  collective  rights.  The alternative  could  be to  allocate  this mandate  to the Society  of Audio -visual  Authors  (SAA).    • A “best practice”  web  platform  detailing  full series  financing  and marketing  strategies   through  case  studies,  thus  breaking  down  silos  between  countries  and between  authors,   producers,  distributors  and commissioners .     Specifically:   • Authors:    o funding  them  at the early  stage  development  phases   o reinforcing  their  statute  with  Minimum  Guarantee  writing  fees (based  on  budget  excluding  producers’  share,  with  a minimum  and a cap) during   development  phases  and success  shares.  Fragmentation  of talents  requires   more  here  than  other  Union  collective  negotiations.   o training  in collective  writing  and showrunning  models  to avoid  talent  scarcity   and star system  disadvantage.  Addressing  existing  scriptwriters  and the new   generation  separately.    • Producers:    o funding  development  phases  and maybe  authors  throug h this financing   o funding  production  phases  without  committed  broadcasters  (alone  or in coproduction ), especially  for small  or independent  producers  before  they  sell on  or find a bigger  co-producer  who  will sell to platforms  and take  care  of the line  production    o training  of cinema  producers  migrating  to the series  process   o establishing  measures  to help  producers  preserv e the ownerships  of their   series,  for instance  with :  ▪ conditional  public  support  in co-production  projects   
     82    ▪ special  “gap  funding”  to avoid  sacrificing  their  remaining  rights  to a  distributor  or a platform,     o networking  and marketplace  dedicated  to co-production  projects      • Distributors:    o creating  a dedicated  fund  for international  productions , helping  them  to  intervene  upfront   o encouraging  producer  and distributor  consolidation  to align  interest s: method   to be determined  (training,  incentive,  addition  of support , etc.)    • Commissioners  from  TVs and platforms :   o training  and workshop  needs    o waiving  domestic  produc tion quotas  when  applicable  (in local  laws)   o specific  module  about  AI also involving  product  managers  of TVs platforms     3.3.4.  Preserving cultural pluralism in the member States     • Increasing  co-production  volume  to sustain  local  players ’ platforms  and guarantee  a  multiple  player  market:    o evaluating  and adapting  funding  process es on green  lighting,  payment  and nonselective  principles.   o creating  a similar  tool for series  co-productions  as the European  Cinema   Convention  for co-production   o developing  mini  treaties  between  European  countries?  E.g. France/Canada,  Italy   or between  regions  like Centre/Pays  de Galle  or Réunion/South  Africa   o sharing  local  funds  operational  initiatives  developi ng efficiency  and encouraging   local  adoption  instead  of duplicating  only  tax credit/ cash rebate  models  (i.e  measures  from  Plan  series  CNC,  fond s série  Wallonie,  Creative  Denmark)   o developing  networking  and market  places  created  by start -ups (like  Midpoint  in  Central  Europe  or Film  Market  Hub in Spain)   • Creating  a more  favourable  regulatory  environment  to facilitate  the consolidation   of European  players  and alliances  (Alliance  FTV RAI ZDF to be copied  by other   groups  of broadcasters  like Pay TVs, Southern  & Eastern  Europe  alliances , etc.  • Tracking  anti-compe titive  practices  (incl.  AI usage  and AVMSD  implementation)   • Making  sure  gender  diversity  (with  bonus  incentives  on funding)  is implemented     
     83    4. Recommendations for the Council of Europe  and Eurimages     Five types of recommendations are presented hereunder :     1) Recommendation 1: Mandat ing Eurimages to build competence on Series     Interviews we have conducted for this report indicate high  expectations from stakeholders about  a possible r ole for Eurimages in this growing series market. Therefore, Eurimages could be  mandated to build competence in this area and granted the necessary budget to do so. Eurimages  could organise a conference with partners about this report .    2) Recommend ation 2:  Set ting up a legal framework for series co -productions     We have seen in this report the importance of increasing series budgets for European broadcasters  to compete against OTT propositions. This phenomenon is quite new as the growing importance  of  OTT players took place only 2 -3 years ago.      The most efficient solution is to increase the number of series co-productions, which today are far  below the  level  co-productions of the cinema industry (only 9%108 of series are co -productions ,  compa red to  22% of fea ture films ). Eurimages is uniquely capable of  handl ing this mission as it did  so successfully in the cinema industry. In order to facilitate cooperation and co -production in the  series sector, a new convention for series, inspired by the Council of Europe Convention on  Cinematographic C o-production  (revised)  could be envisaged.      Eurimages could be  mandate d by the COE to draft a proposal for a COE convention on series coproduction  in collaboration with interested member States .      3) Recommendation 3: Supporting innovation and risk -taking in series development     We have shown in this report the importance of script writing and the development phase which  is  much higher  for series  than it is in the cinema or local fictions. In this new paradigm, the producer  is the main player. The p roducer is usually the stakeholder without high capital resources unless  he/she  is part of a large media group. We therefore recommend financially assisting independent  producers specifically at this stage. The impact we expect is on three levels:   - There will be more international projects, also from low production capacity countries where  national broadcasters are  much below international series budget requirements .   - Independent producers will play an important role in this growing segment thus preserving  European pluralism .  - Eurimages objectives of cultural diversity would be secured thanks to specific selection  criteria.      The development support would focus  on producers from member States willing to develop coproduced  series projects . The F ocus would be to support producers in their creative deve lopment  but also for their marketing tools to pitch projects  at the international level.  For example , the    108 Source:  The production  and circulation  of TV fiction  in the EU28 , Report  published  by EAO (2018)  
     84    scheme c ould allocate  to them 50 -100k€ (depending on their project) with an objective to cover  25% to 50% of their development costs .   It could be complementary to other transnat ional development support funds such as Creative  Europe -Media  or the Nordic Film & TV Fund , by focusing on independent producers willing to  produce riskier but also more artistically innova tive series  with international distribution potential .  This way, Eurimages would fulfil  its commitment to supporting cultural diversity in the series sector,  which can be more business driven than film for reasons explained ea rlier.      4) Recommendation  4: Propos ing terms of trade for series production in member States  inspired by international best -practice  and en courage collaborations     This report has under scored  the importance of process, transp arency and equity between the  different players to develop successful series projects and economic growth for each. We therefore  recommend that Eurimages contribute to the establishment of standardised terms of trade f or  series  production in member States by promoting dialogue between professional representative   organisation s (such as EBU, ACT, FERA, etc.)  inspired by international best practice s.     This can be do ne via several simultaneous actions, to be discussed and shared with partners at all  levels, from the supranational (European Commission)  to the  professional organisations .     We suggest also to develo p further  collaboration  and ex pertise by sharing  concrete editorial and  business practices,  training programmes, offer and demand on coproduction projects . Eurimage s  could be mandated to centralize  these pieces of  information  and promote them  via different  online tools  such as an online marketplace  and an online marketing  & data  services platform .    5) Recommendation 5 : Raisin g awareness on the impact  of AI in the Audio -visual sector.      Eurim ages  could  assist  the Council  of Europe  to be fully  informed  about  the role and players  of AI in  the audio -visual  field  and its associated  impact  on data  protection,  freedom  of expression  and  cultural  diversity  in this context.  The purpose  of awareness  raising is to build  credibility  and ensure   Eurimages  is seen  to be proactive  and diligent  in protecting  members’  interests.  Eurimages  should   make  sure  that the role of AI in the series  sector  is taken  into account  in the work  of the Council  of  Europe.     So far, AI has been driven  by commercial  interests  mainly  to guide  consumer  decision -making  and  to target  advertising.  Only  recently  have  we realized  that some  of the AI usage  must  be regulated.   A governance  system  is definitely  needed  to improve  the trustworthi ness  of AI.    We recommend  that the Council  of Europe  consider  the new  creation  of a governing  body  for a  media  AI certification.  It will screen  and use the existing  codes  of ethics  and similar  publications   and base  its scrutiny  on generally  accepted  princi ples.     The concept  of AI certification  is essentially  a stamp  of approval.  Certified  compan ies using  AI are  regarded  as trustworthy,  which  makes  certification  desired. A certification  body  would  gather  the  best  AI ethics  codes  and practices  in use in the industry.  They  are made  available  to the  media  industry  and stakeholders,  even  law makers  who  need  backing  for new  media  laws.  It  should  be noted  that establishing  a body  of certification  to ensure  fair use of AI in media  is  challe nged by some  algorithms  being  hidden  for technical  and business  purposes.  These  algorithm  
     85    codes  are intellectual  property,  owned  by someone,  which  means  revealing  them  is highly   unlikely.  The certification  standard  must  take  this hidden  AI-element  into consideration.    
     86    5. Appendi ces     5.1. Appendix 1: Algorithms     Introduction  to algorithms     Content  recommendation,  among  a multitude  of other  things,  is based  on algorithms.  Algorithms   are updated  on a regular  basis  as more  data  becomes  available,  which  brings  up the need  to  implement  a machine  learning  model.  These  models  will change  significan tly over  time  and they   must  be monitored  to ensure  that the intended  goals  are reached,  and appr opriate  data  changes   are implemented.      Algorithm  is a term  often  misused.  The word  algorithm  comes  from  the name  of al-Khwarismi,  an  early  mathematician , and it is generally  understood  to mean  the code  which  drives  intelligent   computer  systems.  For the purposes  of this study,  we will use the word  algorithm  to stand  for a  well-defined  computational  procedure.  It takes  numerical  data  (a value , or set of values)  as input   and produces  some  value,  or set of values,  as output.  An algorithm  is thus a sequence  of  computational  steps  that transform  the input  into an output.     Validating  algorithms     If the core  data  changes  (as it does  over  time),  the algorithms  will change  as well.  As the machine   learning  models  are employed , there  is an ongoing  need to have  control  groups  against  which  to  monitor  the models,  re-train , and measure  the impact  on a regular  basis.     All AI systems  work  around  the clock  and they  need  a continuous  data  flow,  otherwise  they  will be  working  with  obsolete  data,  resulting  in a poor  performance.  AI models  also need  continuous   development  and testing,  which  brings  up the need  for human  intelligence  to participate  in it.109      Algorithms  that explain  themselves     Other  ways  to make  AI more  trustworthy  are coming  from  advances  in AI itself,  particularly  in the  area  of explainable  AI, or XAI. The XAI program  from  the Defence  Advanced  Research  Projects   Agency  (DARPA),  based  in the US, is working  on more  interpret able algorithms.  The goal  is an AI  solution  that can explain  its rationale,  strengths , weaknesses  and convey  how  it will act in the future.   A growing  number  of enterprises  will want  to open  up AI’s black  box and make  AI’s decisions  more   transparent , interpretable  and provable.  They’ll  also need  to anticipate  when  algorithms  will require   auditing.  In the future,  we expect  some  governments  to make  some  level  of interpretability  a  regulatory  requirement.110          109 https://www. pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/library/artificial -intelligence -predictions -2019.html   110 https://www.pwc.com/us/en/services/consulting/libr ary/artificial -intelligence -predictions -2019.html  
     87    5.2. Appendix 2 : AI and Advertising       AI in Advertising  (Programmatic  advertising)     Commercial  VOD -platforms ’ raison  d’être  is to turn  profit  from the content  production  and  distribution.  Monetizing  is done  in various  ways,  the main  sources  of income  being  subscription   sales  and advertisi ng revenue.  This is mainly  achieved  by programmatic  advertising,  which  relies   heavily  on AI. Advertising  has shifted  massively  from  wanting  to reach  as many  viewers  as possible   to wanting  to reach  only  the viewers  that matter.  The need  to reach  the target audiences  on several   different  platforms  and medi ums has created  programmatic  advertising.     Online  adverts  are highly  targetable,  and the pricing  is based  on auctions.  This “real time  pricing”   favours  advertisers  who  also support  platform  loyalty by providing  relevant  advertisements.  AI is  used to deliver  advertisements  to the target  audiences,  but at the same  time,  estimating  advertising   costs  and revenues  has become  complicated.     Programmatic  advertising  goes  beyond  individual  platforms;  the target  audiences  are reached  on  several  different  services  simultaneously.  User  data  is crucial  in reaching  the key audiences.   In many  cases,  collecting  enough  relevant  user  data  can be challenging,  for example,  connected  TV  and cross -screen  campai gns yield  little  user  data  for the advertisers  to make  better  educated   decisions  on how  to best  reach  and address  a desired  audience.      One example  of a technology  service provider  is Amobee  Inc.,  which  offers  an end-to-end  programmatic  buying  and selling  platform  for premium  video  inventory.  The data  marketplace  is  designed  to help  advertisers  overcome  certain  challenges  by mapping  individual  devices  and cooki es  to anonymized  households  for connected  TV and cross -screen  targeting.  Amobee  claims  to give  advertisers  access  to more  than  60,000  always -on audience  segments  to create  targeted  campaigns   for connected  TV.111    Another  example  of an AI-powered  analytics  solution  to gain  intelligent  automation  is Guavus.  It’s  AI-based  service  provides  real-time  customer  experience  analytics,  predictive  analysis  to automate   network  troubleshooting,  and marketing  insights.  The world’s  largest  mobile  data  network   operator,  Chinese  Jio, will use Guavus  to create  a new  digital  experience  (for its more  than  300  millio n subscribers ) in a portfolio  which  include s on-demand  films,  animation  series , and short  films   delivered  in mobile  format . A client’s  view  is described  as: “But they’re  not just fishing  for us, they’re   giving  us the abilit y to fish.”112             111 https://www.rapidtvnews.c om/2019081657010/amobee -launches -connected -tv-multiscreen -advertising -data marketplace.html?utm_campaign=cicely -tyson -joins -duvernay -project -forown&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter_2211 ,  112 https://www.rapidtvnews.com/2019082257059/jio -joins -guavus -on-ai-powered -analytics.html  
     88    5.3. Appendix 3 : Thumbnails on Netflix     Personalized  and auto -generated  thumbnails  on Netflix     Thumbnails are the small , static promo images which appear in the programming guide. They are  intended to illustrate the essence of  the content and market the program, thereby maximizing the  viewing. An image thumbnail can have a huge impact on the likelihood that someone will click on a  video and watch. For example, two different artistic image thumbnails based on the user’s past  preference for romance would present sweet smiles, or for a thriller, serious and dramatic looks.     Using thousands of vid eo frames from an existing movie or show as a starting point for thumbnail  generation, Netflix annotates these images then ranks each imag e in an effort to identify which  thumbnails have the highest likelihood of resulting in your click. These calculations  are based on  what others who are similar to you have clicked on. One finding could be that users who like certain  actors or movie genres are more likely to click thumbnails with certain actors or image attributes.     For example, for the same  Good Will Hunt ing movie,  one user identified as a comedy fan would be  shown a Robin Williams (comedian) thumbnail, whereas another user identified as a romantic  comedy fan would be shown a kissing thumbnail featuring Matt Damon and Minnie Driver. While  not perfect, Netf lix’s algorithms suggest that such level of personalization based on user profile  characteristics increases probability of click thru rate s.    The data  pool  to choose  the page  thumbnails  is enormous.  A one-hour  episode  of a series  has over   86,000  static  video  frames.  These  video  frames  can each  individually  be assigned  certain  attributes   that are later  used  to filter  down  to the best thumbnail  candidates  through  a set of tools  and  algorithms  called  Aesthetic  Visual  Analysis.  This is designed  to find the best  custom  thumbnail  image   out of every  static  frame  of the video.      Netflix  Annotation — Netflix  creates  meta  data  for each  frame  including  brightness,  number   of faces,  skin tones,  probability  of nudity,  level  of motion  blur, and symmetry.    Netflix  Image  Ranking  — Netflix  uses  the meta  data  from  above  to pick out specific  images   that are highest  in quality  (good  lighting,  no motion  blur, probably  contains  some  face  shot  of major   characters  from  a decent  angle,  don’t  contain  unauthori zed branded  content,  etc.)  and are most   clickable.      In order  to know  whom  to target  these  custom -generated  thumbnails  at, Netflix  tracks  the following   data:  • number  of movies  watched,  number  of minutes  of each  show  watched   • % of completion  for every  video  or series   • number  of upvotes,  which  movies  were  favourite , etc.  • % of overall  watch  content  that is attributable  to any specific  show  (level  of affinity that a       user   has to a specific  show  or related  cast members)   • any seasonal  or weekly  trends  related  to a user’s  level  of engagement113        113 Source:  www.becominghum an.ai . 
     89    5.4. Appendix 4 : Youtube Filtering     YouTube  and Offensive  Content      YouTube , a Google -owned  site, removed  more  than  8 million  videos  during  the last quarter  of 2017.   Machine  learning  technology  played  a big role in deciding  which  videos  to take  down.   According  to YouTube,  machines  (rather  than  humans ) flagged  more  than  83%  of the now -deleted   videos  for review.  And more  than  three  quarters  of those  videos  were  taken  down  before  they  got  any views.  The majority  were  spam  or porn.   Machine  learning —or AI, involves  training  algorithms  on data  so that they  become  able  to spot   patterns  and take  actio ns by themselves,  without  human  intervention.  In this case,  YouTube  uses   the technology  to automatically  spot  objectionable  content.   Videos  containing  “violent  extremism ” are banned  on YouTube.  Only  8 % of such  videos  were   flagged  and removed  in early  2017 before  10 views  had taken  place.  After  YouTube  started  using   machine  learning  for flagging  in the middle  of the year,  more  than  half of the videos  removed  for  violent  extremism  have  fewer  than  10 views.   The use of AI on YouTube has implications for the freedom of expression. The use of machine  learning does raise serious questions about content being taken down that should stay up —some  depictions of violent extremism, for example, may be satire or just reportage. Several news  organizations, such as Middl e East Eye and Bellingcat, found out late last year that YouTube was  taking down videos they had shared, depicting war crimes in Syria. Bellingcat, which played a key  citizen -journalist role in investigating the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine in  2014, found its entire channel suspended.114                                     114 Source:  https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/ai -is-now -youtube -s-biggest -weapon -against -the-spread -ofoffensive -videos/  
     90    5.5. Appendix 5 : AI in Production                       Script  evaluation,   predictive  AI Location  scouting  Production   budgeting  Production   planning  Production   hardware   AI can be used  to  predict  succe ss  based  on the  following:   celebrity  status  of  the cast,  genre,   budget,  length,   and key plot  events.  AI can  identify  weak   signals  and trends   on social  media  =  predictive   analysis  tool  Past  box office   performance  is  sometimes  added   into data.     Using  data  to  help  determin e  where  best  to  shoot  a movie   set. This includes   physical   environment  in  reference  to  production  scene   requirements,   such  as day vs.  night  shoot,   weather   conditions,   logistics,  and so  on. Even regional   and national   production   incenti ves can be  part of the data   gathered.   Scouting  also  involves  possible   shooting   restrictions,  such   as using  drones   for aerial  shoots   and permits   needed  in  production.  Includes  above   and below  the  line production   costs,  venue,   flights  and  accommodation   costs , set props,   and all properties   used  in  production.  For  example,  if  costume  designer   needs  a certain   dress  brand,   knowing  the  exact  cost helps   and AI can say  where  the dress   is located  in a  warehouse.   Budgeting  can  also include   information  on  product   place ment.  Scheduling,   locations,   production   logistics,  actor   and crew   availability,  etc.  Automated   metadata   tagging,  voice   recognition,   preparing  for  special  effects  to  be added  in post production.

     92    5.7. Appendix 7 : Definition, objectives, criteria and examples of public support:     Cash Rebate/ Tax relief   Description:     • Cash Rebate /Tax Relief /Tax Rebate are differ ent names for the similar automatic support  mechanisms   • Cash Rebate Mechanism is a refund of usually around 15 -25% of eligible costs spent in the  country by the production company in charge of an audio -visual project.   o The eligible cost s are defined in the guidelines of the Cash Rebate, as well as the  percentage of the cash rebate, and it might come with a maximum  refund   • The payment of the cash rebate can occur in two instalments , around 30% before the  producti on start, based on sp ending estimation, and the rest comes once the production is  complete.   • Otherwise, the payment occurs in one time, once the production is complete and all the  eligible spending ha s been certified.   • Most  cash rebate mechanisms work for both feature fi lms and series production   • However, the cash rebate mechanism presents a few risks:   o If all European countries are implementing it, then it won’t be a differentiating  factor anymore, and countries might be tempted to increa se the ir rebate  percentage to becom e more attractive than their neighbour.   o The European commission is currently evaluating what  the impact of this  mechanism is on the market and might not renew its authorization if it considers  these practices  unfair competition or unhealthy measure   Criteria:   • The (co -)production company must be registered in the country providing the cash rebate  and/or pay taxes in the country   • The percentage of cash rebate might vary based on:   o  cultural criteria/cultural test   ▪ exampl e: does the movie promote local cul ture or language? Does it reaches  required level at the cultural test?   o the amount of spending?   ▪ example: do  the local expenditures reach a minimum threshold?   o the type of project:   ▪ example: some countr ies will favour high -end series  project s with  a higher   rebate percentage.   o Local Business activity criteria:   ▪ Example: How many local professionals (actors, technicians , etc. ) have been  employed for the production?          
     93    Objectives:   • Cash Rebate s/Tax Relief are made to entice  internationa l co-production and facilitate local  production by reducing the production costs  in order to develop local audio -visual talents  and activity.    • Promote local culture and landscape through audio -visual project s in order to attract  tourism and increase cul tural influence.   Examples:   • Croatian Cash Rebate:   o =>http://filmingincroatia.hr/en/production_incentive/rebate_for_film_and_tv_pro duction   o Interesting extra ct:  “cash rebate has been raised to 25%, with additio nal 5% for productions filming in  regions with below average development.”   • French  Tax Rebate for International productions (TRIP):   o => https://www .cnc.fr/web/en/tax -rebate   o Interesting extract:   “The tax rebate amounts to 30% of the following pre -tax expenses:   ▪ Salaries and wages paid to French or EU  writers, actors (up to the minimum  set in collective bargaining agreements), direction  and producti on staff  (wages and incidentals) including the related social contributions.   ▪ Expenditures incurred to specialized companies for technical goods and  services.   ▪ Transportation, travel and catering expenditures.   ▪ Accommodation expenditures.   ▪ Depreci ation expense s.”    Script Writing Support     Description:   • Script Writing Phase is  when the scenario of a film /show  (including the technical  breakdown and dialogues ) is written down.   • Script Writing support program s may also include “idea development” or synopsis creation,  which is the  very early stage of writing   • Different kind s of script writing support exist:   o Refundable rate -free loan s provided to a writer or a team of writer s  ▪ The average value of this type of loan is around 5 -10k€   o Script writing s ubsidies (based on a certain  percentage of the cost ) paid by a  production company   ▪ For example, a production company selected an author synopsis and wants  him/her  to write  the script in the 3 -4 months to come. The production  company can apply for  Script Writing Support a nd receive  (for example ) 50%  of the total estimated costs.  
     94    • Sometimes, the  author will have to provide information on the advancement  of the  project, and the institution providing the support can provide help in kind (contact,  network, information, training, workshops , etc. )  • This type of support is already there for feature films and has been recently opened to  series project s. Howe ver, some countries (such as Canada, France, and the UK) developed  specific Script Writing support speci fically  tailored for series needs.   Criteria:   • All these supports are selective, meaning a jury will evaluate application s based  on certain   aspect s before providing the funding support. Sometimes there is a limited amount of  money available per time period , or a limited number of projects t hat can be supported.   • Cultural Test s  • Language employed in the script   o Most of the time, countr ies’ public fund s won’t support a script that is not written  in the local language.   • Original and Artistic aspects of the project  (evaluated by the jury )  • Background of the author   o Experienced author for High -End Project support?   o For support sy stems designed to encourage diversity, d oes the author belong to a  minority, are they a  woman,  young author, etc .?  • Does the author of the script have their  rights protected?   o Most of the time, when  the fund ing is provided to a production company  employing a script writer, the author must be allowed to keep the rights to what  he/she  wrote if the  project doesn’t go further into production phase.   • Respect for specific format conditions, such as the nu mber of episodes per season, the  length of each episode , etc.     Objectives:   • Help  script writers creat e qualitative and original stories by providing them enough funds  to focus exclusively  on their work   • Allow  production companies to take more  risks  by making them pay for only a part of the  script writing phase   • Support  projects corresponding to  certain expectations: technical innovation, cultural  aspects, expected market success , etc.     Examples :  • Story development grant of the FFF Bayern :   o =>https://www.fff -bayern.de/en/funding/funding -schemes/story development.html   o Relevant extract:   ”The grant is awarded as a conditionally repayable, interest -free loan. It can  amount to up to 70% of the calculated project development costs. The maximum  rate for theatrical and television films is 100,000 euros. The maximum rate for a  series is 150,000 euros.  If production funding is granted for the project, the loan  is 
     95    credited against this amount. Producers with a registered office, branch office , or  place of business in Germany are eligible to apply.”     • Film Fund Nord – Script Development grant:   o => https://www.nfi.no/sok -tilskudd/dokumentar/manusutvikling -dok   o Relev ant extract :   Purpose:   “With the grant scheme, we will stimulate the development of manuscripts of high  artistic and professional quality .”    .§ 2-4. Grants for the development of ideas and manuscripts     “The grants will also contribute to a professional an d strong environment for audio visual production in Norway; to Norwegian audio -visual productions having a strong  position among children and young people; and, will over time, con tribute to  achieving the goal of gender equality in the film industry.”     Development Support     Description:   • The development phase includes all the steps preceding  production (writing the script,  creating storyboards, preparing a production schedule, casting, etc.).   • Development support grants are reserved for producers, their value depend ing on the  ambition of the project , and are usually part of a wider program  leading to  Production  Support.   • The producer m ay have to provide information on the advancement of the project, and the  support might be paid in s everal instalments as milestones are reached   • Public institution s can provide help in kind (contact, network, information, training,  workshops , etc. )  • It can be a repayable tax -free loan (depending on the success of the project) or a direct  subsidy .   • The average value of this support is between 20 -150k€   • This type of sup port was already in place  for feature films and has been recently opened to  series project s. However, some countries (such as Canada, France, and the UK) established  development support speci fically  tailored for series needs ( just like script writing support).     Criteria:   • Most of these supports are selective, meaning a jury will evaluate applications based on  certain  aspects before providing the funding s upport. Sometimes there is a limited amount  of money available per time period , or a limited number of projects that can be supported  every year or semester.   • Cultural Test   • Language employed in the se ries  • Original ity and artistic aspects of the project  
     96    • Background of the author and producer   • Detailed and realistic planning   • Respect for  specific format conditions, such as the number of episodes per season, the  length of each episode , etc.   • The production c ompany must show the proof of at least 50% of external financing (private  investment, loan , etc. )  Objectives:   • Help projects  that seem relevant  on their artistic aspects and/or their potential market  success   • Limit the financial risk taken on by the producer when they finance the project   • Increase the quality and ambition of the production   • Influence the way the project will be made , following  the criteria necessary to acquire   funding  (language, cultural aspects, business , etc. )  Examples:   • Film Fund Nord - Development of drama series by market assessment:   o =>https://www.nfi.no/sok -tilskudd/dramaserier/markedsvurdering   o Relevant extract:  “This scheme will help Norw egian producers to carry out  development work beyond what the viewing platforms alone can finance, and with  a degree of predictability that gives the industry room to manoeuvre. This is to  strengthen the artistic quality of the pro jects at an early and decisive stage, as high  quality is a prerequisite for Norwegian series to compete with the offer of major  international productions, both here at home and beyond Norway's borders.”   • Screen Ireland - Television Drama Development:   o =>https://www.screenireland.ie/funding/development -loans/television -drama development   o Relevant extract : “This funding enables Irish producers with a track record in TV  Drama productio n to originate live action TV drama projects. This scheme aims to  provide opportunities for Irish talent to create original drama content.”   Production Support:     Description:   • Production phase is the period when the shooting takes place, and images/animation s are  created. It’s the phase with the highest costs.   • It’s the most common type of support granted to series  project s. Depending on the public  fund ’s nature and objectives, the criteria and value of the grants can  vary  greatly .  • It can be a refundable tax -free loan (depending on the success of the project) or a direct  subsidy.   • This type of support was already in place  for feature films and has been recently opened to  series project s. However, some countries (such as Canada, France, and the UK) developed   Production support speci fically  tailored for series needs.    
     97      Criteria:   • Most of these supports are selective, meaning a jury will evaluate applications based on  certain  aspects before providing the funding support. Som etimes there  is a limited amount  of money available per time period , or a limited number of projects that can be supported  every year or semester.   • Cultural Test   • Language employed in the series   • Original ity and artistic aspects of the pro ject  • Background of the author and producer   • The production company must have a partnership wit h one or two broadcasters   o Most advanced Institution s require a TV broadcast er and a Digital Media  Broadcast er (SVOD platform most of the time)   • Detailed and r ealistic planning and spending estimations   • Respect for specific format conditions, such as th e number of episodes per season, the  length of each episode , etc.   • Depending of the type of support (high end project or a more artistic project), the  production mi ght have to show the proof of at least 50% of external financing (private  investment, loan , etc.)  • The production company will often have to spend a percentage of the granted support in  the country/region providing the funding (usually at least 100 -125%)     Objectives:   • Help projects which seem relevant on their artistic aspects and/or their potential market  success   • Limit the financial risk taken on by investors when they finance the project   • Increase the quality and ambition of the production by allowing more  spending   • Influence the way the project will be made, following the criteria necessary to acquire  funding (language, cultural aspects, business, etc.)   • Cultural diversity -oriented fund s (most provided at national level) will provide grants to  projects of all size s and ambition  levels , after a selection based on cultural and artistic  criteria   • More busines s-oriented fund s (most ly regional ones) will provide grants to bigger projects.  The objective s here are to attract productions and international co -productions in their  area , stimulate the audio -visual production activity , and increase local prof essionals’ skills   Examples:   • Film Scotland - Broadcast Content Fund   o =>https://www.creativescotland.com/__dat a/assets/pdf_file/0010/55297/Broadca st-Content -Fund -FINAL -August -2018.pdf   o Relevant extract :“The Broadcast Content Fund aims to help the sustainable growth of  Scotland’s broadcast production sector, encouraging the development of new projects, the  scaling up of already successful activities and the production of commissioned programmes. 
     98    The Broa dcast Content Fund is one of the key new measures being taken to ensure that by  2022/23:   a) Production spend ing in Scotland is doubled; and   b) Scottish production company growth is increased to boost the number  (from two to six) reaching the UK top 50 with turnover greater than £10m.”     • Canada Media Fund – Aboriginal Program   o => https://www.cmf -fmc.ca/getattachment/f97a30a2 -282b -4dc5 -9008cb58c995a079/attachment.aspx   o Relevant extract:   “Eligible Projects (see section 3.2) in the Aboriginal Program must be convergent,  meaning: they must have an eli gible Television Component (see section 3.2.TV) and  accompanying multi -platform content that meets the criteria set out in section 3.2.  Eligible Projects under this Program are administered under a selective process  where the CMF115 evaluates applications ac cording to an Evaluation Grid (see  section 2.4). Eligible Project s may receive funds subject to per -project Maximum  Contribution amounts (see section 2.3) and other specified limitations.”     Distribution Support:     Description:   • The distribution includes  the series broadcasting , translation, marketing, securing of right s  distribution, etc .  • It can be a refundable tax -free loan (depending on the success of the project) or a direct  subsidy.   • Not a very common support for series am ong public funds, because series enter the  producti on phase when they are already backed -up by a broadcaster in charge of the  distribution   • This type of support is already in place  for feature films and has been recently opened t o  series project s.   Criteria:     • All these supports are selective, meaning a jury will evaluate applications based on certain   criteria before providing the funding support. Sometimes there is a limited amount of  money available per time p eriod , or a limited number of pr ojects that can be supported  every year or semester.   • This type of support usually come s into play  as additional financing for project s already  backed by a public fund  (criteria will be the same as those for  production support )  • The production or distribution company might have to show the proof of at least 50% of  external financing (private investment, loa n, etc. )          115 Canada  Med ia Fund:  Main  Federal  Audio -visual  Public  fund  in Canada  
     99        Objectives:     • Help a series project go  international after a local su ccess   • Increase the market success of the series by financing a wider marketing campaign     Examples:   • CNC116(France) - Grant for the promotion and sale of audio -visual program abroad   o => https://www.cnc.fr/professionnels/aides -et-financements/multi sectoriel/exportation/aides -a-la-promotion -et-a-la-vente -a-letranger -desprogrammes -audiovisuels_190726   Relevant Extract:   “Support for promotion and sales is managed according to two methods of granting aid: automatic  and selective.
