Declaration of Cities Coalition for Digital Rights     We, the undersigned cities, formally come together to form the ​ Cities Coalition for Digital                             Rights, ​ ​  to protect and uphold human rights on the internet at the local and global level.       The ​ internet ​ ​ has become inseparable from our daily lives. Yet, every day, there are new                               cases of digital rights abuse, misuse and misinformation and concentration of power around                           the world: ​ freedom of expression being censored; personal information, including our                       movements and communications, monitored, being shared and sold without consent; ‘black                       box’ algorithms being used to make unaccountable decisions; social media being used as a                             tool of harassment and hate speech; and ​ democratic processes and public opinion being                           undermined.         As cities, the closest democratic institutions to the people, we are committed to eliminating                             impediments to harnessing technological opportunities that improve the lives of our                       constituents, and to providing trustworthy and secure digital services and infrastructures that                         support our communities. We strongly believe that ​ human rights principles ​ ​ such as                         privacy ​ ​ , ​ freedom of expression ​ ​ , and democracy must be incorporated by design into                         digital platforms starting with locally-controlled digital infrastructures and services.       As a coalition, and with the support of the United Nations Human Settlements Program                             ( ​ UN-Habitat ​ ), we will share best practices, learn from each other’s challenges and                         successes, and coordinate common initiatives and actions. Inspired by the Internet Rights                         and Principles Coalition ( ​ IRPC ​ ), the work of 300 international stakeholders over the past ten                             years, we are committed to the following five evolving principles:     1. Universal and equal access to the internet, and digital literacy     Everyone should have access to affordable and accessible internet and digital                       services on equal terms, as well as the digital skills to make use of this access and                                   overcome the digital divide.       2. Privacy, data protection and security     Everyone should have privacy and control over their personal information through                       data protection in both physical and virtual places, to ensure digital confidentiality,                         security, dignity and anonymity, and sovereignty over their data, including the right to                           know what happens to their data, who uses it and for what purposes.     3. Transparency, accountability, and non-discrimination of data, content and                 algorithms     Everyone should have access to understandable and accurate information about the                       technological, algorithmic and artificial intelligence systems that impact their lives,                     and the ability to question and change unfair, biased or discriminatory systems.        
        4.   Participatory Democracy, diversity and inclusion     Everyone should have full representation on the internet, and the ability collectively to                           engage with the city through open, participatory and transparent digital processes.                       Everyone should have the opportunities to participate in shaping local digital                       infrastructures and services and, more generally, city policy-making for the common                       good.       5.    Open and ethical digital service standards     Everyone should be able to use the technologies of their choice, and expect the                             same level of interoperability, inclusion and opportunity in their digital services. Cities                         should ​ define their own technological infrastructures, services and agenda, through                     open and ethical digital service standards and data to ensure that they live up to this                                 promise.
