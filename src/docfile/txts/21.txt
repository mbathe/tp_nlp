      Report  on   Artificial Intelligence and Human Society     Unofficial  translation                                   March  24th, 2017           Advisory  Board  on Artificial Intelligence and Human  Society        
1 Preface     Artificial Intelligence  (AI)  is expected  to transform  our society,  not only  by  substituting  for routinized tasks  but also by supporting  and enhancing  human activities   and decision  making.   In its 5th Science and  Technology  Basic  Plan  (2016–2020), Japan  introduced a  new   concept,  namely  “Society  5.0,”  as a way  by which  to guide  and mobilize  action  in  science,  technology , and  innovation to  achieve a  prosperous, sustainable , and inclusive   future  that is, within  the context  of ever -growing digitalization  and connectivity ,  empowered  by the advancement  of AI.  With  its potential  to equip and  better  shape our  society  with new  services,   businesses,  social  structure s, values,  and welfare,  AI is perceived  as a fabulous  enabler,   but its benefits  to society  will deeply  depend  on the  way  it will be  implemented  and used   in real socioeconomic  systems.    One may  have concerns  about  the quick advancement  of AI and its implementation   in society.  This is why  the Advisory  Board  on Artificial  Intelligence  and Human  Society   was set up in  May  2016 under  the initiative  of the Minister  of State  for Science and  Technology  Policy  with the aim to assess different  societal  issues that  could possibly  be  raised  by the development  and deployment  of AI and to discuss  its implication  for  society . The advisory  board was  expressly  composed of  members  with various   backgrounds  in fields  such as  engineering,  philosophy, law,  economics , and  social   sciences.  The advisory  board  finally  published a  report  that includes  a summary  of the  issues to  be addressed  regarding  AI and human society.    I would like  to share ideas  and excerpts  from  this report  with  you to encourage  communication  and potential  future  cooperation. These issues should be  discussed   continuously  as AI advances , ideally  with  international  cooperation.

4 Executive Summary     Artificial Intelligence  (AI) technologies  that can perform  portions  of human  intellectual activities  (perception, recognition, decision  making, inference,  and actions   based  on the same)  have  been  advancing  quickly , especially  big data and machine learning.   They  are being  implemented  in autonomous  cars, diagnosis  supports, conversation agents ,  and others. AI technologies  are critical  and fundamental  for the realiz ation  of the Society   5.0 that Japan ’s government  is promoting, and it is expe cted to contribute  by giving   solutions  to social  problems , such as the labor  shortage  caused  by the low birthrate  and  aging society,  and to enable every  person to play a significant role by utilizing  their own  abilities . Although AI technologies  bring  tremendous  benefits  to human society,  they might   affect  human  society  itself  fundamentally  by advancing without  awareness  because their  development  is so fast that it inevitably  surpass es the pace of institutional and social   adaptation. Thus, the influence  of AI technologies  on society  should be discussed  to ensure   that these technologies  are used  safely  and beneficially .  Ethical,  Legal,  and Social  Implications  (ELSI)  surrounding AI technologies  are  attracting  attention  internationally , including  Japan,  and various  people  as well as  researchers  and engineers  discuss  opportunities  and concerns  regarding  AI technologies   with great  interest.  For example,  academic organizations, non-profit  organizations,  governments , and international  organizations  are discussin g and providing  policy   recommendations  on increasing  productivity,  decreasing  heavy  work,  accelerating  science,   and finding  new medical  treatments  as good opportunities, and they address  job loss and  existential risks  to humans  as concerns.   The Advisory  Board on Artificial Intelligence and Human  Society  (Advisory  Board)   focused  on existing  AI technologies , those  that may foreseeable be realiz ed in the near  future , and the society  in which  those  technologies  are or will be implemented.  The  Advisory  Board’s  objective  was to clarify  what  benefits  are expected,  what  issues are to be  concerned,  what  issues are to  be resolved,  and what  attitudes  are beneficial.  Digitalization   that cannot  be dissociated  from  AI technologies  was included in the discussio ns. Given  that  AI technologies  are being  applied  in various  fields,  the Advisory  Board  took a case-based   approach  that dealt with various  cases  in the four representative categories : mobility,   manufacturing,  personal  services,  and conversation/ communication. The Advisory  Board   aimed  to clarify  common  key issues  of AI technologies  and human  society  from  a multistakeholder  point  of view,  i.e., from  the viewpoints  of users,  researchers,  engineers,  artists,   people  across  generations , including  children, businesses, a nd governments.  AI technologies  support  and augment  human intellect and actions,  and they execute   parts  of intellectual behaviors  on behalf  of humans. This is suppose d to greatly  benefit  and  empower  human  society  and contribute  to ensur ing its sustainability.  The extracted  key  issues are summarized  as follow s:  ◆ Ethical  issues:  A significant  action  is to consider  the balance between  human   decisions  and AI-based  decisions  depending  on the situations  and objects  to be  judged. The balance  change  causes  the emerg ence of a new sense of ethics . If users   confirm  AI services  that enable them  to manipulate  some one's  mind  and/or  to  evaluate people, discussions  of ethics  might  especially  be needed.  Careful   attention  contributes  to proper  AI progress  that has the possibility  to change  
5 human concepts,  since AI technologies  augment  human being s’ senses  and  abilities.  New  evaluation  procedures  have required the observ ation  of the values   (e.g.,  originality,  utility,  and virtue)  of the products  made and actions  performed   by humans, by  AI technologies,  and through the  cooperati on of  both.   ◆ Legal  issues:  Determin ing the locus  of responsibility  for accidents  involving  AI  technology  along  with preparing  insurance for probabilistic  risks  contributes  to  social  acceptance  and helping  users  understand the risks  of utilizing  AI  technologies. Exploitation  of big data while considering information  privacy   protection requires  the consider ation  of appropriate  institutional frameworks   (laws,  guidelines, and contr acts).  Considering  the rights  to and incentives  for the  creation  of AI technologies  remains  a subject  of further study  for multistakeholder s. In-depth analysis  and basic research  (e.g.,  social  sciences ) play an  important  role in recon sidering fundamental  concepts , such as human   responsibilities , that  the modern law  is based  on.  ◆ Economic  issues:  Individuals  chang ing their work  style  and updating  their abilities   propose  to harmonize  each person’s  abilities  with a creative  job/task. These  changes  also require  that companies  reconsider  their decision -making  techniques   and staff (re)assignment  to take advantage  of work  flexibility.  At the government   level,  combining educational  and employment policies  is one of the effective   procedures  for mobilizing  labor, revitalizing  the econom y, and preventing  economic  disparities.   ◆ Educational  issues:  The significant issues are understanding  the advantages  and  limitation s of the present  AI technologies,  properly  utiliz ing AI technologies,  and  perform ing creative activities  in collaborati on with AI technologies. An  educational  policy  functions  according  to discussions  of how to efficiently  reform   curriculums  based  on evidence  that show s the technologies ’ limitations , the  critical  human abilities  differentiated  from  present  AI technologies,  and the  essential  human abilities  to be acquired .   ◆ Social  issues:  There  is a need  to create space  for dialogue  among people  with  different  visions  and ideas  and to consider  common, fundamental  social  values.   One of the fundamental  issues is the need  to facilitate  provisions  against  the "AI  divide ," unbalanced  social  costs  relative to AI, and discrimination  that occur s  because  of the technologies’  procession . Continuous  assessments of social   pathology, conflict,  and dependence on AI technologi es will offer  solutions  to  these issues.   ◆ Research  and development  (R&D)  issues:  Researchers  and engineers  are required   to engage  in R&D  with professional  ethics  while  observing  ethical  codes  and  guidelines. Technologies  for cyber  security  and privacy  protection must  be  advanced . Basic  research  to ensure  that AI technologies  are controllable  and  transparency  by explain ing the processes  and logics  of calculations  made by AI  technologies  contribute  to their social  implication s. Advanc ing AI technologies   that are beneficial  for human society  requires  basic sciences , including  social   sciences  to study  societal  issues that may arise  in the future , observing  the social   acceptance of their stochastic  behaviors  such as deep  learning,  and creating  an  environment  that supports  open science to enhance  the diversity  of AI 
6 technologies .    We have  already  initiated  international  discussion on these key issues and are engaged   in the pursuit of this process  because  we consider  clarifying  the relationship  between  AI  technologies  and human society  to be a prerequisites  to realiz ing a sustainable  society ; we  also consider  addressing  the fundamental  question, “What  values  are shared  by humans  all  over the world ,” to be unavoidable. The Advisory  Board  wishes  for this report to be shared   by not only AI researchers/engineers,  governments, and business  sectors  but also by  humanities  and social  scientists,  education  suppliers, and the general  public  in order  to  open debate and precipitate  taking  action . 
7   Introduction     1.1 Impacts  of AI technologies  on human  society   In 1956, a proposal  was made to consider  various  research  on "thinking  machines"  as  a new  research  horizon, "Artificial Intelligence  (AI) ," at the Dartmouth  conference held  at  Dartmouth  College  in the United  States  of America.  Research  had previously  been   conducted on whether  computer s could be invented or intelligence  artificially  realized,  but  AI was officially  set as a research  horizon at this conference. The realization  of AI is the  researcher's  goal.  Complete  AI does not exist  yet, and it is difficult to say what  is complete.   Technologies  that can replace some  intellectual activities  (perception, recognition,   reasoning,  learning, decision  making , behaviors/actions  based  on the same ) have  been   developed in this research  process. In this report,  these technologies  are defined  as  “Artificial Intelligence technologies  (AI technologies)”  and are the  subject s of study .  In March  2016, AI technology  won the world  championship of Go with 4 wins  and 1  loss. This progress  was a great  surprise.  One of the reasons  is that Go is a very difficult  game,  and since there are numerous  variations  of the following  measures,  it was thought   that the computer’s  comprehensive  solution search  would be unable to win the world   championship. In other  words, AI technologies  exceed  humans, even  concerning  games   that require  high intellect.  Around 2014, vehicles  with automatic  driving  (auxiliary)   function (Level  2) were  sold on the open market.  These vehicles  can be driven   automatically  with multiple  functions  such as acceleration,  steering,  and braking  through   information  gathered  via cameras,  radars,  and other  sensors  in a limited  situation , such as  on highway s. In the summer  of 2016, it was reported  that a cancer  patient  for whom  an  adequate treatment  could not found recovered  by using  an alternative  treatment  that utiliz ed  AI technologies.   In addition, corporate  activity,  the way of working, and everyday  life are changing   with, digitalization , such as the use of rideshares . Among  the optimization  of information   in digital ization,  there are many  cases  that cannot  be strictly  separated  from  AI  technologies.  Currently,  the government  of Japan  aims  for the realizat ion of its Society  5.01, which   can overcome  social  problems  such as the declining  birth  rate and the increasing  age of the  population by using  science and technology  and which  can ensure  sustainable  development   for the future.  Therefore,  AI technology  is regarded  as an important  fundamental   technology  with the Internet  of Things  (IoT), which  accelerates  robotics  and digital ization.   The progress  of AI technologies  in recent  years  has held surprises  for society,  and the  government  as well as companies  invest  in R&D  tremendously  as a driving  force for the  realization  of a sustainable  society  and as core technologies  for industrial  strengthening.                                                                 1 Society  5.0 is a society  in which  the different  needs  of members  are distinctly  met through  the provision  of  relevant  goods  and services  in the desired  amount  to those  people  who need  them  and in which  the entire   population  has access  to top-notch  services,  and lives  convenient,  vibrant  lives  that take into account  their  differences,  such as age, gender,  religion  or language  (The  5th Science and Technology  Basic  Plan,  Cabinet   Office,  Japan).  
8   1.2 Expectations  and concerns  regarding AI technologies   AI technologies  have brought  tremendous  benefits  to human society.  For example,   autonomous  cars are expected  to improve  safety  by reducing  accidents  caused  by drivers'   carelessness  and mistakes.  Furthermore,  there will be a change in which  people  become   free from  tedious  labor  and spend more  time on high-value -added  jobs and hobbies  as  machines  become  increasingly  automated.  A new lifestyle  is upcoming that enables  users   to discover  new knowledge  efficiently , as shown by the automated  cancer  treatment   suggestion, if human society  can accelerate intellectual tasks  that require  an enormous   amount  of specialized  knowledge  and a great  deal of time.  Therefore,  AI technologies  offer   to make human society  more  convenient, more  prosperous, more  secure, and safer.   On the other  hand, those  people  who are concerned  about  the advancement  of AI  technologies  have  the following  questions : “Who  is responsible  for accidents  caused  by an  autonomous  car?”;  “Will  AI steal our jobs?”; “Will our children  lose motivation  for  learning  as AI technologies  become common?” ; and “Will  we be manipulated  by AI before   we know  it?” The aim of this report  is to clarify  the current  situation  and issues to be  considered,  rather  than impetuously  trying  to guarantee  the safety  and security  of AI. Some   concerns  involve  outcomes  that are unlikely  while  others  would require  individuals  (both   users  and developers),  businesses,  and governments  to consider  appropriate  actions .  Although utilizing  AI technologies  would raise concerns  and require  some  action s in  the short  term,  they could offer  more  benefits  if users  properly  deal with the risks  and  concerns  that arise . Japan  has a mature  society  and is also referred  to as the forerunner  of  finding  solutions  to emerging  issues.  AI technologies  are expected  to contribute  to  economic  growth  and safe, secure  and prosperous  lives,  overcoming challenges  such as the  low birth  rate, greater  longevity , and natural  disasters,  and thereby  to realize  a sustainable   society.     1.3 Features  of AI technologies  differ  from  previous   technologies   Although human societies  have  previously  accommodated  and accepted  new  technologies  with both concern  and expectation , there is a question as to why current   society  primarily  faces  troublesome  technologies  relative  to AI.   What  distinguishes  AI technologie s from  previous  technologies  is that it is enabled to  do things  that have  been  assumed  to only be doable  by humans . In addition, given   appropriate  goals,  AI technologies  can learn  from  data and self-improve  rapidly. It should  also be noted that AI technologies  are invisible , unlike  electric equipment, cars, and cell  phones, and they work  in the background inside  of existing  items  and services.  Users  might  find it difficult to assess whether  AI technologies  are actually  used and how much  they are  used in those  since they work  as part of a program  that cannot  be directly,  physically   observed.  AI technologies  can use existing  tools  and technologies  as they are in pretty  much   the same manner  as humans . As a result,  users  cannot  simply  confirm  whether  AI  technologies  are implemented  at a glance . It might  occur  to people  that AI has already   prevailed  in a wide  variety  of technologies  and scenes  or that alleged  AI products  do not  actually  use AI technologies.  Taken  together,  AI technologies  can prevail  and advance   before  users  know  it, since  their development  is rapid  and their behavior  is hard to see from  
9 the outside. The characteristics  of AI technologies  described  above  should be considered   when  address ing issues and determining  appropriate  actions  to take in  resolving  them .    1.4 Purposes  of Advisory  Board   The Advisory  Board  on Artificial Intelligence  and Human  Society  (hereafter,  the  Advisory  Board)  was established  in May  2016 under  the Minister  of State  for Science and   Technology  Policy  in order  to advance the R&D  and utilization  of AI technologies.  AI  technology  is one of the most  significant technologies  that facilitates  the realization  of  Society  5.0. The Advisory  Board  has worked  especially  to clarify  benefits,  issues,   challenges,  and future  directions  with special  attention  to AI technologies  that exist  or will  be realiz ed in the near  future  and a society  in which  such  technologies  prevail.   Given  that AI technologies  are being  applied  in various  fields,  the Advisory  Board   adopt ed a case- based  approach that took up various  cases  in the four representative   categories : mobility,  manufacturing, personal  services,  and conversation/ communication.   These services  are based  on not only AI technologies  but other  technologies  that cannot  be  clearly  divided  from  the former,  defined  as digitalization.  In this report,  AI technologies   include  digitalization,  and the Advisory  Board aimed  to clarify  significant  issues regarding   AI technologies  and human  society  from  multi- stakeholder  points  of view , i.e., from  the  viewpoints  of users,  developers, people  across  generations , including  children, artists,   businesses,  and governments, and thereby  serving  as a starting  point  for continuous   discussions  moving  forward .     
10   Overview  of activities  on AI and human  society     Along  with the rapid  progress  of AI technologies  and intellectual machines,  several   global  activities  that study  the impact  of AI on human society  are concurrently  being   conducted. Characteristically , in addition to scientists,  engineers  and government  agencies   are involved in AI research,  but researchers  and entrepreneurs  in other  fields  as well as the  general  public  also have  a strong  interest i n these issues.     2.1 Global  trends   In 2008–2009, the  Association  for th e Advancement  of Artificial Intelligence  (AAAI)   created  an expert  group, led by the president,  and examined  the long-term influence  the  development  of AI had on society  (2008–2009 AAAI  Presidential  Panel  on Long -Term  AI  Future).  In its development, the project "One  Hundred Year Study  of Artificial Intelligence"  was launched  in 2014 at Stanford  University  (USA).  The project  members  are continuously   investigating  and examining  opportunities  and concerns  from  the view point  of laws and  ethics  about  the long-term impact  of AI development  on society.  The report  of 20162  examines  the influence  of AI research  for each field, such as transportation, home,  healthcare,  and others , assuming  a typical  North  American  city until 2030, and it also  makes  policy  recommendatio ns. In addition, by 2030 it is stated  that there  will be no  concern  that humankind will be destroyed  by AI. The IEEE Global  Initiative  for Ethical   Considerations  in Artificial Intelligence and Autonomous  Systems  published “Ethically   Aligned  Design,  Version  1,” which  aimed  to provide  ethical  issues  and candidate   recommendations  about  AI and autonomous  systems  and to provide  recommendations  for  IEEE  Standards  based  on Ethically  Aligned  Design .3  In addition, a  voluntary  organization , "Future  of Life Institute  (FLI) ," was established   in Boston (USA)  in 2014, and enables  not only researchers  in various  fields  such as  humanities,  social  science, and natural  sciences  but also actors,  students, and entrepreneurs   with various  background s to gather  and deal  with  existential risks  that the development  of  AI can bring  to human beings  as well as biotechnology,  nuclear  weapons , and climate   change.  Funding  for AI R&D , organization of conferences ,4 and enlightenment  activities   are promoted using  donation s. Future  risks  of Artificial General  Intelligence  (AGI)  and  safety  concerning  AI (AI safety)  are also involved in  the study.   In the "Future  of Humanity  Institute  (FHI)"  (established  in 2005)  of Oxford  University   (UK),  the existential risks  to mankind, including AI safety , are studied.  In the "Center  for  the Study  of Existential Risks  (CSER)"  (established  in 2012)  of Cambridge  University,   prediction and evaluation  of global  catastrophic risks  due to the development  of science                                                               2 Peter  Stone,  Rodney  Brooks,  Erik Brynjolfsson,  Ryan  Calo,  Oren  Etzioni,  Greg  Hager,  Julia  Hirschberg,   Shivaram  Kalyanakrishnan,  Ece Kamar,  Sarit  Kraus,  Kevin Leyton -Brown,  David  Parkes,  William  Press,   AnnaLee Saxenian,  Julie  Shah,  Milind  Tambe,  and Astro  Teller.

11 and technology, especiall y AGI, are studied.   Activities  for organizing  an Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  on AI R&D  in a private   company  as well as for making  a partnership  of companies  to publicize  correctly  AI's  influence  on society  and to share information  to prevent  bad effects  on society  and ethics   have  been  reported.   Government  agencies  and international  organizations  commence similar  studies. For  example,  in the United  States,  the Office  of Science and Technology  Policy  (OSTP)  held  workshops  four times  with participation from  citizens  and studied the benefits  and risks   that AI technology  brings  to society  (the report  was released  in October  2016).5  In the  Organization  for Economic  Co-operation and Development  (OECD),  the Committee  on  Digital Economy  Policy  mainly  began  attempting to examine necessary  policies  and the  benefits  that digitalization  including  AI technology  brings  to society.     2.2 Trends  in Japan   The Japanese Society  for Artificial Intelligence  (JSAI)  has put importance  on  connectivity  with society  taking  into consideration  the high  presence and  strong  impact  of  AI in the general  society  along  with the opportunity  that changes  to the journal ’s name  and  cover  design  would  becom e an important  topic  in society  as a trigger .6  The Ethics   Committee  was established  in December  2014 with the aim of discussing  and considering  the relationship  between  AI and society,  then it released  the Ethic al Guideline s in February   2017. The "Acceptable  Intelligence  with Responsibility  (AIR )," where  researchers  in fields   such as scien ce, technology  and society  (STS) , and AI gather , mainly  examin es dialogue   during  on-site visits  and interview s about  the social  acceptance  of AI. The study  group  on  robot  law in the Information Network  Law Association  is investigating  international   research  trends  of social  institutions  and consumer  protection. Efforts  are being  made from   such various  perspectives.   The "Fifth  Science and Technology  Basic  Plan,"7  formulated  by the Council  for  Science,  Technology , and Innovation (CSTI)  and started  in 2016, is a plan to implement a  systematic  and consistent  science and technology  policy  from  a long- term perspective.   That AI technology  is an impo rtant part of realiz ing Society  5.0, the importance  of  deepening  the relationship  between  science and technology  innovation and society,  and  ethical,  legal  and social  efforts  are mentioned in the plan. In February  2016, the Ministry   of Internal  Affairs  and Communications  set up "The Committee  for AI Networking"  to  evaluate the  impacts  and risks  of AI networking  on society  and the economy. The meeting   then released  the princip les for AI R&D . Since  October  2016,  "The Committee  for  Promoting  AI Network  Society " has continued  mak ing guidelines  for AI R&D.                                                                   5 https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/defa ult/files/whitehouse_files/microsites/ostp/NSTC/preparin g_for_the_future_of_ai.pdf  (retrieved  on February  24, 2017).   6 Matsuo  et al.

12 Will AI surpass  human  intelligence?     Artificial Intelligence  (AI) has been  presented  as beings  that are a possible  threat  to humans  or  that feel conflicted  just as humans  do, due to their intelligence  either  equaling or surpassing  that of  humans  in the science fiction  (SF) world. There  has recently  been  much  discussion  on AI and human   society  all over the world, and a part of such discussion  seems  to be based  on the image  of AI that  has been  created  in the SF world. In what  follows,  we consider  the probability  of such AI threats   becoming reality  in order  to identify  ways  in which  to further deepen  discussion  on AI and human  society.    AI that tries to control  or extinguish the human race has been  described  in SF; e.g., the movies   The Terminator  and The Matrix  as well as Japanese cartoon  "Phoenix:  A Tale Of The Future. " The  movies  2001:  A Space  Odyssey, Alien , Blade  Runner , and Ex Machina  presented  AI that attempts  to  harm  humans .  Movies  like Bicentennial  Man and A.I. depicted  AI that feels  conflicted , just as humans. The  movie Her presented  romance between  a man and an AI woman. Regarding such AIs, there  have   recently  been  discussions  on how to deal with extraneous  things  that consist of machineries  and  computer  programs  and yet seem  to have human- like mind s as well as on whether  such AI should   be developed  [1].  The probability  of AI with great  intellect becoming  reality  may seem  plausible  given  the recent   rapid  advancement  of AI that has enabled  its victory  over humans, e.g., the quiz  champions  [2], the  Go champion [3], and the experienced  fighter  pilot [4] and that approach  a human  level  even  in the  fields  of creation,  e.g., recipes  [5] and novels  [6].  However,  any actual  and current AI technologies  are basically  executed  functions  of computer   programs,  i.e., a description  of a concrete computation process that reflects  the objective  given  by  human programmers.  Basically,  it only works  according  to the human programmers’  intention , since   it cannot  set its own objective s, unlike  the AI of SF described  above,  though recent  advancement   such as deep  learning  has made  it possible  for computers  to learn  from  data.  AI sometimes  might   not work  according  to its human  programmers’  intention  if it is based  on machine learning  or  statistical methods  or if it contains  bugs. However,  it is almost  impossible  for AI to set its own  objective  independent  of human  programmers  and behave in a rational manner  toward  that objective.   The objective s given  to actual  AI are specific  and concrete tasks by which  the human programmers’   desired  output  is obtained from  a given  input;  actual  AI only performs specific  and concrete tasks   like image  recognition, speech  recognition, and automated  driving. So far, existing  AI does not have  general  intelligence , as humans  do; it can only automate  the execution  of specific  and concrete tasks.   It cannot  be completely  denied  that entirely  new  hardware and  software  will be  invented  through   technological  advancement,  which  will remove  the current  AI’s limitations  and create artificial   general  intelligence  (AGI)  or Superintelligence  (a hypothetical AI that possesses intelligence  far  surpassing  that of the brightest and most  gifted  human  minds  [7]), which  will be a threat  to  huma nkind. We should be aware  of the potential risk of harmful  people  using AI to case damage  human society.  However,  the probability  that AI will have  its own intention s and could  spell the end 
13 of human race will be  quite  low over  the coming decades.   A White  House  report , Preparing for the Future  of Artificial Intelligence , published October  2016 ,  says that general  AI will not be achieved  for at least decades  [8]. The One Hundred Year Study  on  Artificial Intelligence  (AI100)  [9], where  Stanford University  plays a central  role in discussing  AI  and human society,  has recently  published a report , Artificial Intelligence  and Life in 2030 [9], that  states  that “Contrary  to the more  fantastic  predictions  for AI in the popular  press,  the Study  Panel   found no cause  for concern  that AI is an imminent threat  to humankind.”  Andrew  Ng, an expert  in  machine learning  in Baidu, states  that “The reason  I say that I don’t  worry  about  AI turning evil is  the same  reason  I don’t  worry  about  overpopulation on Mars ” [10].   On the othe r hand, the  Future  of Life  Institute  (FLI)  [11],  where  existential risks including  AI are  being studied, mentions, as the reason  why they mainly  study  AI with  intelligence  equaling humans   or Superintelligence,  that we should start studying  such AI immediately  given  its huge  impact  on  humankind [12].   Our view  is that,  for further deepening of  the discussion  on AI and human society,  it is important   to balance the opposing positions  mentioned above:  the one in which  discussion  of AI and human  society  should be realistic , pragmatic , and based  on a precise  understanding of the current  states  of  technologies , and the other  in which  we should consider  the worst -case scenario  regardless of the  probability  of its being reality.

14   Approach     The Advisory  Board  aimed  to create concrete discuss ions on probable  situations,   rather  than abstract  discussions  on concerns  or the blueprints  of the distant  future.   Therefore,  the board  adopted  an approach  based  on cases  to estimate  the influence  on  society  by focusing  on existing  AI technologies  as well as those  foreseeable in the near  future . The board members,  experts  in various  categories,  and business  executives   participated  in the discussion, and some  examples  were extracted  considering  ethics,   legal ity, economics,  and others, as  imaging  the near  future.   In addition, public  comments , a brainstorming  workshop with university  students  who  were interested  in AI and human society,  and public  workshops  at Miraikan  (National   Museum  of Emerging  Science and Innovation)  with the general  public , including  children ,  were conducted  to widely  collect  opinions  and/or  examples.  As a result,  common issues   relative  to several  categories  were identified . These issues enabled  the members  to consider   a many -sided  discussion about  human society,  for example,  to analyze employment   problems  from  econom ic, education al, and  R&D  viewpoints.    3.1 Categories  of cases   Applying  AI technologies  to various  life scenes  in the near future  would  change  personal  lifestyle  and business  factors.  The four categories  of mobility,  manufacturing,   personal  services  included  medical  care and  finance,  and conversation/communication are   especially  suggested  to greatly  impact  immediate  lifestyle  and business. Therefore,  these  categories  were selected  for the discussions  in consideration of characteristic Japan ese  industries, and  many  examples  were collected.   ● Mobility: c overing  moving  persons  and goods , e.g. , autonomous  cars,  ride-share  services,  and delivery  systems  by drone.   ● Manufacturing:  covering  manufactu ring and production, e.g. , fully  automated   factories,  power -assisting  suits  that extend  abilities  of operations, highly   accurate manufacturing,  and reproduction of  arts and expert  techniques.   ● Personal  services  including  medical  care and  finance:  covering  ICT services  for  individual s, e.g. , e-commerce,  recommend ing services  with  web  browsing,  medical  care services  appl ying AI technologies,  robot  advisers , transaction   support  system s and/or  credit  administration s based  on AI technologies.   ● Conversation/Communication:  covering  human communications  using  ICT or  robotics  and human -machine  communications, e.g. , anthropomorphic  (spoken)   dialogue  agents,  chat  bots, and  machine translation  services.     3.2 Overview  of issues   A statement  on science and technology ’s relationship with human society has required   ELSI  assessments since  the Human  Genome  Project . AI technologies  supposed that  industries  and labor  could  economically  change in perspective.  It was implied  that 
15 reform ing the education  system  would effectively  work  for children  if a point  is made to  include  computer  science and AI study.  Furthermore, appropriate  AI progress  suggests   applying  the board’s  conclusion to AI R&D.  Thus, the board  adopted three additional   perspectives  (Economic, Educational, and R&D  issues)  and facilitated  discus sion  considering  six points  of view.    ● Ethical  issues:  ethics  and moral ity relative  to outputs  of AI technologies  and  those  values.   ● Legal  issues:  laws  and/or  contracts  relative  to utilizing  AI technologies,  responsibility  for AI products, and  protection of  personal  information.   ● Economic  issues:  changes  in the economy, companies,  and labor  by the  populariz ation  of a lifestyle  based  on AI  technologies  as well as required   policies.   ● Educational  issues:  identifying  how  to improve  the education  system  and  resolve  problems  for schools, colleges,  universities,  education  suppliers, and   students.   ● Social  issues:  the relationship  between  users  and the  implementation  of AI  technologies  as well  as indirectly  resultant  social  problems.  ● R&D  issues:  the implementation  by AI researchers  and engineers  of AI  technologies  and educating  users  about  how  to avoid  the disadvantages  of AI  products  and/or  servic es.    3.3 Extracting  common key issues   According  to the discussions  of many  examples  from  the four categories,  the objective   of the Advisory  Board  was to provide  common key issues  from  the six points  of view.   Typical  cases  of implemented  AI technologies  were  selected  in order  to create a matrix  in  which  the columns  indicated  categories  and the rows  explained  examples.  By analyzing   the matrix,  key issues were  extracted.   Although this approach  enabled  the member s to discuss  the key issues,  the result   suppos ed that care would  be taken  not to arrive  at an exhaustive  extraction  of all of the key  issues.  In addition, the examples  had different  implementation  time-scales  and market   values.  The Advisory  Board also had not dealt  with items  such as anti-social  or unexpected   usage  of AI technologies,  autonomous  AI networking  products, and others. Therefore,  the  above -mentioned issues still require  further  study. The Advisory  Board focused  on realistic   and significant examples  that are current  or foreseeable for the near future,  and they  summarized  critical  issues to  contribut e to continuing  discussions.

17   Summary  of the issues  to be addressed regarding   AI technologies  and human society     AI technologies  support  and augment  human intellect and actions,  and they execute   parts  of intellectual behaviors  on behalf  of humans. Thus, it supposes  to greatly  benefit  and  empower  human society  and to contribute  to ensur ing its sustainability  if utilized  safely   and beneficially.  However,  AI researchers/engineers,  governments , and business  sectors  as  well as humanities  and social  scientists,  education suppliers, and the general  public  need   to consider  an appropriate  relationship  between  AI technologies  and human society  and to  prepare for it to realize  and support  a sustainabl e society.  The Advisory  Board  has  attempted  to identify  key issues to  be addressed  as summarized  below.    4.1 Ethical  issues   The changing relationship  between  humans  and AI technologies  and the  emerging new sense of ethics   Human s have utilized  various  tools  and machines  to make choices  and decisions   depending  on circumstances.  The advancement  of AI technologies  is increasing the cases   in which  they, using  big data,  can make accurate and quick  decisions, semi -automatic   operations, and statistically  appropriate  choices.  When  AI technologies  support  human   choices  and decisions, there are many  benefits,  such as improvement  in accuracy  and speed   as well as independence  from  human cognitive  bias and prejudice.8  However,  it is  important  to consider  the balance  between  human  decisions  and AI-based  decisions   depending  on the situations  and objects  to be judged .9 Since relationships  between  humans   and AI services/products/machines  have  gradually  changed  as AI technologies  have  advance d, it is likely that there is an emergence of a new sense of ethics  based  on these  evolving  relationships.    Concerns  about  manipu lating  emotion,  faith,  and behavior  and ranking or  selecting  AI technologies  without  awareness    AI technologies  are becoming  able to support  and make decisions  and actions  that only  humans  have  previously  been  able to perform.  Many  people  have concerns  and anxieties   about  AI’s potential  manipulation  or operation of their mind s and behavior, the evalu ation   or ranking  of people  by AI technologies,  and AI influencing  people’s  emotions , affection s,                                                              8 Cognitive  bias is a confirmation  bias or a fundamental  ascription  error.  Confirmation  bias is the cognitive   tendency to overestimate self-serving hypothetical  information  and emphasize  confirmation.  However,  it  is also known  that AI technology  based  on machine  learning  deviates  from  judgment  based  on the biases   of learning data (algorithm  bias) , requiring  to prevent  inequity  based  on the algorithm  bias.   9 For instance,  there  is an unsolved  ethical  problem  regarding  whether  one driver  of a car should  be sacrificed   rather  than several  passengers  in another  car in an inevitable  emergency based  on utility;  humans  may want   to save their own lives  while  AI technologies  can be set to give priority  to many  lives  over fewer  lives   based  on utility.  Thus,  at the current  stage,  how we consider  the balance between  huma n and AI-based   decisions  is significant . 
18 and faith.10 Ethical  discussions  might especially  be needed  if these are conducted  without   people’s  awareness.     Revisiting  the concept  of humanity   The future  blueprints  show  that AI technologies11 augment  human being s’ senses  and  abilities  regarding  space,  time,  and the body.  According  to this, changing  concepts  of  human abilit y and emotion  are supposed. With  interaction s such as augmenting  senses,   there is an opportunity  to revisit the concept  of humanity  by taking  account  of these AI’s  potential .12    Considering the value  of products  and actions  relating  to AI technologies :  The diversity  in values and future  prospects   The application  of AI technologies  has enhanced  productivity  quantitatively  and  qualitatively.  AI technologies  simply  produce  objects  that otherwise  either  could be made  only by artists/experts  or would require  high costs  and/or  a long time to generate. This  indicat es that everyone should have  access  to such high-quality  items.  Increasingly,  new  evaluation  procedures  have  been  required  to observe  the values  (e.g.,  originality, utility,   and virtue)  of products  made and actions  performed  by humans,  AI technologies, and  cooperati on between  both. The objective  is to provide  assessment  results  about  how those   values  are accepted  in society.  Furthermore, it is also important  to provide  opportunities   for dialogue  among  various  people. Cooperation between  humans  and AI technologies  can  lead to the augmentation  of human ability  being  a basis  of a new sense  of values. To realize  this objective,  continuous  discussions  about  various  choices  and a diversity  of values  are  strongly  demanded  based  on recognition  of individuals’  differences  in values  and future   prospects.     4.2 Legal  issues   Clarifying  the locus  of responsibility  and utilizing  insurance : Considering  the risks  of using and not using AI technologies   Considering  legal  issues  contributes  to the acceleration  of AI technolog y utilization   and acceptance safely  in society.  Previously , statistical reports  showed that most  traffic   accidents  were caused  by human errors  and carelessness.  Although  autonomous  cars enable  users  to expect  traffic  accidents  to decreas e and thus create a safer  society,  one may be  concerned  about  who is responsible  for accidents  caused  by autonomous  car systems.   Society ’s nearly implemented  AI technologies  require  clear  determin ation  of the locus  of  responsibility  for risks,  accidents,  rights  infringement,  benefits , and achievements.  For  human society  to accept  and benefit  from  AI technologies,  it could be useful  to clarify  the  locus  of responsibility  according  to the levels  of technological  advancement  (e.g.,  levels  0  to 4 for automated  driving  technology)13  and to deal with uncertain, probabilistic  risks                                                               10 Similar  concerns  have  been  discussed  on TV and poster  advertisements , and companies  keep  voluntary   restrictions.  When applying AI technologies,  careful  attention  and consideration  are required  since   services  and advertisements  are optimized  for individuals.   11 Change  by daily  use of automated  machines  such as autonomous  cars or AI-based  prosthes es.  12 What  is human  ability?  Does  it include  daily -used AI technologies  or prosthes es?  13 It is said that drivers  are responsible  for the accidents  caused  by automated  driving at the levels  of 0 to 2. 
19 through insurance14 . This is also important  in preventing  businesses  from  becoming   intimidated  by or overreacting  to reputation risks.  Similarly,  discussion from  another  point   of view  facilitates  solving  legal  issues,  such as human  society ’s need  to discuss  the risks  of  losing  opportunities  and credibility  by not using  AI technologies .15    Exploitation of big data with consider ation  of information privacy   protection  The ability  to exploit  big data would make AI technolog ies more  useful. It is necessary   to consider  appropriate  institutional frameworks  (laws,  guidelines, and contracts)  to avoid  the chilling  effects  of privacy  invasion and to balance  the usefulness  of AI technologies   with privacy  issues.  A mature society  has to discuss  access  rights  to personal  information   data, data portability,  and related  security  issues with international  cooperation. One of the  prospects  supposes  government  services  based  on AI technologies  to embody  the above mentioned considerations .     Considering the rights  of and incentives  for creation s by AI technologies   The exploitation  of AI technologies  encourages  the easy creat ion of high-value  products16 by various  people , such as algorithm developers,  learned -data providers, service   provider s, and final creators.  It is necessary  to consider  who retains  the property  rights  to  a creation  or a learned  model  produced by AI technologies  or the collaboration between  AI  technologies  and humans  (i.e., issues of data ownership). Furthermore, to facilitate  the  development  and utilization  of AI technologies,  human society  is required  to find an  appropriate  method of assignment  of rights  (incentives)  to algorithm developers,  algorithm  users,  and data providers  by means  of appropriate  contracts  and guidelines  on a case- bycase basis.     Interpretation  and revision  of laws  and the basic science of underlying  legal  concepts   Continuous  discussions  contribute  to appropriately  revis ing laws (on transportation,  business, medicine,  labor ,17 and others)  with the change s to jobs and employment  caused   by AI technologies.  There  is the possibility  of fundamentally  reconsidering the  underlying  concept s of laws, such as human responsibility . For example,  the existing  laws do not have  answers  to clearly  determine  the locus  of responsibility  for an output  by AI technologies   or collaboration of humans  and AI technologies , as AI technologies  based  on machine   learning  are socially  implemented .18  The process  of accepting  AI technologies  requires                                                               14 The government  needs  to discuss  whether  a mandatory  insurance  as social  insurance  should  be  implemented  and who pay for its premium.   15 For example,  a patient could  recover  from  a disease  if an AI-utilized  diagnosis  has been  applied,  but he/she   could  not be given such diagnosis.   16 Industrial  robots  that can work  either  at the level  of or better  than human  experts  as well as AI technologies   that can create pieces  of work  by modeling  the style  of famous  human artists  are already  being  put to  practical  use.  17 If self-employment  is becoming  popular  as predicted,  the present  labor  laws may change  because they  mainly  concern  employees'  rights  at work.   18 If someone  is wearing  a myoelectric -controlled  powered  exoskeleton while  working in a factory , and a  nearby  coworker  is accidentally  harm ed because of an unintentional  movement  of the exoskeleton , who  is responsible  for this accident?  Do we possibly  regard  myoelectric  signals  as the user’s  intention  and 
20 human society  to advance  as well as the technologies.  Thus, discussions  and social  sciences   are required  to reconsider  fundamental  concepts , such as human responsibilities , that  modern law s are based  on.19    4.3 Economic  issues   AI technologies  have promoted economic  and industrial  activities,  and they generate   additional  employment in new jobs such as providing  data for machine  learning.  The  comparative  advantage  of AI technologies  drastically  changes  the power  relationships  in  business, just as the small  number  of companies  that successfully  explo ited big data on the  Internet  gained  extensive power  in the information  society.  Careful  awareness  is effective  at avoiding  industrial  monopoly , especially  with regard  to its influence  on society.  It is also  anticipated  that many  companies  can reduce business  costs  and improve  their business   impetus,  since AI technologies  services/products  require  less labor  power  to operate.   However,  quick  and appropriate  actions  are needed  since  an economically  inefficient   situation  might occur  at the transition  phase  when AI technologies  are being  implemented   ethically,  legally , and  societally.      Changes  in tasks  and the way people  work  caused  by AI technologies:   Individual  workers   AI technologies  have increasingly  become capable of doing  automated  jobs/tasks  in  place of humans . Consequently,  many  people  are required  to focus  on more  creative   activities,  for instance,  changing  jobs. One issue  that needs  to be addressed  is how to  harmonize  an individual ’s abilities  with  a creative job/task. In the case where it is  difficult  to change  jobs, that is, human resources  do not meet  with job requirements, both of  unemployment  and a labor  short age will occur  at the same time. To avoid these problems,   an individual  has to acquire the abilit y to work  creatively.  As new businesses  increasingly   implement AI technologies, work  styles  also change in various  ways  that enable more   people  to work  on their  own  account.     Change s in employment  systems and companies  due to the utilization  of AI  technologies:  Companies   AI technologies  are now crucial  for industries  and companies  if they are to compete  internationally.  The change of work  style  can be contributed to AI technologies  facilitating  the reduction  of tedious, prolonged, and  exhausting  jobs/tasks  and the increas e high -value   work , as previously  mentioned. This also requires  companies  to reconsider  their manner  of  decision  making  and staff (re)assignment  in order  to take advantage  of work  flexibility  that  is unconstrained by time and space,  e.g., teleworkin g. Companies  should have  impetus  to  make quick  decision s and take action  when  acquisition  of human resources  that can                                                              therefore blame  the user? Otherwise,  is the data provider  or algorithm  developer  respons ible for the  accident?  There  is not yet a clear  answer.   19 For instance,  autonomous  cars are expected  to decrease traffic  accidents  and make  human  mobility  much   safer  than it is at present . However,  very rare accident s would  occur  in unexpected  situation s that differ   from  learned  data, where  the locus  of responsibility  is unclear.  Insurance  is effective for protecting  people   from  econ omical  loss in such accident s. However,  how we accept  such accident s/event s personally  and  socially  is a substantial,  basic  question  for the social  sciences  requiring  further  study and discussion.  
21 develop or utilize  AI technologies  or reassignment  of labor  are needed.  For employee  reassignment,  it is effective for companies  to provide  education  opportunities.    Industrial  policies facilitating  AI technology  utilization , and educational  and  employment  policies  enabling labor  mobility : The government   At the government  level,  it is necessary  to formulate  policies  that provide  opportunities   for people  to learn  abilities  that enable labor  mobility20  in order  to facilitate  economic   growth  through  AI technologies  and ensure  that is are a variety  of work  styles  suita ble for  individuals .21 The government  also has to contribute  to determining  how to harmonize  an  individual ’s abilities  with a creative job/task. Combining  educational  and employment   policies  is one of the effective procedures  for enabling  labor  movement . In addition, the  government  has to appropriately  put macroeconomic policies  and safety  nets in  perspective.  The procedures  for the fair distribution of profits  based  on AI  services/products,  economic revitalization,  and preventi on of economic  disparities  should  be proposed  through consideration  of the benefits . Since AI technologies  are beneficial  for  Japan  in confronting  labor  shortage, policies  that enhanc e industrial  competitiveness   should be accelerated.  Those policies  will be more  effective if users  provide  their opinions   about  companies’  activities  and the government’s  policies.     4.4 Educational issues   Cultivating  individuals’  ability  to utilize  AI technologies   AI services/products  work  appropriately  if users  understand their benefits  and risks,   learn  how to identify  responsibilities,  and operate  them  perfectly  to keep  them  under   control. Significant issues are need  to understand the advantages  and limits  of the current   AI technologies,  to perfectly  utilize  AI technologies, and to perform  creative activities  in  collaborat ion with  AI technologies.     Enhancing essential  human abilities  that AI technologies  cannot  perform   Education policy  functions  according  to discussions  about  how to efficiently  reform   the curriculum  based  on evidence  that show s the limitations  of technologies. For example,   a deep  understanding  of semantics,  the utiliz ation  of experience- based  imagination  in novel   situations , the ability  to identify  a problem  that should be solved, the ability  to  communicat e and collaborat e, and the ability  to explore  novel  information  actively  and to  discuss  and incorporate  the opinions  of others  are all abilities  that current  machine- learning   AI technologies  seem  unable  to perform,  and they are expected  to become more  importan t.  Enhancing  these abilities  differentiates  humans  from  AI technologies  and makes  humans   perform  creative tasks  by utilizing  AI technologies, which  leads  to the realiz ation  of a  sustainable  society  with high productivit y and less labor. Education for child ren is  especially  urgent  because  it takes  time, and the development  of AI technologies  is so rapid .  It is important  to consider  what  abilities  should be still learned  by humans  for proper  brain   development  even  though the activities  enabled  by said abilities  can be performed  instead   by AI technologies.                                                              20  “Labor  mobility ” refers  to individual  workers  changing jobs across  companies,  industries,  and job  categories  in the labor  market.   21 This issue  is related  to educational  issues.  Continuing education  to update  the knowledge  and skills  of the  labor  force  is increasingly  important  in addition  to education  for children.  
22     4.5 Social  issues   Freedom  to use (or not use) AI technologies  and people’s  dialog ue on  common social  value s  The social  benefits  from  AI technologies  are numerous , such as the realization  of social   security  and safety,  improvement  of productivity  to counter  labor  shortages, a decreasing   birthrate,  an aging  population, and the facilitation of participation  by various  people   (inclusiveness)  with individually  optimized  AI technolog y supports . Thus, AI technologies   are crucial  to the realiz ation  of Society  5.0. However,  like many  other  tools  and  technologies, AI technologies’  utilization  cannot  be socially  enforced.  It may  be necessary   to take into consideration the need  to ensure the freedom  to use AI technologies, based  on  an individual ’s faith,  and avoiding  social  conflict  between  users  and non-users  of AI  technologies. AI technologies  work  as a part of Information  Technologies  (IT) or software   programs , so users  cannot  simp ly confirm  AI services/products  by their  appearance.  Thus,   a discussion is required  about  whether  AI technologies  should be always  explicit.   Furthermore,  Society  5.0 demands  the avoidance of social  conflicts  between  AI  services/products  users  and non-users.  This also requires  continuous  dialogue  among   people  with different  visions  and ideas,  including experts,  regard ing opposi ng opinions  in  order  to consider  common, fundamental  social  values.     AI divide , the unbalanced burden of social  costs relative  to AI, and the  preventi on of discrimination   To maximize  the benefits  from  AI technologies,  in addition to appropriate  knowledge   of the AI technologies  themselves , users  need  digital goods  and services literacy  and  knowledge  of data privacy.  However,  all people  cannot  acquire or maintain  this knowledge   and literacy,  and it might be a causal  factor  in the so-called  “AI divide .” For example,   “rideshare,”  backed  by AI optimization  technologies , could offer a new means  of transport   at a low cost comparative to taxis; therefore,  it is supportive  of socially  disadvantaged  people. However, access  to these services  require  a minimum familiarity  with digital   devices, so those without  literacy  may be excluded  from  the benefit  of rideshare  services.   As rideshar ing becomes  popular, the traditional taxi services  may become expensive  or  diminished. Therefore,  it is necessary  to take this into consideration when  mak ing policies   to avoid generating  an imbalanced  social  cost burden and a new differential caused  by  literacy,  knowledge,  and assets.  Potential discrimination  based  on the output  of personal   profiling  by AI technologies  must  be prevented .    New social  pathology,  conflict,  and dependence  on AI technologies   With  increasing  opportunities  to use AI technologies  in social  contexts,  there is a  possibility  of generating  social  pathology  and new social  problems, such as excessive  rejection,  overconfidence, and dependence on AI technol ogies.  Recommendation  and  personal  optimization  by AI technologies  may limit available information  for individuals   and increase the tendency  for people  to regard  the limited  information  as universal. It is,  therefore,  necessary  to provide  accurate informat ion and opportunit ies for dialogue  and  training.  
23       4.6 Research  and Development  issues   Ethics,  accountability,  and visualization   Researchers  and engineers  are required  to engage  in R&D  in AI-related  areas  with a  high level  of professional  ethics22 while  observing  the ethical  codes  and guidelines  of their  academic societies  and organizations23 and with accountability  for them.  AI technologies   have  feature s that users  are hardly  aware of ; they  use the technology  yet do not know  how   it actually  works  inside  the products/services.  Thus,  R&D  is recommend ed regarding  the  appearance of AI technologies  and to visualiz e how much  AI technologies  are used in  decisions  or actions.     Security,  privacy protection,  controllability,  and transparency   Scientists  and engineers  are required  to establish  environments  with robust  cyber security  and safety  in which  to use AI technologies . It is especially  essential  to develop   technology  that enables  us to choose  how much personal  data to share,  the level  of  individual  privacy  to be protected , and what  kind of information  can be used publicly. R&D   should be conducted to develop technologies  that enable people  to control  the safety   features  of AI technologies,  to explain  the processes  and logics  of calculations  inside  AI  technologies, to  provide  interfaces  that smoothly  perform  transitions  of control  from  AI to  human, especially  in emergencies .    Appropriate  disclosure of information:  Promoting the humanit ies, social   sciences , and research  collaboration   AI technologies  based  on machine learning  produce  statistically  valid  outputs, and  they statistically  benefit  human society.  For this paradigm  to be accepted  in society,   scientists  and engineers  are required  to explain  it appropriately. When  spreading  new  technologies, researchers  and engineers  might have  to invest  effort  in explaining  their  benefits  and risks  fairly.  To discuss  the relationship  between  AI technologies  and human   society  adequately  and to design  and realize a better  future  society,  researche rs in the  humanit ies and social  scien ces should acquire up-to-date knowledge  of new technologies   and utilize  them  in their research . Scientists  and engineers  should collaborate with  researchers  in the humanit ies and social  scien ces for pursuing  socially  beneficial  AI  technologies.     Diversity  of AI technologies  for social  diversity   While  AI technologies  are currently  advancing  in deep  learning  and machine learning,                                                               22  “Principles  in AI R&D  Guideline s” have  been  proposed by Japan’s  Ministry  of Internal  Affairs  and  Communications  (MIC):  (1) transparency,  (2) user assistance,  (3) controllability,  (4) security,  (5) safety,   (6) privacy,  (7) ethics,  and (8) accountability  (interim  report  publishe d in April  2016;  Annual  report   published  in June 2016).   23  The Japanese Society of Artificial Intelligence  published  “Ethical Guidelines ” in February  2017 . The  Institutional Review  Board  (IRB)  on AI will be established  in research  institutes,  universities,  and  companies  in the near future.  
24 there are various  basic theories  and technologies.  In the future, new theor ies will emerge  and further promote  AI technologies. The government  needs  to promote  basic sciences  and  create an environment  that supports  open science to enhance R&D  in AI technology   diversity.  This will contribute  to the advancement , robustness, and safety  of AI  technologies. Such  technological  diversity  seems  suited  for social  diversity.  
25   Conclusion     Japan,  with  its energy  and resource  constraints  and demographic  pressure,  is placed   among  developed  countries  on the  front  line in seek ing new  societal  models , ensuring   sustainable  and inclusive  growth , and  maximizing  the wellbeing  of its citizens.  To take  the lead  in this endeavor,  the full potential  of science,  technology  and innovation (STI)   should be  explored, and  in this perspective, AI is considered to  be a priority.  Accordingly,   the Japan ese government  proposed the  concept  of Society  5.0, which  fully  utilizes  STI  for humans  and society.   Recognizing that  AI has tremendous  potential  to generate benefits  for society  while  it  also may engender  safety  concerns  or other  side effects,  the Advisory  Board  proceeded   with an in-depth discussion of cases  of AI technologies  deployed  today  or likely  to be  developed in the foreseeable future  with the aim of extract ing key challenges  to be  addressed  to ensure  the intellig ent use of AI for the  benefit  of human society.   Recent  acceleration  of the advancement  of AI technologies  makes  it difficult for  institutional and social  adaptation  to keep  pace,  which  leads  the government  to address  the  question  of transition  management.  The Advisory  Board  concluded  that the government   should enact  policies  relative  to industrial  competitiveness,  employment,  and education   about  social  sciences  for future  design  while  promoting  AI technologies.    We have  already  initiated  international  discu ssion  on these key issues and are engaged   in pursuing this process . We consider  clarifying  the relationship between  AI technologies   and human society  to be a prerequisite  to the realiz ation  of a sustainable  society,  and we  believe that addressing  the funda mental  question, “What  values  are share d by humans  all  over the world ,” is unavoidable .  The Advisory  Board  wishes  for this report  to be shared  by AI researchers/engineers,   governments, and business  sectors  as well as researchers  in the humanities  and social   scien ces, education  suppliers, and the general  public  so they can open debates  and take  actions .
