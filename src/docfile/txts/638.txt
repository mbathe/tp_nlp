Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               5    PREFACE   The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg and TIR Consulting Group LLC have engaged in a deep  collaborative initiative over the past twelve months, designed to transform the country into the  first nation -state of the smart green Third Industrial Revolution era. The year -long project has  culminated in a 475 page  Third  Industrial Revolution Strategy Study to help guide the Grand  Duchy of Luxembourg into the next stage of its journey.   The process itself has established a new milestone in the governance of economic and social  development. More than 300 socio -econom ic actors  from government, the business  community, academia, and civil society actively participated in the proceedings and in the  preparation of the final Strategy Study and accompanying proposals. The government of the  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg took on a  new role as a facilitator of the process, replacing  traditional top -down governance with a peer approach, engaging a broad representative swath  of the Luxembourger community in jointly planning the Third Industrial Revolution Strategy  Study. The final Thi rd Industrial Revolution Strategy Study for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg  encompasses the combined input of the 300 stakeholders and TIR Consulting Group LLC’s global  team of experts.   The Third Industrial Revolution Strategy Study breaks additional ground  by taking a cross disciplinary approach to the future development of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, combining  social, cultural, and environmental narratives and economic theory and business practices, with  the goal of reconceiving economic development wit hin a larger frame of “quality of life.” While  the early takeoff stage of the digital Third Industrial Revolution focused almost exclusively on  new technologies, products, and services – the Silicon Valley model –, the Grand Duchy of  Luxembourg has introdu ced the next level of engagement by concentrating equally on how the  new Third Industrial Revolution infrastructure fosters an emerging global interconnectivity and  accompanying planetary stewardship of the Earth’s ecosystems – the Biosphere Valley model.  In the Biosphere Era, Luxembourg and every other political jurisdiction becomes responsible for  its 19 kilometers of the biosphere stretching from the stratosphere to the sea, which makes up  the life force of the planet and constitutes the indivisible comm unity to which we are all  beholden and whose well -being determines our own quality of life. Biosphere stewardship  becomes the essential mission of each region and locality in reducing ecological footprint and  addressing climate change in the coming era.   The Third Industrial Revolution narrative proposed in th is Strategy Study introduces a  sophisticated and nuanced new approach to economic development  based on establishing  digital ecosystems that mirror the dynamics of natural ecosystems, with the goal of es tablishing  a seamless symbiotic relationship between the circular flows of nature and the economic 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               6    activities of the Luxembourger society. With this in mind, the Strategy Study continually hones  in on critical ecosystem features including self -organization , mutualism, co -evolution, diversity,  emergence, resiliency, and adaptation in modelling Luxembourg’s new digital ecosystems and  accompanying business practices and regulatory regime.   Luxembourg has now developed the vision, the narrative, and the game pl an to usher in a  smart green digital society, paving the way for the nationwide deployment of a Third Industrial  Revolution transition.   The publication and deployment of the Third Industrial Revolution Strategy Study positions the  Grand Duchy of Luxembour g as a flagship nation in the European Union build out and scale up  of a smart digital society. As a major financial center  of Europe, Luxembourg can play an  important role in marshalling the financial resources and preparing the EU regulatory  framework fo r the scaling of a Third Industrial Revolution infrastructure across the 28 Member  States and adjoining partnership regions to advance the European Dream of a borderless digital  infrastructure and integrated single market.

Economists are predicting 30 more  years of low productivity and slow growth. And now, after two Industrial Revolu tions in the 19th  and 20th Centuries, we can begin to assess the impact of this economic period in human history.  Arguably, 50% of the human race today is far better off than our ancestors were before the  onset of the industrial era. It is also fair to say  that 40% of the human race, that is still making  two dollars per day or less, is not appreciably better off than its ancestors were before the  Industrial Revolution. At the same time, economic inequality between the rich and the poor is  at the highest poi nt in human history. Today, the combined wealth of the 62 richest human  beings in the world equals the accumulative wealth of half of the human beings currently living  on Earth – 3.5 billion people.1   This dire economic reality is now compounded by the rap id acceleration of climate change  brought on by the increasing emissions of global warming gases  during the First and Second  Industrial Revolutions . James Hansen, former head of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space  Studies and the chief climatologist for t he U.S. government, forecasts a 6°C rise in the Earth’s  temperature between now and the turn of the century —and with it, the end of human  civilization as we’ve come to know it.  The only hope, according to Hansen, is to reduce the  current concentration of c arbon in the atmosphere from 385 ppm to 350 ppm or less — something no government is currently proposing.2  What makes these dramatic spikes in the Earth’s temperature so terrifying is that the increase  in heat radically shifts the planet’s hydrological cycle . We are a watery planet. The Earth’s  diverse ecosystems have evolved over geological time in direct relationship to precipitation  patterns. Each rise in te mperature of 1°C results in a 7% increase in the moisture -holding  capacity of the atmosphere. This causes a radical change in the way water is distributed, with  more intense precipitation but a reduction in duration and frequency. The consequences are                                                           1 See: http://www.oxfam.org.uk/media -centre/press -releases/2016/01/62 -people -own -same -as-half-world -says oxfam -inequality -report -davos -world -economic -forum   2 See: http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/briefs/hansen_13/

We are experiencing more bitter winter  snows, more dramatic spring storms and floods, more prolonged summer droughts, more  wildfires, more intense hurricanes (category 3, 4, and 5), a melting of the ice caps on the great  mountain ranges, and  a rise in sea levels.3  The Earth’s ecosystems cannot readjust to a disruptive change in the planet’s water cycle in  such a brief moment in time and are under increasing stress, with some on the verge of  collapse. The destabilization of ecosystem dynamics around the world has now pushed the  biosphere into the sixth extinction event of the past 450 million years of life on Earth. In each of  the five previous extinctions, Earth’s climate reached a critical tipping point, throwing the  ecosystems into a positiv e feedback loop, leading to a quick wipe -out of the planet’s  biodiversity. On average, it took upward of 10 million years to recover the lost biodiversity.  Biologists tell us that we could see the extinction of half the Earth’s species by the end of the  current century, resulting in a barren new era that could last for millions of years.   Now, however, a  new economic paradigm is emerging that is going to radically  change the way  we organize economic life on the planet  and dramatically reduce global warming e missions to  address climate change. The European Union is embarking on a bold new course to create a  high -tech 21st Century smart green digital economy, making Europe potentially the most  productive commercial space in the world and the most ecologically s ustainable society on  Earth. The plan is called Smart  Europe. The EU vision of a green digital economy is the  cornerstone of the emerging Third Industrial Revolution.   To grasp the enormity of the economic change taking place, we need to understand the  technological forces that have given rise to new economic systems throughout history. Every  great economic paradigm requires three elements, each of which interacts with t he other to  enable the system to operate as a whole: new communication technologies to more efficiently  manage economic activity; new sources of energy to more efficiently power economic activity;  and new modes of transportation to more efficiently move ec onomic activity.   In the 19th Century, steam -powered printing and the telegraph, abundant coal, and  locomotives on national rail systems gave rise to the First Industrial Revolution. In the 20th  Century, centralized electricity, the telephone, radio and te levision, cheap oil, and internal  combustion vehicles on national road systems converged to create an infrastructure for the  Second Industrial Revolution.   Today, the European Union is laying the groundwork for the Third Industrial Revolution. The  plan call s for a digitally connected smart Europe. The Third Industrial Revolution involves much                                                           3 Kevin E.

The digital  economy will revolutionize every commercial sector, disrupt the workings of vir tually every  industry, bring with it unprecedented new economic opportunities, put millions of people back  to work, democratize economic life, and create a more sustainable low -carbon society to  mitigate climate change. Equally important, the new economic narrative is being accompanied  by a new biosphere consciousness, as the human race begins to perceive the Earth as its  indivisible community. We are each beginning to take on our responsibilities as stewards of the  planetary ecosystems which sustain all of  life.    The digitalized Communication Internet is converging with a digitalized Renewable Energy  Internet, and a digitalized automated Transportation and Logistics Internet, to create a super Internet  to manage, power, and move economic activity. This sup er Internet rides atop an  infrastructure called the Internet of Things (IoT) . In the Internet of Things era, sensors and  actuators will be embedded into every device and appliance, allowing them to communicate  with each other and Internet users, providing up to the moment data on the managing,  powering, and moving of economic activity in a smart Digital Europe. By 2030, it is estimated  there will be more than 100 trillion sensors connecting the human and natural environment in a  global distributed intellige nt network. For the first time in history, the entire human race can  collaborate directly with one another, democratizing economic life.   The digitalization of communication, energy, and transportation also raises risks and challenges,  not the least of whi ch are guaranteeing network neutrality, preventing the creation of new  corporate monopolies, protecting personal privacy, ensuring data security, and thwarting  cyber -crime and cyber -terrorism. The European Commission has already begun to address  these issu es by establishing the broad principle that “privacy, data protection, and information  security are complimentary requirements for Internet of Things services .” These challenges will  be addressed in the development and implementation of the TIR Strategy Study.   In this expanded digital economy, private enterprises connected to the Internet of Things will  use Big Data and analytics to develop algorithms that speed aggregate efficiency, increase  productivity, dramatically  reduce ecological footprint, and  lower  the marginal cost of producing  and distributing goods and services, making Luxembourg businesses more competitive in an  emerging post -carbon global marketplace (marginal cost is the cost of producing an additional  unit of a good or service, after fixed co sts have been absorbed). The marginal cost of some  goods and services in a Digital Europe will even approach zero, allowing millions of prosumers ,  connected to the Internet of Things, to produce and exchange things with one another, for  nearly free, in the growing Sharing Economy.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               10    AGGREGATE EFFICIENCIES AND PRODUCTIVITY   The transformation to an Internet of Thing infrastructure and a Third Industr ial Revolution  paradigm is forcing a wholesale rethinking of economic theory and practice. The unleashing of  extreme productivity wrought by the digitalization of communication, energy, and  transportation is leading to a reassessment of the very nature of productivity and a new  understanding of ecological sustainability. Conventional economists fail to recognize that the  laws of thermodynamics govern all economic activity. The first and second laws of  thermodynamics state that “the total energy content of t he universe is constant and the total  entropy is continually increasing.” The first law, the conservation law, posits that energy can  neither be created nor destroyed —that the amount of energy in the universe has remained the  same since the beginning of ti me and will be until the end of time. While the energy remains  fixed, it is continually changing form, but only in one direction, from available to unavailable.  This is where the second law of thermodynamics comes into play. According to the second law,  energy always flows from hot to cold, concentrated to dispersed, and ordered to disordered.  For example, if a chunk of coal is burned, the sum total of the energy remains constant, but is  dispersed into the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide, sulphur d ioxide, and other gases.  While no energy is lost, the dispersed energy is no longer capable of performing useful work.  Physicists refer to the no -longer -useable energy as entropy.   All economic activity comes from harnessing available energy in nature —in m aterial, liquid, or  gaseous form —and converting it into goods and services. At every step in the extraction,  production, storage, and distribution process, energy is used to transform nature’s resources  into finished goods and services. Whatever energy is embedded in the product or service is at  the expense of energy used and lost —the entropic bill —in moving the economic activity along  the value chain. Eventually, the goods we produce are consumed, discarded, and recycled back  into nature, again, with an in crease in entropy. Engineers and chemists point out that in regard  to economic activity there is never a net energy gain but always a loss in available energy in the  process of converting nature’s resources into economic value. The only question is: when d oes  the bill come due?   The entropic bill for the First and Second Industrial Revolutions has arrived. The accumulation  in carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere from burning massive amounts of carbon energy  has given rise to climate change , the wholesa le destruction of the Earth’s biosphere, and the  sixth extinction event in the history of our planet, throwing the existing economic model into  question. The field of economics, by and large, has yet to confront the fact that economic  activity is condition ed by the laws of thermodynamics.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               11    Until very recently, economists were content to measure productivity by two factors: more  capital invested in better performing machines and improved labor performance. But when  Robert Solow —who won the Nobel Prize in econ omics in 1987 for his growth theory —tracked  the Industrial Age, he found that machine capital and labor performance only accounted for  approximately 12.5 percent of all of the economic growth, raising the question of what was  responsible for the other 87.5  percent. This mystery led economist Moses Abramovitz, former  president of the American Economic Association, to admit what other economists were afraid  to acknowledge —that the other 87 .5 percent is a “measure of our ignorance.”4  Over the past 25 years, a number of analysts, including physicist Reiner Kümmel of the  University of Würzburg, Germany, and economist Robert Ayres at INSEAD business school in  Fontainebleau, France, have gone back and retraced the economic growth of the industrial  period using a th ree-factor analysis of machine capital, labor performance, and thermodynamic  efficiency of energy use. They found that it is “the increasing thermodynamic efficiency with  which energy and raw materials are converted into useful work” that accounts for most  of the  rest of the gains in productivity and growth in industrial economies. In other words, “energy” is  the missing factor.   A deeper look into the First and Second Industrial Revolutions reveals that the leaps in  productivity and growth were made possibl e by the communication/energy/transportation  matrix and accompanying infrastructure that comprised the general -purpose technology  platform that firms connected to. For example, Henry Ford could not have enjoyed the  dramatic advances in efficiency and produ ctivity brought on by electrical power tools on the  factory floor without an electricity grid. Nor could businesses reap the efficiencies and  productivity gains of large, vertically integrated operations without the telegraph and, later, the  telephone prov iding them with instant communication, both upstream to suppliers and  downstream to distributors, as well as instant access to chains of command in their internal and  external operations. Nor could businesses significantly reduce their logistics costs with out a  fully built -out road system across national markets. Likewise, the electricity grid,  telecommunications networks, and cars and trucks running on a national road system were all  powered by fossil fuel energy, which required a vertically integrated ene rgy infrastructure to  move the resource from the wellhead to the end users.   The general -purpose technology infrastructure of the Second Industrial Revolution provided the  productive potential for a dramatic increase in growth in the 20th Century . Between 1 900 and  1929, the United States built out an incipient Second Industrial Revolution infrastructure —the  electricity grid, telecommunications network, road system, oil and gas pipelines, water and                                                           4 See: http://www.nber.org/chapters/c5650.pdf  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               12    sewer systems, and public school systems. The Depression and World War II slowed the effort,  but after the war the laying down of the interstate highway system and the completion of a  nationwide electricity grid and telecommunications network provided a mature, fully integrated  infrastructure. The Second Industrial Revolution infrastructure advanced productivity across  every industry, from automobile production to suburban commercial and residential building  developments along the interstate highway exits.   During the period from 1900 to 1980 in the United States, agg regate energy efficiency —the  ratio of potential to useful physical work that can be extracted from materials —steadily rose  along with the development of the nation’s infrastructure, from 2.48 percent to 12.3 percent.  The aggregate energy efficiency leveled  off in the 1990s at around 14 percent with the  completion of the Second Industrial Revolution infrastructure.5 Despite a significant increase in  efficiency, which gave the United States extraordinary productivity and growth, nearly 86  percent of the energ y we used in the Second Industrial Revolution was wasted during  transmission.   Even if we were to upgrade the Second Industrial Revolution infrastructure, there will be only a  limited effect on aggregate efficiency, productivity, and growth. Fossil fuel ene rgies have  matured. And the technologies designed and engineered to run on these energies, like the  internal -combustion engine and the centralized electricity grid, have exhausted their  productivity, with little potential left to exploit.   Needless to say, 100 percent thermodynamic efficiency is impossible. New studies, however,  including one conducted by our global consulting group, show that with the shift to a Third  Industrial Revolution infrastructure, it is conceivable to increase aggregate energy effic iency to  60 percent or more over the next 40 years, amounting to a dramatic increase in productivity  beyond what the economy experienced in the 20th Century .  A 2015 McKinsey report suggests that the build out and scale up of an Internet of Things  infrastru cture will have a 'value potential' of between $3.9 trillion to $11.1 trillion per year by  2025.6 A General Electric study published in November 2012 concludes that the efficiency gains  and productivity advances induced by a smart industrial Internet could  resound across virtually  every economic sector by 2025, impacting “approximately one half of the global economy.”7 A                                                           5 John A. “Skip” Laitner, Steven Nadel, R.

The  report goes on to say that the increase in productivity alone could exceed € 430 billion in the  EU. However, AT Kearney is quick to add that the increased capabilities brought on  by the  digitalization of the infrastructure will "increase exponentially when connected objects are  coordinated."8  The build out and scale up of the Third Industrial Revolution Internet of Things platform will  enable businesses in Luxembourg to dramatically increase aggregate effi ciencies across their  value chains, increase productivity, and reduce marginal costs and ecological footprint, making  the nation a leader in the shi ft to the new economic paradigm and an ecological society.                                                                    8 See:  https://www.atkearney.com/documents/10192/7125406/The+Internet+of+Things A+New+Path+to+European+Prosperity.pdf/e5ad6a65 -84e5 -4c92 -b468 -200fa4e0b7bc   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               14    ENERGY   OVERVIEW   The bulk  of the energy we use to heat and cool our  homes and run our appliances, power our  businesses, drive our vehicles, and operate every  part of the global economy will soon be generated  at near zero marginal cost and be nearly free in the  coming decades. That  is already the case for several  million early adopters in the EU who have  transformed their homes and businesses into micro power plants to harvest renewable energy on -site.  In Sweden, already over 50 % of the gross final  energy consumption was generated from renewable sources in 2013.9 Looking at electricity  only, Austria and Sweden are leading the pack with close to 70% of their gross electricity  production being generated from renewable sources, predominantly hydro power. Hydro  power is the still larges t source of renewable energy (370TWh as of 2013) but its share is  declining due to the strong increase in generated solar (85 TWh in 2013, projected to increase  to 12110-46211 TWh in 2020) and on - and offshore wind (234TWh in 2013, projected to increase  to 442-487 TWh in 202012).  Currently, 32%  of the electricity powering Germany comes from solar, wind and other  renewable energies, accounting for approximately 15% of the total final energy consumption.  By 2030, a minimum of 50%  of the electricity powering Germ any will be generated by  renewable energies.13   In contrast, smaller, more densely populated countries like Belgium and the Netherlands are  generating less than 10% of their total final energy use from renewable sources. Luxemburg's  projected strong populat ion growth and the fact that it is landlocked intensifies the challenge to  meet EU 2020 and COP21 targets.                                                            9 The State of Renewable Energies in Europe, Edition 2014, 14th EurObserv’ÉR Report   10 Renewable energy progr ess report, European Commission   11 Set for 2020.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               15    In 2013, 74% of the energy produced in Luxembourg was generated by renewable energy  sources (RES). However, since 97% of the energy consumed is impor ted, the share of RES on  gross inland energy consumption is only 3.6% . Since petroleum, which accounts for 65% of total  final consumption, is heavily consumed by transit traffic and cross -border commuters, the  statistics show a more realistic picture witho ut the transport sector. The share of RES on final  energy consumption for electricity, heat and fuel for national transport ( this does not include   fuel tourism and fuel for cross -border commuters ), is about 6.1%.  The share of RES without  renewables consumed in the transport sector (biofuels) amounts to 5.6% (excluding national  transport) and to 6.1% (including national transport).14  In 2013 the final energy consumption without transport amounts to 19.2 TWh per year,  composed of 6.8 TWh electricity and  12.4 TWh heat and cold, assumed that the conversion of  gas and other energy carriers into heat is on the average 80%. With a “technical RES potential”  of 14.4 TWh electricity and 20.7 TWh heat generated in the country, Luxembourg is  theoretically able to generate about 250%  of today’s electricity and heat demand by its own  RES. Photovoltaic has the highest potential with 7.9 TWh, followed by wind power with 5.7  TWh, Biogas and bio liquids in CHP plants with 0.6 TWh , and small hydro power with 0.1 TWh  per y ear. In heat generation, solar thermal demonstrates the highest potential  with 14.6 TWh ,  followed by solid biomass with 4.0 TWh, heat pumps with 1.5 TWh , and biogas and bio liquids  in CHP plants with 0.6 TWh per year.15 16 Taking into account that the techni cal RES potential  within the country is significantly higher th an the expected energy demand in 2050, 100% of  the energy  demand could be generated by RES in the country .  The quickening pace of renewable energy deployment is due, in large part, to the plunging cost  of solar and wind energy harvesting technologies. The reduction in fixed costs of solar and wind  technologies have been on exponential curves for more than 20 years. In 1977, the cost of  generating a single watt of solar electricity was 76 do llars, and by 2017 the cost is projected to  be 55 cents/Watt.17 After the fixed costs for the installation of solar and wind are paid back — often as little as five to eight  years —the marginal cost of the harvested energy is nearly free.  Unlike fossil fuels a nd uranium for nuclear power, in which the commodity itself always costs  something, the sun and the wind are free. In some regions of Europe and America, solar and  wind energy is already as cheap, or cheaper, than fossil fuel or nuclear generated energy.                                                            14 All data in the paragraph calculated by Fraunhofer ISE  using data from: EU Commission, DG ENER, Unit A4:  Energy Statistics, Energy datasheets: EU -28 countries, Luxemb ourg (values of 2013).    15 Ibid.   16 Aktualisierung der Potenzialanalyse für Erneuerbare Energien, Fraunhofer ISI, IREES, 2015   17 See: http://www.nwclimate.org/news/solar -panel -efficiency -from -solarcity/  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               16    The impact on society of near zero marginal cost solar and wind energy is all the more  pronounced when we consider the enormous potential of these energy sources. If we could  grab hold of one -tenth of one percent of the sun’s energy that reaches Earth, it would give us  six times the energy we now use across the global economy. Like solar radiation, wind is  ubiquitous and blows everywhere in the world —although its strength and frequency varies. A  Stanford University study on global wind capacity concluded th at if 20 percent of the world’s  available wind was harvested, it would generate seven times more electricity than we currently  use to run the entire global economy.18   The Energy Internet is comprised of five foundational pillars, all of which have to be ph ased -in  simultaneously in Luxembourg for the system to operate efficiently. First, buildings and other  infrastructure will need to be refurbished and retrofitted to make them more energy efficient  so that a high share of electricity, heat, and cold generat ed by renewable energy technologies  can be installed . The renewable energy generated can be used in the building or delivered back  to the electricity or heating grid. Reducing the energy needs of buildings allows traditional oil  and gas based heating syste ms to be replaced by newer technologies like heat pumps. This will  allow the share of renewables for space heating and cooling to increase massively. New  buildings will need to meet the strictest standards for energy efficiency, by designing them as  net po sitive energy buildings. The need for newly constructed residential buildings in  Luxembourg, resulting from its projected substantial population growth, provides a great  opportunity to transition into positive power building stock.   Second, ambitious targe ts must be set to replace fossil fuels and imported nuclear power with  renewable energy sources. This includes a marked  increase of energy efficiency in electricity  and heat generation, e.g. by using combined heat and power technologies (conventional plants  run by biogas or methane, and fuel cells run by hydrogen).  To achieve this goal, Luxembourg  has introduced a feed -in tariff to encourage early adopters to transform buildings and property  sites into micro -power generation facilities. The feed -in tariffs guarantee a premium price  above market value for renewable energies generated locally and sent back to the electricity  grid. Past experience in several other EU countries suggests that the introduction of feed in  tariffs can dramatically reduce the fixed and marginal cost of harvesting renewable energy and  be phased out over time as the new green energies approach parity w ith conventional fossil  fuels and nuclear power. Ultimately a legal and regulatory framework for the energy system will  need to emerge where subsidies and hidden costs for fossil fuels and nuclear power that are  currently embedded in the system are made ex plicit, thus creating a level playing field.                                                            18 Cristina L. Archer and Mark Z. Jacobson, “Evaluation of Global Wind Power,” Journal of Geophysical Research ,  Vol. 110.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               17    Third, storage technologies including batteries, hydrogen tanks (in combination with fuel cells),  pumped hydro storage, large thermal stores, etc., will need to be embedded at local generation  sites and across the energy system to manage both the daily and seasonal intermittency of  green electricity, heat and cold and the reduction of peak loads.   Fourth, advanced metering infrastructures and other digital technologies like energy  management systems will need to  be installed in every building, transforming the energy grid  into a fully digitized bidirectional system in order to manage multiple sources of energy flowing  to the grid from local generators (smart grid implementation). This will enable passive  consumer s of energy in Luxembourg to become active prosumers of their own green energy,  which they can then use off -grid to manage their facilities, store , or sell back to the Energy  Internet. Luxembourg's smart grid efforts have been primarily focused on the tech nical aspects  of the smart grid. A more complete smart energy system is needed that includes connected,  distributed markets for trading energy at both a local and national scale. Such a system will  need to provide a positive business case for all stakehold ers and enable end -user propositions  that resonate well with Luxembourg’s residents and businesses.   Fifth, industrial, commercial, and residential spaces will need to be equipped with charging  stations to allow electric vehicles to secure power from the En ergy Internet, as well as to sell  power back to the electricity grid. Electric vehicles connected to the Energy Internet also  provide a massive storage system that help reduce the load on the grid during peak demand by  providing local power and storing (lo cal) power at times of excess renewable energy  generation . New business models for the energy value chain are needed that allow vehicle  owners to be appropriately compensated for the storage and generation services they provide.   The phase -in and the integr ation of the above pillars transform the entire energy infrastructure  and, especially the electricity grid of Luxembourg, from a centralized to a distributed energy  system, and from fossil fuel and nuclear generation to renewable energy. In the new system,   every business, neighborhood, and homeowner becomes the producer of electricity, sharing  their surplus with others on a smart Energy Internet that is beginning to stretch across national  and continental landmasses.   This massive shift has started to appea r in Germany with the establishment of energy  cooperatives. Most of these cooperatives were successful in securing low interest loans from  banks to install solar, wind, and other renewable energies on -site. The banks were more than  happy to provide the loa ns, assured that the funds will be paid back by the premium price the  cooperatives will receive —via feed -in-tariffs —from selling the new green electricity back to the  grid.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               18    The rise of local energy cooperatives has forced electricity companies to rethink their business  practices. A decade ago, four giant vertically integrated electricity generating companies — E.ON, RWE, EnBW, and Vattenfall —were producing much of the electricity powering Germany.  Today, they are losing market share, since fossil fuel and nu clear generated electricity has been  reduced to 68  percent . At the same time, the big four power companies are producing less than  7 percent of the new green electricity that’s taking Germany into a Third Industrial Revolution.  Peter Terium, CEO of RWE, th e German -based energy company, acknowledges the massive shift  taking place in Germany from centralized to distributed power, and says that the bigger power  and utility companies “have to adjust to the fact that, in the longer term, earning capacity in  conv entional electricity generation will be markedly below what we’ve seen in recent years.”19  Companies like E.ON and RWE are spinning off their fossil -based activities into separate  businesses in anticipation of the changing role of traditional power plants i n the energy system.   In the future, in the fully liberalized European energy market, traditional energy suppliers will  increasingly generate income by erecting and operating the Energy Internet and managing their  customers’ energy use by taking on addition al roles as both Energy Service Company Providers  (ESCO) and aggregators of energy services. Suppliers and grid operators alike will mine Big Data  across each of their clients’ value chains and use analytics to increase their aggregate energy  efficiency an d productivity, and reduce their marginal cost. Their clients, in turn, will share the  efficiency and productivity gains back with the utilities in what are called “Performance  Contracts.” In short, energy companies will profit more from managing energy us e more  efficiently, and selling less rather than more electricity.   Luxembourg Vision “Energy System 2050”   The participants of the Luxembourg Energy Working G roup have set forth a bold vision of a  smarter energy future in Luxembourg described in eight transformational initiatives:   1. Significant reduction of energy consumption through increased energy efficiency.   2. The energy production in 2050 will be based almost exclusively on renewables.   3. Energy production and consumption will increasingly be distribute d.   4. Local and/or regional energy clusters will become increasingly more important.   5. Centralized production and distribution of energy (in particular electricity) will remain  at least a back -up component of the energy system.   6. Innovative ICT solutions will be the basis of a flexible demand side management and  thus contribute to an increased flexibility of the energy market(s).   7. The mobility sector will essentially rely on electricity.   8. As a prosumer, the client will play a crucial role in the future energy s ystem.                                                            19 See: http://www.reuters.com/article/us -utilities -threat -idUSBRE92709E20130308  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               19    In order to realize this vision, the chairs of the Energy  Working Group , with the assistance of  myenergy , describe a “Target Energy System 2050” vision for Luxembourg :  Schematic representation of the energy system 2050     The Target “Energy System 2050” is Composed of Five Critical Keystones:   Sources of Energy for the Target System 2050    The energy future of Luxembourg will mainly be based on renewable energy sources  and the mix should be free of nuclear and coal. In particular, solar, wind, biomass,   and geothermal energy will play an important role. A small share of fossil fuel energy  sources (like crude oil and natural gas) could still be part of the energy system in  2050 for back -up and transition reasons – and because the country will most likely  still need to import a certain percentage of its ene rgy.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               20    Autonomous Regional Energy Clusters    The energy system 2050 will be predominantly organized by autonomous regional  energy clusters. Within the clusters, smart local microgrids allow the exchange of  data and energy among the different prosumers, aiming at an efficient intra -cluster  demand side management. Small decentralized production units based on  renewable energy sources provide electricity to the prosumer. Electricity links to  other regional clust ers are needed in case the local balancing cannot accommodate  the ‘domestic’ energy demand/supply. If available and economically sound, heat  and/or cold exchange within a cluster (for instance based on waste heat from  industry) can contribute to the divers ification of the cluster portfolio. Thus, local  heat and existing gas grids could remain , at least in part , to provide energy for  existing buildings. Finally, the concept of autonomous clusters can also be  understood independently from geographical proximi ty via the creation of Internet based ‘virtual’ clusters.   ICT Infrastructure Crucial at all Levels of the “Target Energy System 2050”    ICT infrastructure represents the backbone of the future energy system. Centralized,  distributed, and decentralized data storage centers as well as data grid and metering  infrastructure are the basis of intra - and inter -exchange of energy and data by the  autonomous clusters.   Interconnection of the Regional Energy Clusters    Transport and balancing electricity grids connect reg ional clusters with the industrial  sector, large production units, energy storage facilities as well as other regional  clusters.   Reliance on Imports    The “Target Energy System 2050” implies a further reliance on energy import. In  particular , gas and its inf rastructure will remain an element of the energy system of  the future: a) on a general level for the industrial sector (and maybe the distance  transport sector) and b) possibly as energy storage (by converting surplus electricity  produced from renewable en ergy sources into gas).   Finally, in order to quantify the transformation path towards the envisioned energy system  2050, the Working G roup agreed on the following objectives for 2025, 2040 and 2050:    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               21      The working group agreed on the following interpretati on of the enumerated objectives:    Luxembourg should leverage  the total energy efficiency potential that can be  achieved through the renovation of the building stock.    Luxembourg should optimize the generation of  economically feasible renewable  energy production potential in the country. This should cover a majority of its energy  demand.    Energy imports will continue to be necessary, but will decrease depending on the  share of nationally produced renewable energy.    The imported energy mix should also be predominantly renewable so that overall  (locally produced + imported) energy consumption reaches at least 80% renewables.   Roadmap 2050 :  Based on the “Target Energy System 2050,” 24 key areas were chosen as the critic al priorities  for advancing the long term agenda:   1. “Promotion of RE through the adaptation of the legal framework and the establishment  of simplified procedures”   2. “Promotion of RE, self -consumption and e -mobility through the adaptation of the  funding progra ms and/or taxation schemes”

This report provides expert insights on the transition path toward a future energy  system for Luxembourg. It incorporates the findings from the ini tial Luxembourg Energy  Working Group (WG) workshops held between February and April 2016, as well as more recent  results from the Executive Seminar held in Luxembourg on May 25 -26, 2016 and a follow -up  meeting held in Luxembourg on July 5, 2016.   Presented first is our view of the changing energy landscape affecting Luxembourg, Europe, and  the rest of the world. In this section, we describe drivers such as the COP21 Paris Agreement  and the various European Union energy targets and directives, as well as glob al trends in energy  sector transformation and technology deployment. Next, we assess Luxembourg’s 2050 Vision  for Energy in the context of the current state of the country’s energy demand, supply,  networks, and markets. We then present our priority recomme ndations for enabling the energy  transition in Luxembourg, building on several of the initial 10 measures proposed by the Energy  Working Group . These recommendations are organized along the following three themes:  market design and regulatory framework, ne w business models and financial schemes, and  experimental distribution grid clusters. We end by summarizing our specific proposals for the  TIR roadmap for Energy and Luxembourg’s 2050 Vision for Energy.     A Changing Energy Landscape: Europe Energy Outlook 2050   Luxembourg is firmly embedded in Europe and its  institutions. An analysis of Luxembourg’s energy  future can therefore not be made without  understanding the key drivers changing Europe’s  energy landscape.   COP2121  The COP21 Paris Agreement is probably the most  important  international agreement influencing how we perceive, produce, and consume                                                           20 These experts include DNV GL, Fraunhofer, and Navigan t.   21 Paris Agreement, FCCC/CP/2015/L.9/Rev.1 (PDF).

Important provisions includ e:    Holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2° C above pre industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5° C above  pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the ri sks and  impacts of climate change    Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster  climate resilience and low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions development, in a manner  that does not threaten food production   The agreement wi ll become legally binding once 55 parties that produce over 55% of the  world's GHG emissions have ratified it. Within the Intended Nationally Determined  Contributions (INDCs), individual countries will specify how they will contribute to the global  goals.22  European Union Targets   The EU has three main sets of targets with respect to increasing the share of renewable energy,  increasing energy efficiency, and reducing GHG emissions among its Member States:   1. Renewable energy:  Achieve at least 20% of total energy needs by renewable energy by  2020 and ensure at least 10% of transportation fuels come from renewable sources by  202023  2. Energy efficiency:  Achieve 20% energy savings compared to projected 2020 energy  use24  3. GHG emissions reductions:  Achieve reductions in GHG emissions by 80% -95% by 205025   Europe’s Energy Roadmap 2050 explores pathways for the transition to a new energy system  that meets these GHG emissions goals while simultaneously promoting competitiveness and  security o f supply.26 In its analysis, the EU concludes that decarbonization is technically and  economically feasible. A European approach is expected to result in lower energy costs and  more secure energy supplies, compared to individual national schemes.                                                            22 Luxembourg’s NDC is, understandably, not available yet, but will hopefully be inspired by the outcome of the TIR  project.   23 See http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/strategies/2020/index_en.htm  and links therein.   24 See https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy -efficiency  and links therein   25 See http://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:52011DC0885&from =EN    26 See https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/2012_energy_roadmap_2050_en_0.pdf  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               25    Single En ergy Market27  The European Commission is strongly focusing on the harmonization of energy markets in the  EU, leading to a single internal market for energy. The free movement of goods, services,  capital, and labor is a founding princip le of the EU. To accom plish this princip le for electricity, a  single electricity market is imperative. A single electricity market is also fundamental for Europe  to meet its low carbon targets and achieve economic optimization at a European scale.   With a single internal market , energy can be produced where it is cheapest and delivered to  where it is needed. A more nationalistic approach, where countries individually manage their  security of supply, is an economically inferior alternative that is not in line with European  solida rity principles.   Energy Sector Transformation   The energy sector is transforming on a global scale, as well as within Europe. It is changing from  a centralized, one -way, hub -and-spoke grid —based on large centralized generation assets like  fossil fuels, hydr o, or nuclear power plants —towards a more distributed grid, with an increased  role for renewables and distributed energy resources (DER), as well as more sophisticated  operating characteristics and controls. In the future, the power grid will be far more d ynamic,  responsive, and democratized than current infrastructure allows.   Figure 1: The Energy Cloud Landscape28     In this e merging Energy Cloud landscape – a concept th at borrows from cloud computing –   tremendous change is occurring within a range of technical, commercial, environmental, social,                                                           27 See https://ec.europa.eu/priorities/energy -union -and-climate/fully -integrated -internal -energy -market_en  and  links therein.   28 See https://www.navigantresearch.com/research/the -energy -cloud    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               26    economic, and regulatory platforms. As with the IT cloud, a dynamic platform is emerging to  enhance the efficient allocation of DER —including distributed genera tion (DG), energy storage  systems, energy efficiency, demand response (DR), plug -in electric vehicle (EV) charging, and  microgrids —across a broad customer base.   The energy sector is adapting to this evolving landscape through business model transformation  and a general rethinking of traditional stakeholder engagement strategies. In addition, energy  consumers and vendors alike are experiencing unprecedented opportunity to enhance  and, in  some cases, replace  the status quo.   Six key trends underpin the energy  sector’s evolution to the Energy Cloud:    Greater customer engagement and demand for more sustainable energy options    Increasing number of policies and regulations aimed at reducing carbon emissions    Shareholders seeking value through new ventures and merger s and acquisitions    The regionalization of energy import and export of oil and natural gas, growing  regionalization of power markets, and increasing  interconnection over land and sea    Mega industries emerging around growth opportunities such as smart cities,   transportation, and building and home energy management    Old infrastructure being replaced and geared toward an increasingly distributed and  smarter power grid architecture   This architecture will enable a two -way power flow such that distinctions between distribution  and transmission grids will blur. The acceleration in the sophistication and pervasiveness of  remote monitoring and automation equipment, combined with robust da ta analytics, is already  allowing more granular and real -time control over generation and consumption, even at the  edges of the grid. This mix of hardware and software enables greater precision with respect to  matching localized supply and demand with high er levels of frequency, all of which is required  for cost -optimal functioning of the Energy Cloud architecture, as well as for capturing the  resource efficiencies anticipated from the Third Industrial Revolution  by 2050.   Global Technology Trends29  Technolog y innovations are largely driven by policy and regulation, climate change, sustainable  use of resources, and the digitization of the energy system. Table 1 summarizes two global  impact scenarios resulting from contrasting policy and regulatory approaches. Given the focus  on COP21 and regional and country -specific environmental policy and regulatory mandates,                                                           29 See http://to2025.dnvgl.com/energy/   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               27    these scenarios are more likely to result in significant shifts in how we produce, distribute, and  consume electric energy.   Table 1: Energy Sector in 2025   State of Global Energy Sector in 202 5 WEAK PUSH FROM  POLICY AND REGULATIONS   Transformation of the energy sector relies primarily on market -based incentives, allowing countries to tailor mechanisms to  national needs and circumstances.  Demand for all fossil fuels continues  to follow the growth trajectory of  the gross world product.  Demand for  fossil fuels  Coal demand peaks, oil demand  declines, and natural gas demand  shows moderate growth.  STRONG PUSH FROM   POLICY AND REGUL ATIONS   Governments predominantly use regulatory measures to force energy  sector transformations, rather than rely on   incentives.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               28    Specific technological trends that can be identified are:    Wind turbines  are now manufactured in very large numbers and represent a mature  tech nology. Still, significant developments continue. Turbine sizes for the offshore  market are increasing, driven by the high cost of foundations and installation. Turbines  rated up to 8 MW and with diameters greater than 170m are already installed, with  designs reaching 12 MW and 200m.    Further developments in wind turbine technology  include light, flexible blades and  aerodynamic control devices, as well as innovations in transmission systems, new  sensors, and smart control systems.    For solar PV technologies , materials such as graphene have the potential to increase  efficiencies dramatically. Combining the expected market growth and the historical cost  reduction, it is clear that by 2025 solar PV will be the cheapest form of electricity in  many regions of the w orld, driving several changes in the power system.    For power converter technologies , wide bandgap semiconductors are capable of higher  switching frequencies (kHz) and blocking voltages (upward of tens to hundreds of kV),  while providing for lower switching  losses, better thermal conductivities, and the ability  to withstand higher operating temperatures, increasing the reliability and efficiency of  next -generation electric grids.    Microgrids  are localized power grids that operate in synchrony with, or indepen dently  from, the main grid. They are, by definition, a distribution network that incorporates a  variety of possible distributed energy resources that can be optimized and aggregated  into a single system that can balance loads and generation, with or withou t energy  storage, and is capable of islanding whether connected or not connected to a traditional  utility power grid. As such, they offer resilience against weather disasters, and both  physical and cyber disruptions to the main power grid.    Over the next d ecade, we expect a steep decline in battery energy storage  prices and a  correspondingly rapid increase in home energy storage solutions. This development,  which is driven in part by the rapid rise of renewables in the energy mix, will pave the  way for a gr owing number of electricity prosumers.    Technological developments are starting to make demand response management   (DRM) solutions possible that combine the benefits of both approaches, resulting in  much more viable DRM options that create much -needed flexi bility for variable wind  and solar integration. By 2025, DRM will be an indispensable service to prosumers and,  as such, will provide retailers and aggregators with a tool to differentiate their services  in new ways.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               29    Luxembourg 2050 Vision for Energy   Participants of the Luxembourg Energy Working Group  have set forth a bold vision for a smarter  energy future.30 Underlying this vision is a number of contextual drivers that set Luxembourg  apart from the rest of Europe, including:    Population growth.  Luxembourg’ s population is expected to almost double by 2050.31  Ignoring finer demographic points, this translates to a doubling of the number of  households and the number of household dwellings. This will create a need for new and  renovated buildings, which in turn presents an excellent opportunity to create a more  sustainable building stock by ensuring all newly erected buildings meet the Passive  House32 criteria, and all existing building stock is converted to Passive House standards  over time.    Small, open economy.  The success of the Luxembourg economy depends, in l arge part,  on open access to and from other EU countries. This access includes a free flow of  people —i.e., about 45% of Luxembourg's total labor force today consists of cross -border  workers from Belgium, France, and Germany.33 Luxembourg’s economy is also h ighly  reliant on the finance sector, as well as its flourishing information and communications  technology (ICT) sector.    Transportation sector.  A large part of Luxembourg’s final energy consumption goes  towards transportation, specifically the transport of  goods by road, cross -border  workers, and ancillary fuel tourism. In order to become fully sustainable, a deep  decarbonization of the transportation sector is needed.   Energy Demand   In cooperation with Luxembourg’s statistical agency, STATEC, TIR Consultin g Group LLC has  created a scenario for 2050 where overall energy demand is reduced by 44%. At the same time,  however, the team believes a more ambitious target setting is desirable and feasible, and has  worked with STATEC to create the Ambitious Energy Eff iciency Scenario (AEE).    In this scenario, the total energy demand of Luxembourg is reduced from ~25 GWh to ~17  GWh in 2050, a reduction of 33%, while at the same time the population of the country nearly                                                            30 TIR Pillar Energy – Note finale de  restitution”, TIR Luxembourg - Final Outcome Document - WG Energy.pdf   31 Source Eurostat, see  http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table &init=1&language=en&pcode=tps00002&plugin=1  for  details.   32 As of January 1 2017, all new residential construction in Luxembourg will need to meet the Passive House  standard.   33 Luxembourg in Figures, STATEC, 2015

Note that this does not include fuel exportation .  In the AEE scenario, as detailed in Table 2, projected transportation savings comes fro m a  reduced use of cars and a higher capacity utilization of public transportation. As there is nearly  no potential for liquid biofuels, it is assumed that the whole transportation sector will be  electrified (only passenger transport, no trucks are conside red) and that public transport will  have a share of one -third of the electricity demand.

This will aim to create the bulk of its energy supply and ensure that  any remaining demand that is fulfilled thr ough imports, also meets its sustainability criteria.                                                            34 During the drafting of the report, some up dated demographic statistics and projections have been released. The  changes have been relatively small and might explain small differences throughout the report (e.g. population  growth).   35 According to the EU, Luxembourg does not seem to be on a path to meet the EU non -ETS GHG targets for 2020.  To meet the goal for 2050 of a largely sustainable energy system, although technically feasible, requires more  intense actions and interventions than currently foreseen.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               31    An increasing adoption of solar PV and wind power can result in an undesirable situation where  oversupply of sustainable energy at the European level during peak hours results in low, or  even negative, wholesale energy prices. This phenomenon can also result in the switching off of  renewable power generation capacity to reduce commercial losses and restore network  stability. This would significantly affect the business case for investments in these asset s and  means that even the yearly energy balance for renewable energy will become negative again.   A solution to this scenario is through the application of energy storage and conversion  technologies.    Energy Storage:  Using hot water tanks and/or battery syst ems for short -term energy  storage. Such solutions are well -suited to store excess renewable energy for a few hours  and, at best, a few days.    Conversion through power -to-gas: Converting excess power generation into hydrogen  or methane gas. The gas can be st ored in underground storage facilities in large volumes  and for long periods of time, to meet seasonal differences in the energy balance. Figure  2 shows photos of the relevant conversion technology.    Electric  vehicles:  Connecting electric  vehicles to the gr id using a bidirectional charging  pole infrastructure for EVs can form a virtual power plant and replace the need for a  central power plant.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               32    Modeling Supply & Demand   Using the urban energy system modeling tool , KomMod, a cost -optimal structure of the target  energy system in a temporal, highly -resolved simulation was calculated36 in a manner that  covers all energy sectors, including electricity, heating, cooling, and local transport energy,  including their interdependencies.   Figure 3: Energy Demand Components Included for the Energy Supply Optimization     This modeling, which accounts for the energy demand components shown in Figure  3, shows  that given Luxembourg’s technical potential, it is feasible that the country could produce 100%  of its renewable energy domestically. The Energy Working Group set a goal of producing a  majority of its energy – between 50% and 100% - with domesti cally produced renewables. With  this in mind, the TIR Consulting team ran three Ambitious Energy Efficiency (AEE) potential  scenario models with 50%, 70% and 100% of the energy generated domestically by renewable  energies. While the scenario modelling found  that producing 100% of its energy domestically  would be technically feasible, a scenario where only 70% is locally generated and 30% imported  is far more cost -effective, as shown in Figures 4 and 5. However, producing 70% of  Luxembourg’s renewable energy needs domestically by 2050 may be a conservative figure. As                                                           36 Input to the Energy Sub -Report, ‘Results o f Modelling the Energy System of Luxembourg.’ Gerhard Stryi -Hipp,  Fraunhofer ISE, 27 July 2016.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               33    mentioned in other sections of the Third Industrial Revolution Strategy Study, the reduction in  the fixed cost of solar and wind generation has been on an exponential curve for 20 years ( for  examp le, in 1977, the cost of generating a single watt of solar electricity was 76 dollars, and by  2017 the cost is projected to be 55 cents/Watt37). The fixed costs in generating renewable  energy will continue to plunge on an exponential curve while the marginal costs remain near  zero. Moreover, the fixed costs of renewable energy storage technologies are also declining and  will be increasingly cost -effective in managing intermittent solar and wind energy over the  course of the next 35 years. In addition,  as the Third Industrial Revolution Internet of Things  infrastructure continues to evolve and become increasingly interoperational, additional  exponential curves will emerge, dramatically increasing aggregate efficiency and productivity,  while dramatically  reducing ecological footprint and accompanying external costs, making  domestically produced solar and wind even more cost effective and attractive. For all of the  above reasons, it is possible that Luxembourg will find it cost -effective to increase the do mestic  production of renewable  energy beyond the 50% minimum benchmark set out in our energy  modelling scenarios to 70% or more.     Figure 4: Installed Renewable Energy Capacity to Achieve 70% Electricity Self -Generation for  the AEE Demand Scenario                                                                37 See: http://www.nwclimate.org/news/solar -panel -efficiency -from -solarcity/   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               34      Figure 5: Energy Flow Graph of the 70% Electricity Self -Generation Scenario for the AEE  Demand Scenario     The energy grids are not part of this modeling, and the effects of DR have not been taken into  account. KomMod assumes a greenfield situation in 2050, not taking into account existing  assets. It also assumes excess solar energy can be sold on the internati onal market during the  day, and that energy can be bought and imported into Luxembourg during the evenings.  However, this is a questionable assumption, since excess solar energy will be a fact of life for  most European countries in the near future, limitin g the ability to sell excess production and  increasing the economic viability of battery energy storage.   This modeling, therefore, shows that it is possible to transform the energy system of  Luxembourg, which is highly dependent on energy imports today, i nto a sustainable energy  system in 2050, which is mainly supplied by renewable energy sources.   Energy Networks   The level of grid interconnection capacity in Luxembourg is already very high. Nevertheless,   investments in interconnections would further improve the security of the country’s energy  supply , especially when considering the foreseen demographic and economic evolution.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               35    Detailed planning of the required interconnection capacity needed in 2050 will be necessary,  since the energy balance, as well  as the peak load on the interconnectors, will change  significantly as Luxembourg moves toward a more  sustainable energy supply in 2050.   It is also important to consider the gas entry capacity which, due to the limited size of the  country, depends heavily  on individual consumers. Following the closure of the country’s sole  CCGT, the total demand has dramatically decreased. In contrast, the peak load on the power  interconnectors with its neighboring countries will most likely increase.   On a local level, si milar issues arise in the distribution power grid. The maximum installed  capacity of ~12 MW for solar PV and 1.7 MW for heat pumps, plus additional load from plug -in  EVs, will lead to an even higher localized peak load on the distribution grid. If supply a nd  demand is properly matched, a significant amount of the solar PV peak load can be absorbed by  the load of the heat pumps and EVs. This results in a limited increase in the local peak load on  the distribution grid.   It will take detailed dynamic load flo w calculations to estimate the expected peak loads, since  the load will become strongly dependent on the location of the generation source over time,  combined with the ability to locally absorb that power using DR or storage solutions. This is  necessary fo r accurate planning of the needed capacity and to ensure the right level of  investments and the timely extension of grid capacity. Otherwise, load shedding becomes  inevitable, leading to dissatisfied customers and underperformance with respect to  Luxembour g’s sustainability goals.   Energy Markets   Luxembourg will continue to rely on the exchange of energy and flexibility through open  European markets, but will have to significantly increase its share of nationally produced  renewable energy. This also reduces security of (sustainable) supply risks, although this is not a  primary driver for the country.   A market structure should be in place to support the connection of local demand and supply.  The EPEX Spot exchange38 could potentially provide the services to do so, but the current  market structure most likely will not support an open infrastructure that is accessible for energy  traders. EPEX SPOT is currently focused on large volumes of power trading and does not yet  incorporate the locality of the production, no r does it provide access for small players like  energy communities or prosumers.                                                            38 See https://www.epexspot.com/en/   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               36    The current power exchange markets do not yet offer services for flexibility trading, which  becomes essential once the step towards a fully sustainable energy system is made and power  production, to a large extent, is based on renewable power via wind and solar.   Flexibility is the ability of a power system to maintain continuous service in the face of rapid  and large swings in supply or demand.39 Flexibility will become a comm odity in itself that is  essential to match demand to the local supply of power. Specific flexibility products are  necessary, as is the adjustment of market processes so that flexibility trading can be included.   In order to create widespread use of flexibil ity, a new market has to emerge at the national and  European level. Aggregated flexibility will have value and can be sold to the network operator  (to prevent congestion) or to parties that are trying to match energy demand to the supply  from various sourc es, at the lowest possible cost.   Intermediaries (aggregators) will try to maximize the value of their customers’ flexibility by  trading it in the marketplace. This will take place under the condition that the future energy  market is transparent, and provid es a level playing field where every player has an equal role  and opportunity to participate.     Resiliency in the Energy Internet   Maintaining resiliency of critical infrastructure, such as electric power networks,  telecommunications systems, and buildings, becomes paramount when considering the various  vulnerabilities arising from catastrophic climate change related weather events, a s well as the  potential im pacts to human health, safety, security, and social well -being.  While resiliency is  frequently considered in the context of climate change and more frequent severe storm events,  the TIR team focus also includes a view of resilien cy in relation to cyber or physical attacks to  these infrastructure  systems (e xtreme weather events can be considered as conditions that  differ substantially from the norm, and consequently might not have been taken into account  when designing cities, powe r and telecommunications networks, supporting infrastructure, and  new or retrofit ed buildings ).   Buildings and other infrastructure (e.g., bridges, roadways) can be vulnerable to extreme  weather events, due to their design (low resistance to storms) or loc ation (e.g. , in flood -prone  areas). They can be damaged or rendered unfit for use by any changing climatic condition or  extreme weather event , including extreme precipitation and floods, extreme low or high  temperatures, heavy snowfalls , strong  wind s, and wildfires across areas experiencing severe                                                           39 Flexibility Options in Electricity Systems, Ecofys, 2014.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               37    draught and dry conditions.  Consequences of climate change for buildings and infrastructure  will certainly differ from region to region , but there is some certainty that Luxembourg has such  vulnerabilities.   Electr ic power infrastructure , in particular,  can be exposed to a number of extreme weather  events and some vital infrastructure components may be subsequently compromised , causing  highly detrimental impacts to countries such as Luxembourg . Specifically, high -voltage  transmission circuits and associated substations are often identified as critical assets, given long  lead times for obtaining replacement power equipment (e.g., substation transformers can take  up to 18 months to acquire), as well as the large popula tion served by this infrastructure .   Figure 6 shows an overview of the largest global power outages through 2015. Here the year of  occurrence (x-axis), duration (y -axis), and number of people impacted (relative size of the  bubbles) are compared. It can be observed that the most common cause of these blackouts was  “natural phenomena” ( six times), while design and application error, communication s failure,  and operator errors were the second largest contributors. These kinds of power outage s are  usually caused by a combination of technical failures and human errors, where a fault or defect  occurs at a critical moment and is then misinterpreted, aft er which an appropriate, but  incorrect action  is taken.   Figure 6: Major Global Power Outages, 1965 to 201540.                                                           40 Peter Vaessen, ‘De Betrouwbaarheid van Het Toekomstige Elektriciteitsnet Nationale Veiligheid En  Crisisbeheersing’, Nationale Veiligheid En Crisisbeheersing , 2015.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               38    Therefore, in planning the deployment of the Energy Internet in Luxembourg, consideration  should be applied for resiliency mitigation as a foundat ional component of engineering design  principles , emergency response planning, and the formation of new approaches to electricity  production and supply.  Indeed, resiliency is inherently embedded in the  considerations that  are found in the subsequent propo sals, particularly as it relates to increased integration of  Luxembourg’s bulk power systems with neighboring countries, as well as the adoption of  distributed technologies such as microgrids and energy storage, and the application of  experimental distribu ted grid clusters.      PROPOSALS   Enabling the Energy Transition in Luxembourg   The Energy W orking Group  proposed ten measures to further the transition to a TIR -compliant  energy system. As shown in Table 3, the actions developed by the W orking Group  represent a  broad range of measures. The shaded sections highlight our recommended subset of priority  actions (within the next 10 -15 years) in which Luxembourg can, and should, take a leadership  role. These priority actions represent prerequisites for man y of the other actions, some of  which will largely be directed by initiatives and influences occurring outside of Luxembourg’s  control and/or jurisdiction (such as global technology innovations).

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               40    We have organized our discussion of these priority areas in the following sections:    Market Design and Regulatory Framework (action #4)    New Business Models and Financial Schemes (actions #2 and #3)    Experimental Distribution Grid Clusters (action #5)     Market Design and Regulatory Framework   The TIR vision for the Luxembourg energy sector recognizes the importance of distributed and  democratized resources, services, and processes. This concept largely depends on creating and  enhancing networks and reducing regulatory barriers that interfere with innovation.   The energy market landscape has shifted considerably over the past decade. The changing  environment within the electricity market is being influenced by a number of key facto rs: the  changing consumer; evolving technology; entry of new players; and the provision of new  product and service offerings. Customers are reducing energy use and switching to new energy  efficient appliances to avoid the increase in electricity prices. Ho useholds are installing solar  rooftop and community -based PV systems, and energy intensity from Luxembourg’s  commercial and industrial sectors has declined due to recent energy efficiency measures.   To prepare for the future, energy markets and regulations will need to become more agile to  accommodate new players and the changing roles of existing players. The future energy system  will require increased energy visibility to allow for informed choices and assessment of energy  management capabilities (e.g., be nchmarking, feedback systems). The future system will also  require new physical networks and linkages to allow for grid flexibility and emerging concepts,  such as transactive energy .41  Luxembourg will need to strike a reasonable balance of adaptability and reliability within its  energy sector governance and regulatory frameworks. This will be especially important during  the next few decades, as demonstration projects begin to provide the  evidence needed to  inform policy at the scale envisioned for the TIR.   Below we summarize our interrelated, high -priority proposals supporting market design and  regulatory frameworks:    USEF: One common standard to enhance value creation                                                            41 Transactive energ y refers to techniques for managing the generation, consumption, or flow of electric power  within an electric power system, through the use of economic or market -based constructs, while considering grid  reliability constraints. GridWise Architecture Counci l, http://www.gridwiseac.org/about/transactive_energy.aspx . 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               41     Further development  of integrated wholesale European and secondary markets    Enhancing retail competition    Decision support for future energy system design     USEF: One Common Standard to Enhance Value Creation    Innovation is occurring rapidly, yet markets differ and multiple i nitiatives are underway at the  same time in different places. While we accept that this approach may be the fastest way to get  results, without any uniformity, there is a risk that  initiatives will not be compatible or connectable.  Standardization, with sp ecifications for market access  and interoperability, is a prerequisite for the  establishment of an accessible, flexible, and truly  integrated energy market. To achieve this effectively  requires that we work together and think beyond  existing market positio ns, companies, regions, and countries.    The Universal Smart Energy Framework (USEF)42 presents a market structure, shown in Figure 7,  for the trading of flexible energy use and the tools and rules to make it work effectively. By  providing a common standard  on which to build, it ensures that people, projects, and  technologies can be connected for an integrated smart energy future that is energy efficient  and cost -effective. The framework specifies all market roles, how they interact, and how they  can benefit  by doing so.   USEF aligns the trading of consumer flexibility with existing wholesale market models. By  extending standard key processes to include usage prognoses for individual consumers, USEF  fits on top of, and can integrate with, most market models.                                                                42 USEF has been developed to accelerate the smart energy transition and unlock the value of prosumer flexibility  by incentivizing all stakeholders (new and traditional) in the energy system. The USEF Foundation is a partnership  organization comprised of ABB , Alliander, DNV GL, Essent, IBM, ICT and Stedin. For more information, see  http://www.usef.energy .   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               42    Figure 7: Standardized Market Access Is Required for Acceptable Cost to Connect and Cost -toServe     USEF’s open ICT architecture provides the freedom to create unique and commercially  competitive smart energy products and services while delivering a common standard on which  to build them. The smart energy market will see existing roles adapted and new ma rket  functions created. By defining the roles, responsibilities, and interactions required, USEF  enables parties to both understand and realize smart energy opportunities.   By delivering a common standard to build on, USEF reduces the cost to connect diffe rent  technologies and projects to the energy system. Its market -based control mechanism then  defines the rules required to optimize that whole system, ensuring that energy is produced,  delivered, and managed at lowest cost.    USEF offers the market descrip tion with specifications, designs, and implementation guidelines.  With its reference implementation and the knowledge from pilots, USEF further supports future  users with insights, structure, and exemplary coding. With detailed specifications and real -life  pilots, USEF is perhaps the most comprehensive and advanced initiative of its kind.         
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               43    Development of an Integrated Wholesale European Market and Secondary Markets   Over the last two decades, Europe's energy policy has consistently  been geared towards  achieving its main objectives: affordable and  competitively priced, environmentally sustainable, and secure energy  for everybody. A single, well -integrated internal European energy  market is seen as a fundamental prerequisite to achieving these  goals.43  Integration of regional markets is currently in progress. However,  building out of interconnectors and regulatory frameworks to support  harmonized market rules will need to continue to evolve on a  regional and EU -wide level.   Luxembourg is  already fully int egrated into the German electricity price zone. As a result, there  is no domestic electricity wholesale market in Luxembourg. Moving forward, Luxembourg  should consider its position in the evolving European integrated electricity market to ensure the  count ry is well -optimized for the future and is aligned with its Third Industrial Revolution   energy vision .   Larger, interconnected bulk power markets can lead to increased efficiency in planning for new  transmission investment and maximizing capital spending a cross national boundaries. These  markets also create efficiencies in maintaining grid reliability, dispatching the most cost effective power generation (and DR resources) that further directs investment into more  efficient power production technology over time. Indeed, these are the principles espoused by  ENTSO -E.44  Furthermore, a number of new secondary market models are being tested in Europe, including  local flexibility markets and flexibility contracts with aggregators. These models are required to  addre ss a new energy mix, new consumption patterns (e.g., e -mobility), and the movement  towards consumers becoming prosumers.   Major energy companies, such as RWE in Europe, are moving aggressively in this emerging  landscape, taking advantage of opportunities t o integrate DER and DR, while remaining flexible  to adapt new, emerging technologies (e.g., solar power combined with battery storage) that  have not yet been commercialized to scale.                                                            43 European Commission. “Progress towards completing the Internal Energy Market”. 2014.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               44    Luxembourg should take a holistic approach to planning a market that is f it-for-purpose. This  would include orienting its market arrangements to support the development of emerging  technologies that enable unique services and capabilities, layered into the system.       Enhanced Retail Competition   In the electricity and gas supply  chains, the retail market includes the provisioning of energy to  end-use customers. The retail energy market provides customers with the ability to purchase  energy services from licensed/accredited retail businesses of their choice. To support this  choice , the retail market provides the systems and processes to track and support the  relationships and flow of information between retailers, distributors, and customers, to ensure  that customer transfers can take place and that costs in the supply chain are co rrectly allocated  and billed.   In Luxembourg, the supply market is fully open to favor competition and to be attractive to  additional suppliers. Nevertheless, the market is dominated by the national champion Enovos   Luxembourg .45 Such a structure can provide advantages as well as risks for competitive and  efficient market development. Enovos’ retail market dominance should be monitored in the  light of transparency, competitive neutrality, and other competition issues. Luxembourg has the  third lowest switching rate in the EU, despite the country being ranked sixth in the EU for ease  of switching. Studies show that one reason for the low level of switching is the high customer  satisfaction. Luxembourg should work on further enhanc ing competition.   Finally, a retail market assessment should be considered simultaneously with the evolution of  wholesale markets. There are strong links and interplays between the wholesale and retail  markets, with the competitiveness of each segment influenced by the respective mark et  arrangements. For example, a competitive retail electricity market is influenced by the nature  of the wholesale arrangements and the ease of entry and operation. This includes the ability to  access generation at a competitive price; the ability to manag e market risk, simplicity, and  clarity of the regulatory framework and market interfaces; the nature of the hub balancing  arrangements; access to timely and accurate data; transparency and symmetry of market  information; or the nature of the wholesale sett lement arrangements. These factors are  similarly relevant in natural gas markets.                                                              45 International Energy Agency (IEA). “Energy Policies of IEA Countries – Luxembourg 2014 Review” 2014.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               45    Decision Support for Future Energy System Design   Transitioning toward a fully TIR -enabled Energy Internet in Luxembourg involves invasive  processes, where many high -impact decisions (with long -term consequences for all  stakeholders) have to be made. As such, we recommend completing a number of intermediary  initiatives to provide strategic guidance and operational support:     Scenario analysis.  There are many conceivable and po tentially viable ways to transition  to a carbon -free energy system in 2050. The exact components of that system depend  on many societal, political, economic, and technological factors and are therefore  extremely difficult to predict. In order for Luxembour g to make the right choices at the  right time, and to be able to identify the no -regret and high -risk options at any point in  time during this transition, further analyses are necessary to identify and assess  a set of  scenarios that contain all conceivable  ingredients of the energy transition. These  analyses can yield the most feasible transition paths and actions to be taken by  Luxembourg, to optimally manage the energy transition.    Stakeholder analysis.  Additional analysis should be conducted to outline th e  implementation of commodity and flexibility markets and supporting regulation, such  that both existing and new players in this market have equal access and fair market  conditions. For the energy transition to be a success, stakeholders of all sizes have to be  able to participate against acceptable costs -to-connect and costs -to-serve. These  requirements mandate a scalable solution, both in scope and number of participants,  which recognizes the different stakeholders and their role in a smart energy system.   Freedom of connection, transaction, and dispatch should be guaranteed, and the  implemented solution should align well with European wholesale markets.    Modeling platform.  A modeling platform is needed to ensure that at any point during  the transition, the best possible decisions can be made, and that these decisions are  powered by the most complete and available data and their effects can be effectively  communicated to all stakeholders. Such a platform should feature components for  detailed, multi -commodity  load flow planning and optimization, grid capacity planning,  and conversion and energy storage options. The platform should allow for analysis of  “what if” scenarios and benefit/cost analyses on both the national and local level.  Integration with open dat a sources should be possible to make use of best available  data. Spatial planning aspects should be incorporated via dashboards and 3D  visualization features. An example of this visualization is shown in Figure 8.

It also inc ludes advanced software and hardware to enable greater control and  interoperability across grid elements. All of these components are operating within an Internet enabled free market, where it is envisioned that technologies and grid systems can be  automat ed to barter over the proper way to solve mutual problems, and settle on the proper  price for their services in near real -time.   Commonly referred to as transactive energy platforms, these systems represent a way of  creating a level playing field for produc er (as well as consumer) investment decisions. In these  types of systems, all parties act autonomously and there is an expectation of transparency;  regulators oversee the system to prevent abuse. Standardized platforms can be local or span  large regions (e .g., neighborhoods, municipalities, countries).   These platforms are being tested —along with the market and regulatory changes previously  discussed —in demonstration settings throughout Europe and other jurisdictions. Through these  projects, new business models and financial schemes are emerging. A summar y of these  emerging models are provided, along with a specific proposal, in the next section, to establish  funding mechanisms for accelerating the sustainable technology  (SusTech) sector in  Luxembourg.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               47    Public and Private Sector Financing Models   One of t he most common options for accelerating investments in DG is the use of Feed -in  Tariffs (FiTs), which typically subsidize the initial cost of installing renewable energy systems at  the consumer level. FiTs have been in operation in Luxembourg for the past decade,46 cover a  wide range of DG and renewable energy technologies, and have recently been expanded to  support the development of community -scale, renewable energy projects.47 A system of  premium FiTs has been shown to be an effective instrument to promote  the generation of  renewable electricity; notably, to ensure a low -level market adoption of wind and solar power  at the national level. In the longer term, however, such a system is hard to sustain due to its  distortive pricing impacts and, ultimately, inc ompatibility with the creation of a single,  liberalized electricity market in Europe. Taking this and the current technology maturity levels  for wind and solar PV into account, FiTs for these types of renewable energy systems are not  likely to be a key par t of Luxembourg’s future smart energy system design.    Additional business models and financial schemes are emerging in Luxembourg to support the  development of energy cooperatives. Following success in other European markets, notably  Germany, Denmark, and Italy,48 energy cooperatives can take several forms. These forms range  from development of small -scale renewable energy assets to serve a part of a community’s  energy needs, to full -scale, municipality -owned and operated generation and distribution  faciliti es. Other initiatives are experimenting with crowdfunding platforms (Citizenergy)49 and  performance contracting and third -party financing models (CITYnvest).50  We note that Luxembourg has a few relevant projects underway, namely Enercoop TM51 and  EquiEnerCoop ,52 which aim to promote, support, and provide advice on establishing  cooperative energy systems. More cooperative models are emerging and should continue to be  encouraged through public/private partnerships.                                                            46 International Energy Agency (IEA). “Energy Policies of IEA Countries – Luxembourg 2014 Review” 2014.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               48    New financing models are also evolving in support of technologies that enable the development  and integration of other forms of DER, such as distributed energy storage and microgrids.    Energy storage.  In order to integrate a large capacity of renewable energy, Luxembourg  should consider increasing its supply of energy storage beyond its existing pumped  storage capacity. Financing structures for energy storage are rapidly evolving, and  Luxembourg should encourage a range of development and ownership models, some of  which are summarized in Table 4.     Table 4: Energy Storage Offers and Ownership Models   Storage Developer : Offers  System Ownership   Shared Savings Model  Third -Party Owner (TPO)   Sale/Lease + Host Control  Host Owned   Utility Procurements  Third -Party Owner (TPO)   Utility -Controlled   Sale/Lease + Utility Tariff Rate  Host Owned   Utility -Controlled    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               49    Figure 9: Hypothetical Deployment of Storage Assets Across a Power System53      Microgrids.  As energy storage is deployed, we recommend evaluating each installation  for the opportunity to create a building - or community -level microgrid. A microgrid is  not a single technology, but rather a system of systems, as illustrated in Figure 9. Since  micr ogrids can be deployed as a shared asset within a group of buildings or in a  community, new financing mechanisms will be required to enable adoption. One option  is that the distribution utility owns and operates microgrids and includes them in their  tariff  structure for cost recovery purposes. Another financing option can occur through  third -party leases. Finally, government agencies could sponsor their development and  operation, which is happening with municipalities in parts of North America, as a  resilie ncy option to mitigate large power outages resulting from extreme weather  events. Another relevant type of microgrid financing option for Luxembourg could be  the community microgrid, as illustrated in Figure 10. These arrangements enable local  community ho meowners and businesses to economically share in the development,  ownership, and operational costs for microgrids. Many of these systems are deployed  throughout Europe due, in part, to a retail competition framework that is more  advanced than other parts o f the world.                                                                    53 International Energy Agency.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               50    Figure 10: Schematic View of a PV/Storage Hybrid System for Community Grid Electrification       Action Plan for SusTech Sector Financing   The development of a SusTech sector —analogous to Luxembourg’s financial technology  (FinTech) sector —would not only aid in the transition from the current fossil -fuel based  economy to an economy powered by sustainable energy. It would also result in job growth for  both vocational and knowledge workers. The energy transition requires ongoing develop ment  in the area of energy conversion and storage technologies, as well as experimentation with new  products and services enabled through advancements in smart grid infrastructure. Enabling a  SusTech sector within Luxembourg will assist in the creation of new economic activity and build  new businesses locally (as opposed to importing). The development of a viable SusTech sector  in Luxembourg can be supported through projects recommended by the Finance WG (e.g., the  use of blockchain technology, the establis hment of a secure data vault for smart contracts).   However, two challenges will need to be addressed if this vision for Luxembourg’s SusTech  sector is to be realized:    Increase R&D expenditures.  R&D intensity in Luxembourg, as measured by R& D  expenditures as a percentage of GDP, has been declining since the turn of the century.22  While public R&D intensity has increased, business R&D intensity has dropped  dramatically, as has the sum of the two. This trend will have to be reversed if a viable   SusTech sector is to be created.    Create a favorable environment for entrepreneurship.  The Finance Working Group  has  identified the need to further encourage development of the entrepreneurial culture in  Luxembourg.22 While initiatives to encourage startups and draft legislation to facilitate  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               51    business creation have been put in place, Luxembourg’s regulatory restrictions should  be reviewed in order to create a more attractive environment.   Fostering a climate toward a m ore entrepreneurial culture in which the SusTech sector can  flourish takes time and effort. If Luxembourg desires to become a leader in sustainable  technology, a dedicated action plan addressing investments, education, and business culture is  strongly reco mmended.   This SusTech action plan can address the type of investment, education, and business culture  that will be needed for Luxembourg to become a leader in sustainable technology. In addition,  lessons learned and best practices from Luxembourg’s FinTec h sector, as well as from current  leaders in sustainable technology and leading entrepreneurial regions, can be incorporated into  the action plan.   The action plan can result in a charter for a public -private partnership that leads to the creation  of a flou rishing, and well -funded, SusTech sector in Luxembourg. Funding options like a  Knowledge and Innovation Community (KIC), co -funded by the European Institute of Innovation  and Technology, can be considered to kick -start SusTech in Luxembourg.     Experimental Distribution Grid Clusters   Across Europe, there has been thousands of practical demonstration projects designed to  experiment with new energy business models, deploy advanced energy infrastructure, and  adapt traditional regulatory frameworks.    For exampl e, blue -sky projects —such as the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 and  Intelligent Energy Europe (IEE) initiatives —are seeking to experiment and test more advanced  energy concepts. These projects are building a critical  R&D mass, the development of which will accelerate the  advancement of the longer -view TIR vision. There have  been more than 2,500 projects implemented as part of  the European Federation or Renewable Cooperatives  (REScoops) initiative.54 In these projects, citizens are  actively engaged not only in renewable electricity production, but also in heat production in  district heating cooperatives. All these REScoops are bringing benefits to their local economies  and are helping the EU to reach its renewable energy and energy efficiency targets. Other                                                           54 European Commission. “RESCOOP European Projects”. May 2016. Available at: https://rescoop.eu/participation rescoops -eu-projects   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               52    projects aim to develop, deploy, and evaluate advanced tools and ICT services for distribution  grid operators, production cooperatives, and medium -sized retailers (Nobel Grid),55 while  others are foc used on experimenting with cooperative models for district heating companies  (Smart Reflex).56   Together, these community renewable and energy efficiency projects are examples of  successful projects that encourage citizens to cooperate in the development of  renewable  energy and energy efficiency initiatives. The results are compelling: European cooperatives  have made cumulative investments of €977 million between 2012 and 2014. Together, they  attracted 109,801 new members and, in 2014, produced around 129,05 0 toe/year of renewable  energy.57  While these initiatives are providing important early learnings from largely small -scale  experiments, they lack the scale necessary to provide sufficient evidence to inform  Luxembourg’s future energy policy at the national level. The following section provides a  recommendation for Luxembourg that can create an experimental grid cluster large enough to  inform decisions at the distribution system operator (DSO) level, and possibly at the EU level.     First Nationwide Smart Grid   The European Climate Change Programme58 aims to provide reliable and affordable energy for  all, to apply the efficiency first principle, and to make the EU the global leader in renewable  energy.59 The EU’s energy and climate objectives for 2030 are expected to increase the share of  renewables to up to 50% of total electricity produced. “Achieving these goals will require a  fundamental transformation of Europe’s energy system, including the redesign of the European  electricity market ”60 by providing greater pre dictability, linking the wholesale and retail  markets, and attracting further investments. This will contribute to delivering a new deal for  Europe’s energy consumers.   To achieve that objective, the European Commission needs to demonstrate this new energy  system in practice. Such a demonstration environment requires a combination of an energy  system with a high degree of renewable energy production, and the simultaneous development                                                           55 See http://nobelgrid.eu/    56 See http://www.smartreflex.eu/en/home/    57 European Commission. “Energy cooperative projects celebrate 10 years of the UN’s International Day of  Cooperatives”.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               53    of a smart energy system that inter connects these energy sources. Although, as outlined above,  many demonstration projects are already developed (or under development), none of them has  a significant scale with an integrated solution that combines the requirements of all the  stakeholders.   The scale of such a demonstration project should be at least 100,000 end users, both  commercial & industrial (C&I) and residential, before it would provide sufficient proof to both  the EU, and especially to the DSO that need to optimize the solutions, and evaluate the  effectiveness of such solutio ns on their networks. Before implementing this throughout Europe,  significant and hard evidence is required.   Luxembourg should take on this experiment and demonstrate this new market model for  Europe (i.e., the first nationwide smart grid). This, in turn, would establish Luxembourg as the  first mover and attract many new, smart energy businesses. European funds (e.g., Horizon  2020) would surely be available to support this initiative and, ultimately, European energy  policymaking would benefit from the scale  of the evidence base provided.   In addition, the scale of this experiment would aid in catalyzing Luxembourg’s journey towards  commercializing the smart energy business. Luxembourg would effectively become the smart  energy transaction hub for Europe, enabl ing many new smart energy FinTech products for  export throughout Europe.   Summary of TIR Proposals for Energy   The following summarizes our proposals for the TIR roadmap for Energy. We have organized  them into two broad groups:   1. Building Block Proposals.  The Building Block Proposals summarized in this section build  from the work initiated by the Energy WG, and discussed in detail in the preceding  sections. These proposals represent our recommended subset of priority actions (within  the next 10 -15 years) i n which Luxembourg can, and should, take a leadership role.  These priority actions (building blocks) represent prerequisites for many of the other  actions, some of which will largely be directed by initiatives and influences occurring  outside of Luxembourg ’s control and/or jurisdiction (such as global technology  innovations).    2. Innovation Proposals.  The Innovation Proposals summarized in this section are  conceptual ideas to foster the vision, goals, and actions described in the TIR roadmap  for Energy. These  Innovation Proposals are predicated on the assumption that, over  time, Luxembourg would apply increased research and development investments into  targeted measures, rather than in general studies. Furthermore, Luxembourg’s aim to 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               54    increase incubated and en trepreneurial businesses provides a supporting platform for  many of these proposals.    In addition, we have organized these proposals according to how they fit within seven broad  categories: regulatory; public policy; financial; technical; business model innovation (BMI);  educational; and research, development, and innovation (RDI). Many pro posals cut across  multiple categories. As shown in Table 5, a ‘P’ indicates the primary category to which we have  assigned a proposal and an ‘S’ indicates assigned secondary categories. We have also  highlighted, where appropriate, how the proposals overlap  with other TIR Pillars (e.g., Smart  Economy, Mobility).     Building Block Proposals   Regulatory    Implement a common standard to enhance value creation within the smart energy  ecosystem. Standardization, with specifications for market access and interoperabil ity,  is a prerequisite for the establishment of an accessible, flexible, and truly integrated  smart energy marketplace. A common standard is needed to enable trading of flexible  energy use, and to ensure that the tools and rules to make it work are effecti ve. This  standard would also need to specify all market roles, how they interact, and how they  can benefit by doing so. A common standard also reduces the cost to connect different  technologies and projects to the energy system. The USEF, as one example, p rovides the  key elements required, such as the market description, with specifications, designs and  implementation guidelines; implementation references and knowledge from pilots; and  a range of insights and support tools (e.g., exemplary coding). Other ex amples of  common standards are also available and under development.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               55        
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               56    Additional elements of this proposal include:   o Closely follow standardization efforts. Influence, but don’t lead. The challenge  with a new energy market and energy system is that there is no common  agreement yet on which standards and approaches should be applied. There is a  risk of “betting on the wrong standard,” resulting in loss of time and investments  as developi ng standards can take a long time. Years will pass between obtaining  formal approval and adoption of the standard and acquiring sizeable market  share. Therefore, Luxembourg should closely monitor international  developments in smart energy system standardiz ation, rather than proactively  trying to set new standards and approaches. Luxembourg should take timely  steps to ensure that learning from its demonstration projects is brought forward  and included in the appropriate standardization discussions.    o Local i mplementation to follow local requirements.  When relevant  international approaches, standards and European regulations have been  identified, these need to be embedded in the local context of national standards  and regulations. Alignment of the local proces ses and procedures in cities and  municipalities is essential to pave the way for deployment  of a Third Industrial  Revolution  energy paradigm  in Luxembourg . Close collaboration with industry  partners will ensure that the local standards and regulations alig n with the latest  industry standards and guarantee a smooth and safe introduction of the TIR  energy system and market. A consistent national approach is the key to a swift  development of an interoperable Third Industrial Revolution  energy system.   o Massive c hange requires massive accreditation.  In order for Luxembourg’s new,  highly dynamic energy regime  to work safely, reliably and efficiently, it is of  utmost importance that all distributed energy production and consumption  components seamlessly fit together, speak a common language, and perform  according to their claims. The process of standardization, certification and  monitoring helps to ensure the interoperability of the individual components in  the most cost effective way. When embarking on such a transition, a multitude  of components, systems and projects will need to be certified. Luxembourg  should ensure it has access to sufficient accredited certifiers to accomplish this  task.    Support the development of an integrated wholesale European energy market and  secondary markets. A well -integrated, single internal energy market is seen as a  fundamental prerequisite to achieving Europe’s energy policy objectives of affordable 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               57    and competitively priced energy, which is both environmentally sustainable and  secure  for everybody. While the integration of regional markets is currently in progress,  Luxembourg should take steps to build out interconnectors and regulatory frameworks,  and support the development of harmonized market rules, to continue to evolve th e  energy ecosystem on a regional and EU -wide level. Luxembourg should encourage  energy companies to move more aggressively into local flexibility markets and develop a  broader range of flexibility contracts with aggregators. These models are required to  address a new energy mix, new consumption patterns (e.g., e -mobility), and the  movement toward consumers becoming prosumers.    Assess the benefit/cost tradeoff from enhanced retail competition in Luxembourg. In  Luxembourg, additional initiatives should be anal ysed to foster the case for  transparency and more competitive pricing. The retail energy market of the near future  will also need to be flexible enough to accommodate new market entrants and  emerging energy as a service business models. Retail markets shou ld also be assessed  with the evolution of wholesale markets, as there are strong links and interplays among  the underlying market structures.    Decision support is needed to enable the design of Luxembourg’s future smart energy  system.  A number of intermedia ry initiatives are recommended to provide strategic  guidance and operational support, as Luxembourg embarks on this important energy  transition. These recommendations include scenario analysis to identify optimized  action pathways, stakeholder analysis to ensure scalable solutions involving  stakeholders of all sizes, and modeling platforms on which to visualize impacts from  different tradeoffs at the national and local level.   Public Policy    Support the development of Europe’s first nationwide smart grid.  While thousands of  innovative demonstration and pilot projects are underway throughout Europe, these  initiatives are essentially small and lack the scale necessary to provide sufficient  evidence to inform Luxembourg’s future energy policy at the national l evel. Luxembourg  should seek European funding to implement a much larger project (e.g., 100,000  customers or more) and establish itself as a first mover at this scale. Such a project  would attract many new, smart energy business activities to Luxembourg, k ick-starting a  journey towards commercializing the export of smart energy solutions to the rest of  Europe and elsewhere.      
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               58    Financing    Develop alternatives to FiTs for accelerating investments in DER.  This will include  public support for scaling the concept of energy cooperatives, crowdfunding platforms,  and other sharing models. Innovations in performance contracting and third -party  financing models should also be supported through public funding initiatives (i.e.,  incentives). New financing models should al so be supported through public/private  partnership, such as those that enable the development and integration of DER (e.g.,  distributed energy storage, microgrids).    Develop and implement an action plan for financing Luxembourg’s SusTech sector.   Analogous t o Luxembourg’s FinTech sector, fostering Luxembourg leadership in in  SusTech would aid in the transition from the current fossil -fuel based economy to an  economy powered by sustainable energy. It would also result in job growth for both  vocational and know ledge workers. Attaining leadership in this area will require  increased R&D expenditures in the public and private sectors, as well as the creation of  a more favorable environment for entrepreneurship. The action plan should include a  charter for establish ing a public/private partnership to ensure adequate funding is made  available and secured over time.     Innovation Proposals   Technical    Develop the energy superhighway.  The energy superhighway is a crucial element of the  larger Energy Internet. The importance of interoperability and coordination with entities  and infrastructure, such as smart cities, smart buildings, DER, and electric  transportation, cannot be understated . This proposal seeks to increase transactional  linkages among transmission operators, distribution operators, energy suppliers, third  parties, and all of their associated systems. Additional elements of this proposal include:   o Develop a scalable network o f DER technologies that can be monitored,  controlled, and dispatched as a virtual power plant.  Software control  development is greatly needed to support this integration and dynamic interplay  between DER technologies. Current examples can be found in Calif ornia, where  distributed energy storage technologies are being aggregated and deployed in an  interconnected fashion, enabling the reduction of peak power demand on the 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               59    regional power grid, thus avoiding the use of fossil -fueled power generation  during extr eme temperatures.   o Accelerate smart meter -enabled, network applications beyond business as  usual.  As Luxembourg advances its plan to roll out smart meters in 2016,  consideration should be given to the emerging next -generation advancements in  network applica tions that will be facilitated by the installation of smart meter  technologies at scale. These advancements could accelerate more common  applications, such as conservation voltage reduction, load balancing, outage  management, transformer overload detection , high impedance fault detection,  and other applications.   o Develop a national testing laboratory for cyber security validation of  hardware/software systems and controls equipment.  The idea is to identify and  alleviate potential risks and concerns with distr ibuted intelligence in building  systems, energy systems, and mobility systems. This concept further leverages  the recent Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive in Luxembourg,  which has established security and notification requirements for Operat ors of  Essential Services (OoES) —such as banking, energy, transport, financial market  infrastructure, health, drinking water, digital infrastructure —and Digital Service  Providers (DSPs), including online marketplaces, online search engines, and cloud  servi ces.This national lab could build on the competence center for (smart)  metering already built up by Creos in Contern as well as institutionalize the  ongoing collaboration between Creos’ National Grid Control Center and the SNT  department of the University of Luxembourg.    o Create an R&D test bed for advanced power generation and energy storage  options.  This could include new battery chemistries for energy storage,  advanced power inverters for renewable energy, and hybrid systems to integrate  multiple energy technologies, such as energy storage with renewables.   o Creation of smart meter data repositories t o facilitate innovation in energy  pricing and service offerings.  Smart meter data exchange platforms can facilitate  the development of innovative rate designs and related service offerings. Data  privacy considerations will need to be addressed as different  levels of access to  these platforms is granted to new market entrants, and to other stakeholders  over time.    Support two -way charging infrastructure for electric vehicles and monitor  developments of hydrogen -based mobility . Given the current and projected maturity, 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               60    availability and uptake of full electric vehicles, supporting the creation of a two -way  charging infrastructure should be characterized as a no -regret option. International  developments regarding hydrogen -infrastru cture should be closely monitored and  facilitated, as appropriate. It is recommended to reduce further investment in fueling  infrastructures for marginal fuels that are not carbon free, such as natural gas.   Regulatory    Facilitate the development of standard s with regard to network orchestrator  platforms and business arrangements (eco -orchestrator).  Increasing opportunities are  emerging to exploit smart grid technology to optimize the energy use of consumers by  automatically shifting local energy production f rom DER and microgrids, as well as  energy consumption from intelligent energy devices like EVs, washing machines, water  heating, and heat pumps. However, a broad range of standards are needed to facilitate  further development of these opportunities. Luxemb ourg should support work to  facilitate the development of these standards, as well as empower local network  operators to pursue appropriate roles in moving this forward. Potential roles for the  eco-orchestrator could involve tailoring electricity and gas s upply, and demand services,  for a customer, distributor, third -party energy provider, or grid operator.   Similar network orchestrator business models can be found in other industries including  Airbnb.com, WhatsApp, Uber, and Alibaba. Luxembourg -specific ex amples include  Appartager, Carloh, BlaBlaCar, and others. To facilitate similar developments within the  energy sector, Luxembourg should begin to explore the creation of a blockchain  economic system for tracking energy transactions associated with transact ive energy  systems. This will also require coordination and integration with the systems of  neighboring countries.    Finally, an additional opportunity for Luxembourg is to develop advanced technologies  for optimizing the water -energy nexus. A range of tec hnologies are advancing to reduce  water treatment and distribution consumption within the context of power generation,  supply, and end use. These technologies range from more traditional waste heat  recovery and process efficiency measures, to more advanced  concepts like dry cooling  and alternate fluids. In addition, cooling for thermoelectric generation continues to be  an important target for water efficiency, as this process withdraws large quantities of  water, resulting in wasted and untreated water, and consumes tremendous quantities  of primary energy.    Require all critical Luxembourg City new or retrofit buildings to meet minimum  resilency standards. Luxembourg City should include in its building design and energy 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               61    codes, a strategy that also addresses the  resiliency of specific buildings that are deemed  critical for shelter and continued operations (e.g., hospitals, municipality,  water/wastewater, police) during extreme weather or other related events.  This can  begin with the identification of critical bu ildings based on functionality, but also  supplemented with a resiliency audit, to understand how impervious these buildings are  to extreme weather events and other natural or man -made hazards (e.g., cyber attacks).  This audit would also seek to identify co st-effective measures to improve resiliency of  these buildings, while also reducing their energy consumption and GHG emissions.   For new buildings, the TIR recommendation is that Luxembourg evaluate and establish  certain design requirements to incorporate a certain level of resiliency. In addition,  Luxembourg City can lead by example, by having new or renovated City buildings  become more resilient and disclose the resiliency measures of the buildings.  Once this  program is deemed successful in the city, the n consideration can be made to scale it  across the country to other metropolitan regions.     Public Policy    Create a smart governance oversight body and develop/implement appropriate  performance assessment tools.  Smart governance will be critical to ensure that  Luxembourg’s journey through the Third Industrial Revolution  proceeds in an efficient  and cost -effective manner, thus avoiding wasteful or ineffective spending. Knowing  where and when to focus investments an d to initiate projects will enable a smoother  transition. This proposal provides a strategy for identifying and prioritizing cities and/or  regions according to their readiness for TIR investments and demonstration projects.  This strategy includes an assess ment framework for evaluating the readiness of cities  and regions. This framework uses specific sets of criteria as measures of TIR readiness,  as well as Readiness Benchmarks, against which cities and regional entities would be  periodically evaluated. A Sm art Cities Index61 was recently developed for U.K. cities and  provides a valuable model of this type of assessment framework.    Create a ‘Future Transport Fuel’ platform with partners from the European transport  corridors, and begin building a detailed roadmap for decarbonizing cargo transport in  Europe.  As Luxembourg’s economy is intrinsically embedded in the European context, it  is important that internal transport fuel and infrastructure policies are aligned with  surrounding countries. Luxembourg migh t consider ‘transition fuels,’ such as biofuels                                                           61 See http://www.huawei.com/en/news /2016/5/UKs -leading -smart -cities   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               62    and LNG, with hydrogen and e -diesel options, which are becoming more favorable over  time. In a transition to a fully sustainable transport economy, it will be crucial for  Luxembourg to consider these options within the broader European context, and to  establish and communicate clear goals and timelines.    Develop innovation engines for accelerating zero net neighborhood (ZNN) models.  This initiative focuses on implementing energy efficiency and renewable energy   technologies at the neighborhood scale. It has several components:   o Focus on schools as engagement hubs.  By using schools as engagement hubs,  this proposal increases energy awareness and creates a community -centered  and location -based approach to energy efficiency and renewable energy that will  generate replicable, medium -scale energy savings across a range of different  sectors. In this way, schools take the lead in facilitating technological and cultural  shifts that eventually become embedded in the comm unity. Students and  parents are afforded a unique opportunity to learn as part of a larger  community. Social accountability is also maximized through the focus on the  neighborhood as a geographical target. An initial ZNN would become a proof -ofconcept tha t government would then replicate throughout other school districts  in the region.   o Develop an XPRIZE62 type of approach to stimulate interest and test a  comprehensive range of implementation options.  Luxembourg should also  develop a program to stimulate int erest in expanding the ZNN concept beyond  energy (i.e., include the circular and sharing economy, efficient transportation,  and local entrepreneurship). The intent is to bring together neighborhood -scale  microgrid technologies, smart meter -enabled energy f eedback systems, and  deep energy efficiency retrofits, to enhance community -level, renewable energy  production, community engagement, and new business model development.  Options might include traditional elements, such as energy audits and low -cost  energy retrofits, but it can also go beyond traditional measures and include  innovative concepts, such as the development of a residential microgrid using  the local school as an engagement hub. In this example, the approach would  generate a replicable, residentia l microgrid that balances the daytime energy  demand of schools during the late afternoon, with the evening energy demands  of households. Reductions in household - and school -related transportation  energy consumption could also be considered through the prom otion of efficient                                                           62 See http://www.xprize.org/  and links therein  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               63    transportation and mobility sharing schemes. Participation in these schemes  might be encouraged through social accountability methods, as well as social  norming processes. Limited -time discounts, financing, and other economic  incentives can be provided by the government and third -party service providers  (e.g., energy service companies), to discount the initial cost of participation and  make implementation more affordable and risk -free.   o Establish integrated design principles as a requireme nt for eco -district funding.  Integrated design can transform the building construction process and help  Luxembourg achieve its 2050 Vision for Energy. Integrated designs involve  cohesive and collaborative planning, design, construction, and management of  buildings to not only deliver on energy and environmental performance  specifications, but to also increase occupant satisfaction and operational  effectiveness. Requiring integrated design frameworks for public/private  financing schemes will enable the neces sary connections between each stage in  the building lifecycle. They will also facilitate a closed loop information exchange  between the design vision and ultimate use of the facility. These same principles  should be integrated into other financing mechanis ms, such as revolving loan  funds and green investment bank type schemes.    Implement partnerships with large businesses to promote energy -at-work initiatives.   Luxembourg's national and/or local governments should partner with large companies  to create employ er-led programs that encourage and support employees to reduce  energy consumption at work, and in their homes, and to install renewable energy  technologies. Energy savings at work can focus on workplace employee engagement  programs. Energy savings at home can be achieved through the provision of aggregated  and discounted technology purchases, sp ecialized payment programs (via the  employer), energy information (in conjunction with Luxembourg's myenergy service),  and tips and incentives (with normative and pr o-social messaging and information about  non-energy benefits), all intended to assist employees in changing energy consumption  practices and reducing energy waste. The United Kingdom runs an employee awareness  program called Carbon Trust Empower.63 This pro gram targets reduction in energy use,  emissions, water, and waste through employee engagement. The program supports the  development and implementation of an energy strategy, as well as the monitoring of  the program.                                                            63 See https://www.carbontrust.com/resources/tools/empower  and links therein  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               64     Upgrade information and engagement: This proposal involves the creation of a national   platform to provide real -time, historical, and comparative energy feedback to residential  and commercial energy customers, using a web -based platform and in -home displays.  The online information can utilize soc ial norms and targeted tips to give meaning to  energy consumption information and motivate action. This program can also enable  residential and commercial customers to have access to near real -time energy  consumption information. This information has been shown to effectuate consumer  behaviors from increased energy visibility, to improve energy management and reduce  energy consumption. Ideally, it can also provide historical consumption information,  baseload and non -baseload information, time -of-use informa tion, usage alerts, and a  variety of other options that can help consumers become more knowledgeable and  more effective in managing their energy consumption and reducing wasteful energy  use. The information can highlight the non -energy benefits and pro -social benefits of  energy efficiency technologies and smart energy practices, building on a waste  management type of approach.    Develop innovative disclosure and rating tools for the real estate sector.  Making  energy -related operating costs more transparent to owners, buyers, and renters creates  an opportunity to make energy more visible and to reshape real estate preferences.  Smart real estate markets will use comparative benchmarking and rating systems and  ICT-enabled programs to share energy consumption information. In addition, there can  be changes in real estate disclosure laws to promote reduced levels of energy  consumption through participation in energy audits, appliance retrofits, smart energy  man agement, green leases, and more. Public access to building -level energy  consumption ratings (residential and commercial) can be accessed via a Zillow -type app,  while actual consumption data can be a mandatory part of real estate transaction  information sha ring.    Develop, test, and maintain an electric power infrastructure resiliency strategy.  As  previously suggested, a well -functioning electricity grid is a requirement to deliver  critical services, including health services, transportation, and telecommunic ations. Due  to the long term impact of investment decisions in power grid infrastructure, it is key  that this infrastructure be explicitly addressed. It is recommended that Luxembourg’s  Energy working group focuses attention on defining scenarios for the f uture grid  architecture, as well as develop a strategic response plan of action, in the event of  extreme weather or cyber -related events that compromise the power network.  As is  the case for many TSOs and DSOs, emergency response plans also need to be tes ted and  revised, as necessary, to account for new threats and mitigating solutions.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               65    Educational    Foster lifelong learning to keep pace with the evolving needs of the energy transition.   Luxembourg can develop a public/private partnership funding and implemen tation  scheme to expand the capacity for community engagement, education/workforce  development, and building/industry audits. This can be created through a  university/trade school extension service. The service can also create energy extension  programs in select universities/trade schools that can provide training to students, while  also providing information, community outreach, and onsite audit services to  businesses, industries, and (potentially) households. The program can provide free or  subsidized ene rgy audits and advice concerning energy efficiency and renewable energy  opportunities, and connect interested parties to pre -screened service providers.                            
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               66    MOBILITY   OVERVIEW   The meshing of the Communication Internet  and the Energy Internet makes possible  the  build -out and scale -up of the automated  Transportation and Logistics Internet. The  convergence of these three Internets comprise  the kernel of the Internet of Things platform  for managing, powering, and transporting  goods and passengers in a Third Ind ustrial  Revolution economy. The automated Transportation and Logistics Internet is made up of four  foundational pillars, which, like the Energy Internet, have to be phased -in simultaneously in  Luxembourg for the system to operate efficiently.   First, charging stations will need to be installed ubiquitously across land masses, allowing cars,  buses and trucks, to power up or send back electricity to the grid.   Second, sensors embedded in devices across road networks as well as in vehicles will pro vide  real-time data to help manage traffic flows, identify the best itineraries for automated vehicles,  and provide information to the users (i.e. collective public transport information, car  sharing  and car  pooling, etc.), and across logistics networks to  allow factories, warehouses,  wholesalers, retailers, and end users to have up -to-the-moment data on logistical flows that  affect their value chain.   Third, the storage and transit of all physical goods will need to be standardized so that they can  be effi ciently passed off to any node and sent along any passageway, operating across the  logistics system in the same way that information flows effortlessly and efficiently across the  World Wide Web.   Fourth, all of the actors in public transport systems and al ong logistic corridors have to continue  their efforts to operate synergistically and in coordination. By the end of 2017, all the public  transport operators will provide a seamless public transport system based on interchange  between different transports m odes, with a single tariff system and travel document and  coordination between the services. Operators along the transport corridors, in turn, need to  continue to aggregate into collaborative networks to bring all of their assets into a shared  mobility spa ce to optimize passenger traffic and the shipment of goods, taking advantage of  lateral economies of scale.  For example, warehouses and distribution centers might establish Co-Chairs Henk van Tuyl and Marie Sauvignon ,  and the Luxembourg Mobility  Working Group;   Elisabetta Cherchi (Technical University of  Denmark), Francesco Sechi (MLab srl), Luca  Guala (MLab srl), and Jeremy Rifkin, TIR  Consulting Group LLC    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               67    cooperatives to share unused spaces, allowing carriers to drop off and pick up shipments using  the most efficient path en route to their destination.   The Internet of Things platform will provide real -time logistical data on pick -up and delivery  schedules,  weather conditions, traffic flows, and up -to-the-moment information on warehouse  storage capacities en route in Luxembourg. Automated dispatching will use Big Data and  analytics to create algorithms and applications to ensure the optimization of aggregate   efficiencies along the logistical routes and, by so doing, dramatically increase productivity while  reducing the marginal cost of every shipment.   Globally, b y 202 0-2025 , at least some of the shipments on roads, railways, water, and air  corridors, as well  as some of the movement of passengers, will likely be carried out by  automated electric and fuel cell transport, powered by near zero marginal cost renewable  energies, and operated by increasingly sophisticated analytics and algorithms.  Driverless  transpo rt will accelerate productivity and reduce the marginal labor cost of shipping goods and  moving people toward near zero on a smart automated Transpo rtation and Logistics Internet.   Luxembourg already has a highly advanced and integrated logistics infrastru cture upon which  to build out and scale up an automated transportation and logistics platform. Cargolux,  LuxairCargo, and CargoCenter provide world class service in air shipments, while CFL Cargo  provides state of the art rail freight logistics, and CFL Mu ltimodal provides a wide range of  freight services. The Cluster for Logistics has been established to advance the various logistics  services across Luxembourg. Its mission, in part, is dedicated to driving new innovations and  collaborations to streamline t he logistics infrastructure and operations. Luxembourg currently  ranks second  in the world for best performance in logistics according to the World Bank’s  logistics performance index.64 Luxembourg’s highly advanced logistics infrastructure and  operations will enable the country to speed its transition into an automated , digitalized , and  soon driverless transportation and logistics hub.   The erection of the automated Transportation and Lo gistics Internet will also have to transform  the very way people living and working in Luxembourg view mobility. According to Eurostat,  with 672 passenger cars per 1 ,000 inhabitants, Luxembourg has the highest number of vehicles  per capita in Europe, while  the average across the EU is 486 passenger cars per 1 ,000  inhabitants in 2013. Traffic congestion is compounded by a daily influx of workers from France,  Germany, and Belgium. More than 175, 000 commuters travel into Luxembourg daily, and 86%  of them trave l by car. Approximately 75% of the oil products sold in Luxembourg are consumed  outside of the country. Luxembourg offers the most lightly taxed fuel in Europe, resulting in  “gas pump tourism .” With transport accounting for 64% of global warming emissions in                                                           64 See: http://lpi.worldbank.org/international/global  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               68    Luxembourg, the country has put a high priority on developing new, more sustainable, and less polluting transport. The implementation of the governmental MoDu strategy will reorganize  public transport and offer faster and more comfortable connections vi a a combination of train,  tram , and bus lines. In 2013, the government of Luxembourg announced the goal of having  1,600 public charging points by 2020. Luxembourg City has also established bike sharing  services available to individuals . The initiative is c alled “Vel ’oH” and it includes 7 5 bike stations  with over 700 bikes that are increasingly being used to mitigate automobile traffic and  congestion on the streets .   Today’s youth are using mobile communication technology and GPS guidance on an incipient  automated Transportation and Logistics Internet to connect with willing drivers in car sharing  services. An increasing number of y oung people prefer  “access to mobilit y” over ownership of  vehicles. In 2015, Luxembourg City unveiled its new car sharing service called “Carloh.” While  still in the pilot stage, plans call for a vast expansion in car sharing services. Future generations  will likely never own vehicles again i n a smart automated mobility era. For every vehicle shared,  however, up to 15 vehicles are eliminated from production.   There are currently 1.2 billion cars, buses, and trucks crawling along in traffic in dense urban  areas around the world.65 Gasoline -powered internal combustion vehicles were the centerpiece  of the Second Industrial Revolution. The mass production of these vehicles devoured vast  amounts of the Earth’s natural resources. Cars, buses, and trucks also burn massive amounts of  oil and are a major contributor to global warming gas emissions, after buildings and beef  production and related agricultural production practices. Larry Burns  – the former Vice  President of General Motors, and now a professor at the University of Michigan  – did a study of  mobility patterns. The results suggest  that 80% of the vehicles currently on the road can be  eliminated with widespread adoption of car sharing services over the course of the next  generation .66 The remaining 2 40 million vehicles will be , in great part, electric and fuel cell  transport, powered by near zero marginal cost renewable energy. Those shared vehicles, in  turn, will be automated and running on automated smart road systems. The trio of innovations  in transport – vehicle sharing, ele ctrification, and automation – will reinforce one another, and  allow Luxembourg to reach a much more efficient and sustainable mobility system than what is  prevalent today.   The long -term transition from ownership of vehicles to access to mobility in driver less vehicles  on smart road systems will fundamentally alter the business model for the transportation  industry. While the big auto manufacturers around the world will produce fewer vehicles over                                                           65 See: http://www.navigantresearch.com/research/transportation -forecast -light -duty -vehicles   66 See : http://sustainablemobility.ei.columbia.edu/files/2012/12/Transforming -Personal -Mobil ity-Jan-2720132.pdf  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               69    the course of the next 30 years, they will likely increasing ly reposition themselves as  aggregators of the global automated Transportation and Logistics Internet, managing mobility  services and logistics.   The convergence of the Communication Internet, Renewable Energy Internet, and automated  Transportation and Logi stics Internet in an operating kernel becomes the global brain for an  Internet of Things cognitive infrastructure. This new digital platform will fundamentally change  the way people living and working in Luxembourg manage, power, and move economic activity   across the numerous value chains and networks that make up their economy. The digitalized  Internet of Things platform is the core of the Third Industrial Revolution.     STATE OF PLAY AND LUXEMBOURG VISION   Luxembourg, as a small country located between Belgium, France and Germany, is located at  the heart of an integrated cross -border region. This strategic position allows the nation to have  good connections with European road, rail , water,  and air networks and to stand as an  important point of intersecti on and interaction between passengers and logistics flows.   The country’s projected strong economic and population  growth (according to Eurostat ,67  population is expected to exceed  1 million in 2050) contributes to increased transportation and  mobility , both  playing a key role in the daily life of the national economy and society.   Policies and interventions need to be reviewed or identified in order to reach the targets  defined in the Europe 2020 strategy, which requires Luxembourg to initiate far more aggres sive  efforts towards reducing greenhouse gas emissions and generating more renewable energy .68   A mobility challenge   The Luxembourg government has identified issues that mobility will face in the future and , in  2012, published a plan for a sustainable mobility called MoDu (“Mobilité Durable ,” Sustainable  Mobility) ,69 providing a set of objectives for the foreseeable future.   According to the MoDu, 2009 mobility modal share is composed of 72.5% motorized individual  vehicles, 14.5% transport en commun70 and 13% active mobility.                                                            67 Eurostat (2013), European Population Projections EUROPOP 2013   68 See : http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/pdf/csr2016/cr2016_luxembourg_en.pdf    69 Ministère du Development Durable et des Infrastructures (2012) MoDu: Stratégie globale pour  une mobilité  durable pour les résidents et les frontaliers.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               70    Despite the small population and size of the country, Luxembourg has the highest number of  cars per capita in Europe (0.672, while the average is 0.486) ,71 in constant growth (factor of 29  over 60 years), with an average CO2 emission o f 147 g/km despite low average vehicle age.72 Of  existing passenger cars , 60% run on  diesel and 40% run on  petrol73 – in which the rate of new  diesel cars bought is 72% .74 GHG emissions from Luxembourg transports reaches 7.6 million  tons C02 equivalent vs. total Lux 11 .8Mt, i.e. 64%.   The high number  of cars, commuters , and transit traffic account s for 54% of the country’s  energy consumption based on fuel sold ( compared to  26% in the EU28) , which has a significant  impact on health and quality of life in public spaces. Furthermore, final transport energy  consumption (road, railway and air amount to 2.5Mtoe) is 250% more than household final  energy consumption (1Mtoe), making  total transport energy consumption equal to 61% of  Luxembourg ’s total energy consumption.75  Additional passenger car traffic come s from the 175 ,000 commuters per day representing, in  absolute terms, the second highest number of cross -border commutes in the E EA. Among  commuters, 40% work in Luxembourg City and enter the Grand -Duchy mostly via car (86%),  train (9%) , and bus (5%). The average daily commute  of 90km takes 100 min. The c ross-border  phenomen on is mainly caused by the attractiveness of the Luxembourg economy which  offers  twice the number of  working positions compared to the resident working population. As a  cross -border region with low fuel prices, 75% of the fuel sold in the country is used by  Luxe mbourgers, cross -border workers, transit trucks, and tourists.                                                                                                                                                                                       70 The French expression “ transport en commun ” refers to all transport systems that imply a “common” use of the  mobility resources, compared to a “private” one. A broader definition of “ Transport en commun ” includes the  traditional public transport and all non -conventional transport systems such as on -demand personal and group  transit systems, micro -mobility, shared vehicles and shared rides.   71 European Commission (2015), EU Transport in figures.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               71    Latest data  show that there are 275 kilometers of rail lines in Luxembourg (140km of double  and 135km of single track).76 The state road network consists of 2, 908km of roadways (1 61km  of highwa ys, 837km of national ro ads, and 1,891km of paths used). Recent years have seen the  saturation of existing road, parking, railway , and highway infrastructures, resulting in  Luxembourg being  the fourth  most congested country in the EU .77   As already stated , public transport usage is low (14.5%) compared to the usage of individual  cars (72.5 %) and active transport (13%). This car dependency is mainly driven by the following  factors: urban sprawl, lack of mixed -used urban developments, the centralization of e conomic  life, long travel times for public transport connections to rural and cross -borders areas, lack of  efficient national regulations fostering the use of clean transportation means, lack of coherent  cycle networks, as well as a strong car ownership cu lture.   Nevertheless, studies show the advantage in urban centers of active mobility rather than  motorized vehicles. For trips  between 1km and 3km, the bicycle is the fastest mode of  transportation  (even on uphill  topography  thanks to electric bikes ). Urban  travel speed for  pedestrians and cyclists is, for the first 500m, higher than the speed of cars with an average  speed of 4km/h .78 This is interesting for Luxembourg , where 40% of daily trips represent less  than 3 km. However, Luxembourg holds  the European record for private car use , with 60% o f  trips below 1km .79   Furthermore, to incentivize more public transportation and alternatives to automobiles, the  Transport Community (Verkéiersverbond)  is setting up a telematics systems  (“mLive”) which  will regroup th e real -time departure times of the different public transport operators.80 Real time data is already available for AVL, TICE and CFL and, by the end of 2017, will be available for  all the RGTR bus lines. Access to real -time datasets is provided by applicati ons via an openly  licensed API in order to make the integration of the RT travel time possible.   Finally , conventional transportation modes caused several negative externalities , with major  consequences for safety and air quality.   Despite having implemented all safety regulations according to EU standards (drink -drive,  helmet, seat -belt, child restraint, mobile phone use while driving and drug -driving                                                           76 EU Transport, 2015 Pocketbook, p .76 and 2014, p.46 and 55 / latest information from MDDI   77 (INRIX, 2015)    78 MoDu, p.145    79 MoDu, p.22   80 MoDu, p.159

Transportation has a significant impact on air quality. Transport impacts on the atmosphere are  twofold:   - Locally , for human health (due to CO, HC, NOx and PMs emissions)   - Globally, causing global warming and acid rain (CO2, CFCs)   According to the European Environment Agency ,83 premature deaths attributable to PM25, 03  and NO2 exposure are , respectively, 250, 10 and 60.   Investments and Initiatives   The Luxembourg government, during the totality of its parliamentary term, will have invested  2.4 billion euros in infrastructure84 and launched the implementation of several MoDu elements   to improve mobility and transportation in the country . The initiatives , led by government or  mun icipalities , include a strong improvement in public transport , the LuxTram connecting the  whole city , and the creati on of  multimodal hubs , new train stations  in the outskirts of the  capital , a reorganization of the regional bus network, car sharing initiat ives such as CARLOH in  Luxembourg City, plug -in hybrid electric buses, a new tax legislation favoring zero emission cars  for private use and low emission vehicles until 2020,  a national telematics project  “mLive” for  public transport , installation  of 1,600 public charging points for electric vehicles until 2020 , an  additional 1 3,100 Park&Ride (P+R) parking spaces , and the creation of 700 km of additional  cycling paths.                                                                    81World Health Organization,  http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/road_safety_status/2015/en/,   82 EC, p.102   83 2015, p.44   84 L’essentiel (2015) “Faire davantage pour la mobilité ».

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               73      LuxTram (source: site luxtram.lu)   The financial cost of new infrastructure is often highlighted as a strong barrier , yet the cost of  inaction and negative externalities is often forgotten. Urban sprawl is extremely expensive  because of necessary maintenance to roads and other infrastructure. The cost of t raffic  congestion is estimated to be  1 to 3% of a country’s GDP. Lastly, the pollution impact on health  as well as the impact of a widespread lack of physical activity are difficult to estimate in  financial terms (see local and global impacts mentioned here above) , but are too often  neglected in the overall analysis.   Clusters fostering innovation   Luxembourg  benefits from active national public research with strong ICT know -how and the  best , most secure IT infrastructure (with excellent network coverage) in the world . This could  lead to a significant  potential in the deployment of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). Studies  show that there is a high economic development potential for Luxembourg in this field and that  while some companies are already active in the field, many more have the  potential to enter  that market. The University of Luxembourg and the public research center , LIST, do research on  mobility solutions and related fields and have strong know -how in ICT.   The recent creation of dedicated clusters (automotive, logistics and I CT) also contributes to the  dynamic development of some specific industries in these fields in Luxembourg.The Cluster for  Logistics has united all institutional players and private enterprises in different competencies.  Their shared goal is to strengthen L uxembourg’s position as a major European logistics hub ,  especially for high value added services.85                                                           85 Clusters for Logistics Luxembourg asbl (2015) Luxembourg your multimodal gateway to Europe   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               74    The Logistics cluster provides a positive path toward a Third Industrial Revolution  mobility  paradigm by establishing the groundwork for the creation of a co llaborative network and a  common shared logistical space (fourth pillar of the Mobility Internet).   Luxairport (where market leaders such as LuxairCargo and CargoLux are based), the Eurohub  South (where CFL Multimodal, a national player acting globally is based) the inland Port of  Mertert (Luxport) , and state of the art road and rail infrastructure provide Luxembou rg with the  necessary assets to be a leader in multimodal freight transportation.   Luxembourg is ranked second  globally for logistics performance and is first for international  shipments and timeliness.Additionally, the Grand -Duchy is well positioned in mai n areas of  R&D. The government supports R&D projects with grants and has established  a special program  to promote joint research that encourages companies to collaborate with each other or with  public research organizations.   Finally , further opportunities could derive from the innovation and implementation of  automated vehicles and drones. In fact, according to a European Commission report, 63% of  Luxembourgish people believe drones to be an efficient way to transport and deliver goods (vs.  EU average of 57 %). On the other hand, based on the Declaration of Amsterdam, pledged by all  important mobility players and EU Member States, improvements need to be achieved  concerning the “uncomfortable” perception that nationals have towards AV (65% compared to  61% at EU level).   In conclusion , with  one of the highest GDP per capita in the world and the lowest debts and  deficits in the EU, Luxembourg’s social stability ensures that the coalition government defines  policies fostering a stable business and friendly environ ment to invest in an ambitious seamless  and sustainable mobility plan.     Vision   An intelligent, sustainable , cohesive , and resilient mobility and transport ecosystem for the  benefits of the Luxembourg society and economy.   The Luxembourg current mobility and transportation model based on the Second Industrial  Revolution proves itself unsustainable, producing massive negative externalities and reaching  its limits. With transport ation  accounting for 61% of energy consumption (and 64% of CO2  emissions), the transformation of this sector and the development of a new mobility paradigm  is critical to the build -out of a new sustainable economic model in the country.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               75    With the forecasted fast-paced rise of its population ( above 1 mil lion inhabitants predicted in  2050  plus some 320,000 cross -border commuters  expected ), Luxembourg will have to provide  solutions for the projected increased mobility and transport needs. Incremental measures will  not be sufficient to tackle this issue, the  symptoms of which we can already witness: traffic  congestion, pollution, loss in productivity, impact on quality of life, etc. A change in paradigm is  necessary, implying fundamental disruptive transformations. Rising new technologies combined  with greene r energies and the build -out of a favorable mobility ecosystem will be decisive to  revolutionize the Luxembourg mobility and transportation system. This approach implies the  conjunction of several aspects.   Fast development of clean mobility based on e -vehi cles and active  mobility is a key priority to  meet drastic reduction of emissions. By 2050, the vision is that Luxembourg will have a 100%  electric fleet for passenger cars and public transport. Pending the availability of vehicles from  car manufacturers, this would  require specific measures and regulations that all new passenger  cars and public transport be 100% electric from 2025 onwards.   However, while switching the fleet to electric cars addresses emission issues, it does not solve  the problem of acces sibility and traffic congestion. Therefore, E -mobility needs to be paired  with policies of car  sharing and car  pooling and with automation technologies that will help  respond  to travel demands , in a much more flexible  and multimodal  way. Such a  system, bas ed  on a performant and comprehensive transportation data structure, will enable the deployment  of on -demand automated personal and group transit vehicles. This flexible transport mode is  expected to gain a substantial portion  of traffic in the next 10 -20 y ears , thus redefining  transport  and freeing attractive space for active mobility in urban centers .  Automated Vehicles, along with the Communication Internet and the Energy Internet,  constitute the kernel of the IoT platform. Automation technologies and the  development of a  resilient transport data system will be a strong source of efficiency gains for logistics through  optimized travel of standardized goods, reverse lo gistics and last -mile delivery.   A rich multimodal matrix , including car sharing, car  pooling, bicycles and other public transport   systems  – where mobility is seen as a service  – is a key component of a shift towards  sustainable mobility.  All the transport solutions have to be integrated via a comprehensive data  system to produce and delive r a service  to support  logistics needs and  the individuals’ daily  routines.   Considering the forecasted population and commuter growth resulting from an extrapolation of  current trends through  2050, the  workforce  will potentially increase to 755,000 people   compared to  415,000 today.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               77    In the 2050 scenario , where the travelling population is expected to rise by 85%, the target  scenario in the modal split implies a reduction of individual cars by 18%, an increase of public  and shared transport  by over six times , and an increase in active mobility by four  time s.   These ambitious targets for public and shared transport and active modes need to be  supported by a set of push measures  oriented towards keeping people away from their cars. If  public policy continues to favor improving the traditional road system, it could deter  commuters from taking public transport. The pressures brought on by the demographic growth  projections, low exc ise duties on fuels, convenient fiscal treatment of company cars and the  increasing housing prices (doubled from 2000 to 2014) cause a rise in the number of  commuters coming in from neighboring countries, all contribute to remaining locked into an old  tran sport mindset that is becoming ecologically unsustainable (unless the target shift toward  clean mobility is achieved) and increasingly untenable in terms of congestion.   A change in the transportation paradigm also changes the way people view mobility. In this  holistic approach to mobility, a set of solutions is required which contributes to the build -out of  a favorable mobility ecosystem in Luxembourg. Intelligent urban planning will be a critical  priority in order to avoid private car dependency (urban sp rawl, single use neighborhoods, and  monopolization of public spaces). New flexible working schemes will also play a decisive role .  The new concept of Mobility -as-a-Service  requires a ‘cultural change’ and specific supporting  interventions in order to reduc e what is called the “cost of cognitive effort” in changing  behavior.   Knowing that the “high powered car” ownership culture is very present in the country, with the  highest number of car per capita and high emission vehicles, encouraging new usages suppose s  a change of culture that can only operate through the emergence of a new narrative.   Finally , the creation of a sustainable mobility fund will help accelerate the transition by  fostering innovation and developing a “mobility of the future” Luxembourg econ omy.   Going forward , Luxembourg will be an important testbed for smart mobility by building on its  central location, its excellent ICT infrastructure and know -how , and the innovation driven  automotive supplier sector. The recently launched inter -ministerial  working group on “Smart  Mobility” will help drive this innovation platform. The new Open Data Platform  (http://data.public.lu ) will provide open access to plenty of high quality mobility and non mobility data to work with. Furthermore, the Automotive Components Cluster and its members  represent a very innovative community and the new Automotive Campus that is being  developed will allow well -established companies to work side by side with agile start -ups and  resulting synergies between automotive and ICT will be exploited to the fullest. In the future, 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               78    Luxembourg will offer companies ideal conditions through a nationwide network of intelligent  infrastructures and services.     Resilience and the Transportation System for Luxembourg   The interventions  identified in the TIR transport scenario  will play an active role to wards   improving the economy and mitigati ng climate change. The challen ge for transport planners  and administrators is to ensure that the new mobility system, based on electricity  from  renewable sources , sharing , and automation , will guarantee high levels of accessibility and  satisfaction of mobility needs , with an adequate l evel of service in terms of travel time, travel  comfort, accessibility and reliability .At the same time, the transport system must be resilient to  short and long -term  disruption of services brought on by cybercrime, cyberterrorism, and  extreme weather events.   The transportation system is one of the fundamental assets of a community: it is essential to  allow people to reach workplaces, schools, and shops, to distribute goods , and provide services.  Its malfunctioning may cause severe cons equences in the resilience of the whole economic  system ( city resilience ). In the case of extraordinary events, the transport system must be  capable of returning to the  previous existing equilibrium  or be able to change,  adapt  and  transform  itself in respo nse to qualitative stresses and strains that change the very nature of  the society.  The transport system must therefore have a high level of built -in resilience.   The resilience of a transportation system can be defined in different ways:   For the individual  it means that each person has several alternative transport options to choose  from, even under unexpected or catastrophic conditions, and in case their chosen option is not  available any more (e.g. car breaks down, public transport is not available, perso n becomes  disabled; personal income drops dramatically…)   For society  it means that the transport system will guarantee the mobility of persons and goods  even under unexpected conditions, in case a partial failure occurs to the transportation system  (for ex ample: unavailability of an infrastructure) or a complete failure occurs in a system which  is complementary to the transport system (for example in the case of IoT: unavailability of  electric power because of a catastrophic natural disaster or a cyber -attack).  Looking at the elements that make up the transportation system, failure may occur at four  fundamental levels : the strategic level  (long term economic, social and environmental goals);  the economic level  (assessment of the cost of the resources require d for transportation) the 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               79    design level  (infrastructures, vehicles and communication and information systems) and the  education level  (availability of persons with adequate skills to make the system function).   The TIR strategy proposes a radical change of the transportation systems of people and goods;  the risks for the transport system in the TIR scenario, resides mainly in the lack of supply of  electricity for charging vehicles and communication systems and in  the collapse of the  infrastructures components exposed to weather events, terrorism and cyber -attacks.   So two questions arise:   - Is the proposed TIR strategy transport system more or less resilient than the current  system?   - Is the proposed TIR strategy trans port system proposed sufficiently resilient? And if not,  how can it be made so?   The proposed TIR transport system will rely primarily on the same physical infrastructure of the  existing transport system and will inherit its positive features that make it resilient: universality,  to accommodate many different types of vehicles (diversity), offering multiple alternative  modes and routes (redundancy); capacity to function even if partly damaged (robustness).   However, the TIR strategy for transport and mobility  also proposes a number of fundamental  changes in the current transportation system:   - Total shift towards renewable resources: Renewable energy is produced locally and  mainly at small generation plants across the territory. This greatly increases local  resilience since the region is protected against geo -political events that may jeopardize  the supply of fossil fuels. It is also less likely that all small generation plants will fail ,  causing a catastrophic failure of the entire system. The electricity di stribution system for   transport can be made more resilient by making it redundant and self -fixing (robust).   - Electrification of the powertrain of the vehicles:  The electrification of the vehicles, on  the one hand, may increase the robustness of the distribu tion system, which does not  rely on road -based  tankers and shipments but, on the other hand, it will also make it  less robust, since it cannot count on reservoirs. Liquid and gas fossil fuels, in fact, can be  stored in large quantities, while electric energy is extremely difficult to store. Electric  vehicles, having a much higher efficiency than fossil -fuel vehicles, are also more resilient  against economic collapse. The system can be made more resilient by adopting a mixed  strategy of power supply, comprising external  supply, on -board batteries and, i n the  future, hydrogen fuel cells (diversity and redundancy).  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               80    - Increase in the use of massive public transportation: This policy can make the system  of transportation significantly more resilient by better distributing the flows of  passengers and goods ove r various modes of transport, by improving the security at  stations and on board the vehicles (robustness), by implementing different types of  interconnected but independent modes (train, tram, bus, shuttle etc., providing  diversity) and connecting the maj or origin -destination pairs by different parallel modes  (for example: bus and train, providing redundancy). The TIR public transport system is  well diversified. It comprises buses (battery electric or hydrogen -fuel cells), trolley  buses, trams, trains, aut omated shuttles and micro -mobility vehicles. Diversity is one of  the keys for resilience   - Promotion of “active modes”:  Active modes are the most resilient modes of  transportation. Walking and cycling do not require any supply of energy, connection to a  grid, informative system , or costly infrastructure.  A policy to promote walking and  cycling and to provide a dense network of dedicated infrastructures, greatly improves  the resilience of the mobility system , despite the limits of distance that are inherent  with active transportation.   - Increase in the use of shared vehicles and Mobility -as-a-Service ( MaaS ): This has mixed  effects on resilience. Anyone can have access to any vehicle in the sharing service, and  not only to their own vehicle, thus increasing greatly the resilience of the system. But on  the other hand, sharing and MaaS both rely on an information and communication  system which may be prone to a complete failure in case of extreme conditions, making  all the vehicles of the service unavailable. T he network itself can be a target of a hacking  attack. The system can be made more robust by increasing the redundancy and security  against cyber -attacks of the communication and information system that regulate the  availability of the vehicles. Diversity and redundancy can be increased by assigning the  shared vehicle service to several independent operators, so that economic failure or  cyber -attacks on one operator will not cause catastrophic failure of the system.   - Increase in the use of automated, highly connected vehicles:  The increase in the share  of highly automated and driverless vehicles will require that cars and buses be  connected through V2V and V2I communication systems. A failure in the  communication system may curb both the collective transport system and the individual  transport system. Automation and communication is one area where a strategy to  increase redundancy, robustness, and diversity is essential. The V2V and V2I  communication networks that are essential for highly automated vehicles ar e at risk of  being targeted by a cyber -attack. Automated vehicle systems also require a large  number of highly skilled personnel. The system can be made more robust by allowing 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               81    the possibility for a human driver to take manual control of an automated vehic le in  case of failure, and for the vehicle to function in the absence of communication.  Redundancy and diversity can be increased by allowing different communication  protocols, acting together. Training the personnel locally is essential to mak ing the  system robust against lack of the adequate skills. The security of the communication  networks is also of the utmost importance (robustness).   - Change of the urban shape to a compact and dense model, with mixed -use  neighborhoods: The change of the urban shape is a long term proposition as the  development of a city takes place on very long time frames. However, a compact city,  with mixed use neighborhoods is the solution that best accommodates the reduction in  the need to travel, while increasing the utility and ef fectiveness of active modes of  travel. For these reasons, a compact and mixed city is by all means the city shape that  allows for the most resilient transportation system. A resilient city will provide various  alternative destinations (redundancy); differe nt types of places to carry out daily  activities (diversity) and the possibility to reach them even in the case of a catastrophic  failure of the transport system (robustness).     PROPOSALS   Key Topics   The Third Industrial Revolution Internet of Things platfo rm can help Luxembourg shift from a  “fragmented, carbon intensive individual transport” to active mobility combined with  renewable energy and multimodal  transportation on a driverless road, rail, water, and air  Mobility Internet, achieving the “vision for 2050 .”   The Mobility team, gathering various stakeholders of the transportation and mobility sector,  has identified  several key priority topics. The topics and proposals have been grouped into 4  main subjects that are considered relevant in th e TIR scenario. These subjects are:   1. Shift towards emissions -free vehicles.   2. Shared transport in a multimodal environment .   3. Digitalization as an enabler.   4. Limiting/revisiting the need for mobility.     To effectively achieve the objective presented in the “Vision 2050,” it is essential to embed the  interventions in a broader systemic frame. With this in mind, Luxembourg will need to engage 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               82    in six fundamental fields of action:    Infrastructure : move away fr om heavy investments aimed at solving private car  contingent problems  and continue investing  in infrastructures that change the way  people move.    Technology : boost the technological changes that will best increase the efficiency of  mobility, in terms of energy use, as well as space occupation, safety and emissions.    Cultural shift : actively promote the onset of a new cultural mindset that includes new  mobility paradigms and new logistics expectations.    Pull + Push policy : fiscality is one of the tools with  which the authorities can leverage  the behavior of persons towards a better mobility. Other policies, such as administrative  and supply policies are particularly effective to shift behavior to sustainable mobility in  the long run.    Urban planning : urban pl anning and transport planning are so thoroughly entwined,  that they should be considered but two faces of the same problem: how people stay in  places, and how they move from place to place. In particular, planning of public spaces  cannot leave active mobil ity aside.    Global policy:  no country is isolated and a small country like Luxemb ourg cannot plan in  isolation from its neighboring countries , especially in regard to mobility. Luxemburg will  need to reinforce the  coordinat ion of  its actions with those of the neighboring EU  countries , and at the same time, require that these countries acknowledge its plans and  actions.   The specific transport strategies and measures consist of a mix that combines modern  sustainable initiatives and  innova tive interventions. The proposal s include  a redefinition of the  framework in terms of Mobility -as-a-Service . A rich multimodal offer , including car sharing, car  pooling , cycl ing, walking and other public transports as well as innovative transport sy stems, all  integrated via a comprehensive data system to produce and deliver a service  to support and not  to impinge on  the individuals’ daily plan of activities.   In the implementation of transport measures, it is important to account for the dynamic  evolution of the system (i.e. how the demand will be distribute d among the alternative modes  available and how this will change over years). This dynamic evolution is s omething to be taken  into consideration during the definition of the detailed plans.   The trio of innovations in transport and mobility – composed of electrification of the power  source, automation of driving and wayfinding, and sharing of vehicles – is fun damental to reach  the objectives of the Third Industrial Revolution in transport. The mobility system, as it is  organized today, has a number of  inefficien cies. One of its greatest inefficiencies is its massive  reliance on fossil fuels, with enormous negat ive effects on energy waste, pollution and GHG  emissions. Inefficiency also comes into play from relying heavily on privately owned individual 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               83    vehicles, which travel nearly empty and spend over 90%  of their time standing still, often  occupying valuable spa ce in crowded city centers. A further inefficiency comes from reliance on  a human being for driving and wayfinding. Humans too often are not adequately informed,  leading to poor  decisions and errors. Last, but not least , unnecessary travel  – a  consequence  of  the car -centered Second Industrial Revolution social organization – represents another major  source of inefficiency. These aspects of inefficient mobility will be dealt with in this chapter, and  solutions will be proposed.     1 Shift Towards Emission -Free  Vehicles   The current system for the mobility of persons and goods is almost totally reliant on fossil fuels,  especially within urban areas. This reliance derives mainly from the abundant availability of  fossil fuels as a relatively cheap and convenient e nergy source, the presence of a well developed distribution network and the lack of truly competitive alter natives. The use of fossil  fuel results in very low energy efficiency, not higher than 25%, and the production of high  quantities of noxious pollutan ts, especially fine particulate matter and nitrogen oxides, as well  as CO2 and other greenhouse gases, not to mention noise.   Electric motors can achieve 3 -4 times the energy efficiency of thermal motors, do not produce  any local pollution or GHG emissions , and produce less noise. If they are powered by  renewable, non -pollutant sources, pollution and GHG emissions can be eliminated completely.  Even if the applied technologies are more expensive and less convenient than those associated  with the use of fossi l fuels, the global advantages of the electrification of mobility are so  numerous that it justifies the shift to the new Third Industrial Revolution mobility.   Several trends are converging to ensure a speedy transition into a new mobility era:   -  The exponential decrease in fixed and marginal costs of renewable energies   -  Other similar initiatives in Europe in favor of e -mobility ( Norway, NL, France )    - The advantage of a small -sized country with short -distance commutes, favoring electric  vehicl es   -    Increased access to solar PV energy (e -battery use)   A recent Bloomberg study on e -mobility calculates that in the mid -2020s, EVs will become  cheaper in their total cost of ownership (TOC) than conventional vehicles.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               84      Evolution of the global ele ctric car stock, 2010 -15   [Source: iea, Global EV Outlook 2016, page 4]       Purchase incentives and market shares for BEVs and PHEVs, 2015   [Source: iea, G lobal EV Outlook 2016, page 16]     Alongside with active mobility, the shift to electric is key in the t ransition towards clean  mobility and moving transports to near zero marginal cost. Luxembourg should take its size and  flexibility, as well as its strength in setting the regulatory framework rapidly as an advantage,  and should promote the e -mobility techn ology. This includes electric passeng er cars – both  owned and shared , electric bikes, micro mobility, public transport as well as last -mile logistics.  In order for the TIR vision to reach the goal of a 100% renewable energy fleet by 2050, it is  recommended that all related new registrations in the country are electric from  2025 onwards.  Overcoming the two main barriers to e -vehicles (EV) adoption – namely the strong purchase  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               85    price gap versus conventional vehicles and range anxiety – will require further actions in  Luxembourg in the long term.     1.1 Technical   When approaching th e question of electric vehicles, it is key to establish a clear distinction  between individual cars, public transport, and freight transport (last -mile, long and very long  distances). Each of these aspects represents a different challenge. Deploying electr ic cars is the  most challenging intervention, because of the number of vehicles and the infrastructure  required. Trucks and public transport, in turn, pose a challenge because of the size and weight  of the energy storage (batteries). The electric bikes (pe delecs) technology is the most mature  and widely accepted by the public.   1.1.1 Battery vs. Hydrogen electric power supply.   There are two mainstream technologies today to store on -board and retrieve the energy  required for electric traction: batteries and hydro gen gas coupled with fuel cells (HFC). Both   technologies  prese nt advantages and disadvantages. However, the widespread availability of  battery electric vehicles and charging stations compared to the marginal existing offer of highly  priced hydrogen powered  vehicles, as well as the lack refueling infrastructure and high  production costs of hydrogen, all lead to a clear advantage of the battery stored solution in the  short to mid -term.    1.1.2 Batteries as a power supply for electric vehicles.   Lithium Ion batteries are technically consolidated, relatively cheap, widely available, efficient,  safe and reliable to use. The existing electricity distribution network can serve as a “fuel  distribution network”, without requiring building a wholly new n etwork and removing most fuel  tanker trucks from the streets.   Unfortunately, the energy den sity even of the best batteries  is very low compared to that of  fossil fuels: it takes on average 40 -90 kg of Li -ion batteries to store the energy equivalent of one   litre of diesel fuel . Even accounting for the higher efficiency of electric motors, in order to  obtain a range of 500 km, a car would need to carry more than half a ton of batteries and a bus  would need nearly three tons. Technological improvements in bat tery technologies can reduce  costs and increase public acceptance of EVs. Price is predicted to reach slightly over 100  euros   per kWh over the next 15 years, which is less than half of the cost today. New innovations for  batteries in the form of larger cap acity, less weight, and smaller size will contribute to the  falling costs of battery technology. Although  constant progress is being made in this area, the  current state of the technology prevents the use of batteries in larger vehicles such as trucks 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               86    and buses. Moreover, specific attention should be given to the sustainability of the batteries  themselves.   In addition, batteries require a much longer recharging time than what is needed for the  refueling of fossil fuel. This means not only a radical change of habit by users (no more casual  refueling, but planned ones), but also the need for many more recharging points, located  mainly at home, but also at parking lots and exchange stations. However, since the average  daily distance travelled in Luxembourg by the majority doesn’t exceed 60km, the range offered  by most of the existing electric cars, (around 100 -120km) is already sufficient.   At the same time , two major technological innovations will become mainstream : inductive and  dynamic charging (charging wit hout plug) and highly automated driving. With the combination  of these two technologies , new  EVs can charge themselves by driving autonomously to a free  inductive charging point nearby. As soon as highly automated driving is established, inductive  charging  systems will be standardized and interoperable and these two technologies will  become more and more affordable.     1.1.3 Hydrogen as a power supply for electric vehicles.   At present, hydrogen is a much less widespread technology fo r automotive use than batteries   due to the disadvantages  that were discussed in proposal 1.1.1 and therefore, at the moment,  hydrogen vehicles have not yet been identified as an immediate priority. However, there are  many advantages to hydrogen vehicles. On -board hydrogen tanks are only  slightly heavier than  fossil fuels tanks, and refueling is almost as quick. Hydrogen could replace fossil fuels, requiring  only a slight change in driving habits by the users. Thanks to its high energy density, hydrogen   could also be suitable in the long -run as a zero -emissions fuel for long distance trucks and  buses.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               87      Comparison of various parameters (Source: B. Schoettle and M. Sivak, University of Michigan 86)    1.1.4 External power supply for electric vehicles.   Electric public transport powered by an exter nal source already exists in the form of  trams and  trolleybuses . Once the network is connected to wind and solar power sources, these modes of  public transport  immediately become zero -emissions and zero GHG mobility.   Although the technologies to power electric vehicles described above all have advantages, their  features quite clearly show that they can be specialized for different types of vehicles:   1- Battery electric power for personal cars, micromobility vehicles, city busses, short distance  trucks, e -bikes and e -scooters;   2- Hydrogen coupled with fuel cells for long distance freight vehicles; not priotized at the  national level, this technology should be considered at the regional or European level;   Long -distance logistics, below 1000km, the needs of which  are not satisfactorily met by rail  solutions, could benefit from strong cooperation with neighboring countries on alternative  fuel based solutions (“Future transport fuel” platform. Cf. energy pillar), given that the key  transit question cannot be solved only in the context of Luxembourg; A different approach  is taken for very -long distance freight (above 1000km) for which rail presents sustainable  and economic advantages;                                                            86 See: http://www.greencarcongress.com/2016/02/20160201 -umtri.html   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               88    3- External power source (overhead wires  or on -ground power taps ) for public transport  (trams and trolley busses) independently or as a complement to on -board power source.   4- Biodiesels also can play a role in aviation.   Given Luxembourg’s small size and relatively short commute distances, electric personal  vehicles will be a feasible choice f or the residents, without the problem of insufficient range.  Many commuters will also have access to recharging facilities in their homes, allowing for night  recharging. Commuters who reside in different countries may encounter more difficulties in  shiftin g from fossil fuel vehicles to battery electric vehicles, especially if the diffusion of  recharging stations is not extended to neighboring countries.     1.2 Business Model Innovation (BMI)     1.2.1 A fast and smart charging infrastructure program   To address the range question, it is essential to install a dense network of smart bidirectional  charging points  and pre-equip any new building  with charging facilities. Since battery electric  vehicles require significant time to be recharged, the rechargi ng points cannot be placed only  along the routes like refueling stations, but must also be located at sharing stations, parking  spots, in parking garages, and also in residential areas for night charging. Since one fast  recharging point can serve only 1 -2 vehicles per hour, compared with 10 -20 at a fossil fuel  station, their quantity must be accordingly higher.   The build out of charging stations will take some time and should begin with the densest urban  areas, where the limitations of electric vehicles are  less evident and their advantages more  pronounced.  It should be noted that Luxembourg recently outlined a plan to install 800  charging stations with two charging points each by 2020. The public charging infrastructure  provided by these 1,600 charging poin ts (3,7 - 22 kW) is a positive step in  promot ing electric  mobility and reduc ing range anxiety. However, these public stations should be accompanied by  the installation of stations in every new residential and commercial building complex.  It is also  key to  drastically increase the number of reserved parking facilities with charging facilities as it  will reduce range anxiety and represent an additional advantage for EV users.   In order to enable long distance trips with electric vehicles, fast charging infrastructure (> 50  kW) should also be installed on highways and Luxembourg should prepare for new dynamic and  inductive charging technologies.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               89    EV charging must be smart. This means  avoiding a scenario with all  EVs c harging at the same  time. The charging, communication and billing infrastructure must be further developed and  established to enable and force smart charging.   1.3 Public Policy Measures   There is much uncertainty in the time needed to obtain a substantial upt ake of EV . So far, with  the exception of electric bikes,  EVs have faced extreme difficulties in developing into a mass  marketed product, and all past predictions of future demand have forecasted a faster market  penetration than what has occurred. The price  of the vehicle, the short travel range, a dearth of  recharging stations, and consumer skepticism (see for example results from the recent  European Green eMotion Project ) have all led to slow EV penetration of the market . 87  A number of paths are available to win over consumers to the new EV mode of transportation,  including:   - Providing the right information about how EVs work and contrast the spread of negative  information, especially when not accurate (such as the famous “ra nge anxiety”).   - Allowing individuals to make their own experience, building trial programs where citizens  can test the EVs for a given period.   - Building specific programs to help individuals understand to what extent their daily  routine will change due to t he use of the EVs and how they can restructure their routine  efficiently.   - Favoring leasing programs  that reduce the risk of not being able to sell the used EV and  allow individuals to make a less risky personal experience, eventually combined with a  servic e to exchange with another ICE car for longer trips.   - Establishing an interdisciplinary taskforce of officials from government, the business  community, and academia (including MEC, MDDI, DSO, ILR) to identify regulatory  proposals. Items for consideration should include standardized accessibility of charging  points, new buildings pre -equipment obligations, energy sent back to the grid, and new  revenue and business models, etc. Infrastructure needs should be a priority,  and new  legislation  should be considered, allowing new vehicle registration only for emission -free  vehicles from 2025 onwards.   - Ensuring sustainable electric batteries. For a truly sustainable EV developement, the  entire environmental life cycle should be considered for elec tric batteries. Circularity  should be encouraged as well as development of bio -based batteries through public private partnerships. (cf. circular economy)                                                            87  See: h ttp://www.greenemotion -project.eu/   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               90    - Establishing a “demand report” for public charging stations in urban and suburban areas  for the next 10 years as a basis for EV infrastructure development within the country.   - Assuring the standardized accessibility of charging points by providing the necessary  regulations. Access could be provided by NFC, Passports, credit card or by QR -code.   - Developing a roadmap on charging infrastructure along highways and promoting its  implementation by regulation or incentives if needed.   Technical innovation will lead to the rise of e -mobility over the next five to ten years. The price  of EVs will become increasingly reasonable, and even cheaper than that of conventional cars  from mid -2020 onwards. Therefore , Luxembourg should take its size and flexibility as well as its  strength to quickly establish the regulatory framework to work in its favor.      1.4 Financial Measures     1.4.1 Subsidize the purchase price of EVs.   To ensure an EV purchase price at the same level of that of conventional cars from the mid 2020’s, aggressive incentivation is necessary to address the cost barrier in this early stage of EV  development.  During this t ransition period, a significant subsidy should be given until the  purchase price for EV becomes competitive with fossil fuel powered cars.   In 2017, t he government will intr oduce a tax refund of 5, 000 euros for zero emissions cars  (Battery electric and fue ll cell hydrogen cars) and will also reevaluate taxa tion of company cars   to favor  the shift  to zero and low emission vehicles. A different taxation based on emissions will  be applicable  for leasing cars and will take into account three main categories: 100% electric or  fuel cell hydrogen vehicles, diesel and hybrid diesel, as well as petrol and compressed natural  gas ( CNG) engine.88 Diesel vehicles will be penalized compared to electric o r gasoline cars .  These new incentive measures introduced in 2017 will be a good starting point. However , a  more drastic game -changing measure is recommended: an ambitious incentive scheme  whereby EV purchase price does not exceed the price of traditional c ars. In the short run, new  fiscal instruments taxing polluting vehicles and incentivizing emission -free vehicles have to be  put in place following the bonus -malus approach (fiscally neutral and polluter -pay principle). In  order to avoid an export market ba sed on subsidy arbitrage, it should be on the condition that  the owner will not sell the car within a defined period or mileage. The incentive could be tied to  investment in renewable energy systems within the country. Energy suppliers could offer “EV  electricity” based on RES, and EV buyers could be bound to use it.                                                            88 See: www.reforme -fiscale.public.lu  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               91    Similar subsidies can also be extended to companies and to cross -border commuters , after  deducting any similar benefit they may receive in the country of residence. Subsidies can  include a redu ction  or elimination of purchase tax, vehicle tax, and/or a subsidy for the  purchase. Consideration should also be given to a tax favoring emission -free vehicles. This  system can be complemented by a per -usage tax.     1.4.2 Incentives for E V Infrastructure .   In general, subsidies for private charging infrastructure are not needed, but they could support  and encourage smart grid readiness:    An additional incentive of 500 euros could be provided for private charging points if they  are “smart grid ready” and controll able by the grid operator. These charging points  should be capable of reacting to price fluctuations and to Big Data coming from the  energy management system of the house / company.    An incentive could also be provided if a Photo Voltaic system is installed  close to a  charging point is powerful enough to  at least meet the electricity demand of the EV.     1.5 Educational     1.5.1 Public Information campaign for EVs.   A public information campaign for EVs  is planned for the beginning of 2017 when the new  incentive program starts and the first stations of the public charging infrastructure are erected .  The campaign should continue  (with updates depending on the evolution of the market) until  the goals are re ached. The campaign should aim to eliminat e misconceptions about EVs (i.e.  majority of people do not need high range)  and to show the positive aspects of e -mobility in  terms of pollution avoidance, noise reduction , and health.  A campaign should also be ru n to  educate people on when and how to use intelligent recharging.     2 Shared Transport in a Multimodal Environment: the Rise of the Commons   One of the main phenomena that characterize the Sharing Economy in the Third Industrial  Revolution is the rediscovery  of the commons as a form of governance. The success of the  commons resides in the fact that nobody knows how to administer a community better than its  own members. The rise of the commons presents a great potential in the transport fields,  notably in tran sport logistics which is the core of the economic system of a community.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               92    Thanks to the Internet of Things platform, logistics operators are discovering the opportunity to  abandon individual management of the logistics chain in favor of collaborative netwo rks, a  common standardization of the processes and protocols, and a common network of  warehouses. The opportunities reside mainly in the significant improvements in transport  efficiency, especially in terms of load factors, itineraries, inventory in wareho uses , and unsold  goods brought about by minimizing congestion across the logistics value chain.   The rise of the commons also includes the transport of passengers through the proliferation  of  vehicle sharing systems , where usage prevails over ownership . With an increase of the traveling  population by 85% in Luxembourg by 2050 and an objective not to increase the number of  individual cars in the country, it is necessary to pursue important invest ments  in the  “commons” solutions , where mobility is offered  as a service on a usage basis, as opposed to a  one-off selling of a vehicle that is owned . An enhanced multimodality, where car sharing and  car pooling are highly promoted, is central to this seamless mobility equation.   New forms of Third Industrial Revo lution mobility also bring back to life the public commons,  with the rediscovery of the value of the streets and squares and, in general, of the public spaces  and public things. During the last century, the public square deteriorated with the expansion of  the road systems for private vehicles. The rebirth of a public transportation system not only  reduces pollution and energy consumption, but also frees up more space for the expansion of  pedestrian zones  and proper cycling infrastructure.      2.1 Technical     2.1.1 Enhanced multimodality .   In the governmental mobility strategy ( MoDu ), an array of P+R sites and multimodal hubs  (named in French "pôles d'échanges")  has been established in order to guarantee modal  interchange between personal cars and transit services. Bus lines services have been identified  to convey transport demand to the railway from the nearest territory. Further , express bus  lines have been ide ntified in the corridors where rail services are not present. In Luxembourg  City, a connected network scheme, based on radial and circular connections and the new  tramway network, has been identified as an alternative to the current scheme based exclusivel y  on radial connections. The success of these strategies strongly depends on several factors  regarding both personal and group transit. The following technical ac tions are suggested :   Offer a variety of mobility services in addition to connections to public  transports. Car   pooling, e lectric car, e lectric bike (including the new system "Bring your own battery" 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               93    that will be soon promoted in Luxembourg) and bike sharing areas (especially in  Luxembourg City) could  be designed with charging stations that will be directly supplied  by solar energy harvesting technologies on rooftops. Even if managed by different  operators, all these services should appear to the user as being part of a single system,  with integrated payment service, coordinated information system, s ame graphics and  platform.    Avoid single -function interchange stations designed exclusively for transport use. They  should provide other services such as professional meeting facilities, parcel delivery  lockers, and grocery delivery . These services  will con tribute to make the intermodal  infrastructures a lively place and add value to the overall travel experience. A  multifunctional interchange should also ensure personal safety and security with  adapted surveillance.    Provide a high quality pedestrian and cy cling infrastructure: walking and cycling are  a  necessary complement of public transport. There is plenty of evidence that people are  more willing to walk  or cycle, even  over longer distances, if the environment is safe,  pleasant, direct and well -connected .89   Development of ICT in order to realize informed travel, communicate the best travel  solutions in real time, facilitate the interchanges, promote the use of shared systems,  and increase the reliability of the system as a whole. As foreseen by the MoDu,  multimodal hubs ("pôles d'échanges") will be built througout the country to facilitate  the shift between the different modes of transportion (train, tram, b us, cycling, car  sharing, etc. ) by offering real -time traffic information, modern and clean facilite s and  additional services such as shops.     2.1.2 Implement multimodal last mile solutions.   It is difficult to act in a short time on the urban structure implementing a more balanced density  and land use for the city. With this in mind, it will be important to co ntinue to implement a  flexible and modern transport system (last mile solution) able to increment the capillarity of the  public transport and bring the citizens near to their final destination.   This system can be realized through the implementation of personal transit  (public transport  able to satisfy personal travel) that collects inhabitants of  suburban and rural areas and  transports them to specific intermodal points  that are  well-connected with the economic center                                                           89 There is ample consensus that quantity and length of pedestrian trips are very sensitive to the quality of the  pedestrian environment. See for example Jan Gehl: “Life Between Buildings: using public space” Island Press  2011; Jarrett Walker: “human transit ” Island press 2011; http://humantransit.org/2011/04/basics -walking distance -to-transit.html ; Jeff Speck: “walkable city” North Point press 2013.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               94    by means of efficient, frequent and reliable mass public transport services  (see section 3.1.3).   Personal transit can also be  achieved  via good intermodal nodes that connect the mass public  transport services with bike lanes, car sharing systems and so on.   Last mile systems can exploit trans port automation technologies able to adapt the transport  supply to the transport demand . The se systems  can also employ  simpler  shared compact  electric vehicles that users can pick up and drop at station points distributed over the territory.  To be efficien t, this type of system requires a high development of ICT solutions for the  management of the shared vehicles and the booking system.   Last mile systems must be able to satisfy personal travel and be ecological, sustainable and  compatible with the urban fab ric. This type of system can be realized using electric micro  vehicles (e -quadricycles, e -scooters, and e-bikes) or traditional bikes that can be picked up at  dedicated stations near to both the collective transport system and the final destination. This  type of system allows travelers to reach destinations five times more distant from PT stops,  than  the ones reachable by walking.

Public transport is more “energy efficient” than the private automobile. Compared with  a car transporting 1.3 passengers ,90 a 90 -seat diesel bus with 23 passengers on board28  uses 3 -4 times less fuel per passenger km. This also results in 70 -75% fewer CO2  emissions;   2. Public transport is more “space efficient” than a private automobile. A person riding a  bus occupies, on average, 6 -10 times less space than a person travelling in a priva te car.   Transferring a percentage of people from cars to buses, even adopting today’s “dirty”  technology, will achieve similar results in terms of CO2 reduction as will replacing the same  percentage of fossil fuel cars with electric cars. Furthermore , bus es allow a significant saving of  urban space.                                                            90 Average value for L uxemb ourg, source Eurostat 2002.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               96    The electrification of public transport must accompany the increase in supply of vehicles and  routes in order to manage the increased demand. If public transport is totally electrified, and  electric energy com es from renewable sources, the results can be striking. Under the same  assumptions made above, compared to fossil fuel cars, buses will result in:   - A reduction of 80 -90% of energy consumption;   - A reduction of 100% of GHG emissions;   - A reduction of 80 -90% of urban space occupation.   Such values cannot be approached by a policy based solely on a shift to electric cars. Since the  electrification of public transport will require significant investment and a long implementation  time, hybrid vehicles offer an interi m solution. The technology is available and very little  infrastructural changes are needed. The RGTR already has a bus fleet of 21 hybrid buses and 12  plug -in hybrid buses will soon be added. The City of Luxembourg recently announced its plans  to use plug -in hybrid busses and the City of Differdange plans to use four electric buses. Such  efforts should continue to be pursued,  as plug -in hybrid and full electric buses can significantly  reduce both energy consumption and GHG emissions compared with diesel bus es. Moreover,   most models of these buses can travel for short distances in full -electric mode, eliminating  pollution and reducing noise.     2.2.2 Pull Measures   Among the “pull” measures, special importance should  be given to the pr omotion of public  transport and active modes:   - Promote the image of public transport, treating the transport system as if it were a  commercial product that needs to be sold. Marketing and promotion is highly  valued for  commercial products, but it is often undervalued when it comes to promoting “social”  innovations. The public transport system should convey a sense of belonging, not only for  those who use it, but also, and most of all, for those who don’t use i t. It should be felt as  part of being citizens of a city (in this case, a country ); Public transport should project  a  precise and recognizable image of itself.   - Make public transport simple to use, recognizable and fully interconnected. Quality must  be high  and consistent throughout the services offered. Interchange between modes  must be easy and convenient and walking to and from public transport must be planned  as a part of the service, applying to it the same levels of quality, accessibility and ease of  wayfinding that characterize the rest of the service. The nationwide introduction of real  time departure data for all of the different public transport means by the end of 2017  (“mLive”) marks a further step towards seamless intermodal mobility.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               97    - Provide com modities that allow users to make the most out of travel time: Wi -Fi internet  connection  in transport hubs , outlets  to recharge mobile phones, availability of seating  and of small tables, conveniance stores at major stations , etc. There is no reason why a  bus or a tram should offer a worse quality of service than an airplane or a train.     2.2.3 Push Administrative policies.   This policy refers to a set of measures that coercively limits totally or partially non -sustainable  transport means. Recommended measures in this line are:   - Banning polluting vehicles from entering certain parts of the city  by designating marked  off Limited Traffic Zones  or Pedestrian Zones . This can be done permanently or at certain  times; the ban can be imposed on all vehicles or on some categories, like ICE vehicles or  pending emission level.   - Regulat e parking  by eliminating parking spaces along roads , provid ed that the liberated  space wi ll not be used to incre ase the car lanes but, rather, be reserved for bike lanes  as  well as bus lanes and space for pedestrians.     2.2.4 Push Supply policies.   Supply policies refer to interventions on the supply side, either vehicles or infrastructures.  Among the supply policies that can be used as “push” measures , we recommend:   - Reducing the capacity of the streets  – especially in urban contexts  –, eliminating parking  space along the road, and using some of the car lanes to build reserved bike lanes and/or  reserved bus lanes. This is a key/strategic action to achieve the established goals.   - Re-distributing public space in a more “democratic” way. A person in a car occupies as  much as 15 times the space of a person doing the same trip on public transport, and 35  times the space of a pedestrian. Space use in cities tends to reflect this inequality: more is  allocated to cars, taking it away from other uses. Reserving lanes for  public transport or  walking can effectively increase the capacity of a street to carry people.  It is of great  importance that the available public space be redistributed equitably between public  transport and active mobility to ensure the quality of service needed to convince people  to change their habits.   It is important to note that limita tions and prohibitions can be unpopular if not well -supported  and justified. In particular, they have to be combined with new modes of mobility that are more  attractive to users and more efficient to use. Social persuasion can help reach the objectives of  a less wasteful system of mobility.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               98    2.2.5 Multimodality   A strong multimodality is the keystone of the transformation of a traditional transit system into  a modern, connected one where rail -based lines define a strong backbone system both at  the  national (railway) and city level (LuxTram). This reflects  the vision of the government strategy  (MoDu) , which is currently being implemented: the tramway network in Luxembourg City,  reorganization of bus lines at the national level, the multimodal hubs ( “poles d’echange”), the  increase of P+R facilities, and the reassessment of active mobility. This will make change of  transportation modes more seamless and promote multimodality.      2.2.6 Promoting car sharing an d car pooling   Car sharing and carpooling both hav e a strong potential to reduce traffic . For every car shared,  15 cars are eliminated from production and from the roadways. In addition, the shift from  ownership of vehicles in markets to access to mobility in car sharing networks dramatically  reduces both  the fixed and marginal cost of mobility, making it a more attractive alternative for  individual transportation. Car sharing is experiencing an exponential growth curve, especially  among the millennial generation,91 and demand is projected to increase five -fold by 2020.   Car sharing contributes to using parking space more efficiently, whereas car pooling aims to  increase the number of people sitting in a car. Both modes have a high potential in Luxembourg  of ensuring that the space allocated to individual tr ansport is used more efficiently. The existing  car sharing services in Luxembourg (for instance Carloh in Luxembourg City) have to be  expanded in a way that offers a viable alternative to owning a car for residents or commuters.   The long -term potential of car sharing is intrinsically linked to automation technologies, where  such a service will be ordered on a digital platform and driverless vehicles will provide door -todoor transport service.     2.2.7 Integrate Electric mobility with car sharing   Combining car sha ring with electric vehicles will not only reduce the number of cars on the  road, but also eliminate pollution and CO2 emissions, dramatically transform ing the nature of  mobility in Luxembourg.                                                              91  Car sharing grew worldwide from 350,000 membe rs in 2006 to 5 million in 2014 ( the forecast that it will grow  worldwide up to 26 million people in 2020 is then then realistic). On the other hand all forecasts of EV market s  have been wrong.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               99    2.2.8 Development of a collaborative platform in the logistics fiel d.   Luxembourg is geographically positioned to play a key role in the establishment of an EU -wide  digital, automated, and GPS -guided Transportation and Logistics Internet.  To this end,  Luxembourg can play a key role in helping create a collaborative network among operators in  Luxembourg and neighboring countries to begin sharing a common logistics space (fourth pillar  of the Mobility Internet) that could reach the ports of Belgium and the Netherlands, as well as  the main logistic hubs in France and Ge rmany. Cooperation can be implemented at two levels:  Short -distance logistics collaboration (for city center delivery grouping) and Long -distance  logistics collaboration for continental transport.   Attention should be placed on the separation of the Interna tional flows (88.2% of the total flow  – Eurostat 2016) from the national and urban flows. The latter, in particular, require the  implementation of a City Logistics process for optimizing the logistics and transport activities in  urban areas in order to red uce the number of vehicles on the streets by using appropriate  vehicles in terms of size and sustainable motorization (e.g. electric cargo -bikes), implementing  reverse logistics, optimizing the load factor, and defining appropriate time bands available for   the drop off and pick up operation outside the commuting hours.   Multimodality plays a central role in the development of a “transport -as-a-service” common  platform. This concept stands as a turning point in the logistics field, where private vehicles and  private management of logistics chains become increasingly abando ned for a multimodal  flexible travel capacity and collaborative networks. Multimodality should be highly promoted,  with the creation of the multimodal logistics platform in Bettembourg. Efficiency gains will also  be achieved through optimized use of passen ger transportation means. Such a flexible solution,  hosted on a transports -as-a-service  single -entry platform will be managed through  collaborative networks with the prerequisite to unify regulations, standards and services.      2.3 Financial     2.3.1 Subsidize public transport modes.   Since the benefits stemming  from sustainable mobility benefit the whole of society, the  government should play a key role in incentivizing the transformation into a Third Industrial  Revolution transportation and logistics network. The budget for subsidizing public transport  services can be derived from fiscal policies addressed to tax the externalities produced by non sustainable transport systems (space occupa ncy, pollutions, and GHG emission).     
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               100     3 Digitalization as an Enabler   Investment s in digitalization, smart infrastructures , and standard protocols of communication  will facilitate the build out of the Internet of Things platform.     3.1 Technical     3.1.1 Build a comprehensive transportation data system.   A continuous flow of Big Data on transportation and logistics, made possible by the Internet of  Things platform, will take Luxembourg into a new era of digitally mediated mobility. Vehicles in  the network will be able to send and receive data in real time, communicating with other  vehicle s, the infrastructure, and buildings, allowing drivers and passengers to adapt journeys to  real-time traffic conditions. Big Data will also facilitate mobile bookings, and optimize the  scheduling of pick -up and delivery of goods. The increasing capacity to  generate Big Data and  mine it with analytics, creating algorithms and apps to increase aggregate efficiency and  productivity is a radical change in mobility that will need to be carefully regulated. Resiliency  will need to be built into the Mobility Inter net to secure data and avoid cyberattacks.   3.1.2 Boost autonomous  cars  Autonomous personal cars, and taxis will take longer to appear than autonomous public  transport, since they will have to be able to travel on any road, in any condition of traffic, with  very little assistance from “intelligent infrastructure .” The first level of  automation is introduced   as “driving aids” in which the car is still controlled by a human driver . Today, some vehicles are  technically  capable of following  a specified route, as well as mak ing autonomous decisions such  as changing lanes when overtaking another vehicle, or braking in an emergency. This is defined  as “level 3” automation by the SAE . Full automation, not requiring the presence of a driver on  board, is defined as “level 5”  automation. The widespread availability  of level 5 – fully  autonomous vehicles – will likely be a reality  after 2030.   Fully autonomous vehicles in an experimental context are already in play  in Singapore and  Pittsburgh . However , since these are experimental projects, a driver is still needed to supervise  the vehicle and take control if needed. Companies like Google expect that in the next five to ten  years , level 5 vehicles could be deplo yed. However, a scenario where most vehicl es on the  roads will be autonomous will likely take place  after 2030 .  All the preceding levels of automation will only remain driving aids where the presence of a  driver is still needed and will no t therefore have a substantial impact on how cars are used.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               101     Only “level 5” has the potential to revolutionize daily mobility habits by substantially improving  public transport and alternative means of transportation . On-demand bus or taxi services could  be offered in areas and during times that are currently consi dered  non viable. So far, the  success of car sharing solutions relies on the proximity of nearby car sharing stations or free  floating cars , whereas car  pooling depends of drivers willing to make detours and share rides  with others. Fully autonomous cars c ould bridge these shortcomings  by focusing on the  demand of the users.       Driverless vehicles are expected to improve traffic flow (Source: US Department of Transportation)   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               102       Levels of automation as defined by SAE   3.1.3 Boost autonomous public transport   The automation of public transport is an essential component of the build out of an automated  Transportation and Logistics Internet for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Driverless public  transport will reduce both the fixed and marginal cost s of providing pu blic transportation and  help ing expand services to low -demand areas and during off -peak times. This innovation marks  the conjunction of electric, automated, connected and shared mobility.   Automated public transport is already technically viable and exists  in select urban areas around  the world. Given Luxembourg’s dense commuter traffic, the country should be a first -adopter in  introducing automated public transport across its transport corridors.   The launch of an autonomous public transport system (a.k.a. rapid Personal and Group Transit  System), offering flexible on -demand and ultimately door -to-door mobility solutions is  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               103     therefore highly recommended with pilot  demonstrations  in selected areas  com mencing as  soon as the technology warrants.       Testing of fully autonomous, driverless shuttle buses in Bordeaux, 2015   Project - Launching an automated people mover system for group and personal transit   The true potential of AV lies in a shared e -AV system that can potentially rede fine public transit  connections . A recent study on Urban Mobility System Upgrade s shows the potential impact of  shared self -driving cars on city traffic. Depending on scenarios, the large -scale uptake of this  kind of vehicle  fleet could lead to a reduction of 8 to 9 out of every 10 cars in a mid -sized  European City.92 First -mover countries are already testing this technology, as illustrated  recently by the joint venture between SMRT (Singapore) and 2Getthere to operate automat ed  vehicle system s in the Asia Pacific region. Luxembourg should be a major player in the new  transport system.   The automated system, operating like a horizontal elevator, brings a high level of flexibility to  the transport sector. A specified network can  combine on-demand personal rapid transit (up to  6 passengers), group rapid transit (shuttle for 20 to 25 passengers) and freight rapid transit.  One of the major benefits of this technology is that it can address the need for on -demand  transport and door -to-door services. To be consistent with the sustainable mobility strategy,                                                           92 See: http://www.itf -oecd.org/sites/default/files/docs/15cpb_self -drivingcars.pdf   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               104     the fleets should be fully electric. According to the OECD study, in this scenario the impact on  fleet size due to recharging time is minimal (+2% only).       Driverless transit system (Source: 2getthere)   Expected results are:   - Reduced number of individual vehicles in city centers (this system will contribute to  increase share of public transport : a shift in modal split ; public transport to reach 40% by  2050)   - Road safety expected to improve significantly   - A solution that can be optimized for last -mile delivery with a combination of passengers  and goods transports (a flexible platform to develop urban reverse logistics through 2 flow optimization and packing stations)     3.1.4 Boost automated freight transport   Beside rail solutions, freight transport can also benefit significantly from automation, very likely  earlier than personal cars. Moreover,  freight vehicles tend to travel on specialized corridors,  from fewer origins and to fewer  destinations. This  solution – that can be designed at the  regional level – makes it easier to implement “equipped corridors” where freight vehicles can  travel in platoons, or take advantage of a high level of automation, enhanced by efficient V2V  and V2I communication. Within the loading -unloading areas, the freight vehicles can even shift  from partial to total automation and maneuver on their own. Also this technological change,  like for autonomous buses, is likely to occur, possibly within the next five years.    Daimler has already outfitted 300,000 of its trucks with sensors that are serving as mobile Big  Data centers, monitoring traffic conditions, weather, warehouse availability , and other  information in real time. Daimler is making the Big Data availa ble to businesses, along with  customized analytics, algorithms, and apps, allowing enterprises to continuously increase their  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               105     aggregate efficiency and productivity while dramatically reducing their marginal cost and  ecological footprint across their value chains. Daimler is among the prime movers in shifting  their business model, in part, from merely selling trucks to also managing logistics on the  emerging Mobility Internet.      3.1.5 Exploit the use of Drones   Drones will increasingly be used to deliver goods in the coming years. However, potential safety  concerns will likely limit payloads to below 50 kg. The potential of drones should be fully  explored and Luxembourg could be a testbed for drone technologies. A priority could be given  to remote locations, before expanding their use.   Given Luxembourg’s commanding presence in the satellite sector and its strong economic  support to developing countries, new opportunities should be explored for utilizing drones in   emergency relief missions.       Drones used for relief operations and last -mile delivery       3.2 Business Model Innovation   3.2.1 Redefining “Mobility as a Service’    Mobility as a Service is a new approach where each particular journey is offered as a service on  a usage basis, as opposed to a one -off selling of a vehicle that is owned. This is strongly linked  to the rise of the Sharing Economy, where access  prevails ov er ownership.   Mobility -as-a-Service is made possible by combining and managing all transport services and  trips on the same digitalized platform – starting as early as 2018. This unique gateway to  mobility should be based on a robust real -time and predicti ve data management system able to  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               106     provide users tailor -made transport solutions based on individual needs – with the objective of  enabling users to enjoy a seamless on -demand travel experience.   The Mobility -as-a-Service digital platform will be set up in collaboration with all private and  public transportation stakeholders and in cooperation with neighboring countries for a “Grande  Region” approach that will eventually unify standardization, regulations, ticketing schemes, and  booking services across the E uropean Union.    The current mobiliteit.lu  platform is limited to domestic bus, train , and pedestrian paths  and  does not yet include other mobility options. However, in 2014, the Verkéiersverbond  introduced a new RFID public mobility card called  the “mKaar t.” In addition to public transport  tickets , the card is designed to give access to all other modes of mobility services. Secured bike  parks  – “mBox” – can already be accessed via the mKaart and  beginning  in 2017 , the mKaart  will also enable access to park  and ride facilities and 1,600 charging points. This  is a very good  basis for a comprehensive platform.     Such a system is currently evolving with the  mobiliteit.lu  and will stand as a centerpiece of the  Mobility Internet. Information provided will show all public transport solutions as well as  P+R  availability for private car transport, bikes and e -bikes availability, walking times, ride sharing  options, booking ser vices and road user charging, and dynamic pricing for parking , depending  on peak / off -peak hours. In the long run, this could also serve as a platform where people can  share their autonomous car and generate revenues. The single -entry system is a response  to  the multiplication of sharing platforms that are part and parcel of the new mobility solutions. It  should be set up in cooperation with all private and public transportation stakeholders and with  neighboring countries for a “Grande Region” approach tha t will eventually unify  standardization, regulations, ticketing schemes, booking and services across the European  Union.    For the Mobility -as-a-Service system to work properly , it is important that :  - A single travel document must be available for mobility t hroughout the region and for  every mode of transportation .   - Information about all available  transport means must be easier to access and understand.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               107         Mobility -as-a-Service , a promising concept       3.2.2 Invest in automation   In the long run, automation leads to new revenues: driverless car owners will be able to share  their vehicle on a single platform. This reduces the cost of car ownership since the vehicle is  rented when not used by the owner.   Automated mobility  can yield several advantages:    Make traffic safer, reduce the risk of congestion and reduce the overall space occupied  by cars, parked or in motion ;    Offer greater mobility and benefits for an aging population and disabled persons;    Make public transport cheaper and more available. This means that public transport can  become available also at low demand times, and in low demand areas, where traditional  public transport is not convenient;    Open up new scenarios for shared vehicles. Electric autonomous vehicles can repo sition  themselves and pick up new passengers, or autonomously reach a recharging point  when needed. This is akin to a taxi service, but without taxi drivers ;    Create new job opportunities in the automotive, technology, telecommunication , and  freight industry, thereby generating economic development.     3.2.3 Develop intelligent logistics chain.   To make an efficient transition, the Cluster for Logistic needs real time logistical data and traffic  conditions provided by a strong ICT infrastructure and know -how (where Luxembourg is a  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               108     leader in Europe) together with Connected Intelligent Transport Systems (C -ITS) made up of   highly automated vehicles able to communicate with each other, with the infrastructure and  building s, as well as with operators.  Real time communication provides  the best vehicle choice  and road path according to the traffic flows, request to shipment, load factor, and warehouse  storage capacity.     3.3 Regulatory   3.3.1 Norms for automation   The practical implementation of autonomous vehicles is limited by the absence of laws that  allow them to travel on public roads. Given adequate laws and regulations, it will be possible in  the next ten years to extend this technology to larger and faster p ublic transport vehicles,  travelling on dedicated lanes , with  some controlled interference with traffic (for example:  crossings with activated traffic lights), and autonomous truck platooning  in controlled  environments.   The current scenario is characteriz ed by a lack of adequate norms, but the recent Declaration of  Amsterdam, signed by the EU Transport Ministers on 14  April  2016,93 aims at removing the  legislative barriers that today represent an obstacle to the roll out of vehicle automation.   Autonomous ve hicles will require a significant amount of data to be exchanged: from vehicle to  vehicle, from/to infrastructure, and in some cases, from the vehicle to the control center and  vice-versa. The concerns  are mainly  liability, privacy of data, security agains t hacking, and  robustness against transmission errors or gaps in the capacity of transmission channels.   However, this is not different from similar issues regarding wireless data transmission such as  Wi-Fi transmission of sensitive  data, mobile phone communication , and the communication of  airplanes with land control centers. Protocols already exist that guarantee a high level of data  privacy, security , and error control.  These protocols need to be standardized and be made  applicable across continental  land masses.                                                                    93 See: https://english.eu2016.nl/documents/publications/2016/04/14/declaration -of-amsterdam  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               109     3.4 Public Policy   3.4.1 Dedicated taskforce for AV’s transition   Consideration should be given to the establishment of a dedicated taskforce to expedite the AV  transition for Luxembourg.   The creation of a cluster for autonomous transport ation  will prepare the Grand Duchy for the  advent of autonomous driverless vehicles. The dedicated taskforce “smart mobility ,” gathering  public and private stakeholders (MEC, MDDI, R&D, LuxInnovation, Cluster for Logistics), will  addres s various aspects of automati on (cf. Smart economy pillar) . In this context, the future  Luxembourg Automotive Campus is a strong asset and will house research and innovation  activities of several companies within the automotive sector.   The taskforce should focus on the following areas :   - Attract companies for testing of connected and automated driving technologies in cross border corridors   - Conduct pilot studies on dedicated sites ( e.g. Belval  Automotive Campus)   - Explore regional truck platooning projects  and drone technologies opportuni ties    - Cooperate with other countries (i.e. BeNeLux) on larger proof of concept   - Study the ethical issues around the automation of transport, including privacy, data  security, open access, etc.     3.4.2 Implement a pilot test   The uptake of autonomous vehicles will require some transition time. The city authorities are  key stakeholders in the transition to automated vehicles. Initially, a negotiation will be  necessary to implement potential restrictions to normal traffic in order to  set up experimental  projects for automated vehicles on specific corridors.     3.4.3 Implement robust resiliency standards.   A robust resiliency monitoring program able to track traffic conditions for passengers and goods  flows, the capacity of the infrastructure, and energy demands that can be used as a database to  model prediction scenarios for massive disruptions to the system  brought on by catastrophic  climate change events and or  cyber -crime and cyberterrorism should be provided.   Vulnerability assessments should be performed based on the traffic models to predict the  effects of system components failures (infrastructures, ene rgy supply, communications), taking  into consideration the interdependencies between the various critical infrastructures and  components. In the s hort -term, mid -term, and long -term transport plans should be updated 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               110     based on the monitoring of the mobility m atrix and vulnerability assessments, and identify the  “resilience” strategies and measures needed to adapt to potentially catastrophic disruptions.  Strategies and measures must be identified , in cooperation with key stakeholders , in  Luxembourg and in colla boration with neighboring countries. New resiliency standards and  operations will need to take into account not only the technical aspect but also the social and  governance aspects of massive disruptions to the system.      3.5 Educational   3.5.1 Informative campaign for automated vehicles.   The issue of public awareness and acceptability is an important one. In the initial phase of the  implementation, the personal or collective  “discomfort” experienced by  passengers towards  riding in a driverless vehicle is often point ed out as a limit to the uptake and effectiveness of  driverless  technology. This is also evident in all surveys that address this matter: the majority of  persons interviewed prefer to have an attendant on board, even if only with the role of  “supervisor .”94 However, the convenience of the system can easily overcome this initial  suspicion. Many autonomous transport systems are already operational all over the world:  automated metros; automated people movers; Group Rapid Transit such as Morgantown and  Rotterda m; and Personal Rapid Transit such as in Masdar City and Heathrow airport. These  systems are widely accepted and used , and very little “discomfort” is felt among their current  or potential users.     4 Limiting/revisiting the need for mobility   Luxembourg City comprises 40% of the Grand Duchy’s  employment , even though it only  represents 18% of the population. Difficult and lengthy commutes are therefore a  key concern ,  and companies are already finding it difficult to attract talent from neighbori ng countries  because of traffic congestion during the commutes. Intelligent urban planning and transport  planning that promotes dense and mixed use settlements is a critical priority. This new  approach will promote active mobility and short distance travel  between home and work.   The digital revolution and augmented and virtual reality environments will increasingly  decouple work activity and the traditional working space (often the office). Telework and                                                           94  B. Shoettle, M.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               111     remote working spaces will increasingly limit mobilit y demands in the future, and should be  factored into future transport planning to prevent the  underutiliz ation of the  transport system.     4.1 Technical   4.1.1 Transit oriented neighborhoods   Transit oriented neighborhoods should prioritize the following areas:   - Urbanization should be promoted along strong  corridors and areas with the best public  transport offer (cf “plan sectoriel transport”) ;  - A coherent, safe and attractive network of dedicated cycle routes should be put in place  covering the entire territory of the Grand -Duchy, with a particular focus on fast and  comfortable cycling access to work places , schools,  and transport hubs including  train  stations, tram stops and P+Rs.  Cycling paths are currently a priority  in Luxembourg.  However, cycling is seen more a s a leisure activity than a transport means.  Fast cycling  lanes should be straight and equipped with sensors that will prioritize bicycle over car  users. As of today, cycling trips in Luxembourg are far fewer than car trips . But, with half  the trips short er than 5 kilometers, there is ample potential for improved cycling  infrastructure at the local level , enabling the  shift from motorized trips to cycling,  especially at peak hours, when the average speed of individual cars is no higher than that  of a bicyc le. For car trips longer than 5km to be replaced by bicycle trip s, comfortable and  direct cycle routes , imposing as few stops as possible , are key.    Expected results of the prioritization of transit oriented neighborhoods are numerous: fast  lanes will extend the range of bicycle trips, limit congestion on highways, reduce accidents,  increase safety, reinforce multimodality, increase flexibility, promote healthy mobility and wel lbeing, and ultimately increase productivity .     4.2 Business Mode l Innovation     4.2.1 Integrate transport policies , strategic regional planning,  and Urban Policies   The intensive use of the private car in Luxembourg is attributable to many factors  including  Luxembourg’s  outmoded urban development plan (urban sprawl, trans -border  commute) and  the accompanying centralization of economic life. It is very difficult for a traditional public  transport system to serve areas with low density of population living in detached housing 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               112     neighborhoods (last mile problem). This is the mai n reason why a scattered territory generates  car use dependency.   An integrated transport -land use policy must be planned in coordination with the  implementation of transport solutions. This can only be achieved through closer cooperation  between municipal and national authorit ies. The emphasis is on “an intelligent urban planning”  as the centerpiece of a new mobility paradigm.     4.2.2 Telework   According to  STATEC figures (2010), 7% of employees in Luxembourg work from home while  75% of employees have no flexibilit y. Teleworking can significantly reduce employee  commutes. Some studies95 show that in principle:   - a twice -a-week teleworker theoretically red uces commute trips by up to 40% for a typical  5-day a week worker;    - a telework program that reduces 10% of vehicle trips may reduce 15% of vehicle mileage  if participants have longer than average commutes;   - neighborhood telework centers reduce commute vehicle miles travelled by about 50%;   This should be combined with attra ctive infrastructure for active mobility and emission -free  vehicles between the home and the neighborhood’s telework center, making automobile use  superfluous.   However, telework does not always reduce total vehicle travel unless it is implemented in  conjun ction with other travel reduction strategies. The real impact is often much lower because  people who telework are likely to substitute the travel to work with other non -work related  travel (Rebound Effects). For Telework to provide significant vehicle trav el reductions it must be  implemented in conjunction with other travel demand push and pull strategies.   The following measures need to be pursued in order to develop Teleworking:   - Encourage flexibility with new adjustable working hours or days. In the case o f  Luxemb ourg, two forms  of teleworking  are suggested  (to the extent possible) :                                                           95 Dennis Henderson and Patricia Mokhtarian (1996), “Impacts of Center -Based Telecommuting on Travel and  Emissions: Analysis of the Puget Sound Demonstra tion Project,” Transportation Research D, Vol. 1, No. 1, pp.  29-45.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               113     o 1 day/week: no home to work trips (particularly important for Luxembourg  commuters) leads to a potential reduction of  traffic by  20%, which has a huge  effect on traffic congestion and related negative externalities . Considering  specific constraints for crossborder workers, a first step could be to reach this  target for all Luxembourg residents with compatible functions and enclined  to  change their habits in the short -term. Discussion at the regional level should  seek harmonization between neighbouring countries.   o Telework during peak hours.  Some employees can already adapt their starting  and end time in -between predefined time slots . Further flexibility and especially  the possibility to work at certain days directly from home should be allowed .  While this solution avoids congestion, it does not reduce total travel.   - A dedicated taskforce should be created, with the aim of adopting new legislation on  telework; its members will discuss various aspects such as  fiscal and  social  benefits  issues, data privacy,  and flexibility with adjustable working hours or days.   - Develop co-working spaces in outskirt areas (close to borders as a first stage in  Luxembourg to avoid current taxation and social protection barriers) and build adequate  infrastructures that will allow for remote work, videoconferences, etc . (cf. the New  World of Work). These new office spaces should be located near multimodal transports  hubs for flexibility.   - Create a prototype in targeted areas with work spaces (from the municipalities or  companies pooling) and subscription cards (per hour fees).     4.3 Regulatory     4.3.1 Integrate transport policies and Urban Policies   The shift to a digital Third Industrial Revolution mobility, transportation, and logistics  infrastructure that is interconnected and highly efficient will need to be accompanied by a  regulatory regime that en ables all of the facets of mobility to operate together seamlessly.  The  regulatory regime needs to prioritize the following:   - Ensure easy access to public transports and develop transit options through multimodal  infrastructures. Switching between transpor t modes should be effortless.   - Encourage active mobility through pedestrian pathways and bicycle lanes with  connections to external cycling paths . Active mobility should also be encouraged through 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               114     the promotion of  shared spaces (cf. shared space best pract ice in Bertrange) and car free  areas in dis tricts during specific hours and around dedicated spaces like schools  as well as  through the  install ation of  parking spaces  at the periphery of the district with a high share  of parking slots reserved for EV or shared cars.   - Foster car sharing and pooling with dedicated facilities (drop -off areas, reserved parking  slots) .   - Encourage e -mobility through reserved parking slots and  compulsory charging stations in  all new urban projects with a strong focus on multimodal hubs.   - Prepare for shared AV deployment – traffic  lanes reserved for public transport should be  opened  and adapted to automated group transit vehicles , if capacity is  available .     4.4 Financial     4.4.1 Fiscal policies: Internalization of externalities.   The main external costs of transportation are: public health costs due to a lack of physical  activity, space use, pollution, generation of GHG, accidents and depletion of non-renewable  resources. Each of these can be taxed, and the revenues will replace the external costs, which  are, by all means, wasted resources. The revenue from externality taxation can be used to  improve the sustainable mobility system. This will provid e clear and visible proof that the  taxation serves the purpose of improving the mobility systems alternative to the private car. In  particular, we suggest that:    Space occupation can be taxed through parking fees and urban access fees.    Pollution, GHG emissi ons and depletion of non -renewable resources can be taxed  through a combined tax scheme: per -km car use fees, and taxation on fuel, taxation  dependent on emissions.    Accidents are more difficult to tax directly, since the taxation should address “risk”  and not the actual occurrence of a crash. For this reason, the external cost of  accidents is better addressed by regulatory measures. However, it must be clear that  the cost of crashes is a high component of the external costs of mobility, and  therefore, the “internalization of externalities” should be addressed in an operational  plan.   In 2013 , environmental taxes in Luxembourg amounted to 2.15% of GDP (the lowest since  2000)  – below the average of EU -28 levels  (EU, January 2016) . The 92.6% of the total is 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               115     represented by Energy taxes. The revenues from taxation of transport (excluding fuel) are low  compared to other EU countries (0.15% of GDP compared to an average of 0.49% GDP).  Following the recommendations from the OECD:   - An envir onmental fiscal reform is needed to reduce incentives for workers  to reside far  away from their workplace .   - Luxembourg should consider creat ing a Sustainable Mobility Fund that will facilitate the  funding of sustainable transport initiatives. It would follow the internalization of  externalities principle and would act as a three -fold financing tool:   o Finance additional specific incentives targete d at users (managed by the Ministry  of Finance)   o Subsidize innovative municipalities on mobility developments (managed by the  MDDI)   o Contribute to financ ing start -ups and innovative projects including on -field pilot  tests and experimentations as well as rese arch and development works  (managed by the MEC)   - In the phasing out period, where fuel tourism will still be important, it is recommended  that a substantial part of fuel tax revenue be dedicated, on top of the Climate fund, to  the specific financing of sust ainable mobility projects. A percentage of the 2 .7 billion   liters sold revenue in Luxembourg could be directed to this Sustainable Mobility Fund.  The sum allocated to this fund has to be considered , keeping in mind the cost of  negative externalities which are estimated to be at least 1 to 3% of the country ’s GDP.  Potential synergies will be sought with the Luxembourg Sustainable Development  Finance Platform (cf. Finance).  The Luxembourg Sustainable Mobility Fund could be  created in the very short term.    - As stated above, new fiscal instruments taxing polluting vehicles and incentivizing  emission -free vehicles have to be put in place in the short run, following the bonus -malus  approach (fiscally neutral and polluter -pay principle).   - Circulation taxes are mor e directly linked to emission s. A per -usage tax, providing extra  funding, represents a particularly efficient tool for taking into consideration the actual  vehicle usage.   All these fees and taxes are extremely unpopular and pose economic planning problems . For  example, higher fuel taxation will reduce or eliminate “fuel tourism ,” which is a source of traffic 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               116     and externalities, but also a source of revenues for the country, representing about 75% of fuel  sales in Luxembourg, and accounted for an earning of a lmost 1 ,500 euros per resident in 2008.   In saying that, we are aware that it is difficult for Luxemb ourg “to reform any tax unilaterally, as  cross border impacts on the economy can be significant. Germany and France, which border  Luxembourg, can absorb sma ll changes which would significantly affect the Luxembourg  economy in their considerably larger territories.”96  Another important  obstacle  is that the high income level of Luxembourg  makes the demand for  cars less elastic to the costs. For this reason, we also recommend that further regulatory actions  be taken in the form of “push” measures that limit the non -sustainable transport modes .     4.5 Educational     4.5.1 Encourage new usages and behaviors – the cultural shift.   A cultural shift is underway  right now in all developed countries : car ownership is not a  paramount objective for Millennials , and “high powered car” ownership is no longer a powerful  status symbol as it was only ten years ago. This cultural shift will be pushed by new “symbols”  whic h could come from IT technologies, and could be aided if the new transport solution and  the technologies will be able to approach the levels of comfort, flexibility, reliability and  security of the cars. All the transport systems and related technologies m ust always take into  account the needs of the people. If alternatives to cars will be able to do that, we believe that a  cultural shift will be easier.   Pursuing the vision of transitioning  from a “traditional” carbon -intensive and inefficient  transport system to a “Mobility Internet ,” combined with active mobility, is “revolutionary” and  not just incremental, and requires an equally ambitious cultural shift to make it happen. It is  importan t to stress that a change in cultural values means a change in individual preferences.  The cultural shift should be promoted immediately and aggressively in order to match the  speed of meaningful change brought on by vehicle sharing in driverless electric and fuel cell  transport on an automated intermodal Mobility Internet. For example, a public education  campaign should be launched around the benefits of sustainable modes of transportation in  reducing environmental pollution and improving personal health , with a focus on the four main  drivers in people’s transport choice: speed, comfort, cost and safety .                                                            96 Study on Assessing the Environmental Fiscal Reform Potential for the EU, published 15 January 2016. Page 449.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               117     Social  security is also a consideration  that must be taken into account. Today a car represents a  comfortable and protected environment and is often not c omparable to the situation at a bus  station or cycle lane, especially during rush  hours. Technologies able to guarantee personal  security must be integrated alongside the new transport systems.    Multimodal journey calculators have to be put place in order to easily compare the real -time  travel times, prices and costs of the different modes of transportation.  This is planned for  mobiliteit.lu for the beginning of 2018.   Importantly, companies play a central role as they can strongly encourage a shift in beha vior:  the aim should be to favor a mobility budget (as opposed to car benefits)  as well as systematic  company mobility plan, where key drivers in users’ transportation choice s can be addressed.      4.5.2 Implement easy demos   Communication programs and regulatory measures are critical to ensuring a transition to a  Third Industrial Revolution mode of mobility. While this is important, we should also remember  that even here there is a need to change individual habits, and this takes time. It is done by  reinforcing po sitive  user  experience with the new form s of mobility.   Providing the transport system for free for a while is typically important, though empirical cases  show that after the incentives are over, many people will go back to the old system. So it might  not b e enough. A push measure on the car, combined with the “pull” incentives, is crucial.   Encourage  the young generation  through reinforced mobility school programs and gamification  for the teens.  Many of the actions included in this plan will take a long time to be fully effective,  and the people who today are in their teens will be the ones who can fully benefit from them.  But they must start to day to become aware of the need  and the adv antages  of this  transformation.     4.5.3 Lighthouse project - Deploying a mobility testing and demonstrating corridor .  A corridor for testing and demonstrating new mobility solutions could be built in Luxembourg.   This corridor would provide an experimental field for testin g various mobility modes and  technologies.  Solar road sections, energy -harvesting paths, and solar roof systems supplying  public lighting or e -bike charging stations are just a few of the systems that will require field  testing . Since the emphasis is put on fast cycling roads (see section 4.1.1),  this new generation  testing corridor could be potentially also used as a fast cycling lane.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               121     BUILDING S  OVERVIEW   Luxembourg will need to transform its stock of  140,000 residential buildings and 5,000  commercial and industrial buildings and its  existing infrastructure into smart, digital  buildings and networks across an Internet of  Things platform  to usher in a Third Industrial  Revolution. The country projects  a population  growth , increasing from roughly 560,000  people in 2015 up to about 1 million  inhabitants in 2050.  In effect, Luxembourg is potentially the fastest growing population in the  EU-28 through the year 2050. By comparison, the EU population is expected to grow  by only  0.1% annually over the years 2013 to 2050, while Luxembourg would  grow 1.8% per year over  that same time horizon. The potential increase in population could provide an opp ortunity to  build out and scale up a new generation of neighborhoods and buildings and accompanying  infrastructure .   Buildings connected to the Internet of Things infrastructure will play an increasing role in data  handling, green power production, energy storage, and act as transport and logistics hubs to  manage, power, and move economic activity in a smart Luxembourg.  The build out and scale  up of  a new generation of neighborhoods and buildings can advance aggregate efficiency,   increasing productivity and reducing marginal costs and ecological footprint, making  Luxembourg one of the most competitive and ecologically sustainable commercial spaces in the  world.   First, buildings will have to undergo deep retrofitting operations, to  seal their interiors,  minimize energy loss, and optimize efficiency. Second, smart Internet of Things technology will  need to be installed throughout the interior and exterior space surrounding buildings. Buildings  will become nodes  connected to every oth er building across the infrastructure to allow families,  businesses, and communities to monitor Big Data flowing along the value chains and use  analytics to create algorithms and apps that can increase their aggregate efficiency. Third,  renewable energy ha rvesting technologies – solar, wind, geothermal, and biomass – will need  to be installed in and around residential, commercial, and industrial sites to generate green  electricity, heat and cold for immediate use within the buildings or sale back to the ele ctricity,  heating and cooling grid. Energy storage technologies, including batteries,  hydrogen fuel cells, Co-Chairs Pitt Mathieu and Vanessa Tarantini,  assisted by Nico Steinmetz, and the  Luxembourg Building  Working Group;   Gerhard Stryi -Hipp (Fraunhofer ISE), Claude  Lenglet (Co -European Director, TIR Consulting  Group LLC), and Jeremy Rifkin, TIR Consulting  Group LLC  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               122     and thermal storage tanks, will need to be installed alongside the renewable energy harvesting  technologies to store intermittent green energy for us e or sale back to the energy grids to  ensure a reliable supply of energy. Fourth, electric charging stations will need to be installed in  or alongside buildings to power electric vehicles for use on the automated, GPS -guided and  driverless passenger and fr eight vehicles of the Transport and Logistics Internet.   The return on investment in energy efficiency and energy savings takes place over relatively few  years, after which the owner or renter enjoys a reliable stream of savings on its energy cost for  deca des. Studies show that retrofitted energy efficient buildings that serve as digital nodes  enjoy a higher market value, higher rents, and higher occupancy rates. A typical study of  residential buildings across France shows a 40% increase in market value for  buildings receiving  the top energy performance certificates .97   More importantly, transforming every building in Luxembourg into an Internet of Things data  center, green micro power generating facility, energy storage site, and automated  transportation hub  greatly enhances their economic value by providing a range of high -tech  services that dramatically increase aggregate efficiency and productivity and lower marginal  cost in the managing, powering, and moving of economic activity. The increase in productiv ity  and reduction in marginal costs, when amplified by thousands of buildings that become nodes  linked to an Internet of Things infrastructure, not only appreciates the value of the building  stock but also advances the economic growth of the Luxembourg eco nomy.   Retrofitting every residential, commercial, and industrial building is a herculean task, but also  an essential pre -requisite for transforming the economy into an Internet of Things Third  Industrial Revolution. Insulating existing and new buildings, installing new, more efficient HVAC  equipment, and introducing highly efficient LED lighting, all generate additional GDP while  increasing the aggregate efficiency and productivity of the buildings’ operations. The  introduction of an Internet of Things inf rastructure in every building and between buildings to  monitor and manage energy efficiency, while still nascent, is expected to grow exponentially in  the next few years as Luxembourg transforms its building stock into smart, digital nodes  interconnected i n vast digital networks.   Germany’s considerable  experience in retrofitting provides a metric for the job creating  potential in Luxembourg as it embarks on a nationwide retrofitting project. The German  Alliance for Work and the Environment is credited with the most ambitious retrofitting project                                                           97 Plan Bâtiment Durable. (2013).

Each one million  dollars of spending on HVAC  improvements generates 13. 3 direc t,  indirect, and induced jobs. Each one  million dollars of spending on LED lighting  creates 12.9 direct, indirect, and induced  jobs. Each one million dollars of spending  on Internet of Things technologies fosters  13.0 direct, indirect, and induced j obs.99  Most of the existing 145,000 buildings in  Luxembourg  will need to be retrofitted in  the coming decades. Luxembourg is  already gearing up to engage in the  largest retrofitting project in history. The  initiative will create tens of thousands of  new jobs while saving tens of thousands  of existing jobs in the manufacturing,  engineering, construction, and real estate  sectors.   Financing the transition of Luxembourg’s building stock to thousands of nodes that serve as  data centers, micro power generating plants, storage sites, and automated transport hubs, will  be financed and executed by a unique new business model called Energy Service Companies  (ESCOs) and a novel financial instrument known as Energy Performance Contracts, also called  Shared Savings Agr eements. ESCOs finance the retrofits of buildings, the installation of                                                           98 See: http://warming.apps01.yorku.ca/wp -content/uploads/WP_2011 -04_Calvert_Climate -Change -Construction Labour -in-Europe.pdf   99 Garrett -Peltier, Heidi. “Employment Estimates for Energy Efficiency Retrofits of Commercial Buildings.” Political  Economy Research Institute. 2011.

The owner or occupant gets a free ride and after the payback period  has ended, reaps the full value of the energy savings from there on. ESCOs generally include  energy audits, project design, financing, purchase of equipment, and op eration and  maintenance.   Given the steep curve in the growth of  the ESCOs market and Performance  Contracting, it is likely that this  mechanism, along with government  incentives, will play a critical role in the  conversion of thousands of buildings in  Luxembourg into Third Industrial  Revolution nodes to manage, power,  and move economic activity across a  smart green Internet of Thing s  infrastructure. In the new Internet of  Things era, everyone becomes their own  efficiency expert and chief productivity  officer, continually creating new apps to  improve aggregate efficiency across  their respective value chains.     STATE OF PLAY AND LUXEMBOURG VISION   The Luxembourg building stock is composed of 140,172 residential and semi -residential  buildings regrouping 227,326 dwellings. Luxembourg’s residential building stock consists  predominantly of single -family houses representing 82.9 % of th e building stock whereas  apartment blocks represent 10.9 % and semi -residential buildings 6.1 % of the building stock.100  The share of single -family homes in Luxembourg -Ville is about 21%, and in the other cities   between 52% and 76%.101 In 2010 , the average fl oor space was 129.9 m2 per dwelling.102                                                           100 See: http://www.statistiques.public.lu/catalogue -publications/regards/2015/PDF -06-2015.pdf and  https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/NEEAP_LU_EN.pdf   101 See: http://www.statistiques.public.lu/catalogue -publications/regards/2015/PDF -06-2015.pdf   102 Luxembourg energy efficiency action plan 2014, page 71    Fig. 3: Construction of a new office building in  Luxembourg City   Source: http://paperjam.lu/news/rtl -bientot -dans -sa-city  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               125     Almost half of the building stock was built prior to the 1970s , while 17.8 % was built after the  2000s. There are significant differences between building types. 72.3 % of semi -residential  buildings were  built b efore 1971 and the majority of t hose (52.3 %) were built even before  1945 , whereas this is only the case for 48.1 % of apartment blocks. For  single -family houses,  50.5 % were built before 1970 and 12.9 % over  the last 15 years. Apartment blocks are gaining  in im portance, so in terms of residential buildings built after 1995 , the proportion of apartment  blocks is greater than that of the single -family houses.103  Restoration or renovation of old buildings is more costly than demolition. Some 200  demolitions of reside ntial and semi -residential buildings have been registered between 2011  and 2013 the majority of which concerned single -family houses. Buildings built before 1945 are  the most commonly demolished (69.1 %) and buildings built after 1981 only represent 2.2 % of  demolitions.104    Current national non -residential building stock105  The statistical basis for non -residential buildings is less complete than that which exists  for  residential buildings. In particular, there is an absence of statistical data for the period before  1970.

The energy performance requirements from the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive  (EPBD) for new and existing buildings in both residential and non -residential sectors are fully  implemented. Among other measures, t he national law implemented:    a methodology to calculate the energy performance of buildings;    minimum requirements for new buildings, extensio ns and renovated building elements  of existing buildings;    the Energy Performance Certificate (EPC)   Since 2012, Luxembourg has mainly implemented:    a roadmap towards Nearly Zero -Energy buildings (NZEBs);    an obligation to indicate the energy performance of buildings in advertisements;    a timetable to reinforce energy performance requirements for residential buildings;                                                            106 Statec population census 2011, http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/population -emploi/rp2011/   107 “Implementation of the EPBD in Luxembourg Status October 2014”

Luxembourg is  gradually increasing the energy performance requirements of residential  buildings (primary energy needs of the building) and the thermal insulation requirements  (heating energy demand of the building). As of 1 January 2017 , the A -A standard, which has als o  been defined, in principle, as the NZEB standard , will become mandatory. NZEBs will be highly  energy -efficient buildings. For non -residential buildings, the energy performance requirements  were reinforced as of 1 July 2015, increasing from the D -D (prima ry energy needs and heating  energy demand) level required since 2011, to C -C level. The NZEB for non -residential buildings  is expected  to become mandatory from 1 January 2019 (the exact timeline and definition are  still to be determined ).  The first figure  below shows the timeline of strengthening energy performance requirements  for new residential buildings and the second one, the reduction of energy needs over time.           Building renovation   With regard to Article 4 of the Energy Efficiency Directive (EED ), Luxembourg is still working on  the final establishment of the national long -term strategy for mobilizing investment in the  renovation of the national stock of residential and non -residential buildings, both public and  private. In the Third National Ener gy Efficiency plan for Luxembour g, the development of the  energy efficiency of buildings in the case of renovation has already been reported.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               129     As part of the development of the final national long -term renovation strategy, surveys were  conducted by TNS ILRES in 2015 on behalf of myenergy  (www.myenergy.lu ), the national  energy agency, on household s’ attitude in relation to energy retrofititting in  Luxembourg, in  particular on planned housing measures like self -generation of electrical power (photovoltaic  system, micro cogeneration unit, etc.) or household s’ equipment with “Smart Home” solutions  for an intelligent control of heating and electrical a ppliances. (cf. “TNS ILRES – La rénovation  énergétique de l’habitat au Luxembourg - Volet Ménages )  Luxembourg also intends  to renovate 3% (4,000 m2) of the national buildings owned and  occupied by the central government each year.  An overview on the energy policies in  Luxembourg for residential buildings is given in  Fig. 4.     Common Vision for the “Building” of the Future   The working group “Building s’” approach focused  on building development as well as on urban  development. The group concluded that the slogan “ Smart, green and circular building in an  optimal shared and attractive district”  reflects the main characteristics of the building of the  future, whereas “IntenC ity” summarizes their vision of an urban concept. We live in a time of  digital revolution that is certainly changing the way we live and communicate and at the same  time making communication between thousands of things around us possible in a manner  never experienced before. However, compared to the terminology “Building as nodes ,” the  group foresees a more people -oriented place for the building in a mixed and attractive urban  setting and considers aspects such as proximity of things, circularity, sustainab ility and  ecological aspects as integral part of the process.   With regard to building development as well as to urban development, the group structured  the elements essential to realize the vision along the following categories: Green, Circular &  Sustainab le, Smart Technology, Energy, Information & Communication , and New urban  concept.   The ICT -based technologies will be used to plan and construct intelligent buildings and will  allow interaction between building operators and occupants to empower them with a  new level  of visibility and actionable information. Through optimized consumption and the ability to not  only produce energy but also to store energy, smart buildings will play a role in stabilizing the  grid. The connection to the grid will allow more fle xible use of energy. At the same time, energy  storage will become crucial for storing intermittent green energy for use or sale back to the  energy grids. Deploying on -site energy generation system s and being energy self -sufficient go  together with the aim of a smart building (such as small windmills/turbines , photovoltaic panels  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               130     and solar heating collectors, and micro fuel cells ). With regard to the energy sources, the group  concluded that energy so urces of the future will be renewable – mainly photovoltaic, due to the  increasing role of electricity in the energy mix. The role of electricity will increase and heat will  also be supplied by electricity even if geothermal energy will also play a role. I nstead of each  building being individually heated, whole districts (neighborhoods, cities , etc. ) are served by a  district heating network distributing renewable energy and waste heat.   Although the working group believes that “energy” certainly will guide t he concept of a smart  building, it is also the group’s approach to refocus on the homeowner/occupant and stress the  high quality of life that is largely dependent upon the construction materials  used . The “IoT” is  the data layer of a smart building , but ci rcularity  (design for modularity, flexibility, c omponent  and material recovery ) and sustainability aspects must be added on top. Building smart means  using the best available technology, yet at the same time it also means promoting good health  and a sound environment for the people who will use it. It seems important for the group to  add the concept of “noble functions of a building” which can greatly contribute to enhance and  support the implementation of the principles of circular economy. The group stres ses a focus  only on using circular materials and entire re -useable structural elements, so that the notion of  waste will completely disappear. The group brought up ideas such as including a rational  bioclimatic architecture and urban farming in the concept  of a building. Urban farming fits  perfectly within the cities of the future and intelligent buildings should incorporate the  functions of urban farms and greenhouses  to bring back agricultural aspects to the cities.   However, the competition for the use of  roof space between solar energy generation and urban  farming must be taken into account.   In order to achieve the construction of the building of the future, planning will become a very  important aspect. Reaching the “vision requires adding intelligence from the beginning of the  design phase through the end of the building’s useful life. ”109 Tools such as BIM (Building  Information Management) allow considering the approach through the complete value chain  from design to construction to dis -assembly and reus e of materials and elements. As of the  planning phase, smart rational buildings should be established and the actual building form  should change. Buildings should not only remain residential buildings but should become more  flexible and multifunctional. Ad ditionally, considering the fact that Luxembourg has many old  architectural buildings, the destruction of those buildings should be avoided in order to  preserve the cultural heritage. The aim is to become inventive with regard to retrofitting and  transform ing existing buildings into green power plants. With regard to the existing building  stock , the group supports retrofitting rather than  demolition  when it is more sustainable . Old  and new, historic and futuristic, should be combined by taking into account the “human” aspect                                                           109See:  http://www.buildingefficiencyinitiative.org/articles/what -smart -building?  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               131     and keeping the “beauty” of a building (reference Vincent Callebaut). The group supports that  retrofitting of existing buildings shall be promoted and developed to a maximum, without  introducing an obligation to retrofit but granting inc entives in a short time frame.   Luxembourg’s expected economic and population growth  as well as the country’s size, will lead   to dense urban and rural environments in the future , requiring careful analysis at the buildings  and urban development levels.  The group retained the terminology “IntenCity”  for the urban  concept of the future. The group does not only foresee the urbanization of the main cities of  the country, but considers urban development over the whole country (eco -neighborhoods,  cities, group ing of different municipalities, etc. ). These issues are also part of the new sectorial  plans for housing, economic activities and landscape.   “Inten” because a city should become  intense through attractive urban design and planning  strategies leading to  lively  public spaces that articulate the many different usages and users.  The concept of  IntenCity  will embrace  art and culture, individual initiative/shared responsibility,  as well as changes across time, age, old and new. Through a more collective spirit the q uality of  life of each individual could be enhanced. “IntenCity”  is an urban development vision that  integrates multiple information and communication technology (ICT) solutions in a secure way.  ICT is used to improve  performance , quality , and interactivit y of urban services, to minimize   costs and consumption of resources  and to enhance  contact between goverment and its  citizenry .  Smart and green building will be completely integrated in the “IntenCity”  of tomorrow. Instead  of considering only a building’s  “greenness” and “smartness ,” buildings will need to  be analyzed  within a much broader context by taking into account social, environmental and economic  factors including the consideration of the timeline: from construction to disassembly and new  assembly with the re -use of disassembled parts. Nature offers  us many  solutions to explore ,  and the city of the future shall be seen as a man -made human ecosystem. It is important to  focus on efficient and livable cities as well as economically, socially and environmentally  sustainable cities.   Preparing liveable and  sustainable cities will have to take into account the potential  catastrophic impacts that climate change will wreak on habitats and infrastructures.  We have  yet to engage a deep conversation on the question of building for “resiliency” on a planet  whose weather patterns are changing exponentially and qualitatively in a matter of decades  beyond anything experienced in the past 65 million years. In short, we need to begin thinking  about a concept of “liquid infrastructure” that can accommodate environmental  upheaval and  mass migration on a local and global scale. Like every other country, Luxembourg will have to  prepare a new generation of architects, engineers, urban planners, and ecologists in the 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               132     erection and deployment of "mobile infrastructure and habit ats" on a large -scale, similar to the  way refugee camps and front line military outposts are set up. In the future, resiliency has to  also include infrastructure and habitats that can be distributed, decentralized, and modular, to  facilitate dismantlement,  shipment, and reassembly in new locations.    We also need to develop a more sophisticated approach to integrating infrastructure, human  habitats, and living patterns with the complex dynamics that animate the evolution of natural  ecosystems, learning from  the approaches to short -term and long -term resiliency that evolve in  natural ecosystems as guides to future human development patterns. This will require focusing  greater attention on stigmergic self -organization, emergence, and complexity theory in  model ing the liquid infrastructures and habitats of the future.   An important step toward transforming Luxembourg’s building stock into nodes connected to  the Internet of Things platform is the development of education and training. Education and  training should  be implemented in all the education layers , and the basic education programs  of the future generations should consider specific courses  on energy strategy and “ IntenCities”   objectives.   The building sector is a core element of the TIR roadmap . Buildings a re responsible for 40% of  energy consumption and 36% of CO2 emissions in the EU.110 Buildings are durable  and play an  important role in the economy as investment and property. They allow privacy and define  public spaces between them and they are key elements  forming a city. In the past, buildings  often provided only a room to be protected against the weather, with low thermal and other  comfort. In the future, buildings will provide optimal  comfort through  intelligent and efficient  design and infrastructure as well as  ICT systems, which can read the needs of the occupants and  provide a comfortable environment. The buildings will be equipped with a high number of  sensors and intelligent control systems gathering data, which enable the HVAC system to  provide : fresh air at the right temperature depending on the oxygen demand ; perfect light  combining daylight and the light spectrum adapted to the needs of the occupants ; as well as  highly efficient use of heat, cold, and electricity, energy generation on the façades and the roof  via solar systems and an optimal connection to ICT services for entertainment, information,  communication, and education. Additional services include personal health assistance and  supplementary childcare support.   With the the Third Industrial  Revolution , the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is aiming to actively  prepare and stimulate the transformation process in the building sector. In 2015, the total  energy demand for heating was 5,723 GWh in the residential sector.111 Taking into account the                                                           110 See: http://ec.euro pa.eu/energy/en/topics/energy -efficiency/buildings   111 STATEC projection 2015. Delivered to TIR Consulting Group in January 2016.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               133     average  floor space and the number of dwellings, the heat demand was 194 kWh per m2 floor  space per year on the average. In comparison, the heat demand in 2014 in Germany was 149  kWh/m2, but with a significantly lower share of single -family buildings than in Luxe mbourg.   A key task is to reduce the energy demand for heating in buildings significantly. The  technologies and products for energetic refurbishment are available and numerous projects  prove that even a passive -house standard can be achieved by refurbishme nt. However, the  country is faced with a large  share of historical buildings, where  the protection of the façades  limits the possibilities of energetic refurbishment (at least at reasonable costs). In these cases,  GHG reduction must be achieved by providin g the heat with renewable energy sources (RES).  Between 2001 and 2010 only 18,330 refurbishments were carried out in residential buildings,  and only a part of them was energetic refurbished.112 Therefore, the energetic refurbishment  rate is below 1% of the b uilding stock per annum and must be more than tripled to refurbish all  existing buildings until 2050.   Another challenge for the country is the expected growth of the population up to about 1  million inhabitants by 2050, which means an increase of 80%. Assu ming that the trend of  growing living area per person and declining occupants per dwelling continues, the number of  dwellings and the living space will almost double. However, this development is also an  opportunity for the country, since for new buildings , from 2017 on, the Nearly Zero Energy  Building (NZEB) standard is mandatory, with an energy requirement of 43 kWh/m2/a primary  energy demand (incl. renewable energy). With almost half of the buildings being built according  the NZEB standard, the average s pecific heating demand will decline significantly. Assuming  that 40% of the single -family homes and 15% of the apartment buildings are historical dwellings  with very limited refurbishment possibilities, it can be calculated that a reduction of the  average heat consumption by 65% per m2 living area and of 33% for total heat demand can be  expected due to the high share of new buildings (see Figure 5).   The building working group provided a clear vision and is aiming for “Smart and green buildings  in an optima lly shared and attractive district .” As further described, the buildings will be green  and sustainable, using smart technologies,  and will be mainly supported by renewable energy  sources as part of a new urban concept. On the district level , an “IntenCity” provides an  attractive urban design with lively public spaces, art , and culture, and support s individual  initiativ es and shared responsibilities, while  integrating multiple Information and  communication technology (ICT) solutions in a secur e way.                                                            112 Luxembourg energy efficiency action plan 2014, page 70

Due to electrical storage capacities, buildings will stabilize the electrical grid. The  Working Group expects that the use o f electricity in buildings will also increase in the heating  sector and that geothermal  will be used in every district.   Buildings will be intelligent by using building information and modelling (BIM) technologies on  the entire chain from design, constructi on and operation up to disassembly and re -use of  elements and materials. This contributes to the aim of total circularity, where no waste is  generated in the construction sector, since only circular and re -usable materials are used.   Luxembourg is also emp hasizing the need to ensure a high quality of life in the future by  ensuring that buildings assist in providing a healthy and sound environment for the occupants.  The Working Group emphasizes that quality of life depends, at least in part, on the construct ion  material. A good building design  also requires abundant daylight and adequate sun protection .

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               136       The working group also highlighted the role of buildings in the TIR as nodes and service  providers in an Internet of Things infrastructure. Buildings will be zero energy or plus energy  buildings within a district/eco -neighborhood through:  optimizing the ba lance of efficiency  (insul ation of the building envelope); the passi ve use of solar energy via south -facing windows ;  the generation of electricity and heat o n-site on the façades and roofs;  solar energy, biomass  driven combined heat and power units (with gas motors or fuel cells);  and using heat pumps to  generate heat from renewable electricity.   The overall aim of buildings is to protect the occupants from the weather, noise , and bad air,  and to provide a healthy environment  which is well tempered, provides daylight and fresh air,  and enough space for people and goods. Buildings  will also provide a perfect connection to the  outside world by ICT for entertainment, information, communication and education. And  buildings provide  fresh water and facilities for disposal of waste, sewage water, etc. In addition,  urban farming is of growing interest and  could be a service provided in, on, or around buildings.

These features significantly impact  the social life in the district. Additional needs include access to shops, education, culture, and  jobs, all of which are very much influenced by urban planning. Buildi ng façades are the walls of  the public space and characterize it. In cities with large buildings, façades are often used for  advertisements and information and contribute to the lighting of the public space.   The construction industry is also an important b usiness sector. Buildings are often the most  significant forms of property people possess and the quality of buildings plays an important role  in their personal wealth. In addition, the construction process should be viewed as a high priority challenge, to  be addressed by the TIR roadmap using BIM tools to expedite high -quality  planning, construction, operation, refurbishment and dis -aggregation and reuse.   All these aspects of the building sector, which are shown in  Fig 6 , should be taken into account  by id entifying necessary actions as part of the TIR transformation process in the building sector.   The TIR proposals for the building sector focus on refurbishment of residential buildings, an  action plan for non -residential buildings, integral and sustainable concepts for the construction  sector, lighthouse districts, and resiliency.     Resilience for the Built Environment   Climate change is dramatically transforming the water cycles of the Earth, giving rise to  unprecedented winter snows, extreme spring floods, dramatic summer droughts and wildfires,  unprecedented heatwaves, and Category 3, 4, and 5 huricanes. The result is catastr ophic  impacts on human infrastructures and the built environment. Existing buildings in communities  around the world were not designed  to withstand these climate related events.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               139     Escalating environmental disruptions are now accompanied by the increased threat of  cybercrime and cyberterrorism aimed at shutting down critical infrastructure – communication,  electricity, and transportation – that could bring society to a halt, with dire implications for  communities around the world.   Cities, regions, and countries are just now turning their attention to the issue of resilience and  exploring radical new approaches to securing the built environm ent. Conventional policies  regulating the built environment are proving to be woefully inadequate in addressing the  disruptions. City planning is being rethought virtually everywhere. Securing buildings against  catastrophic disruptions will increasingly be come a key priority in ensuing decades. New codes,  regulations, and standards will have to be established for new buildings in every region, tailored  to local climate change risk conditions. Existing buildings will have to be audited and assessed in  terms of their resilience to the new realities caused by climate change and the increasing threat  of cybercrime and cyberterrorism. The retrofitting of existing builidng stock will become an  essential centerpiece in an era increasingly characterized by modes of resilience.      PROPOSALS   The following proposals are prioritized to implement the TIR roadmap in the building sector.   1 Stimulate innovative and deep refurbishment of residential buildings   1.1 Technical: Promote the use of standardized construction elements and methods   1.2 Regulatory: Establish legislation to stimulate refurbishment of buildings   1.3 Public policies: Involve municipalities and stimulate local refurbishment action plans   1.4 Financial: Encourage refurbishment of buildings by financial s upport programs   1.5 Establish and implement an action plan for refurbishment of residential buildings   2 Turn non -residential buildings into TIR ready working places and data hubs   2.1 Technical: Promote the use of standardized construction elements and meth ods  2.2 Regulatory: Legislate urban  context -adapted  density and high -rise construction   2.3 RDI: Develop intelligent façades for non -residential buildings    2.4 Build up the LUX TIR Construction Platform involving all stakeholders    2.5 Develop and implement a TIR action plan for non -residential buildings  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               140     3 Introduce integral and sustainable concepts in the construction sector   3.1 Technical: Develop and implement a national BIM strategy   3.2 Regulation: Develop a TIR building certificate   3.3 RDI: Introduce circ ularity with the development of a “material bank for buildings”   4 Build up “Intencity” lighthouse  projects   4.1 Technical: Demonstrate smart, green, and circular zero -energy districts   4.2 RDI: Strengthen the research sector for transitioning buildings and districts   4.3 RDI: Develop the University of Luxembourg as a TIR living lab   5 Create a Resilience Commissioner in charge of economic, societal and environmental  resilience     1 Stimulate innovative and deep refurbishment of residential buildings   Under the recent  building codes, newly constructed buildings in Luxembourg will be nearly -zero  energy buildings from 2017 on and be in accord with the TIR requirements in regard to energy  efficiency. However, additional actions are needed for existing buildings. Since  the majority of  existing buildings are residential, they should be the first to be retrofitted. The scale of  refurbishment should increase significantly each year and should involve deep renovation to a  high efficiency standard , since cosmetic refurbishme nts are not sufficient.   1.1 Technical: Promote the use of standardized construction elements and methods   The increased use of standardized construction elements and methods will stimulate the  refurbi shment of residential buildings  because they  reduce  costs, refurbishment time, and  disturbance of occupants of the buildings, while improving the quality of work, enabling a fast  increase of the refurbishment rate.   Standardization, at the same time, supports the introduction of circularity by making it ea sier to  reuse and recycle construction elements. But standardized can also mean the integration of  different functions in one element, e.g. HVAC components like air ventilation ducts in the  insulation layer of the building.   This technical concept should be  promoted by setting up a working group of all stakeholders  involved – architects, planners, construction companies, housing companies, governmental  representatives, etc. – to collaborate in the development of an action plan for standardized 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               141     elements, acco mpanied by commensurate regulations, incentives, financing, business models,  and R&D. The Luxembourg government and the energy agency should promote this concept in  their public relations work with owners of residential buildings.   1.2 Regulatory: Establish  legislation to stimulate refurbishment of buildings   The heterogeneity of the market makes it necessary to set minimum legislative requirements  on energy efficiency for existing buildings, taking into account the limited capacity to act by the  government, since it is regarded as an invasion of the owner’s property rights. However, there  are opportunities for the government to act (e.g. the German state of Baden -Württemberg  made it mandatory to use a minimum share of renewable energy sources for heating, if the  heating boiler is replaced). A combined approach of requiring building owners to reduce their  GHG emissions caused by their heating system by regulation while simultaneously motivating  them to invest in a deep refurbishment with incentives seems the mo st promising approach to  achieve the government goals.   1.3 Public policies: Involve municipalities and stimulate local refurbishment action plans   Municipalities are key actors in stimulat ing and support ing the refurbishment of buildings in  their jurisdicti ons. Therefore, the government should join forces with the municipalities and  incentivize them to develop and implement refurbishment action plans for residential buildings  as part of the TIR roadmap deployment. Concrete actions could include:    Build up a n etwork of political leaders at the municipal level who are willing to implement  the TIR roadmap, and motivate them to establish local action groups (e.g. architects, social  housing companies, property developers, and construction companies).    Identify, toge ther with municipalities, potentially scaleable refurbishment projects that  could become lighthouse examples for buy -in by other residential neighborhoods and  commercial districts.    1.4 Financial: Stimulate refurbishment of buildings via financial support  programs   Financial incentives are necessary to stimulate ambitious energetic refurbishment of buildings.  For example, the German government provides loans for refurbishment via the state owned  bank KfW. Subsidies are provided in the form of reduced intere st rates and by waivers of a part  of the loan rates.   Special support is needed for low -income building owners and the social housing sector. A fund  should be set up to provide support for these target groups which could be financed by taxes  on empty house s/apartments, on low efficiency secondary houses, on capital gains from rental  properties already paid off, or on rental price changes (when they increase due to the pressure 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               142     on the market and not due to renovation or upgrades).  The state should provide ad ditional  funding from the national budget if the defined sources are not sufficient.   1.5 Development and implementation of an action plan for refurbishment of residential  buildings   To overcome the barriers in refurbishment of residential buildings and to u nlock the related  potentials by combining it with other elements of the TIR roadmap like the generation of  renewable energy and the usage of the buildings as energy storage centers and as nodes of the  IoT infrastructure, a concerted action plan should be d eveloped to transform the existing  building stock. All relevant stakeholders should be involved, including the construction sector,  real estate industry, housing companies, planners, government agencies, etc.   The action plan should combine the already exi sting initiatives and support schemes with  additional actions based on a gap analysis. Priority interventions include:   1. Identify and quantify the needs, the targets (refurbishment rates, average energy  consumption of the building stock per m2) and the types of buildings and areas for  renovation. Develop ESCO business models, financing schemes, and a "full service offer" for  building owners from project design until final commissioning.   2. Start with a few predominant house typologies and develop initial projects. The start -up  projects will serve as a learning curve for a large -scale and long -term deployment.   3. Develop a second phase with a massive scale -up of houses and/or other types of bui ldings.       2 Turn non -residential buildings into TIR ready working places and data hubs   Non -residential buildings are an important part of Luxembourg’s construction sector. They  correspond today to almost 9 Mio m2 of floor space built since 1970113 whereas t he residential  sector is close to 18 Mio m2. These are mainly offices and public buildings which will provide a  significant part of the infrastructure of the TIR economy, since they will become energy and  data nodes of the IoT and provide the services for the new businesses and the TIR work force.   The working environment will change radically in the post fossil -fuel age. Sharing work spaces,  working together in teams in virtual settings, having access to Big Data on the Internet of Things  platform, and usin g distributed 3D printing, are only a few of the game changing trends that will  dramatically affect the way we work and conduct business in the future. Offices and public                                                           113 See : https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/NEEAP_LU_EN.pdf    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               143     buildings will provide much of the space and infrastructure for this development. The refore,  they have to be energy efficient and serve as energy producers and data hubs for the IoT and,  at the same time, provide high quality work environments.   2.1 Technical: Promote the use of standardized construction elements and methods   While the stan dardized construction elements and methods for residential buildings (see 1.1)  are equally applicable to commercial buildings, the latter require additional consideration.  High -rise buildings with intelligent façades and which require the flexible use of s pace also  necessitate more sophisticated digital infrastructure to support business services. Since there  are specialized stakeholders involved in the development, construction and operation of non residential buildings, a separate working group with these  stakeholders should be set up to fix  targets, identify regulatory changes that need to be implemented, and finance R&D.  Sustainable concepts (see 3.1 – 3.3) should become an integral part of the action plan.   2.2 Regulatory: Legislate urban context -adapte d density and high -rise construction   With the population of Luxembourg expected to increase to up to about 1 million inhabitants  by 2050, workplace growth will also increase commensurately.  The construction of non residential buildings needed to provide these workplaces is potentially in conflict with land -use  for residential homes, agriculture, and even nature preserves.  However, if the country decides  to grow as expected and become a flag ship TIR model, the design of cities and villages will n eed  to follow a different path in order to reduce the use of space.   To assure a high quality living and working environment in Luxembourg, spatial planning should  be reviewed with the emphasis on inc reasing density in appropriate urban settings , while  simultaneously curtailing urban sprawl and freeing up land to restore Luxembourg’s biosphere  reserves. These aspects will also be part of the new sectorial plan for housing. Providing  sufficient public l iving spaces and attractive work environments should be a high priority and be  developed with deep public participation. Commercial districts embedded alongside residential  neighborhoods make up the critical components of a public commons and a dynamic  com munity life. This approach to urban planning is far -different from the conventional  separation of work life and social life that results in dead office districts after work.   The new legislation on urban planning should include:    An ambitious plan for energy  efficiency of buildings.    The benchmarking of renewable energy generation in and around commercial buildings.    The r eview of spatial planning with the emphasis on increasing density in appropriate urban  settings.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               144      A mobility concept, which frees up more pub lic living and meeting spaces and is in line with  the TIR mobility roadmap (electric vehicles, public transport, car -sharing, etc.).    Requirements for Key Performance Indicators for eco -design and the use of eco -materials in  a Circular Economy .   Measures to provide high resilience against natural disasters.   2.3 RDI: Development of intelligent façades for non -residential buildings   Intelligent façades control the light exposure, provide decentralized ventilation, protect against  UV irradiation, contribute to el ectricity and heat generation by solar energy and support the  cooling system of the building. In addition, they can play an active role in (digital)  communication with the environment (e.g. by being a display).   Since it is expected that a growing number of large non -residential buildings will be constructed  in Luxembourg, research will need to be prioritized to advance intelligent façades and smart  building infrastructure.   2.4 Build up the LUX TIR Construction Platform involving all stakeholders   Several networks are already established and a myriad of activities are ongoing in the housing  and construction sector in Luxembourg. In addition, the TIR working group on buildings brought  together most of the stakehold ers of the building and construction sector: architects, planners,  engineering firms, real estate and construction industry, housing companies and associations,  academia, and the energy agency of the government. These stakeholder groups now need to  join to gether and oversee a Luxembourg TIR Construction Platform. The objective is to use the  platform to implement the recommendations set forth in the TIR Strategy Study. A governing  structure composed of the various stakeholders needs to be established and pro tocols need to  be put in place to guide the operation of the construction platform.   The platform should be tasked with organizing education seminars, stimulating innovations in  the construction sector, and collaborating with the other sectors of the TIR r oadmap including  energy, mobility, and digitalization. The TIR Construction Platform mandate should include  urban planning and urban development, building information modeling (BIM), integrating  circular economy principles, reducing construction costs, and  introducing new business models  to manage Big Data flows in buildings transformed into nodal networks of the Internet of Things  infrastructure.    2.5 Development and implementation of a TIR action plan for non -residential buildings   Transforming non -resid ential buildings into Third Industrial Revolution nodes requires that the  stakeholders of the TIR Construction Platform establish an action and implementation plan. The  plan should address  the following topics:  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               145      Gather detailed data on the existing non -residential building stock to identify the low hanging fruits for actions. The BIM concept should be implemented in the renovation of  existing buildings and the construction of new buildings, with an emphasis on integrating  the Internet of Things network thro ughout the non -residential building stock.     Efforts should be made to quantify the market value of buildings that have been  transformed into nodes that serve as Big Data center, micro power generators, and charging  stations for e -transport.    TIR state -of-the-art nodal building stock should be promoted across the EU and globally to  attract businesses to a Smart  Luxembourg.       3 Introduce  integral and sustainable concepts to the construction sector   3.1 Technical: Development and implementation of a national BIM strategy   Digitalization is growing fast in all steps of the value chain of a building, from design,  construction, operation, and refurbishment, to disaggregation, reuse of components and  recycling of materials. However, up to now the different tools o f building information modeling  (BIM) used in the chain are often not connected. To unlock the efficiency potential of the  digitalization of the construction sector, it is recommended that Luxembourg establish a BIM toolchain, where all tools used in the c hain access the same dataset of a building and add their  results to this dataset, which then can be directly used by other actors. This means that there is  only one dataset per building, including all data from the early beginning of planning until the  final end of disaggregation and recycling of materials. This will increase efficiency, not only in  construction and operation, but also in refurbishment, disaggregation and recycling of the  construction and its elements.   To establish the BIM -toolchain require s extensive preparatory work. Among other things, the  processes of the toolchain must be structured, interfaces defined, data protection rules  developed, and data ownership questions and legal aspects resolved. Therefore, research and  development, standard ization and organizational work must be undertaken. The goal is to  make the use of the BIM -toolchain mandatory for all non -residential buildings and to extend  the process to all residential buildings.   3.2 Regulation: Development of a TIR building certifica te  Luxembourg introduced the energy performance certificate (EPC) for residential buildings in  2008 and for non -residential buildings in 2011. The EPC must be presented when selling,  leasing, renovating, extending, or constructing buildings. In implementin g the EPBD Directive 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               146     2010/31/EU, new residential buildings must fulfil the nearly -zero -energy building standard from  2017 on. In 2014, the “Sustainability certification of residential buildings in Luxembour g”114  guideline was published under the name LENOZ t o evaluate not only energy efficiency, but also  ecological, economic, and social aspects of buildings. In total, 145 criteria are evaluated in six  categories. The sustainability assessment of buildings is being tested in the ongoing pilot phase.   These exi sting certificates assess the energy efficiency and the sustainability of buildings, which  are important quality of life aspects of buildings in t he TIR economy. A third aspect – the  smartness of buildings – is growing in importance but not yet covered. Th erefore, it is essential  to develop a set of key performance indicators to assess the smartness of a building. This  should include the level of connectivity to the IoT, the use of smart home technologies, the  level of intelligence of the energy management system, and the provision of data hub services  to other buildings. Based on all three performance indicators, a comprehensive certificate  should be developed that includes energy efficiency, sustainability, circularity, and smartness.  This would constitute  a TIR Building Certificate.   3.3 RDI: Introduce circularity with the development of a “material bank for buildings”   Between 25% and 30% of the waste generated in the EU is caused by construction and  demolition of buildings. This waste consists of materia ls like concrete, bricks, gypsum, wood,  glass, metals, plastics, etc., many of which can be recycled. Since the European Union aims to  be a society of  recycling with a high level of resource efficiency, the Waste Framework Directive  (2008/98/EC) regulates that Member States have to ensure that a minimum of 70% (by weight)  of non -hazardous construction and demolition waste are prepared for reuse, recycling or  material recovery.115  In December 2015, the European Commission adopted an ambitious Circular Economy Package   to stimulate Europe's transition towards a circular economy and boost global competitiveness,  foster sustainable economic growth and generate new jobs. The EU Action Plan for the Circular  Economy promotes actions on production, consumption, waste m anagement, and the  marketing of secondary raw materials. The overall aim is to close the loop of product lifecycles  through greater recycling and reuse, and bring benefits to both the environment and the  economy .116   These EU initiatives underline the import ance of the circular economy, which is an integral part  of the TIR roadmap. The efficiency improvements in the TIR economy can only be achieved if                                                           114 Ministère du Logement: LENOZ – Luxemburger Nachhaltigkeits -Zertifizierung für Wohngebäude, October 2014,   http://www.ml.public.lu/fr/lenoz/index.html   115 See: http://ec.europa.eu/envi ronment/waste/construction_demolition.htm   116 See: http://ec.europa.eu/environment/circular -economy/index_en.htm  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               147     construction elements and materials are reduced, and reused and recycled after the end of life  of the buildin g. To reduce the volume of materials, enable the highest share of reuse of  construction elements, and improve the quality of recycling of construction elements and  materials, the knowledge of all materials used in the buildings is needed. Therefore, it is  necessary to develop a “material databank for building s,” which gathers all information on  materials (origin, volume, environmental data, etc.) used in a building from construction to  disassembly. This will allow automized lifecycle assessments of building s during the planning  phase and the optimization of design based on the assessment of materials used. The  information procured will also allow stakeholders to identify the “eco -friendliness” of the  buildings. In the long -run, the material databank of a bui lding will become a part of the BIM toolchain dataset (see 3. 1) and a certificate based on the eco -friendliness of the building and  the ability of reuse and recycling (circularity) will become a part of the TIR building certificate  (see 3. 2).    4 Build up  “Intencity” lighthouse  projects   4.1 Technical: Demonstrate smart, green, and circular zero -energy districts   While the single technologies for TIR buildings, districts and cities are already available or under  development, the implementation of all technologies in one district or city with all cross linkages  between the components of each of the three Internets – communication, energy, and  mobility – and the IoT platform is not yet operational. However, only the implementation of the  fully  connected (sub ) systems  optimizes the aggregate efficiency and productivity gains that  comprise a Third Industrial Revolution paradigm shift.   Therefore, consideration should be given to erecting two fully -operational TIR lighthouse  districts in Luxembourg. One ligh thouse project should be undertaken in a new Greenfield   district since many  new districts will be built in the coming decades to accommodate the  population growth of Luxembourg. The other lighthouse project should be built out in an  existing brownfield  district where the challenges and opportunities are quite distinct and  provide a different learning curve.    Moreover, the lighthouse projects should be embedded in mixed districts, which include  residential, non -residential, and industrial areas, to build up  living districts, make full use of the  flexibility of the TIR infrastructure, and demonstrate synergy effects between the different  types of buildings. The development and implementation of the TIR lighthouse districts  will  require the active involvement of all of the stakeholders: government (national and municipal),  relevant businesses (construction, mobility, ICT, trade, financing, etc.), social groups, and the  research sector. In addition, civil society organizations and residents of the districts shou ld be 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               148    involved in the conception, planning, and implementation of the lighthouse district to ensure  active involvement and public support by the residents of the community.     4.2 RDI: Strengthen the research sector for transitioning buildings and district s   The construction of TIR districts requires a wide range of scientific and technological knowledge  and expertise. This will require strengthening Luxembourg’s research sector.   Research is needed on sustainable materials, construction elements, integrati on of  functionalities, reusability of elements, refurbishment techniques, etc. Digitalization will  enhance the design process in transforming buildings into nodes, while digitally mediated  prototyping and virtual reality techniques will help establish the complex interconnections and  synergies that optimize the building’s Internet of Things infrastructure. Transforming buildings  into intelligent, distributed, and cognitive systems will require the coming together of skills  across academic disciplines, raisi ng the bar for world -class academic and research centers.  Luxembourg will need to invest in establishing biosphere valley research centers that can  attract the best scientific talent from around the world.    4.3 RDI: Develop the University of Luxembourg as  a TIR living lab   A university is not only the place for research and education  of students, but also a campus and  community, not unlike other neighborhoods or districts, with its own buildings, transportation  modes, and public commons. Consideration shou ld be given to transforming the University of  Luxembourg into a “Living Lab”, where professors and students from across the various  academic disciplines can come together and transform the campus buildings and infrastructure  into a nodal Internet of Things  platform and Third Industrial Revolution test site for the  research, development, and deployment of TIR technologies and concepts.   The scientific priorities of the University of Luxembourg include Computational Sciences,  Finance, Security, Reliability , and Trust, and fit well with the implementation of the TIR concept.  University researchers and students can actively participate in transforming their campuses into  a smart digital TIR community.     5 Create a Resilience Commissioner in charge of economic, s ocietal and  environmental resilience   The Commissioner should monitor upcoming worldwide trends and coordinate the efforts to  prepare Luxembourg’s resiliency efforts. The building and infrastructure requirements in the  emerging Third Industrial Revolution era are qualitatively different than i n the past. Real -time  climate change is dramatically impacting the water cycles of the Earth, resulting in extreme 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               149     weather  events – violent winter storms, dramatic spring floods, and prolonged summer  droughts and wildfires. Buildings and infrastructure in the emerging era will need to be far  more resilient to withstand unpredictable and life -threatening weather changes. This will  require a rethinking of buildings and infrastructure . Luxembourg will have to prepare a new  generation of architects, engineers, urban planners, and ecologists in the erection and  deployment of "mobile infrastructure and habitats" that are highly flexible, dismantable ,  moveable, and resilient to withstand climate -induced environmental assaults.     The Resiliency Commissioner and age ncy should be independent and not be subordinated to  other ministries, to allow a broad and unimpaired view on economic, social and environmental  issues. Accumulating evidence and experience indicate that the laterally oriented and  networked sharing and ci rcular economy is more resilient and less prone to catastrophic  disruption, than traditional vertically integrated, tightly linked linear supply chains. Tight linear  supply chains are vulnerable to large disruptions causing catastrophic failures (e.g., Fuk ushima  and Chernobyl reactors), whereas the laterally dispersed, richly networked features of the  sharing and circular economy increase the likelihood of smaller disruptions that fail gracefully  and can rebound more rapidly. Highly resilient buildings and infrastructure are at the core of  the Third Industrial Revolution transformation.   5.1 Regulatory: Resiliency codes, regulations, and standards need to be established for all the  structures in the built environment. Every building will need to be evaluated  for vulnerability  against climate change events . Evaluation criteria will  need to factor in the type of construction,  the age of the building, the technical equipment embedded in the building and the purpose of  the building. Vulnerability categories shoul d be defined and the buildings assessed against the  different types of external disruptions. Such evaluation must be adapted to the use for which  the building is intended, since the challenges facing single -family homes differ from public  buildings like ho spitals and schools or commercial buildings and shopping malls.                
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               150     FOOD   OVERVIEW    The phase in of the Internet of Things  infrastructure for a Third Industrial Revolution  portends vast gains in aggregate efficiency and  productivity for Luxembourg farmers, food  processors, wholesalers, and distributors.  Farmers are already utilizing the emerging  Internet of Things with sensors to monitor  weather conditions, changes in soil moisture,  the spread of pollen, and other factors that affect yields . Automated response mechanisms are  also being installed to ensure proper growing conditions.   The agricultural Internet extends beyond the harvest to include the distribution of food to  wholesalers and retailers. Sensors are being attached to vegetables and fruit cartons in transit  to both track their whereabouts and sniff produce to warn of spoila ge so shipments can be  rerouted to vendors.   As the IoT infrastructure is phased in, farmers, processors, wholesalers, and distributors in  Luxembourg will be able to mine the Big Data flowing across their value chains. They will be  able to use increasingly  sophisticated analytics to create algorithms and apps, allowing them to  dramatically increase their aggregate efficiency and productivity, and reduce their marginal cost  and ecological footprint in the managing, powering, and transporting of food, taking the food  industry out of the chemical era and into an ecological era mediated by smart, new digital  interconnectivity.   The Ag Internet introduces a new era of agriculture. It’s called prescriptive planting and it is  being heralded as a potential productiv ity leap in agricultural yields. Early trials boosted yields  by approximately 5% over two years, marking an extraordinary jump in productivity.117  Prescriptive planting combines remote sensors and cartographic techniques to map millions of  acres of agricultu ral land and overlays the information with Big Data on climate across the  regions. Analytics is used to mine the Big Data and provide precise times for planting as well as  selecting the appropriate seed varieties best matched to the prevailing conditions.                                                            117 See: http://www.economist.com/news/business/21602757 -managers -most -traditional -industries -distrust promising -new -technology -digital  Co-Chairs Christiane Wickler and Nancy  Thomas  and the Luxembourg Food  Working  Group;   Michael Totten (Assetsforlife.net), and Jeremy  Rifkin, TIR Consulting Group LLC    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               151     While a promising new set of technologies, the agricultural Internet of Things is not without  controversy. Farmers worry that global life science companies might misuse the Big Data they  are collecting to buy underperforming farms or that the Big Data mig ht be sold to third parties  or be used to trade on the commodity markets, undermining the price farmers receive for their  harvests. In the United States, the American Farm Bureau, the nation’s largest organization of  farmers and ranchers, is introducing a code of conduct declaring that farmers own and control  their data and that life science companies cannot use the information except for the purpose  intended and cannot sell the data to third parties.   The food sector is a major consumer of energy in Luxemb ourg and across the European Union.  The cultivation, harvesting, storing, processing, packaging, and shipping of food to wholesalers  and retailers, uses massive amounts of energy. Petrochemical fertilizers and pesticides account  for a significant portion o f the energy bill. Operating farm machinery is also major energy  expenditure. The cultivation of crops – especially the electricity bill used in irrigation – and  animal rearing use the most energy in the food value chain, making up one third of the energy  bill. The industrial processing makes up another 26% of total energy use. Packaging and logistics  uses another 22% of the total energy expended. Final disposal of food waste makes up about  5% of total energy use; food waste is also growing, from 89 million  tonnes in 2006 to 100  million tonnes in 2014 and projected to grow to 126 million tonnes by 2020.118 Animal -based  food production and refined food products require more energy than fruits and v egetables.

When all the energy cost s associated with food production, distribution, and recycling are  added up, EU agricultural food production is a whopping 26% of the EU’s total energy  consumption annually, making it a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. The food   sector has lagged woefully behind other commercial sectors in increasing renewable energies,  with only 7% of total energy used coming from renewable sources, in sharp contrast to 15% in  the overall energy mix. Weaning Luxembourg’s food sector off of petro chemical based  farming  is a formidable task.

Consumption of dairy and meat products confirm its major role in GHG emissions even  when emissions are estimated per kg of product (Figure 1.7), with the exception of milk.  Emissions from the agriculture/zoo-technical stage are also particularly significant for the  dairy and meat products: agriculture emissions account for 73, 81 % and 71 % for milk,  butter and cheese, respectively. In the case of beef, pork and poultry agriculture linked  GHG emissions reach the shares of 95 %, 84 % and 84 % respectively. Not surprisingly,  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               153     The food sector is beginning to turn its attention to the challenge. Replacing petrochemical  farming practices with organic ecological based farming practices is spreading across Europe  and even in Luxembourg. Approximately 4,000 hectares of land in Luxemb ourg are currently  being used for organic agriculture (this includes arable land, grassland, wineyards, fruit and  vegtables).   The total retail sales of organic food are approximately €75 million annually  (a large part of this  turnover is still covered by i mports from other EU -countries and beyond).  Consumer demand is  pushing the transformation. An increasing number of Luxembourgers are willing to pay  premium prices for organic and sustainable foods.   Farmers are also joining together in the creation of elec tricity cooperatives and beginning to  install solar, wind, and biogas  energy technologies, creating a second business as micro power  generators.   Changes in consumer dietary preferences are forcing a rethinking of farm practices. For  example, intensive rearing of cattle and, to a lesser extent pigs, requires massive amounts of  energy and is the most inefficient means of providing food in the agricultural system. It takes up  to eight pounds of feed to create a pound of beef, making intensive cattle productio n and  related animal husbandry practices even more inefficient than automobile transportation. A  younger generation in Europe is beginning to wean itself off of a heavily meat -oriented diet and  is consuming more fruits and vegetables.   Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) is a good example of the impact that new TIR business  models are having on how food is grown and distributed. A century of petrochemical - based  agriculture, in tandem with other technological innovations, spawned a vast increase in  produc tivity and a corresponding reduction in the number of small farms. Now,  a new  generation of family farmers is turning the tables by connecting directly with households to sell  their produce. Community Supported Agriculture began in Europe and Japan in the 1960s and  spread to America in the mid -1980s. Shareholders – usually urban households – pledge a fixed  amount of money before the growing season to cover the farmer’s yearly expenses. In return,  they receive a share of the farmer’s crop throughout the grow ing season. The share usually  consists of a box of fruits and vegetables delivered to their door (or to a designated drop -off  site) as soon as they ripen, providing a stream of fresh, local produce throughout the growing  season.   The farms, for the most pa rt, engage in ecological agriculture practices and utilize natural and  organic farming methods. Because community supported agriculture is a joint venture based on  shared risks between farmers and consumers, the latter benefit from a robust harvest and  suffer the consequences of a bad one. If inclement weather or other misfortunes befall the 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               154     farmer, the shareholders absorb the loss with diminished weekly deliveries of certain foods.  This kind of peer -to-peer sharing of risks and rewards binds all of the sha reholders in a common  enterprise. The Internet has been instrumental in connecting farmers and consumers in a  distributed and collaborative approach to organizing the food supply chain. In just a few years,  community supported agriculture has grown from a handful of pilots to nearly three thousand  enterprises serving tens of thousands of families.   The CSA business model particularly appeals to a younger generation that is used to the idea of  collaborating on digital social spaces. Its growing popularity is  also a reflection of the increasing  consumer awareness and concern about the need to reduce their ecological footprint. By  eliminating petrochemical fertilizers and pesticides, CO 2 emissions from long -haul food  transport across oceans and continents, and the advertising, marketing, and packaging costs  associated with conventional Second Industrial Revolution food production and distribution  chains, each shareholder comes to live a mo re sustainable lifestyle.   Finally, new cutting edge developments in the life sciences are opening up vast new  opportunities for the agricultural sector. The fiber industry is introducing new biological based  products as substitutes for petrochemicals in p ackaging, construction materials, enteric  coatings for pharmaceutical products, and filaments for 3D fabrication and manufacturing,  raising the prospects of additional income generation for farmers, g rowing specialized fiber based materials that can replac e petrochemicals i n a range of commercial fields, along side   conventional food crops. In the Third Industrial Revolution era, it will be critical to find the  appropriate balance in using agricultural land for both food production and fiber production  that can substitute for petrochemical products.     STATE OF PLAY AND LUXEMBOURG VISION   Luxembourg’s food and agricultural contribution to GDP  is approximately 0.3 percent. The gross  value added from the agriculture sector has fluctuated over the past two decade s from a high  of €164 million in 2002  to a low of €80 million in 20 09.119   Value Added Production   The chart below indicates the production value from Luxembourg’s agriculture sector.

Farm automation may  account for a substantial percentage of the labor reduction, but no figures were available.  This  included 42,000 working days by day laborers (or 154 AWUs) – which have increased 340%  since 1990.  Luxembourg’s agricultural workforce is roughly two percent of the nation’s active  population, which is one of the smallest percentages among the EU member nations.   Agricult ural holdings by families in the country have declined by half over the past 25 years -  from 3,770 in 1990 to 1,900 in 2015; while corporate and group holdings have increased more  than 400 % – from 35 to 144. Luxembourg’s utilized agricultural land has rema ined roughly  constant since 1990 at 131,000 hectares, nearly split between permanent grasslands and arable  land. Half the farms are 50 hectares or more in size, covering 86% of Luxembourg’s agricultural  land in 2010; one -fifth of farms, comprising half of utilized agricultural area (UAA), are more  than 100 ha in size.121  In Luxembourg, 60% of the land is rented by the farmers and only 40% is in property and the  proportion of leased land is continually increasing.122 There is a very high pressure on farmland  prices because of the roaring development in the other sectors of the national economy.                                                           121 STATEC Farm Survey, Luxembourg.   122 Figures for 2015; source STATEC   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               158     Moreover, due to nature and biodiversity protection regulations, commercial developers are  required to offset the loss of soils and biotops due to  paving.  This is often do ne by  extensification of farming land (for example, arable land is converted to extensive grassland,  forest etc.), thus adding even more pressure and speculation on agricultural land.   In these circumstances, access to land becomes a difficult challenge for  agricultural holdings,  which cannot compete with other mo re profitable economic sectors.   Luxembourg Farm Holdings and Utilized Agricultural Area     Source: EuroStat (2012) Agricultural census in Luxembourg    Types of farming include specialized field crops, horticulture, permanent crops, and livestock  grazing. Two -thirds of the farms involve specialized livestock grazing  consisting of nearly  200,000 cattle – including specialized dairy cattle (518 farms), spec ialized breeding and meat  cattle (351 farms), and specialized dairy, breeding and meat cattle (231 farms).  Other livestock  include 8,700 sheep, 4,700 horses, and 4,300 goats.  In addition, in 2015 farmers raised roughly  116,000 poultry and 87,000 pigs.   Intensification has been a hallmark of the dairy sector, as shown in the two graphs below.  The  milk yield in kilograms per cow per year has increased from 3,380 kg/cow/year in 1967 to 7,382  kg/cow/year in 2015, or a 220% increase, as well as a 175% increas e in total milk production  (see charts below).123  At the same time, the number of dairy cows has declined to 46,908 in  2015 – one-third less than the high of 71,183 in 1975.124                                                             123 Luxembourg (2015) Service d’economie rurale (SER) for statistics on production of milk and milk prices and  STATEC for statistics on farms with dairy cows and the number of dairy cows, Ministere de l’Agriculture.   124 Ibid.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               160     Sustainability Production Indicators   In line with the historical EU promotion of intensive agricultural production through the  Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), the European Commission’s 1999 Communication on  Directions towards sustainable agriculture  incorporated the promotion of environmentally  sustainable production processes and outcomes.125     The emphasis has shifted from simply sustaining intensive production levels to increasing  production levels that are ecologically sustainable. Achieving highe r yields and value added  entails more effective application of inputs while simultaneously reducing detrimental and  unwanted outputs.   There are several sustainability indicators for assessing Luxembourg’s progress in the  agriculture sector.  Regarding cli mate change, the agriculture sector was responsible for 5.65%  of the nation’s total GHG emissions – or approximately 614,000 metric tonnes (mt) in 2012.   Emissions from agricultural soils constituted the largest fraction (45.3%, 278,000 mt), followed  by en teric fermentation (35.8%, 220,000 mt) and manure management (18.9%, 116,000 mt).    Land -based CO 2-equivalent emissions were reduced through LULUCF (forestry) activities by  515,000 mt between 1990 and 2012, along with 46,000 mt reduced from grasslands duri ng the  same time period.126  Overall, agri culture emissions declined 10.2% even while cropland  expansion increased emissions by 37,000 mt. These data are shown in the three chart s below.                                                                                125 EC (1999) Communication on Directions towards sustainable agriculture, COM (1999) 22 final, January 27, 1999.   126 LULUCF stands for Land use, land -use change and forestry.

As recently summarized, “the net sequestration of GHGs by the land  surface may even diminish as methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2O) emissions increase  with  further intensification of agriculture and forestry.”127 Ongoing, accurate, and increasingly fine grained measurement is imperative to provide the level of assurance that soil carbon sinks are  persisting, and not becoming GHG sources over time.  The In ternet of Things can play a highly  effective role in providing the monitoring, measurement and verification functions, from the  farm field through all the steps and stages of the agriculture value chain.   In addition to GHG emissions, the agriculture sector ’s use of pesticides and fertilizers continues  to impact the nation’s water resources.  The quality of two thirds of Luxembourg's groundwater  was ranked unsatisfactory in 2015 according to Carole Dieschbourg, Minister of Environment.   A pesticide spill in 2 014 resulted in the considerable contamination  of the lake of Esch -sur Sûre ,  the main drinking water reservoir of the country, leading to  a ban on the herbicide Metolachlor,  as well as tight new restrictions on the application of the herbicide Metazachlor.  Monitoring  from 2008 —2012 detected pesticides at 70% below ground monitoring points.                                                             127 Schulze ,E.D.,  S. Luyssaert, P. Ciais, A.

It is  estimated that more than 70% of Luxembourg’s surface water  may not comply with the EU's  2015 targets for chemical and biological quality (EU Water Framework Directive). Roughly one tenth of the below ground monitoring points indicated nitrates exceeded concentration limits.    Luxembourg’s agriculture sector does show continued p rogress in reducing both the total  amount of fertilizer and the applications per hectare, as shown in the following chart.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               164     Farmers Harvesting Higher Value -Added Renewable   Luxembourg’s agriculture will never meet the profitability of other more favored territories, at  least in comparison to regions where production standards are not as high as in Euro pe.  Luxembourg’s far mers complain about low incomes, and t hey are not and never will become  competitive to supply international markets. Sustainable food will increase their margins by up  to 100% (conventional milk: €0.30 /liter; organic milk: €0.50 /li ter).  The net income of farmers is lower than the compensatory payments  (e.g. farmers destroy  public money as well as environmental goods ). This is true for conventional farms and for  organic farms, except for fruit, vegetable , and wine production.  This raises the key question of  how to diversify farmer income through viable innovative options that the farm sector could  pursue to generate other secure sources of sustainable revenues while at the same time  practicing ecologically  sustainable farming practi ces.  Shifting Luxembourg to renewable energy resources is a promising option. The nation is  completely dependent on several billion euros of imported oil and natural gas, and a large  percentage of imported electricity.  There are competitive domestic alter native options that  can displace these imports within the next several decades. For Luxembourg’s farming  community , the alternatives offer a secure, long -term, safe and sustainable source of revenues.   These revenues could alleviate, if not entirely elimin ate, the fragile economic conditions many  in the farming community have faced for years. This value -added opportunity extends far  beyond providing a strong financial foundation for the nation’s farming community, by also  accruing robust climate mitigation and adaptation benefits.   Climate  change is already being felt in Luxembourg and throughout Europe. Current climate  change measurement s in crop yields in Luxembourg find an ongoing decrease in total vegetal  food production of -5.8% for 2013/2014 and - 18.9% for 2015 compared to 2013 . Current  weather statistics show a 40 – 50%  deficit in rain during the spring and summer. The cumulated  summer rainfall [for 2015] was 136.9 liters per m2, with a 39% decrease compared to the 1981 2010 reference long term period .  Rain collected for June was 39.3 l/m2, and July was 28.3 liters  per/m2, the 9th driest month of July ever recorded at the Findel weather station.  The  cumulated rain for the 2015 spring season was only 109.3 l/m2, nearly half (47%) the expected  rain for  spring (1981 -2010 levels averaged 206 l/m2).129                                                                                                                                                                                         http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics -explained/index.php/Agri -environmental_indicator_ _renewable_energy_production .  129 “Information on the climate in Luxembourg in 2015,” MeteoLux , 15 January 2016.

Observational days for precipitation are based on daily sums  between 06 UTC and 06 UTC of the following day .     Source:  MeteoLux   On the other hand, the cumulative rain in the spring was exceptionnally high (over 300 l/m2) in  2016. This had a very negative effect on the grain and wine harvest, with a loss of yield of up to  30% and bad quality parameters.    Conservative U.S. farmers and ranchers in Kansas and other Great Plains States, who have  suffered severe droughts and floods for more than a decade, now refer to wind and solar farms  as their most resilient cash crops that keep on generating revenues long after crops have  wilted  and cattle collapsed. Solar panels and wind turbines have become the new harvesting  equipment.    More importantly, solar and wind energy are generated at near zero marginal cost of  production.  The zero marginal cost of solar and wi nd energy is in stark contrast to the volatile  and unpredictable price of importing fossil fuels. Moreover, solar and wind energy use nearly  100 times less water to generate electricity than fossi l-fueled thermal power plants. In addition,  unlike fossil fu els, solar and wind energy are non -polluting, and do not emit CO 2 and other  greenhouse gas emissions, or discharge hazardous or to xic wastes during generation.    Moreover, the actual land footprints of wind turbines and solar panels are modest.  More than  90% of the land area surrounding a wind turbine remains available for ongoing farming and  ranching.  Solar panels can be installed sufficiently high up from the ground to grow crops  underneath (see photos below).  It is also worth noting that compared to t he land area required  for wind or solar power for battery electric vehicles, the bioenergy to fuel internal combustion  engine vehicles would require 30 to 60 times more area, respectively.  The exergetic gains  made in the solar and wind powered electrifica tion of thermal combustion processes are  significant, while also preventing the many environmental challenges and risks associated with  large -scale bioenergy production, as well as the emissions and pollution resulting from fuel  combustion.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               166     The harvesting of renewable energies allows farmers a diversification of their income and to be  more financially self -sufficient, providing more  stability and resiliency to enable them to be  more experimental. For example, they can experiment with changing crops that may be more  tolerant to erratic climate and weather patterns, or crops that can be used to produce bio based polymers for the expand ing composites and 3D printing industries.  The robust financial  security from onsite solar and wind power systems also enable greater flexibility in  implementing new smart farming methods – ICT-based precision tools and techniques – as well  as eliminating  petrochemical inputs through alternative methods and organic practices.  Accumulating experience with smart farming approaches provides positive evidence of  increasing yields while reducing operating costs.   The transition to a post -carbon (emissions), biol ogique, organic, and ecologically sustainable  agriculture establishes a new era of best practices that can position Luxembourg agricultural  products as a premier global brand noteworthy for the care, stewardship, and regenerative  approach to farming that r esults in healthy, nourishing, and safe products that citizens can trust  and prefer. The ecological brand goes hand -in-hand with obtaining a premium price for  Luxembourg agricultural products.           
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               167           There are far more benefits to be garnered, societ al-wide. Farmers can lead the way to weaning  the national economy off its nearly 100% dependency on imported oil and natural gas, and the  more than 50% of its electricity that is imported.  The several billion dollars now exported for  fuel will remain in t he domestic economy, circulating many -fold in local businesses and  employment.    Farmers will also be at the forefront of significantly reducing the high level of CO 2 emissions and  other pollutants towards zero.  Luxembourg’s per capita CO 2 emission levels  are more than  twice as high as the EU average.    Moreover, the Luxembourg government’s strong promotion of ICT innovations through  advanced research centers collaborating with business firms - innovations ranging across High  Performance Computing (HPC), B ig Data Analytics (BDA), high -speed Internet connectivity,  computational visualization, geoinformatics, smart wireless sensor networks, Blockchain  distributed ledger technology, and more – all have great relevance in the designing, siting,  engineering, con structing, operating, and blockchaining of the electricity and monetary  transactions between farmers, transmissi on companies, and consumers.   In addition to advancing the nation’s lofty aspirations of achieving deep reductions in GHG  emissions, and scaling up the nation’s renewable energy resources, this transition will also  further Luxembourg’s ambition to become a flagship circular economy.    The 2015 workshop, ‘Opportunities for Agriculture and Forestry in the Circular Economy,’  conducted by the European Innovation Partnership for agricultural productivity and  sustainability (EIP -AGRI), identified the following actions fo r initiating local ini tiatives:   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               168      1. Develop a shared vision.   The stakeholders’ vision should be designed for the locality  and region, with a long -term profitability and sustainability focus.  Lay out and  communicate the project’s purpose, objectives, scope and scale.    2. Develop  a feasibility plan.  To involve and engage key stakeholders, highlight the  range of opportunities, benefits, and outputs of this alternative approach.    3. Set up a collaborative innovation network (COIN).  An Internet networking platform is  key for bringin g together the diversity of actors to interact, enabling them to participate,  ask questions, and access shared and distributed information.    4. Ensur e initial investment.  Financial resources are essential for scaling up new  initiatives, which can take the  form of financing, investment, grants, and guarantees.   This requires administrative and political support from local, national and regional  entities.    5. Harmonize and clarify standards. Some existing standards may impede or prohibit  circular economy oppo rtunities, such as employing certain waste streams for a variety  of uses.   In gaining domestic market experience and accruing performance gains from learning curves  throughout the renewable energy supply chain and value net, Luxembourg opens up additional  business opportunities to export this model to other regions.  The global market for wind and  solar power systems is vast, enabling early movers to gain a competitive edge.  In the case of  Luxembourg, the combination of large industrial players, a strong fi nancial sector, and a  growing ICT sector affords the business community the wherewithal to create a comprehensive  package of Knowledge -as-a-Service combined with financing, expertise and products.   Perhaps one of the most desirous qualities of this Knowledg e-as-a-Service transition “package”  is its numerous future proofing dimensions, some already noted.  The transition to a smart  agricultural economy strengthens the resilience and anti -fragile attributes of the nation’s  energy system against disruptions, wh ether due to nature, technical failure, human error, or  terrorist attacks.    With all of these compelling reasons for pursuing  a farm -based solar and wind “cash crop”  energy system, just how large is the actual potential in Luxembourg?  Several Luxembourg  energy assessments have been performed in recent years.  Energy production on agricultural  lands presents an important value added dynamic to a hard -pressed farm community.   Importing foreign energy and power resources could, perhaps, offer short -term, lowe r cost  services, but accrue no long -term benefits to the farming community. The decision to employ  solar and wind generating energy technologies on agricultural lands is, to some extent, a public 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               169     policy issue, and the facts and figures in this paper are in tended to inform this decision -making  process.   To illustrate the opportunities specifically in Luxembourg we draw from the nation -by-nation  global 100% renewable energy assessment published in December 2015, undertaken by a joint  team of Stanford University and UC Berkeley research scientists, engineers and economists.130    These figures should be seen as illuminating the opportunities, rather than precise  recommendations.  For example, it’s possible to have more wind and less solar.   The global assess ment projects energy growth out to 2050, and assumes the typical economic  growth rate of bus iness -as-usual energy studies. The assessment also postulates the  electrification of all energy services capable of shifting from thermal combustion processes, as  in the case of electric vehicles, space heating systems, and some industrial processes.   Renewable powered hydrogen fuel production is assumed where electric conversion is not  feasible.    The Stanford/UC Berkeley team estimates 22% of Luxembourg’s total ene rgy needs can be  satisfied with land -based wind power.  This represents 1/12th (8.6%) of the technical potential.   It amounts to roughly 1,600 MW (nameplate capacity). That would require 319 installed  turbines each 5 MW rated power, and assuming 43% averag e capacity factor.    The land spacing area for turbines would span 202 km2 (20,200 hectares, or 7.8% of land area),  although 90% of this land area would still be available for farming or ranching.  For context, this  is comparable to one -third of the nation ’s permanent grasslands.  The projected levelized cost  of electricity (LCOE) is €cents 7/kWh.  The upfront capital costs would amount to €1.89 billion  (in 2016€).  The energy simple payback is 4.3 years, and if the prevention of air pollution and  CO 2 prevention are included, the simple payback shrinks to 1.6 years.  Roughly 260 construction  jobs would be created, full -time equivalent (FTE) to build capacity, and 567 permanent  operations jobs created.                                                            130 Ibid., Jacobson, Mark and Mark Delucchi et al .

The Enercon E -126 hub’s height is 135 meters, with a diameter rotor of 1 27 meters,  encompassing a swept area of nearly 13,000 square meters.

The second key difference is capacity factor.  While both reports  assume 5 MW turbine sizes, Fraunhofer conservatively assumes 23% capacity factor by 2020,  and S/UCB assumes 43% achieved by 2050.  Capacity factors in the 40 to 50 percent range  already oc cur with increasing frequency in new installations in good wind sites.132  Fraunhofer  estimates technical potential at 5,700 GWh per year, or 28% of their theoretical potential  estimate of 20,500 GWh per year; which compares with the S/UCB estimate of 5,900 GWh  achievable by 2050, or 8% of the their theoretical potential estimate of 70,000+ GWH per year.  Differences in theoretical potential would require a separate study, but appear to be due to  different capacity factor assumptions, turbine spacing arrangeme nts, possible differences in  assumptions about land availability, wind speeds and durations, plus other potential factors   The Stanford/UC Berkeley team estimates 67.3% of Luxembourg’s total energy needs can be  satisfied with utility -scale Solar PV systems.  This presents 99.6% of technical potential,  amounting to 14,400 MW (nameplate capacity).  Roughly 287  solar farms would be needed,                                                           131 Fraunhofer (2016) Aktualisierung der Potenzialanalyse für erneuerbare Energien in Luxemburg  (Update Analysis  of Potential for Renewable Energies in Luxembourg ), by Mario Ragwitz, Felix Reitze & Michael S chön , Fraunhofer  Institute Systems and Innovation Research (Fh -ISI) Institute for Resource Efficiency and Energy Strategies (IREES  GmbH), June 08, 2016.   132 Shahan, Zachary (2012) Wind Turbine Net Capacity Factor — 50% the New Normal?

The land footprint  would require an area of 129 km2  (12,900 hectares, or 4.96% land area). For context, the area  is comparable to 20% of arable land.  Most of this land could be available under the solar panels  for vegetable cultivation.  The LCOE is estimated at €cents 9/kWh, with upfront capital cost of  €20.5 billion (in 2016€).  Roughly 7,500 construction jobs would be created, full -time equivalent  (FTE) to build capacity, and 11,100 permanent operations jobs created.   Fraunhofer LuxRes 2007 (Solar PV) Update report (June 20 16)  How does the Stanford/UC Be rkeley solar photovoltaic power assessment compare with and  differ from Fraunhofer Institute’s June 2016 report updating the LuxRes 2007 report?133  As  with wind power, the key difference is the time frame, with Fraunhofer focused on 2020,  compared to 2050 b y the S/UCB analysis. Capacity factors are roughly the same in both reports  (15% by Fraunhofer, and 14.6% by S/UCB).  A third key difference is the estimated technical and  theoretical potentials of Luxembourg’s solar PV availability.  Fraunhofer calculates  a technical  potential of 7,900 GWh per year out of a theoretical potential of 33,200 GWh per year; whereas  S/UCB calculates a technical potential of 14,400 GWh per year.   Farmers typically receive annual royalty fees for allowing siting of wind turbines.  It is  impossible to speculate on Luxembourg’s local arrangement, but according to farmers’  experience in the United States, the rural wind advocacy group, Windustry, notes, “Wind lease  terms vary quite a bit, but the general rules of thumb is: 3,500 to 7,0 00 euros per turbine, 2,700  to 3,500 euros per megawatt of capacity, or 2 -4% of gross revenues . Larger turbines should  translate to larger payments. Compensation packages typically are offered as fixed yearly  payments, as percentages of gross revenues, or some combination.”134      Forming a farmers’ energy cooperative to facilitate expansion of farm -based solar and wind  farms is another potential option,  and has already been implemented in Luxembourg in the  biogas sector for more than 10 years. Agricultural co operatives have a long history in  Luxembourg.135  University of Luxembourg Law Professor David Hiez has written extensively on  the status of cooperatives in Luxembourg, and might be one expert to call upon for  insights.136 137                                                           133 Op cit ., Fraunhofer (2016).   134 Windustry  (n.d.)

As noted by transaction attorney Janelle Orsi,  Co-founder and Executive Director of the Sus tainable Economies Law Center,   “The world’s economic and ecological meltdowns demand that we now redesign our  livelihoods, our enterprises, our communities, our organizations, our food system, our  housing, and much more. T his glorious reinvention has already begun, and many refer to  it as the ‘sharing economy,’ the ‘relationship economy,’ the ‘cooperative economy,’ the  ‘grassroots economy,’ or just the ‘new economy.’”138      Smart Farming & Internet of AgriFood Value Chain   As noted above, establishing a sustainable source of revenues for farmers through onsite wind  and solar power systems provides them with the flexibility and resilience to adopt ICT -based  smart farming and precision agriculture technologies.  The Food Worki ng Group  makes argues   for greater use of the myriad smart farming tools and intelligent agriculture technologies that  have emerged. The current market is roughly €3 billion and projected to double within the next  five years.139 The proliferation of wireless smart sensor networks, telematics, geoinformatics,  computational visualization, Big Data analytics, drones, robotics, and other automated tools,  apps, and smart algorithms, are being combined for tracking data throughout the entire  farming operation - soil, plant, and animal conditions – and transporting products from “field to  fork,” while giving this information on -demand in real -time to farmers via their smart phones or  computers. These are labor -saving, resource -conserving, cost -minimizing, and value -adding  opportunities.                                                            138 Orsi, Janelle (2012) Practicing Law in the Sharing Economy: Helping People Build Cooperatives, Social Enterprise,  and Local Sustainable Economies .

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               173         Precision agriculture aims to optimise the yield per unit of farming land based on observing,  measuring and responding to inter and intra -field variability in crops. Precision agriculture  makes use of a range of technologies that include GPS services, sens ors and Big Data to  optimize crop yields.   Rather than replace farmer expertise and instinct , ICT -based decision support systems, backed  up by real time data, can provide additional information concerning all aspects of farming at a  level of granularity no t previously possible.  This enables better decisions to be made, resulting  in less waste and maximum efficiency in operations.   The disciplines and skills now required for agriculture include robotics, computer -based  imaging, GPS technology, science -based  solutions, climate forecasting, technological solutions,  environmental controls and more. To make the best use of all these technologies, it is essential  to train farmers and farm mana gers in their use.

By 2020 this sum could increase to 126 million tonnes if  no further efforts are taken, raising CO 2 emissions to 170  million tonnes per annum, or 3 % of all  EU27 GHG emissions.146  The issue of food waste in Luxembourg  was examined in the study “ Emergence, treatment and  prevention of food waste in the Grand Duchy of Luxe mbourg ." This study is based on data  evaluation of environmental management and other information that have been identified  within a set of surveys of different actors in the food sector.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               177     Luxembourgish total volume of food waste is estimated to 68 ,010 ton nes yearly, which  amounts to 123.7 kg / inhabitant per year. Within this total, 31 ,005 ton nes are avoidable food  waste, which amounts t o 56.4 kg / inhabitant per year.   In addition to food wastes, there are organic quantities of bio -refuse. Since Luxembourg’s 1994  inclusion of organic waste separation requirement, the collection of organic quantities of waste  and bio -refuse increased ten-fold (by 2012 as shown in this chart). Of the roughly 97,000 tonnes  per year, Luxembourg landfills 7%, incinerates 52% and biologically treats 41%, including  composting and anaerobic digestion  (based on 2004 data of food and green waste  management, so percentages may be different as of 2016).147      LU accepted organic quantities of waste and bio -refuse (in tons) 2004 -2012     Source: Statistics Portal Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, November 19, 2014,   According to a World Bank assessment, organic wastes worldw ide amounted to roughly 600  million tonnes in 2012, with projected doubling by 2025 and disposal  costs rising to one -third of  a trillion euros.148 As part of the EU’s PLASCARB collaborative, ongoing research, development                                                           147 JRC (2008) Inventory of Existing Studies Applying Life Cycle Thinking to Bio waste Management (Analysis of  Existing Studies that Use a Life Cycle Approach to Assess the Environmental Performance of Different Options for  the Management of the Organic Frac tion of Municipal Solid Waste), EUR 23497.   148 World Bank (2012) WHAT A WASTE, A Global Review of Solid Waste Management , prepared by Daniel  Hoornweg and Perinaz Bhada -Tata, March 2012, No. 15, World Bank Urban Development series,

PLASCARB explain s the microwave plasma process:   “Molecular cleavage using plasma is we ll known. This microwave plasma technology involves  microwave induced plasma to energy efficiently cleave CH4 [methane] into graphitic carbon  and hydrogen, with no CO 2 emissions. The process uses non -equilibrium (or ’cold’) plasma  induced by microwave ener gy from magnetrons. Microwaves provide a unique means of  efficiently transferring energy directly into the electron bonds in gas molecules. In this non equilibrium plasma, ionisation and chemical processes are directly determined by electron  temperatures, and therefore not as sensitive to thermal processes and the gas ion temperature  as thermal plasma. This enables increased energy efficiency, milder process conditions and  reduced process complexity. The key element of innovation is the generation of large homo geneous non -equilibrium plasma zones for cracking methane into valuable carbon products at  atmospheric pressure with potential for industrial scale operation.”149  It is unknown  as to when the promising ultra -high -efficiency, ultra -low emission microwave   plasma technology will become commercially available and competitive with existing and other  new innovative waste conversion technologies. More immediately, it is worth exploring the  application of ICT/IoT technologies to enhance tracking these material f lows, and determining  which of the separated food wastes can be soil composted rather than incinerated  or land filled.        ORGANIC WASTE & BIO -REFUSE DEFINITIONS   “Food waste can be defined as avoidable (e.g. left overs on a plate), partly avoidable (depends  on the personal habits of the consumer, e.g. skin of an apple) and not avoidable fractions (e.g.  bones). In order to have a clearer opinion on waste types it is  important to define the  differences between food waste, organic waste, biodegradable waste and bio -waste.   Food waste: Food waste or food loss is food that is discarded or cannot be used.   Organic waste: Organic waste is anything that comes from plants or  animals that is  biodegradable                                                                                                                                                                                       http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTURBANDEVELOPMENT/0,,contentMDK:23172887~pa gePK:21 0058~piPK:210062~theSitePK:337178,00.html .    149 PLASCARB (2016) Microwave Plasma, http://www.plascarb.eu/microwave_plasma .

Oil and gas fuel more than 70% of Luxembourg’s farm sector.  Energy efficiency gains have been  beneficial in reducing d irect energy used in agriculture throughout the EU by 1% per hectare  per annum. Roughly 135 kg of oil equivalent were directly consumed per hectare in 2010, and  inclusion of the indirect energy use (e.g., fertilizer and pesticides) increased this amount by   several fold.151                                                               150 PLASCARB (2015) Report about Food Waste Statistics in Europe , PLASCARB Innovative plasma based  transformation of food waste into high value graphitic carbon and renewable hydrogen, by Daniel Frohnmaier,  Peter Brandstetter and Florian Gehring, 7th Framework Programme for research, technological development  and demonstration un der grant agreement No 603488   151 EC JRC (2015) Energy use in the EU food sector: State of play and opportunities for improvement , by F.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               181     John Deere's line of E tractors (“electricity”) is  indicative of a shift underway in reducing fossil  fuel consumption by increasing power electronics used in farm machinery. The E models  generate electricity for operating the tractor’s air conditioning com pressor, the air brakes  compressor, fans for engine cooling, as well as powering shop and hand tools.  Farm machinery  has not yet experienced the inroads witnessed in electric buses, trucks and automobiles, but  the spillover and crossover is under developm ent.  Deere’s 7030E Series tractor, available for nearly a decade, has “a built -in power generator that  makes 400-volt, 3 -phase power and 230 -volt DC power on -the-go,” and includes an “all -electric  twin -disc fertilizer spreader. It uses the three -phase powe r to drive spreader motors, while 12 V  power drives the agitators and two electric actuators. The spreader offers a clear example of  the benefits of electric drives. Drive speeds are controlled independently of tractor ground  speed or rpm. Speeds are easy to adjust and hold constant. Spinner discs can be shut down  more quickly, thanks to the electrical braking of disc motors.”153  Electric pick -up trucks are available, ready for serving frequent farmer mobility needs, like 20 to  30 kilometer round -trips to fee d and parts stores, chores around fields, going to and from grain  elevators, moving loads, etc.  The excellent torque of electric motors would be a benefit for  hauli ng animals or towing trailers.   The extra weight of batteries for electric utility tractors  should be less a liability than in cars, by  providing some useful tractor ballast.  Actions only requiring a short time, like feeding cattle  twice a day with a silage loader -tractor, would be better served by an all -electric tractor, as  would other jobs  taking up a few hours.   The declining cost advancements in stationary battery systems are being marketed by  numerous firms - Tesla’s Powerwall, Schneider Electric’s EcoBlade, Sonnenbatterie, Samsung  SDI, LG Chem, Saft Groupe, and many start -ups – and bring t o the farm the opportunity to  integrate these advanced batteries with solar PV systems or wind turbines for reducing and  replacing fossil fuel needs for lights, dryers, pumps, compressors, fans , refrigeration, coolers,  etc.   Zürn Harvesting GmbH & Co. KG, the John Deere subsidiary, has developed an electrically  driven header where separate electric motors individually power at variable speeds the auger,  knife, reel and belt drives; while displacing sprockets, chains, pulleys and belts.  The header  was  engin eered jointly with Group Schumacher and the  University of Dresden.  In addition to  displacing fuels and emissions, there are other benefits. For example, the “knife speed can be  varied  separately to the table auger and, with  each of the adapted premium flo w table’s  rubber                                                           153 See: https://www.farmshow.com/a_article.php?aid=20815  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               182     belts powered by its own motor,  it’s now possible to reverse them or speed  them up  independently to clear blockages  and maintain even crop flow.”154  There is also an intelligence dimension.  Sensors are embedded into each electric  motor  that  monitors torque loading. Zürn  and partners  are developing smart algorithms for processing  real-time data that enables maintaining the header at optimal use by varying the num erous  parameters automatically.   There are other sensor and controller feedback co mmunication features capable of performing  a number of other real -time fine -tuning and optimizing adjustments.155    Zürn Harvesting GmbH & Co. KG, in collaboration with i ts partners was awarded a silver medal for the fully  electrically driven i -Flow header at Agritechnica 2015.   Fuel costs can be reduced by one -fourth by using electric motors to replace hydraulics. The  higher efficiency of electric drive components is one key reason why farm machinery  companies are developing electrified farm equipment.  A De ere engineer showcasing some of  the new equipment at Agritechnica pointed out, “Mechanical and hydrauli c drive units are only  65 to 70% efficient [ whereas] electric motors are 90% efficient and electric power is safer and  more flexible, offering better con trol and instant torque. It’s the trend of the future.”156    Blockchain – Monitoring and Measuring Material Flows and Building Consumer  Trust   “Think about the blockchain as another class of thing, like the Internet − a comprehensive  information technology with tiered technical levels and multiple classes of applications for any                                                           154 See: http://www.zurnuk.co.uk/wp -content/uploads/2010/12/Brochure -Premium -Flow.pdf   155 FW (2016) The Shape of Things to Come, Farmers Weekly , April 11, 2016,  http://farmersweekly.co.nz/article/the -shape -of-things -to-come?p=100%253Fp%253D102 .   156 Farm Show (2012) Electrification of Ag Equipment, Farm Show  magazine, Vol 36, Issue 1,  https://www.farmshow.com/a_article.php?aid=25108 .

In fact it is even more;  the blockchain concept is a new organizing paradigm.”157    Blockchain technology has emerged as a valuable transaction and activity tracking tool that can  be applied all along the agricultural value  chain that results in building consumer trust and  confidence in the health and safety of food products .   Organic food and farming methods are critical to sustainability and the long -term health of a  population. The biggest challenge that these inherently decentralized farming methods face is  that they must compete with the economies -of-scale of large agribusinesses. The solution has  been for organic farmers to collectivize their marketing and sales efforts to try to boost their  bargaining power. However th ere is a fundamental problem in that large -scale buyers can’t be  assured that the produce coming from multiple producers is of uniform quality . The blockchain  offers a potential solution as it can be used to keep track of authenticated credentials of  produ cers, certifing  that their food is organic and how it is produced . In a blockchain, a farmer  is unable to alter the record inserted by whatever body is employed to periodically verify that  he or she is meeting required standards. As bio -sensory technology advances, this  authentication process can be increasingly automated and, therefore, will be come increasingly  trustworthy.   Once an agreed -upon trusted standard can be established in this manner, decentralized organic  food production can be sold more like a  uniform commodity. Here, the blockchain is also useful:  smart contracts, transparent data and the very low transactions costs that digital money affords  would allow the creation of commodity derivatives of much smaller size than the contracts that  are tra ded in big commodity markets in Chicago and elsewhere. This is a good way to improve  the position of the farmers and of their cooperatives in the foodchain, with the result of fairer  trading practices and a better income for the producers.  As a trading nat ion, it’s an opportunity  for Luxembourg to lead the way in setting pricing models for trade in organic, sustainably  farmed food.158  Blockchain technology is also being used in promoting energy services from wind farms and  solar PV systems, as well as a myria d of exergetic efficiency -productivity operations.                                                                  157 Swan, Melanie (n.d.)

One economic indicator of merit is the estimate of land  productivity at 919 € Gross Value Added (GVA) per ha, presumably 2008 (but purportedly  declining in recent years).   Milk is reported as Luxemb ourg’s main farm product, comprising one -third of agricultural  production’s total value. At that time, there were roughly 860 milk -producing farms, accounting  for two -thirds of Luxembourg’s total agricultural land area.  More than half of milk production i s  shipped out of the country.  Currently, less than 1 percent of milk is organic (lait biologique), or  2,300 ton nes out of 317,000 t onnes of milk production in 2014.   Most dairy farms include arable crops and meat production. Three -fourths of dairy farms de rive  roughly two -thirds of their total gross product from milk. There h as been a yearly decline of  3.7% in the number of dairy farms.  Automatic milking is practiced by 10% of the farms and it is  increasing fast.159    Organic Farming & Consumer -Supported Agri culture (CSA)   According to 2012 statistics from IFOAM, the organic market in Luxembourg had €75 million in  retail sales. In 2013, there were 115 organic farmers in Luxembourg, operating on 4,145  hectares.  There are an additional 77 processing and 5 import  companies marketing organic  products. All of this occurs under the 'Bio -Lëtzebuerg — Vereenegung fir Bio -Landwirtschaft  Lëtzebuerg A.S.B.L. label (Union for Organic Agriculture Luxembourg).                                                                        159 Lycée Technique Agricole  (2011) Evaluation de la durabilité régionale agricole au Luxembourg , by Jeff Boonen et  al., in collaboration with Dairy Management (Dairyman),  http://www.interregdairyman.eu/en/dairyman/regions/Luxembourg.htm .

The nation’s growth in organic products has been expanding at five to ten percent per annum in  recent years, accounting for roughly 3% of agriculture production. Luxembourg reportedly has  one of the highest per capita consumption rates for organic products  in the world, although  more than 80 % of the organ ic products are imported.   Although  there is a National Action Plan and policy support by the Ministry of Agriculture in  promoting organic food research, consumer awareness, educational programs, training, a nd  marketing support, the nation’s farmers are not responding or converting to organic.

Results show that organic farms  cause substantially lower environmental impacts than their conventional co unterpart s.    There is a higher nitrogen (N) eutrophication potential from conventional farms and a  higher N -efficiency o n organic farms (on average 189 % in comparison to conventional  farms)    Organic farms have a l ower energy need (on average 43 % of conventional farm s) and a  higher energy efficiency than con ventional farms (on average 150 % in comparison to  conventional farms)    There are lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions on organic farms and organic farms have a  higher GHG efficiency compared to con ventional farms (o n average 139 %)   Organic farms have also a higher fodder autarky than conventional farms; conventional  farms have lower fodder autarky, especially protein fodder autarky and especially on dairy  farms (52%)    Organic farms have on average more diverse crop rot ation (7 .8 elements compared to 6 on  the conventional farms)    There was a higher biodiversity on organic farms: 28% more species on organic fields and  28% more species on intensive permanent grassland    The habitat diversity is on average twice as high on organic farms than on conventional  farms    The species number was even on organic farms with low weed cover significantly higher    The number of red list species was nearly twice as high on organic farms than on  conventional farms (4.6 compared to 2.7)   However , these additional environmental benefits do not go alon g with higher public  payments. On average, organic farms have a somewhat lower income (85% in comparison to  conventional farms) and a somewhat lower expense (74% in comp arison to conventional  farms).

The increasing concern over the impact of climate change on Luxembourg’s agricultural lands  requires urgent attention by the public authorities. Measures  should be undertaken, allowing  the agricultural sector to adapt to climate change . Improving  food security includes:  strengthening mainstream farming, encouraging alternatives such as organic agriculture,  permaculture, urban farming and collective gardens, short -circuit distribu tion, alternat ive  crops, etc.   Urban and suburban community gardens, occurring in both public spaces and on the grounds of  private institutions and companies, are a well -established phenomenon worldwide. An  estimated 15% to 20% of total global food production is current ly grown in cities and  communities. Luxembourg might take on the task of Internet mapping the nation’s available  community lands for expanding gardens, and making this open source platform available to  citizens w anting to engage in gardening.   Given that t here is wide variation in the productivity of urban farm and garden growing  techniques, as well the range of practices, including or excluding the use of pesticides, the  Internet platform can provide apps that effectively engage and educate citizens on how  to  significantly increase produce yields entirely through organic production methods.    Building on the past Century’s accumulated experience worldwide with low -input, high -yield  micro -farming methods, urban agriculturalists have the potential to grow, fo r example,  complete vegetarian diets sufficient for 100 people on one hectare of land.  This represents a  several -fold greater yield of produce than what is grown with la rge-scale commercial methods.    Biointensive mini -farming techniques make it possible to grow food using three -quarters less  water, 50% to 100% less fertilizer, and 99% less energy than commercial agriculture.161    Empirical results and accumulated evidence from practitioners in more than 100 countries  indicate high -yield micro - and mini -farmi ng methods are capable of producing two to six  times                                                           161 Jeavons, John (2010) How to Grow More Vegetables and Fruits (and Nuts, Berries, Grains, and Other Crops)  Than You Ever Thought Possible on Less Land Than You Can Imagine , http://www.johnjeavons.info/video.html

It is a well -observed social phenomenon that young start -up enterprises are  mainly comprised of youthful entrepreneurs.   These savvy pioneers h ave been growing up with  the growth of IoT technologies, social media, and collaborative innovation networks, naturally  absorbing this radically new (wireless, mobile, social networking) technological infrastructure.   Schools are comprised of buildings, gr ounds, and a flow of materials and resources that  constitute learning laboratories for students to engage in applied learning experiments.   Contests, software games, and the creation of apps  are modes of engaging students, faculty  and administrators in par ticipating as p roducers, users, and prosumers.   Gaining experience in the art and practice of gardening ranks as one of the finest applied  learning opportunities, opening a potentially life -long interest in healthy food cultivation,  whether pursued as a career  or a recreational past time.    When children start kindergarten in many parts of the world, they have their first educational  experience growing and tending a small garden of plants. It is an educational tool and often a  voluntary part of the  elemen tary school curriculum. Mobile apps and Internet platforms  enabling peer -to-peer interaction, and collaborative innovation initiatives, can  greatly enrich  this experience .

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               192     Significance and Value of non -traded Ecosystem Services on Farmland   While there are negative externalities – emissions and pollution – from the combustion of fossil  fuels, there are also positive externalities  including the ecosystem services (ES ) accruing from  organic farming.  The economic benefits of two of these ES – biological control of pests and  nitrogen mineralization – were assessed at farm scale and extrapolated to global benefits. Field  experiments were conducted in New Zealand of the ES provided by non -traded non -crop  species in ten organic and ten conventional arable fields.  The researchers found , “The total  economic value (including market and non -market components) was significantly greater in  organic systems, ranging from US$ 1750 –4536 per hectare per year, with US$ 1585 –2560 per  ha/yr in the conventional systems. The non -market component of the economic value in  organic fields was also significantly higher than those in conventional fields.”164  The most remarkable finding was the gl obal extrapolation, “We found that the extrapolated net  value of these two services provided by non -traded species could exceed the combined current  global costs of pesticide and fertilizer inputs, even if utilized on only 10% of the global arable  area. Th is approach strengthens the case for…more diversified, ES –rich, integrated agricultural  systems that enhance functional agricultural biodiversity, avoid expensive inputs, minimize  external costs and are less energy intensive.”165    The authors include half a dozen caveats regarding the “what -if” global extrapolation. At the  same time, one clear conclusion is to implement comparable experiments on Luxembourg fields  to determine local values and benefits associated with a shift to organic farming methods.   Ecolog ical Intensification of Forests and Woods   Promote forest permaculture in public domains as an option of forest tender contracts that  involve protecting biodiversity and climate mitigation and adaptation measures. The key  concept of this priority is Forest Gardens,166 where portions of the wooded areas are designed  and managed to mimic natural forests, with up to seven successive plant canopies that result in  a polyculture canapy layer. The natural forest processes are used to grow food, from chestnuts                                                                                                                                                                                      163 Jeavons, John (2012) How to Grow More Vegetables and Fruits (and Nuts, B erries, Grains, and Other Crops)  Than You Ever Thought Possible on Less Land Than You Can Imagine , 8th edition,  http://www.johnjeavons.info/video.html   164 Sandhu et al.

This polyculture is very productive and resilient, as the plants  are associated to help one another.   Currently, Luxembourg’s forests are economically under -developed assets. Climate disruption is  already happening and expected to gr eatly amplify negative effects by 2050, threatening  Luxembourg’s rich biodiversity (65% of forests are protected for their b iodiversity, 88% are  managed). Multiple impacts are projected, including severe droughts, sudden erratic  temperature shifts, soil er osion, loss of vulnerable tree species, increase of tree illnesses, loss of  pollinators essential for fruit and vegetable production, and declinin g aesthetics that draw  tourism.     PROPOSALS     1 Business Models and Innovation   1.1 Establish a public -private partnership between industries, research institutions, and key  agencies at the national and local levels to develop the action map for accelerating the  transition to 100% renewables.     1.2 As part of a public -private partnership to further the nation’s wind and  solar transition,  establish an open source Geospatial Visual Mapping of all avai lable wind and solar farm  sites (e.g., http://www.awsopenwind.org/ ): Advanced 4D data visualization tools enable  lifecycle planning  that integrates siting, architectural -engineering -construction processes,  virtual monitoring of performance metrics, predictive maintenance, repair and  replacement procedures, and related operating data.  Ongoing development and use of a  suite of virtual reality tools and sensor technologies are projected to help continue  reducing costs and improving performance of wind and solar PV farms.  Experience gained  in the application of these Internet -based tools help generate ongoing learning curves.     1.3 Set up a quadruple helix innovation network platform focused on creating an open  source GPS -based inventory map of all intra urban  land sites capable of growing food  as  well as an inventory of land sites that may need detoxification prior to being used for   food production . An inventory of available land in urban and suburban areas and on   rooftops in cities (a call for tenders and close collaboration with local communities is a  must) is a first step in an ongoing process of informing citizens of the opportu nities for  engaging in local gardening and organic food production.  Students and faculty can help 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               194     undertake the mapping inventory as an integral part of courses, as well as coding  smartphone apps to make citizens aware of nearby available sites to garden and/or where  to find local organic produce grown and for sale or gleaning.  Similarly, with public funding  support for necessary equipment, students and faculty could perform a valuable public  service by installing soil smart sensor networks to gather data  for measuring and mapping  the presence of any hazardous or toxic contaminants in specific locations that require  remedial treatment. In addition, calculations can be performed and shared online  indicating produce yields that could be achieved – per plot, by neighborhood, city wide,  and nation -wide.     2 Technical   2.1 Establish a public -private working group to assess the commercial readiness for applying  Ethereum and Blockc hain distributed ledger technologies to supply chain transactions : a  “Roadmap towards Susta inable Food Production by Transparency and Trust.” These  encrypted, but auditable distributed ledgers could help build transparency and trust within  every supply -chain. The combination of open -source hard ware  and software and  innovative distributed apps might transform companies’ willingness and inclination to  better inform their potential customers of the upstream and downstream history of their  products and production processes. Features to implement overall  traceability for sellers  and providers might include: Origin of primary products; Labeling (origin, product number,   etc.); Transport from origin to first transformation process; HACCP compatibility checks;  Sales tracking; Supply -chain audit; Third Party s oftware integration / ERP integration;  Margin tracking; Customer satisfaction; Customer habits; Delivery tracking; Environmental  impacts on every stage of transformation (Input -Output assessments); Contest between  providers (global critical path analysis);  Delta analysis (sales, margin impacts).  For  customers: Decentralized app using QR -code s to share information (satisfaction, point of  sale, location , etc. ) and check the quality of the global delivery chain ( CO 2 impact,  provenance, reputation of the provid ers, and comparison  with market standards).   2.2 Establish a platform for engaging relevant professionals across sectors in identifying,  prioritizing, and addressing the myriad of technical challenges  associated with scaling up  the IoT tools and technologies ap plicable to the farming community.  Leverage efforts to  foster the seamless interfacing with and interconnections between the Internets of  Communication, Renewable Energy, and Transportation  & Logistics , Buildings  as nodes and  nanogrids, and the Internet of  Things, all of which play a vital and central role in managing,  powering, and moving economic activity in the agriculture sector.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               195     3 Regulatory     3.1 Include the monetized costs of the current unpriced externalities caused by the use of  fossil fuels as an integral part of the review and revision of regulatory rules : Implement  policies and procedures in the utility planning and investment decision -making process to  successfully promote the transition to 100% renewable power to meet Luxembourg’s  energy needs.   There is a substantial peer -reviewed literature that has estimated the range  of unpriced social, health, and environmental costs resulting from the use of fossil fuels.   There is also a wealth of assessments that have calculated the “value of solar tarif fs” that  encompass the societal benefits of shifting to renewables that are not currently  incorporated in utility planning methodologies (which limit their analyses to just the direct  costs to the utility company).  The social and environmental benefits of  solar, wind, and  end-use efficiency improvements have been shown to significantly exceed the utility’s  direct benefits. Large lost opportunities continue to be incurred as a result of being ignored  in making investment decisions. Including some of the mon etized costs of unpriced  externalities caused by fossil fuels should be used as a guiding factor in providing financial  assistance to Luxembourg farmers to install wind and solar harvesting technologies across  their fields.     3.2 Regulatory agencies should ensure that no regulatory barriers exist  to preclude  siting  solar and wind technologies on farmland . The opportunities for farmers to use their land  assets to secure a diversification  of revenues by allowing the siting of solar and wind plants  results in mult iple social benefits. It builds financial resilience in Luxembourg’s farming  community by creating a sustainable revenue stream that can be applied to assisting farms  in the transition to petrochemical -free organic farming.     3.3 Request funding sources from the EU to undertake remediation of soil contamination  that currently prevents urban food production on these landscapes. Decades and  centuries of industrial activity have left many community landscapes with the build -up of  cont aminated soils unsafe for community food production. The government agencies  should request EU support to determine the best practices and procedures for remediating  these soils to a point where they are safe to garden again. For example, mycology  remediat ion has been demonstrated to achieve outstanding success in fully remediating  even the most highly contaminated soils.167 ,168 ,169 In cases where such remediation may                                                           167 Stamets, P aul (2005).

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               196     take years or decades to recover, alternative strategies should be tested, such as planting  non-edible vegetation that helps soil carbon sequestration and regeneration, while possibly  yielding aesthetic benefits (e.g., floral scapes).     4 Public Policy     4.1 Establish an ambitious set of policies, rules and regulations that align with accelerating  the transition to a 100% renewable energy economy . As an integral part of revising  existing regulations and implementing strong new measures, develop an action plan for  engaging the farming community in recognizing the new revenue stream that can accrue  throug h siting of wind and solar PV systems integrated with farm operations.     4.2 Undertake an inventory of the farming sector to determine cu rrent and planned uses of  smart farm  / precision farming  / intelligent agriculture tools and technologies . The  inventory should assess the time, costs and other resources required to implement and  operate the equipment, and the returns on investment and time, along with performance  metrics such as higher yields, labor savings, lower petrochemical or water inpu ts, etc.   Precision agriculture aims to optimize the yield per unit of farming land based on  observing, measuring and responding to inter and intra -field variability in crops. Precision  agriculture makes use of a range of technologies that include GPS serv ices, sensors , and Big  Data to optimize crop yields. Rather than replace farmer expertise and gut feeling, ICT based decision support systems, backed up by real time data, can provide additional  information concerning all aspects of farming at a level of g ranularity not previously  possible.     4.3 Promote urban organic gardening.  Establish a collaborative innovation network platform  that enables citizens, farmers, teachers and students, community organizations, and work  locations to map the nation’s available la nd resources where community gardens can be  grown. Build out the site to include the suite of knowledge resources, tools, and apps that   help citizens learn how to start and sustain high yield, low -input organic gardening  practices and techniques.  Use the platform to facilitate distribution of excess plants and  food products for the elderly and poor.  Tie in the program with local school programs,                                                                                                                                                                                      168 Rhodes, Christopher J.

Network with other cities to share the innovations resulting in higher  participation by citizens, and greater productivity of the gardens.     4.4 Foster entrepreneurial initiatives in local organic food production.  Several specific  organizational structures and food production met hods can be promoted and expanded in  Luxembourg. Some of these are currently operating, like Community -Supported Agriculture  (CSA) and community gardens, but could thrive if provided further support by local and  national officials and agencies.  Other pote ntial systems, including hydroponics, insect170  protein farming, eco machines171, and vertical farming, should be assessed and tested for  local viability and cost -effectiveness. To nurture suggestions, ideas, recommendations, and  activities that would help sca le-up local organic production and consumption, establish a  collaborative innovation network (COIN) platform that enables interaction among citizens,  government, academia, and businesses to determine options that could be jointly  promoted.  The COIN enable s ongoing discussion as different recommendations go through  testing and trials to see what works best, and how to modify or supersede these tests for  achieving better results.     5 Financial     5.1 Better targeting of EU and national funding sources to help the nation’s farming  community advance its use of smart farm techniques and technologies to enhance  productivity and accelerate the transition to organic -based agriculture and livestock  production . It has to be examined why, despite  relatively high support, the current level of  organic food production in Luxembourg is roughly 3 % – half the level of border countries  like Germany.                                                                     170 Solon, Olivia (2015)  Edible Insect -Farming Hatches New Breed of ‘Entopreneurs’, Bloomberg , September 9,  2015, http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015 -09-10/edible -insect -farming -hatches -new -breed -ofentopreneurs -.   171 Todd, John (n.d.)

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               198     6 Educational     6.1 Promote a collaborative innovative network (COIN) platform for farmers on how to take  advantage of smart farming and precision agriculture technologies . A COIN enables  leveraging both local experience and expertise on a range of topics relevant to addressing  specific farmers’ questions, as well as accessing insights, applied research results,  accumulated evidence and experience from professionals in the Greater Region and  beyond.  A COIN also provides multiple advantages over periodic classroom sessions or  presentation events, including the capacity  for posting queries 24/7 to a broader audience  of experts, to retrieve the accumulated knowledge already shared and stored on the COIN,  to access multiple learning formats (text, spreadsheets, calculators, research reports, slide  presentations, audio and video clips, MOOCs, open source courses, network contacts, etc).     6.2 Adopt an educational learning experience by providing each student with a square meter  of land to nurture her/his own biological textbook during the course of the school  semesters until grad uating . Gardening is at once a personal and peer collaborative  experience.  The process of growing ensembles of seeds into thriving gardens invol ves  natural feedback dynamics. Students exploring and exchanging perceptions about  variations in results instil l a feel for the experimental processes of science: the  consequences of watering too much or too little; differences in soil texture, pH levels, and  nutrient content; the effects of shaded vs. sunny exposures; the applications of STEM  knowledge (science, t echnology, engineering and mathematics); the process of composting  wastes into soil amendment; as well providing students with an awareness of the range of  scientific disciplines and research fields such as botany, entomology, beekeeping,  pollination, clim atology, microbiology, mycology, and ecology; substantially enriching their  understanding and know -how of composting, soil mulching, plant grafting, seed saving and  other hands -on activities. By the time they leave school, youth will have become better informed citizens regarding food, land and agriculture issues, while having deepened their  competences and broadened their horizons on a range of future opportunities, from  engaging in recreational hobbies to vocational pursuit as master horticulturalists, re search  scientists, or professional agriculturalists.     6.3 Expand educational opportunities and access to resources on smart agriculture applied  research for students pursuing vocational tracts and related professions . Include field  research initiatives with fa rmers and involvement in farm operations, in addition to class  instruction and online courses.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               199     6.4 Provide in class, online, and in field training sessions to upgrade and enhance the skills  and competences of professional farmers to enable them to take advan tage of intelligent  agriculture techniques and technologies . These include robotics, computer -based imaging,  GPS technology, drones, climate forecasting, technological solutions, environmental  controls and more. To make the best use of all these new and ex panding technologies, it is  essential to provide a series of ongoing trainings for farmers and farm managers to sustain  productive, healthy farms.     7 Research, Development & Innovation     7.1 Increase the engagement of farmers and farm managers in applied research  with  research institutes to field test practical intelligent agriculture tools and technologies .  Farmers are reluctant to change methods and adopt new technologies without clear  evidence of their cost -effective practicability and minimal risk. Sharing exp erimental results  and best practices can help identify challenges and opportunities and assist farmers in  learning about the myriad of new smart technologies that can increase aggregate  efficiencies and productivity while reducing marginal costs and ecolog ical footprint.     7.2 Increase funding support for RDI applied research on organic farming methods that could  be seamlessly integrated into farm operations .  Seek out funding opportunities from EU  initiatives that encompass how to detoxify soils, streams, and groundwater in making the  transition to organic farming.     7.3 Commission a University -led inventory mapping of the opportunities for increasing soil  and vegetation carbon levels of Luxembourg’s forests and farmlands .  Inventory mapping  of carbon levels can provide a baseline for assessing both the current health and  productivity of the nation’s soils and vegetative landscape, as well as remaining  opportunities for further enhancing carbon storage.  Part of the invento ry exercise should  consider placement of soil smart sensor networks for gathering and monitoring data over  longer time frames.     7.4 Implement experiments on Luxembourg fields to determine local economic values and  benefits from the Ecosystem Services accruing as a result of a shift to organic farming  methods . Determine the increased benefits of ecosystem services such as biological  control of pests, as well as nitrogen mineralization, among others.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               200     7.5 Perform field tests to assess the range of benefits that can accrue from ecological  intensification of forests and woods . Undertake pilot tests in a number of locations with  diverse assemblages of plants, determining the baseline for a relevant set of metrics, and  monitor changes over a multi -year period, such as in creased soil and vegetation carbon,  moisture levels, species richness, etc. From the pilot tests, determine which ecosystems to  scale up forest garden activities, while continuing to monitor long -term performance  metrics.                                              
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               201     INDUSTRY   OVERVIEW   The European Union is potentially the largest  internal market in the world, with 500 million  consumers, and an additional 500 million  consumers in its associated partnership regions,  stretching into the Mediterranean and North  Africa. The build -out of an Int ernet of Things  platform for a Third Industrial Revolution,  connecting Europe and its partnership regions in  a single integrated economic space, will allow business enterprises and prosumers to produce  and distribute their own virtual goods and their own r enewable energy, use driverless electric  and fuel -cell vehicles in automated car sharing services, and manufacture an array of 3D printed  products at low marginal cost in the conventional marketplace, or at near zero marginal cost in  the Sharing Economy, w ith vast economic benefits for society.   Luxembourg hosts diverse industrial sectors including finance, logistics, chemicals,  biotechnology, agriculture, steel, glass, audiovisual, crafts, and tourism. Luxembourg ranks only  second to Germany among the 28 E U Member St ates in business innovation, making its  business culture primed for leading th e EU into the digital economy.   Luxembourg’s leading industries will explore the vast opportunities brought on by the  convergence of the Communication Internet, Renewable Energy Internet, and the automated  Transportation and Logistics Internet, and the build out of an Internet of Things infrastructure.  Cross -industry collaborations, the development of open -source platforms, the lateralization of  value chains, colla boration between conventional market -based companies and startups in the  Sharing Economy, and new distributed business models, will draw Luxembourg’s industrial  sectors into the emerging digital business culture. Every industry will be tasked with explorin g  new ways to utilize the Internet of Things to increase its aggregate efficiencies, raise  productivity, reduce marginal costs, and lower its ecological footprin t in a smart green  Luxembourg.   The transformation of Luxembourg’s industries into the new digi tal economic paradigm will be  assisted by a number of world -class scientific and technical institutions. The Luxembourg  Institute of Technology (LIST) was created from t he merger of the Gabriel Lippmann and Henri  Tudor Public Research Cent ers. In operation  since 1 January 2015, the center was established to   provide research and technical support for transitioning Luxembourg’s industries into a high -Co-Chairs Nicolas Buck and Jérôme Merker ,  and the Luxembourg Industry  Working Group;   Michael Totten (Assetsforlife.net), John “Skip”  Laitner (Economic and Human Dimensions  Research Associates), and Jeremy Rifkin, TIR  Consulting Group LLC

The institute focuses on new materials including  nanotechnology, IT servic es, and environment.   Luxinnovation, the National Agency for Innovation and Research in Luxembourg  also plays a  prominent role in advancing innovations across Luxembourg’s industrial sectors by working  directly with enterprises and research organizations. Luxinnovation will help guide the  transformation of Luxembourg’s industrial sectors into a fully digitalized Third Industrial  Revolution economy.   Virtually every industry in Luxembourg will be transformed by the Internet of Things platform  and the usherin g-in of a Third Industrial Revolution. For example, a new generation of info facturers in Luxembourg is beginning to plug in to the incipient IoT, and dramatically increasing  their productivity while reducing their marginal costs, enabling them to compete in a highly  competitive global digital marketplace. It’s called 3D printing and it is the manufacturing model  that accompanies an IoT economy. Luxembourg hosts a large FabLab called 3DPrint.lu.  Engineers, architects, and designers use the technology at 3DP rint.lu to erect urban models,  create prototypes for components and prod ucts, and repair broken parts.   In 3D printing, software directs molten feedstock inside a printer to build up a physical product  layer by layer, creating a fully formed object, even w ith movable parts, which then pops out of  the printer. Like the replicator in the Star Trek television series, the printer can be programmed  to produce an infinite variety of products. Printers are already producing products from  jewellery and airplane par ts to human prostheses, and eve n parts of cars and buildings.   The early practitioners of 3D printing have made strides to ensure that the software used to  program and print physical products remains open source, allowing companies to quickly share  new ideas with one another. The elimination of intellectual -property protection also  significantly reduces the cost of printing  products.   The 3D printing production process is organized completely differently than the manufacturing  process of the First and Se cond Industrial Revolutions. Traditional factory manufacturing is a  subtractive process. Raw materials are cut down and winnowed and then assembled to  manufacture the final product. In the process, a significant amount of the material is wasted  and never f inds its way into the end product. Three -dimensional printing, by contrast, is  additive info -facturing. The software is directing the molten material to add layer upon layer,  creating the product as a whole piece. Additive info -facturing uses one -tenth of the material of  subtractive manufacturing, giving the 3D printer a dramatic leg up in efficiency and 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               203     productivity. 3D printing is projected to grow at a blistering compound annual rate  of 106%  between now and 2018.172       Source: ARK Investment Management LLC (2016)173    Innovation Leadership in Green & Circular  Additive Manufacturing & 3D Printing   The $5+ billion market in industrial -scale additive manufacturing (AM) and consumer -scale 3D  printing reveals the significant potential value to be gained in a wide  number of manufacturing  venues.  Ultra -light materials are being fabricated in the aerospace industry for achieving  dramatic fuel savings from light -weighting everything from passenger seats to the skins of  aircraft bodies and wings. Freeform curves, latt ice structures and intricate s hapes that do not  follow predic table geometries, are being 3D printed in ways unavailable in traditional  manufacturing processes.  Similarly, substantial savings are being achieved from integrated  designs capable of collapsing  scores of parts and components into one continuous 3D printing  output, in fields as diverse as automotive bodies to medical devices.

Herein lies a great opportunity for Luxembourg’s rich array of industrial and manufacturing  firms to work closely with the nation’s and EU’s lea ding R&D and Innovation centers to further  the state -of-play in green, lean, clean, sustainable AM and 3D printing products that ful ly  integrate  into a circular economy.      A local 3D printer can also power his or her fabrication lab with green electricity  harvested from  renewable energy onsite or generated by local producer cooperatives at near zero marginal  cost. Small - and medium -sized enterprises in Europe and elsewhere are already beginning to  collaborate in regional green -electricity cooperatives to t ake advantage of lateral scaling.   While 3D printing technology is the digital heart of the new info -facturing processes that are  transforming industrial production, a range of other digital technologies coming online also  amplify the optimization of aggregate efficiencies and productivity.  Virtual product design  dramatically shortens the research, development, and deployment of new product lines and  reduces the upfront cost of getting the product to market. Smarter robots that can learn from  their mistakes and integrate Big Data feedback fr om other best practices in real time,  transforms robotics from a dumb linear mechanical process to a smart cognitive exponential  learning curve. Smart robots continually upgrade their capacities by mining incoming Big Data                                                           174 Faludi, Jeremy,  Zhongyin Hu,  Shahd Alrashed,  Christopher Braunholz,  Suneesh Kaul,  and Leulekal Kassa  (2015)  Does Material Choice Drive Sustainability of 3D Printing?

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               205     with analytics. Augmented reality  – or virtual reality – allows work teams to be on -site and  participate in a work environment as if they were there, allowing them to interact with  machines and colleagues in real -time. Eliminating temporal and spatial constraints and  boundaries allow glob al work teams to interact intimately with one another, increasing the  efficacy of engagement.   It needs to be emphasized that the smart new info -facturing is only made possible by plugging  into the Internet of Things infrastructure. The convergence of the Communication Internet, the  digitalized Renewable Energy Internet, and the digitalized automate d Transportation and  Logistics Internet atop the IoT platform allows info -facturers to dramatically increase their  productivity and reduce their marginal cost of managing, powering, and moving economic  activity across their value chains . 3D printing, virtu al design, robots that learn on the job, and  augmented reality work environments will benefit all of the key industrial sectors of  Luxembourg in the digital era.   Many of Europe’s global manufacturing enterprises will continue to flourish, but will be  fund amentally transformed by the democratization of manufacturing, which favors a high -tech  renaissance for small and medium sized enterprises. Europe’s manufacturing giants will  increasingly partner with a new generation of 3D -printing small and medium sized enterprises  in collaborative networks. While much of the manufacturing will be done by SME’s that can  leverage  the increased efficiencies and productivity gains of lateral economies of scale, the  giant enterprises will increasingly find value in aggregatin g, integrating, and managing the  marketing and distributing of products.   The transition from the Second to the Third Industrial Revo lution will not occur overnight  but,  rather, take place of over the next 25 to 35  years. Many of today’s global corporation s will  successfully manage the transition by adopting the new distributed and collaborative business  models of the Third Industrial Revolution while continuing their traditional Second Industrial  Revolution business practices.   The establishment of the Thi rd Industrial Revolution Internet of Things infrastructure in  Luxembourg will necessitate the active engagement of virtually every commercial sector, spur  commercial innovations, promote Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (SME’s), and employ  thousands of w orkers over the next thirty -five years. The power and electricity transmission  companies, the telecommunication industry, the construction and real estate industries, the ICT  sector, the electronics industry, transportation and logistics, the manufacturing  sector, the life sciences industry, and retail trade will all need to be brought into the process. Many of today’s  leading companies, as well as new commercial players, will help establish and manage the  Internet of Things platform, allowing thousands of others —small, medium, and large sized 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               206     businesses, nonprofit enterprises, and prosumers —to produce and use renewable energy,  automated transportation and logistics, and a panoply of other goods and services at low  marginal cost in the exchange economy or at  near zero margina l cost in the Sharing Economy.   The Luxembourg communication network will have to be upgraded with the inclusion of  universal broadband and free Wi -Fi. The energy infrastructure will need to be transformed from  fossil fuel and nuclear pow er to renewable energies. Thousands of buildings will need to be  retrofitted and equipped with renewable energy harvesting installations, and converted into  micro power plants. Hydrogen and other storage technologies will have to be built into every  layer of the infrastructure to secure intermittent renewable energy. The electricity grid of  Luxembourg will have to be transformed into a smart digital Energy Internet to accommodate  the flow of energy produced by thousands of green micro power plants. The tran sportation and  logistics sector will have to be digitalized and transformed into an automated GPS -guided  driverless network running on smart roads and rail systems. The introduction of electric and  fuel cell transportation will require thousands of chargin g stations. Smart roads, equipped with  millions of sensors, feeding real -time information on traffic flows and the movement of freight  will also have to be installed.   Semi -skilled, skilled, professional, and knowledge workers will need to be employed acro ss  Luxembourg to construct and service the three Internets that make up the digital platform of a  Third Industrial Revolution economy. Transforming Luxembourg’s energy regime from fossil  fuels and nuclear power to renewable energies is extremely labor inte nsive and will require  thousands of workers and spawn new businesses. Retrofitting and converting thousands of  existing buildings into green micro -power plants and erecting thousands of new positive micro -  power buildings will likewise require thousands of  workers and open up new entrepreneurial  opportunities for Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), smart -construction companies, and green -  appliance producers. Installing hydrogen and other storage technologies across the entire  economic infrastructure to manag e the flow of green electricity will generate comparable mass  employment and new businesses as well.   The reconfiguration of the Luxembourg electricity grid into a Renewable Energy Internet will  generate thousands of installation jobs and give birth to cle antech app start -up companies. And  finally, rebooting the transport sector from the internal - combustion engine to electric and fuel cell vehicles will necessitate the makeover of Luxembourg’s road system and fueling  infrastructure. Installing charging sta tions along roads and on industrial, commercial, and  residential spaces are labor -intensive employment that will require a sizable workforce. The  massive build -out of the IoT infrastructure for a Third Industrial Revolution across Luxembourg  is going to sp ur an extended surge of mass wage and salaried labor that will run for forty years  or more, spanning two generations.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               207     Improvements in aggregate efficiency and productivity across all of the sectors that make up  the Luxembourg economy will have a significa nt impact on new employment opportunities.  Based on 2013 data from STATEC, energy services supported 4 jobs per million euro of value added, compared to 5 in information and communication services, 14 in manufacturing, and 18  in construction and 10 on aver age throughout the economy (STATEC). Hence, for every one  million euro of value -added services generated through greater cost -effect energy efficiency  improvements, Luxembourg will gain a net increase of 6 new jobs (that is, instead of supporting  4 jobs, t he economy will be supporting an average of 10 jobs, or a net gain of 6 jobs). A 5 billion  euro gain in GDP from higher productivity in the Luxembourg economy will lead to higher  employment of about 50,000 jobs (all else being equal).   It is important to n ote the key role that ICT will play in transitioning all of the other commercial  and industrial sectors into a digitalized Internet of Things economy. By establishing the critical  digital infrastructure to manage, power, and move economic activity across t he value chains,  ICT becomes an enabler of new job creation throughout the Luxembourg economy.   The business at hand for Luxembourg will be to provide retraining for the existing workforce  and the appropriate skill development for students coming into the labor market to ease the  transition into the new job categories and business opportunities that come with a massive  build -out of an Internet of Things infrastructure.   In summary, the scale up of a smart digitalized Internet of Things infrastructure across   Luxembourg will generate new business opportunities, dramatically increase productivity,  employ thousands of people, and create an ecologically oriented post -carbon society. The  employment of thousands of workers will also stimulate purchasing power and g enerate new  business opportunities and additional employment to serve increased consumer demand.  Infrastructure investment always creates a multiplier effect that reverberates across the  economy as a whole.                
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               208     Indicative quantification of digitalization value drivers     Source  : McKinsey (2015)180    STATE OF PLAY AND LUXEMBOURG VISION   Luxembourg  has  a  strong  industrial  history  which  is  continuously  evolving.  Over  time, the  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg managed to set up a healthy mix of large and medium sized  industrial players by relying on a set of advantages including the central location of the country  in Europe , its socio -political stability , and its rich pool of qualified workers.  These assets played  an important key role in attrac ting foreign direct investment and helped establish the activities  of several world -class industrial actors. A substantial number of multinationals such as Arcelor  Mittal, Goodyear, Dupont de Nemours, Husky, Guardian, and Delphi are currently pursuing  their activities on the Luxembourg territory. These companies represent a strong foundation for  the future development of Luxembourg industry. Additionally, a number  of “Hidden  champions” is active in Luxembourg including IEE, Accumalux, Rotarex, Ceratizit, EL TH, and Paul  Wurth. Most  of them companies produce lesser -known products, but in the markets they  produce for, they are ranked a mong the top ten in the world.                                                            180 McKinsey (2015) Industry 4.0 How to navigate digitization of the manufacturing sector. According to McKinsey,   “[I]nformation itself does not have an inherent value. All data collection should be approached with the  objectiv e of maximizing value. We thus need to look out for concrete value drivers across the business (i.e.,  areas where inefficiencies occur due to information leakages). For example, machinery and assets are a  significant cost category for manufacturing compani es; therefore, asset utilization is a value driver that might  contain untapped potential due to information leakages.” (p. 22)   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               209     Despite its small size, the country has a diverse number of industrial sectors. The steel indust ry  enjoys a long tradition in Luxembourg and is still one of the main players in the country’s  economy. In addition to the steel industry, Luxembourg boasts several other related industries  including the processing of metals and the manufacturing of metal articles. The chemical  industry is another important sector, with its main activities evolving around processing  chemical products. Luxembourg also hosts companies involved in the production of non metallic mineral products, glass, lumber , and raw material s used in the construction sector. The  food industry and the manufactur ing of beverages and tobacco are also important historic  player s in Luxembourg.    Employment in industry remained quite stable over the last 20 years in Luxembourg (1960:  35,000 vs. 201 5: 36,600).181 Interestingly, several structural changes occurred within the  Luxembourg industry. The steel industry, which heavily dominated the economy in the 1970s,  scaled back over the last several decades (1974:  25,000; 1985:  13,000; 2010: 6 ,000).182  Meanwhile, the other manufacturing industries gained in market share (1960: 11,200; 2010:  23,900). In comparison to its neighboring countries, Luxembourg performed quite well.  In  Belgium , for example,  industrial employment declined during the same period by 50%, in  France by 36% and in Germany by 22%. In Italy and the Netherlands, industr ial employment  remained stable.   The manufacturing industry made up 44% of the value added generated in the entire economy  in 1970. Today, the contribution of manufacturing  has fallen to approximately 5%. This heavy  loss in “relative terms” is closely linked to the staggering growth of the services sector during  the 80s, 90s and 2000s. However, the stagnation and the decline of certain industrial activities  also contributed to this evolution, especially in the af termath of the Great Recession.   Remaining competitive on the international level is one of the key challenges faced by  Luxembourg’s industrial sectors. Not surprisingly, given the small size of the Luxembourg  economy,  international trade constitutes the main driver of Luxembourg’s economic  development.  Luxembourg’s industrial sector exports about 85% of its production and, in some  sectors, exports account for nearly 90% of production.  Luxembourg’s main trading partne rs are  its neighboring countries: 28% of the production is exported towards Germany, 15% to France,  and 12% to Belgium. On the whole, 81% of the exported goods are flowing into a n EU country,  5.2% to  the Americas and 5.6% to Asia (2012).   The very notion of  what constitutes an industry is evolving  with the introduction of a digitalized  Third Industrial Revolution paradigm. As the Industry  Working Group has pointed out, the shift                                                           181 Source: Les autres industries manufacturière.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               210     to a digital infrastructure brings with it new business models and business prac tices that  converge products and services in an economy that is moving from conventional ownership in  markets to nontraditional access to services and networks. The Working Group emphasizes the  fact that the shift to a digital infrastructure will bring wit h it not only new business practices,  but also significant challenges including the country’s lack of qualified engineers and other  technical personnel.   With this in mind, the Industry Working Group has adopted a set of guiding principles that will  take t he Grand Duchy of Luxembourg into an Internet of Things Third Industrial Revolution  economy. The guiding principles  are the set of values that will guide Luxembourg Industry  in all  circumstances, irrespective of changes in its goals, strategies, type of wo rk, or governance. By  pursuing the path based on values and holding one another  accountable to the sector’s  standards, the values become the fabric of the industrial culture. Those guiding principles are  also essential in order to encourage the right behav ior while advancing  the transition into the  Third Industrial Revolution . The values are derived from the history and culture of Luxembourg  and are linked to the size of the country and existing interacti ons with neighboring countries.   Multi -lingualism : Luxembourg’s strength is a versatility of spoken languages on a daily basis,  three of which (Lux embourgish , French , and German ) are official national languages, with  English and Portuguese spoken by many people.   Open -mindedness : receptively and actively ch asing new ideas, new concepts and new  industries; adopt an open approach towards the  views and knowledge of others.   Collaboration : the process of working together to the same end (e.g. p ublic -private  partnerships).   Drive and embrace change : change is the o nly constant. We must learn not to fear change, but  to embrace it and even encourage and drive it and have the courage to give up what cannot be  sustained. Companies come and go, and have to be resilient and embrace continuous  improvement.   Pursue growth an d learning :  reflect on the areas where you excel or have an interest and try to  learn more about those areas but also means to reflect on areas  where you can further  improve.   Do more with less :  eliminate/reduce “waste .” Lean principles – save on resource s, time, money  and energy.      
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               211     Luxembourg Industry Vision   As the Industry Working Group emphasizes, Luxembourg industry exports about 85% of its  production, exceeding 90% for some sectors.

A multitude of factors are continuously challenging the competitiveness of these products and  firms: global market turbulence, technology disruptions, intra -industry rivalry, extra -industry  forces, regulatory requirements in production processes and product attributes, taxation  changes, fluctuations in factor input cost and availability, alterations in risk insurance, etc.        
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               212     Digital Single Europe & Digitizing European Industry   The European  Commission is moving forward with the establishment of the European cloud  in  tandem with the Digital Single Europe initiative .  Among its numerous functions will be  connecting Europe’s 70 million science, technology and engineering professionals an d 1.7  million researchers to a vast repository of research data.  This open source virtual storage and  retrieval network will enable professionals and researchers to access and share voluminous  amounts of data and information for performing analyses and ap plying to new uses and  innovative applications. The E uropean Commission  estimates more than €50 billion of public  and private funds will go into digitization of industry.183   It has been estimated that EU industry  revenue will increase by an additional €110  billion per annum over the next 60 months as a  result of this digitization of industry.184    New Business Models for TIR   The myriad of challenges puts a premium on Business Model Innovation (BMI) initiatives, a  point succinctly summed up by the Working Group, “The past has shown that ‘waves’ of  disruption are regularly challenging our companies in Luxembourg. Some companies will  disappear; new ones will emerge. Hence it is important as well to detect the opportunities of  tomorrow and help promising entities to seize their chance to become a leading actor of  tomorrow’s industry.”   As such, a bold vision statement sums up what t he Luxembourg industry hopes to accomplish:   “Luxembourg: an internationally recognized platform for sustainable   Industrial  excellence through innovative solutions”     The Working Group on Industry created a common vision for industries established in  Luxemb ourg. The vision should provide both the guidance and inspiration necessary throughout  this transformational process. It is a brief, but powerful statement, one that is aimed at helping  all stakeholders in their efforts to address the challenges and opport unities of t he Third  Industrial Revolution.                                                            183 EC (2016) Commission sets out path to Digitise European industry, European Commission, April 19, 2016,  http://europa.eu/rapid/press -release_IP -16-1407_en.htm .    184 EC (2016) Digital Sin gle Market – Digitising European Industry Questions & Answers, European Commission,  April 19, 2016, http://europa.eu/rapid/press -release_IP -16-1407_en.htm .    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               213     The first part of the sentence “An internationally recognized platform for sustainable industrial  excellence” represents the goal the Luxembourg industry would like to achieve, while the  second part of the senten ce “innovative solutions” are the means required to reach this goal. It  is important to stress here, that the vision is a unique statement only applicable in the context  of the Luxembourgish environment.      Glossary:   Internationally recognized Platform:  a vibrant cluster of stakeholders who have a strong vested  interest in the development of Industries. These stakeholders come from both the public and  private sector. The concept of the Public Private Partnership is the cornerstone of the whole  initiative.   Sustainable:  mindful use of resources (energy and raw materials), investment in people  (safe  and skill -enhancing working conditions) and profitable. The principles of the circular economy  are fully acknowledged and recognized.   Industrial Excellence : production of world -renowned and high quality industrial products. The  Business Model for these products may be a standard purchase model of a product, or the  delivery of this product as a service.   Innovative:  exploit the symbiotic link between research an d industries. The focus is on applied  research.   Solutions:  offering solutions (products, services, hybrid models) to end -customers.   While the vision statement describes what Luxembourg Industry wants to be in the future, the  Working Group also proposes a m ission statement. The mission statement should guide the  actions and strategie s, and provide a path and guide the decision making process.   “Develop an ecosystem that will be a fertile ground for the development of industrial  products and services which wi ll be innovative, mindful of any environmental impact, thrifty  in its use of the Earth’s limited resources and enabling the transformation of the economy  from a carbon fossil model to renewable energy.”

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               216     Accomplishing exergetic efficiency -produ ctivity gains have become economic, business, and  environmental imperatives for the entire €70 trillion global economy. Exergetic growth rates  need to exceed economic growth rates in order to drive the engine of aggregate efficiencies  across value chains, and significantly increase productivity, while dramatically shrinking  ecological footprints. Low and slow exergetic improvement rates drag down the economy,  jeopardizing business stability, employment, and dampening innovation.  Innovation flourishes,  trad e expands, businesses thrive, and society and the environment benefit with higher and  faster exergetic improvement rates.   The Industry Working Group seized this insight by zeroing in on three key topics holding a vast  potential for exergetic gains : 1) Energy and Resource Efficiency, 2) Research, Development &  Innovati on (RDI), and 3) Smart Industry and IoT Integration.  The Working group emphasizes,  “These subjects converge at all times and should not be viewed in isolation .”      Energy and Resource Efficiency   Over the next 35 years , total energy use in Luxembourg could  be cut by as much as one -half  through the greater use of energy efficiency across all economic sectors and households . It is  crucial to pinpoint the total energy c onsumption of industries in this country. Secondly , it will  be important to highlight the sources of the energy purchased by industries. What is the  percentage of energy that could be qualified as renewable? Here we are talking about energy  that is purchas ed and hence produced by a third party. But the interesting questions go further:  Will industries be able to significantly reduce the level of energy they require for production?  There are physical limits to energy efficiency that will prevent  heavy energy -consuming  industries from reducing their level of energy use . Will industries be able to produce significant  EXECUTIVE	SEMINAR	 May	25th	to	27th,	2016	  Luxembourg EcoInnovation Cluster – 23.04.2014  Luxembourg EcoInnovation Cluster –   Luxembourg Cluster Initiative  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               217     energy themselves? This could be achieved through different means (solar, wind, geothermal,  biomass). Finally,  there is the central question of wa ste. Many production processes produce  heat. How could industry turn this thermal energy into reusable energy to be used by a third  party? For example, consider Luxembourg’s glass industry. This is a high -energy consumption  industry. During the production process, water with a temperature of 57 degrees is used to run  over the finished product (glass). That water is considered to be  waste and will flow into the  drain and be recycled. An investment would be necessary to use that thermal energy (in the  form of  warm water) to potentially heat a communal swimming pool or a building. The same is  true for steel production. Recuperation of heat energy from cooling steel beams at Arcelor  Mittal’s  walking beams furnace has significant potential. Clearly both the plant and the  consumer would have to be situated in regional proximity to prevent energy losses.   The challenge is straightforward: increase energy efficiency and render energy production more  sustainable through win d, solar or other renewable technologies. In this regard, industries  should be encouraged to use all available free space on roofs and in parking lots to produce  solar energy which they can both use and return to the power grid. The exploration  of new  ways  to encourage the storage of energy should be actively promoted.   As previously mentioned, t he smart grid will be a critical component in the paradigm shift to a  Third Industrial Revolution . Smart grid technology will give industries real time information on  their energy consumption profile s. This will help them better align their sources of energy (buy  or produce) and if they buy, the buying pattern could be optimized and result in cost savings.  Simply put, energy peaks are expensive.   At the same time, Lux embourg industries will need to explore the potential of reusing waste  heat and materials to close  the production and consumption cycle . This is an important step to  avoid  any waste leakages and to maintain the longevity of the input materials. There is also a  strong link between the construction and the industrial sector. A number of industries  producing building materials such as concrete, glass, and steel are well-established in  Luxembourg. At present , the construction sector is required to deliver build ings which have to  meet very high standards in regards to energy efficiency. This trend is continuing, and  at some  point in the future , it may well be that new buildings will have to be built of materials which are  100% recyclable/reusable.   Rethinking Ener gy Services   Vintage Second Industrial Revolution energy industries are being buffeted by relentless storms  brought on by the IoT and GAIN (genetic, auto -robotic, informatics and nano -engineering)  technology advancements driving the Third Industrial Revolution. These general -purpose 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               218     technologies offer the means to deliver energy services more competitively with substantially  smaller ecological footprints.   This is pointedly seen in the staggering decline of wind and solar PV power costs, which are  sometimes cheaper  in the United States than fossil or nuclear power options.  Lawrence  Berkeley National Lab’s annual review of long -term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) find the  levelized cos t of electricity (LCOE) to be 2.5 cents per kWh for wind power and under 4  cents/kWh for utility -scale solar PV plants, located in good sites (and recently under 3  cents/kWh in Dubai).  Deutsche Bank predicts solar grid parity in 80% of the global market b y  2017.   Competitive price is just one important criteria of the overall value of wind and solar. Equally  important is the fact that their risk profile is significantly lower than traditional fossil and  nuclear resources, as well as some other renewable re sources like large -scale biomass  plantations and large hydrodams. Solar PV and wind power are not dependent on transported  fuel inputs, require 95% less water than thermal power plants to generate each kWh of  electricity, and , during generation,  release no  emissions, air pollutants, toxic sludge  contaminants, or rad ioactive wastes requiring  permanent isolation .  Unlike with nuclear power, wind and solar  do not require catastrophic accident insurance. Wind  and solar have a small land footprint that is 30 to 6 0 times smaller, respectively, than biofuel  crops.  These risk -free attributes are of special concern for the uncertain world of the 21st  Century, where cyber -terrorism could trigger Chernobyl and Fukushima type disasters, or  worse, whereas solar and wind power systems fail gracefully, not catastrophically, and are  capable of quickly rebounding.     Developing an Eco -system Strategy that Encourages, Stimulates, and Increases  the Innovative Capacity of Industrial Companies   The development of an eco -system for research and development, with a special focus on  applied research, will be one of the key elements that will help to develop “innovative  solutions” in order to attain “industrial excellence .” The aim is to set up common platforms that  facilitate cooperati on between the University of Luxembourg, CRPS and private companies.  Scientific research shall support national industry to enhance competitiveness. Luxembourg can  rely on a strong industrial history with a healthy mix of large sized and small and medium s ized  companies. Industry in Luxembourg has a strong focus on high value added products and  services and benefits from short and flexible decision making. Moreover , there are strong links  with other sectors promoted and developed in Luxembourg such as logistics hub and eco -
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               219     technologies; and strong support vehicles  (public funding, Industry oriented public research)  are made available by the public institutions with t he ambition to create industrial eco systems.   However, several weaknesses have to be taken into account: Decline in private investment in  research; limited collaboration culture which is fragmented and individualistic (public and  private); weak public opin ion of (dirty) industry; missing critical mass in sectora l value chains;  absence of seed  venture capital for industry; and research is currently too focused on  fundamental (theoretical) research instead of applied research, linked to industrial needs.   Ther e are several possibilities ahead. Focusing on multi -company research may benefit more  than one company and allows for the sharing of research infrastructure, the joint development  of key enabling transversal technologies and profit from joint staff appoin tments (e.g.  development of mathematical models that can be shared with several stakeholders). Research  does not necessarily need to be related to product development, but other topics of common  concern such as solutions for more energy efficiency or commo n manufacturing technologies  can be the fruit of a common research project that may benefit the industry on the whole. The  potential of cross -sectoral cooperation may be quite easy to activate in Luxembourg as most  industries are not in direct competition with each other. This common approach is also  interesting from a financial point of view as it allows one to use the available resources more  efficiently. There is an  equally  important opportunity to capitalize on public funds offered by  Europe.   More Publi c Private Partnerships will be key. Luxembourg  will have to find a common  denominator that reflects the diversity of its industry and their scientific and technological  needs with those of public research (align public and private research priorities). The re is also a  need to scale -up investment in technological research excellence to international levels and get  the stakeholders to devote their resources to common RDI projects. Here, the question of risk  sharing is also crucial.   Common platform to test new  viable business models   It should not only be about reinforcing existing industries and companies but a bout  offer ing a  platform to develop new promising start -ups and new business models. The past has shown  that “waves” of disruption are regularly challenging companies in Luxembourg. Some  companies will disappear  while  new ones will emerge. It is therefore important to  detect the  opportunities of tomorrow and help promising entities seize their chance to become a leading  actor of tomorrow’s industry.      
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               220     Smart IoT Integration   Smart Industry is a new stage of organi zation and control of the entire value chain of the  lifecyc le of products. This lifecycle will increasingly be determined by individual customer  preferences and will extend from the idea, the development and production, the delivery of the  product to the end client, the recycling stage , and all relevant services.   All members of the working group agreed that their business environment is increasing in  complexity year by year. Having the right product at the right time is becoming more and more  complex. Customers are constantly challenging companies and require them to be more and  more flexible.   Smart Industry bears the potential to revolutionize supply chains. We are unable to imagine  today what the possibilities will be over the coming years. We believe that we are just at the  beginning of this process.   The driver f or this revolution is the Internet. The Internet has transformed our world in a way  that hardly any other technology has done in the past. Information is at our fingertips and  accessible anytime from everywhere. This was the foundation for social media.   Web 2.0 made it possible for mankind to be c onnected in real time in a many -to-many format.  Now we will be able to add things or objects to this network. These things will become  autonomous actors. We refer to this evolution commonly as the Internet of Thing s or Internet  of Services. It is important to understand that beyond the connection of objects we will be able  to add an application layer that will allow computers to recognize and sort the contextual  importance of information.   The basis for all of this i s the availability of all relevant information in real time through the  connection (network) of all instances (machines, people) which are part of the value chain. In  addition, the system and the “system of systems ” will have the capability to determine the  optimum flow of value creation through the analysis of the data.   Through the connection of people, objects and systems, dynamic self -organizing cross  organizational value chains will emerge. These value chains wil l be able to optimize in terms of  costs, availability and resource consumption. We are moving from a centralized to a distributed  form of plant planning and control. We are not referring to new production techniques i.e.  additive manufacturing. We are refe rring to a totally new organizational framework. Innovative   production techniques will be integrated into this new framework but they do not represent  the point of origin.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               221     IoT-Enabled Prognosis in Industry and Manufacturing   Among the value -added benefits emerging from the Internet of Things (IoT) is the application of  system -level prognostic and predictive science throughout the industrial sectors. Cloud, fog,  edge and distributed computing,185,186 reliant upon pervasive wireless smart sensor networks  and Big Data analytics and smart algorithms, enables robust operational reliability, enhanced  service life, reduced capital and operating expenditures, and accrued productivity gains by  performing continuous intelligent preventive maintenance, fault detection and diagnosis, asset  management, and rigorous system design.    As recently summed up in Cloud -enabled prognosis for manufacturing , “Advanced  manufacturing depends on the timely acquisition, distribution, and utilization of information  from machines and process es across spatial boundaries. These activities can improve accuracy  and reliability in predicting resource needs and allocation, maintenance scheduling, and  remaining service life of equipment. As an emerging infrastructure, cloud computing provides  new op portunities to achieve the goals of advanced manufacturing.”187  Classification of Prognosis Methods     Source: Gao et al (2015)188                                                           185 Mitchell, Gary (2015) Open Fog Consortium to Help Enable Scenarios for the Internet of Things,  themanufacturingconnection.com, December 2015, http://themanufacturingconnection.com/2015/12/open fog-consortium -to-help -enable -scenarios -for-the-internet -of-things/ .   186 Enescu, Michael (2014) “From Cloud to Fog & The Internet of Things” LinuxCon, Chicago,  http://www.slideshare.net/MichaelEnescu/michael -enescu -keynote -chicago2014fromcloudtofogandiot .   187 Gao, R., L.

It is important to stress  that, as a sovereign state, Luxembourg has  the authority  of  a governing body to implement , to a certain extent, the right legislative and regulatory tools  that may encourage a transparent and simple possible authorization process for industrial  activities and change in activity that are in line with the principles of the Third I ndustrial  Revolution. Moreover, the question of the availability of the right skill set is  crucial for the  development of the industry in the context of the Third I ndustrial Revolution. Attracting,  retaining and training of high -qualified workers will be key for a sustainable development  across all of  Luxembourg industry. However, the whereabou ts of less qualified personnel                                                           189 Ibid., Gao et al . (2015)   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               223     should not be neglected in the transition phase and should retain the attention of the  stakeholders as well.     Steel Industry   What does solar and wind technology portend for sustaining and expanding the export  potential of Lu xembourg’s industrial sector? The steel industry , for example,  continues to face  considerable market volatility for a number of reasons.  Growth is slowing, with the following  chart showing the World Steel Association’s projection to 2030.     Source: World Steel Association, Global Steel Market Outlook   OECD Steel Committee Meeting Paris, 11 -12 May 2015   Despite the lower growth rates, the market is particularly favorable for specialty products and  high -grade steels.  ArcelorMittal’s $80 billion in sales shipping 85 million tonnes of value -added  steel product in 2014 would appear to be well -positioned for capturing a robust share of the 1.9  billion tonnes global steel market in 2030, despite ongoing displacement of steel products in  the materials market.   For example, steel confronts new competition from advanced ultra -light materials such as the  rising application of carbon composites in the vehicle industry. In addition, the Internet of  Things, Services, and Networks (IoT, IoS, IoN) are enabling radical ma keovers not only in  products, but also in the very nature of how a service such as mobility is delivered.  With the  scale -up of car -sharing operations, augmented by the emergence of autonomous/ driverless  vehicles, there is likely to be a decline in privat e car ownership, with a consequent drop in  vehicle manufacturing levels and the demand for steel.  Carbon composites and lighter weight  aluminium further diminish the percentage of steel used in cars, although specialized, high value steel materials will c ontinue to compete for key components of vehicles.   8  Steel demand outlook till 2030                 15  2014  2030   Global steel demand growth momentum to stabilize at lower level  China to show a steady decline   India, ASEAN, MENA to emerge as fast grow ing regions 1,537MT  (finished steel basis)     1,992 MT  (finished steel basis)    Diverging grow th pros pects of the developing e conomie s  Structural reform will determine grow th potential  •Brazil and Russia trapped in structural problems  •Mexico to strengthen growth potential thanks to strong reform agenda  •MENA outlook weakened by low oil prices and geopolitical  instability  •ASEAN  countries with reform agenda  will outperform others  •India getting ready for a take off with renewed reform initiatives   16 Sources: UN, Global Insight, worldsteel     GDP /capita  (thou USD) Urbanisation  (%) Population  (million) Steel  use/capita (kg)    2014  2030  2015  2030  2014  2030  2014   India 1.6 9.5 33 40 1267 1476 59  Indonesia 3.4 12.3 54 63 253 293 54  Vietnam 2.0 8.1 34 43 93 102 138  Thailand 5.6 14.2 50 64 67 68 258  Mexico 10.5 22.8 79 83 124 144 182 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               224     For example, ArcelorMittal is the world’s leading steel supplier to the automotive industry, and  the steel giant is immersed in promoting sustainable mobility over the past decade as part of  the Future Ste el Vehicle (FSV) initiative. The FSV consortium focused on cleansheet designs for  the expanding electric vehicle market.  ArcelorMittal has made tremendous strides in light weighting the EV  underbody’s total weight by 20% using advanced high -strength steel s and  ultra high -strength steels (Usibor® and Ductibor®). These steel products now constitute over  85% of the underbody.   ArcelorMittal also uses its advanced steels in intelligent design of vehicle components for  deriving multiple benefits like increased s afety, reduced emissions, and reduced metal waste, in  addition to reducing emissions and fuel consumption during vehicle use.  Co -engineering with  automakers, ArcelorMittal generates  optimized steel specifications with innovative tools like  laser -welded bl anks to get the right steel in the right place.   In the energy sector, the steel consumed in the coal, oil and gas industries is on a declining  path, given the urgency of eliminating emissions and pollution.  The steel market for nuclear  reactors is also de clining, given the recognition that living with reactors means living with the  intrinsic risk of a fat -tail probability of catastrophic disaster, whether triggered by nature,  technical failure, human error, or malicious terrorist attack.     Chemical Composites   Shifting markets to composites and other material substitutions means new business  opportunities for non -steel industrial and manufacturing sub -sectors.  Luxembourg -based  corporation DuPont has been co -engineering lighter weight compon ents with automakers,  using a range of high -performance polymers to displace metals. For example, DuPont  developed innovative nylon resin products (Minlon® and Zytel® PLUS) that are instrumental in  fabricating  engine components capable of withstanding  hars h chemicals, scorching  temperatures, and extreme pressures. Other DuPont™ products, like the thermoplastic Delrin®  has been valuable for engineering levers and gears and other functional components.    But shifting to solar and wind technologies offer multi -trillion euro new business opportunities  for both the steel industry and other manufacturers.     Advanced Steel and Composites   According to the World Steel Association, steel comprises four -fifths of the materials used to  construct and install wind turbines,  and 90% of that steel is recyclable at the end of the wind 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               225     turbine’s lifespan, result ing in significant reductions in CO 2 emissions compared to primary steel  production.   OFFshore Wind   Two examples help illuminate the potential market for steel in the offshore wind market.  In  2002, the installation of 160 MW of offshore wind turbines at Horns Rev (Horns Reef) 15  kilometers off the coast of Denmark  required 28,000 tonnes of steel.  That is roughly 175  tonnes of steel per MW.  By 2016, ArcelorMittal participated with Statoil and Siemens in the  offshore 30 MW Hywind Park situated 25 km off the coast of Scotland.  The six 5 MW turbines  required 3,500 tonnes of steel, or 116 tons of steel per  MW.   The 2015 global 100% renewables energy assessment conducted by a joint team of Stanford  University and UC Berkeley scientists, engineers and economic analysts calculated the global  wind market opportunity over the next 35 years.190 They assumed wind tur bines located in  roughly one -quarter (~27%) of the near -shore offshore wind technical resource potential.  This  amounts to 760,000 wind turbines (5 MW each), which would satisfy ~13% of total global  energy consumption.  The 3.8 million MW of installed offs hore wind capacity represents an  €11.7 trillion (2013€)  global market opportunity.  Assuming 100 tonnes of steel per offshore  MW, suggests a global market opportunity of 380 million tonnes of steel worth a quarter trillion  euros ( 2016€) .  There is also a ci rcular economy crossover benefit of working with the concrete and cement  industry in creating steel -in-concrete and stee l-around -concrete foundations. As the World  Steel Association spells out, “To improve durability and achieve longer -term strength, 70% o f  the cement in a concrete foundation can be replaced with ground granulated blast furnace slag  (GGBS), a by -product from the steel industry. In many cement or concrete applications, this is  the most cost -effective method for strengthening foundations beca use it adds no overall cost.  Furthermore, compared to a foundation that does not use GGBS, it saves an average of 92  tonnes of CO 2 per foundation manufactured."191   The circular economy is also facilitated by the reuse of 90% of the steel in wind turbines at  the  end of their 20 to 30 year lifespans, shrinking the ecological footprints involved in extractive  mining, the amount of energy and water required in virgin processing, and levels of CO 2  emissions, air pollutants, and wastes.                                                            190 Jacobson, Mark and Mark Delucchi et al.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               226     ONshore Wind   Onshore wind p ower offers an equally enormous, attractive global market opportunity for the  steel industry, as well as for other manufacturing, financial, insurance, and IoS -based wind  (virtual, remote) operations and maintenance sectors.   The 2015 global 100% renewables  energy assessment proposes relying on just 3.5% of the  onshore technical potential for locating turbines by 2050.  This amounts to roughly 1.2 million  onshore wind turbines (5 MW each). The 6.35 million MWs of installed capacity represent a  global market opportunity of €7.2 trillion (2013€) , providing 20% of total global energy needs  within the next 35 years.  This amounts to a global potential market of 635 million tonnes of  steel, assuming 100 tonnes of steel per MW, at a worth of a quarter trillion euro s (2016€) .  Solar Power   Solar PV and CSP installations, with the need for steel posts, merchant bars, and beams also  represent an immense global market opportunity for the steel industry.  The 2015 global 100%  renewable energy assessment estimates 25 millio n MWs of utility -scale solar PV power plants,  seven million MW of rooftop solar PV systems, and 1.5 million MW of concentrated solar power  (CSP) plants that collectively could generate 60% of total global energy needs by 2050.  The  global market opportunit y exceeds €65 trillion (2013€) .  The solar power systems would occupy  less than one -third of 1 percent of land area, averaged worldwide.   As the global assessment indicates, solar and wind can provide  90% of total global energy  requirements, including power  for the electrification of the transport sector  and many other  energy services that currently rely  on fossil fuels.  The greater efficiency of electrification over  thermal combustion results in an overall global e nergy efficiency boost of 40%. Remaining p arts  of the economy incapable of electrification could be satisfied with conversion of excess solar  and wind into hydrogen fuels, and a modest amount of biofuels where less expensive than  hydrogen fuel use.   The steel industry will also be instrumental in t he electrification markets for transmission and  distribution power lines, in the pipelines necessary for transporting hydrogen fuels, as well as in  mining operations for the numerous resources that go into the wind and solar technologies.   This detailed, tr ansparent assessment is illustrative  of the economic opportunity of  substantially reducing  fossil fuels and nuclear resources by 2050. The actual percentages of  wind versus solar will vary within nations, regions, and worldwide, which, beyond geographical  differences, is partly driven by the competition between the differential learning and  experience curves that continue to drive down costs and increase performance of each  technology.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               227     The assessment is not a prediction, since there are countervailing for ces overtly attempting to  block displacement of fossil fuels and nuclear resource development, and there are unwitting  barriers that should be superseded, notably updating public utility planning and approval  regulations, removing subversive tax subsidies,  and accounting for the fully monetized costs of  non-regulated externalities so as to effectively phase out the  competitive advantage of fossil  fuels over solar and wind. According to the 2015 assessment by the International Monetary  Fund (IMF), worldwide subsidies to the fossil fuel industry exceed €5 trillion  per year.   On the upside, as transparently detailed in the Stanford/UC Berkeley assessment, the economic  and social benefits are immense, summarized in the following box. The energy transformation  will save the average person worldwide $30/year in fuel costs, ~$370/year in health costs, and  $1,820/year in climate costs (2013 dollars).     TIR GLOBAL ENERGY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES   Renewable powered electrical conversion of 139 nations projected by 2050 to:      Create 23 million 35 -year construction jobs and 17.5 million 35 -year operation jobs for the energy  facilities alone, the total outweighing by ~3 million the 37 million fossil & nuclear jobs lost.     Avert ~4.6 million premature air pollution mortalities per year in the 139 countries and avoid ~ €2.9  trillion/year in health costs (2015 dollars).   Prevent ~ €14.3 trillion per year in 2050 global warming costs (2015 dollars) otherwise due to 139 country emissions.    Wind and solar are intermittent diurnally and  seasonally, although geographically distributing  the systems can substanti ally dampen the intermittency. However, the advances in materials  chemistry and engineering of nano -materials are leading to significant gains in a variety of  energy storage technol ogies. Recent figures on the levelized cost of storage (LCOS) compiled by  Lazard indicate the current sta te of play in the chart below. These estimates are continuously  changing targets, with some of the technology costs already further declining over past  months.

The Industry Working Group rightly considers that, given the global market, energy storage is  projected to grow to €44 billion by 2020 .    End-Use Efficiency -Productivity across  Luxembourg Industry   The exergetic efficiency -productivity gains enabling solar, wind and storage to cost -effectively  resource the global energy system are of utmost value and timeliness. Just as immense,  however, are end -use efficiency gains above and bey ond the efficiencies stemming from  electrification (displacing thermal combustion).  Efficiency throughout the va lue chain is as  great of value and timeliness as solar and wind power.    A key metric and indicator of efficiency is the ratio of energy requir ed to produce each unit of   GDP (e/GDP). A quarter century of increasingly detailed assessments point to efficiency as the  single largest pool of low -cost, low -risk means of delivering energy services to the point of use.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               229     This mega -growth market opportuni ty could satisfy half the world’s yearly total energy needs  for a fraction of the cost of expanding new power supply of any kind.  Instead of investing the  entire ~ €100 trillion for a 100% renewable powered global economy, the same delivered  services and b enefits could be gained by including efficiency and cutting total costs to €50  trillion .    In addition to €50 trillion of gross monetary savings , there are massive, cost -free circular  economy benefits accruing from the dematerialized form of energy service s.  Metals, minerals  and materials are largely substituted by data, information, knowledge and wisdom.   Both cases  reap €17 trillion in annual direct and indirect savings and health benefits.   Another way to view this market growth in expanding the deliver y of energy services in tandem  with rapidly diminishing ecological footprints is the following exercise.  What would be the  economic results if the world averaged 3% per annum energy reductions per unit of Gross  Domestic Product (e/GDP) for the rest of the  century?     The results would catalyze an immense, expanding pool of prosperous outcomes for citizens,  consumers, taxpayers, ratepayers, and businesses across the economy, while also enhancing  the biosphere.  Efficiency is an emerging market worth many te ns of trillions of euros in the  offering for TIR -driven enterprises.   John “ Skip” Laitner’s update of the 2003 estimate prepared by Professor Art Rosenfeld,  Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, with estimates to reflect energy projections by ExxonMobil  extended to the year 2050, indicate the following results could accrue.  The base case as sumes  the energy per unit of GDP improving at -2% per year through 2040 and continuing at that same  rate through 2050. This was compared to a case where e/GDP improves at -3.0% annually  through 2050.

Luxembourg Construction, Real Estate, and IOT -GAIN Amplifying   These end -use efficiency gain opportunities are in every sector and value chain of the economy,  conjoined with both existing processes and products, as well as with the IoT and GAIN  technologies in the process of disrupting even the most durable, long -lasting market  performance trends in sector after sector. The global built industry is overdue for such a  makeover, given their immense ecological footprint and the extensive exergetic gains that IoT  and GAIN technologies can catalyze.    Over time, every exist ing building and facility should undergo a real -time retrofit and upgrade  process that uses wireless smart sen sor networks drawing off Big Data a nd data visualization  analytics, transforming energy -consuming buildings and facilities into positive energy hi ghperformance buildings.  This is a multi -decadal immense market for Luxembourg’s  industrial  sector  businesses to pursue. Given Luxembourg’s 4% per annum new construction growth  rates, all new construction should also be designed to create buildings that serve as Big Data  nodes, micro power generating sites, and electric and fuel cell vehicle transport hubs.     Infosys, one of the world’s largest IT companies, provides an exemplary model.  The €8.3 billion  annual revenue multinational is achieving 80% ener gy savings in new commercial building  construction and operations through its innovative green infrastructure division.  Upfront,  systems -integrated architectural -engineering designs led to 50% cuts in energy consumption  (achieved at roughly no extra first  cost), while real -time, life -long “continuous commissioning”  of the facilities is maintained through smart sensor networks and Big Data building analytics to  ensure the facilities remain operating and performing as designed. These design features  resulted  in accruing an additional 30% energy savings. Deep retrofits and rebuilds of existing  building stock can achieve total savings of 50+ percent.    Architect Ed Mazria, founder of the Architecture 2030 global initiative embraced by business  associations and c ities around the world, points out that over the next 15 years 82 billion  square meters of new building and rebuilt construction will take place in urban areas, 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               231     amounting to the equivalent of 60% of the world’s existing building stock .192 Visually, imagine  another Empire State Building being built every 40 minutes for the next 15 years.   Designing, fabricating, and assembling smart buildings, and measuring real -time operating  performance data of the inventory of energy -consuming smart devi ces (building shell, lights,  appliances, electric motors, and onsite power and storage systems) begin with industrial  manufacturing.    The TIR architectural design features, construction components, and smart technologies open  up vast new opportunities for  Luxembourg industry. For example, Luxembourg’s Guardian  Industries  are using advanced manufacturing processes like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) to  lay down nano -scale thin films on ‘smart glass .’ This is just one building shell (and vehicle)  component providing valuable climate -adaptive energy efficiency benefits (heating and cooling  control, natural daylight).  Within the next 4 years the global smart glass market is projected to  grow to half a billion square meters per year valued at € 53 billion. In addition to smart glass,  the global market for building -integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) is projected to exceed € 5 billion  by 2022.  In addition to glass, Dupont Luxembourg has a long record of success of  promoting a  line of building envelope and constructi on system products used in green and sustainable  certified buildings.   The Internet of Things  makeover of industrial electric drive systems (motors, pumps,  compressors fans) and heat processes, present s another massive global market opportunity for  cutting -edge industrial and manufacturing companies.  Embedding the industrial electric drive  equipment with wireless smart sensor networks enables delivering Big Data for real -time  continuous analytic visualization and automated control by rapid response intellig ent  algorithms. Intelligent factory operations deliver  multiple benefits  including  energy and  resource savings, reduced waste, improved product quality, reduced down time, lower capital  and operating expenditures, and reductions in emissions and pollution.  They are also integral to  advancing circular economy outcomes.   Half of all the electricity in the world is consumed by industrial electric drive system  components, and over 60% in countries like China.  Integrated design and installation of high performan ce components can achieve 50+% savings in new installations at or near zero net  cost, and 30+% savings in retrofits with a levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) as low as several  cents per kWh.  China is pursuing large “efficiency power plants” (EFFs) based  on this market  transformation potential, aggregating industrial and manufacturing sector retrofits, as in                                                           192 Ed Mazria, Architecture 2030, ROADMAP TO ZERO EMISSIONS, June 4, 2014, s ubmission to Durban Platform for  Enhanced Action; citing and Adapted from, Dobbs, Richard.

These exergetic ef ficiency -productivity gains are foundational to engaging the IoT general purpose technology platform.  Connectivity is key for catalyzing experience and learning curves  leading to more innovative manufacturing design techniques and technologies capable of  producing smarter products and delivering intelligent services.   This is well -recognized by the Industry Working Group, noting crossover and transversal  opportunities with other sectors. Beginning with applied research, development and innovation  (RDI) init iatives, and continuing through the co -development of new value propositions and  value -added services constituting smart manufacturing  initiatives, and going all the way to  leveraging circular economy outcomes.   One of the largest transversal possibilities being pursued in Europe, the U.S., China and Japan, is  the convergence and synergies of connecting the Communication Internet, the Renewable  Energy Internet, and the Transportation and Logistics Internet, and Buildings as Nodes. All of  this is undergird by  the Internet of Things and  smart manufacturing.  The emergent IoT/IoS/IoN  tools and technologies increasingly enable the linking and interaction between the traditionally  silo’d vertical sectors of the Second Industrial Revol ution. Large exergetic productivity gains  become possible.    Buildings and factories become nanogrids operating in real -time, with plug -in electric vehicles  serving as connected picogrids (detachable, portable, interoperable).  The nanogrids connect, in  a self -similar fractal -like pattern, into neighborhood microgrids, which, in turn, link together to  form urban -wide minigrids. Cities fractally link together to form regional macrogrids, and these  macrogrids form the backbone of continent -wide smart supergrids.  Th is fractal growth pattern,  facilitated by embedding IoT connectivity throughout the industrial and manufacturing  processes and products, achieves leaner producti on while enhancing resilience. Local nanogrids  and microgrids remain functional e and resilient even in the event of large -scale failures of the  supergrid or a regional macrogrid due to a cyber -attack or natural disaster.   Chemicals and Automotive Sector   Luxembourg vehicle -related companies like Delphi and Goodyear, and logistics companies like  CFL, D ematic and Cargolux have key roles to play in the growth of digitalized Transportation  and Logistics Internet .  Delphi, a leader in powertrain electrification, has decades of experience  marketing a robust hybrid & electric vehicle product portfolio: chargi ng systems, connection  systems, electrical centers, energy storage systems, power electronics powertrain systems,  thermal systems, service solutions, and wiring assemblies.  The most recent forecast by 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               233     Bloomberg indicates electric vehicles will constitute o ne-third of global new vehicle purchases  within the next 25 years, as shown in the chart below.  The projected sale of 41 million EVs  would be nearly two orders of magnitude greater that the 0.4 million EV sales in 2015.       Source: BNEF (2016) Electric veh icles to be 35% of global new car sales by 2040.193    Goodyear has tantalized the world with an imaginative concept rendering of what the tire of  the future may become in the world of autonomous/driverless electric vehicles.  The Eagle -360  visionary tire (sketch below) is designed as a sphere that enables maneuverability in any  direction, such as driving sideways into a parking space. Embedded sensors would help balance  wear and extend travel life by constantly rotating the tires, and sensors would also mo nitor  pavement and weather conditions and communicate the information via telematics to  surrounding cars. Goodyear envisions magnetic levitation serving as the vehicle’s suspension,  propulsion and steering systems.  Magnetic fields would be used to suspend  the tires,  preventing them from making vehicle contact. 3 -D printers produce the tire treads, which  Goodyear believes could allow customizing tire treads for the specific region where the vehicle  resides.   Goodyear’s IntelliGrip is a near -term concept tire , also loaded with sensors and being designed  as an integral control component system of autonomous vehicles.  Ten million self -driven                                                           193 BNEF (2016) Electric vehicles to be 35% of global new car sales by 2040, Bloomberg New Energy Finance,  February 25, 2016, http://about.bnef.com/press -releases/electric -vehicles -to-be-35-of-global -new -car-sales -by2040/ .

More than 100 million driverless vehicles could  be on roads by 2035. Goodyear sees the IntelliGrip sensor -packed tire concept performing a key  role in communicating driving information to other drivers. The sensor smart algorithms would  perform a range of functions: sense pavement and surrounding road conditions, weather  circumstances, monitor tires for wear, and monitor air inflation levels.  Linked to GPS and  telematics devices, the tire could also perform smart city tasks such as mapping street potholes,  and providing real -time data to city transpo rtation departments for repair.

DOMESTIC LEARNING CURVE BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION (BMI)   Luxembourg’s Industry sector  – constituting nearly 5% of the nation’s GDP, and depending on  exports for 85% of its revenues  – needs to implement a dynamic, continuously evolving  Business Model Innovation (BMI) process.  IoT demands no less, in order to future proof the  sector’s ongoing innovative performanc e, value creation, differentiated products and services,  market position and profitability.   Luxembourg’s domestic market and the region’s surrounding markets provide the crucibles for  experimenting with marketing creative and innovative applications and so lutions for the  convergence of the Communications Internet, the Renewable Energy Internet, the automated  Transportation and Logistics Internet, and  buildings  serving  as nodes and nanogrids. This trial and-error process helps accrue tangible outcomes, learn  from mistakes, and accelerate the  learning and experience curves in scaling up IoT -based products and services.     
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               235     Exporting Products, Expertise and Knowledge -as-a-Service   The Industry Working Group views  public -private partnerships as the cornerstone in pu rsuing  and advancing the myriad aspects constituting the Third Industrial Revolution  and the  Luxembourg industry sector becoming a leading international platform.  More than 80% of  Luxembourg’s exported goods flow into other EU countries (55% to the three surrounding  nations of Germany, France and Belgium). These regional trade partners simultaneously pose  both challenges and opportunities.   The challenges stem from competition by other EU nations in pursuit to varying degrees of TIR  growth opportunities, al so focusing on energy and resource efficiency, RDI and Smart Industry   venues. The flip side of the coin, however, is the opportunities rooted in the EU’s collective  vision and manifest policies, programs and initiatives  which  strongly promot e the TIR economy  throughout the EU.  The Industry Working Group recognizes this upside, both for leveraging  available financial resources, as well as exploring partnership opportunities for growing exports  within an d beyond the EU.   With accumulating experience and learning curves in using IoT/IoS/IoN platforms and GAIN  technology innovations, one of the core advantages is increasing the intellectual/intelligence  capital, along with advancements in human and social capital, that are the prerequisites for  creating Kno wledge -as-a-Services expertise as an export business model innovation.    The fractal metaphor is apt in conceptualizing this export growth potential.  Local and regional  transformation of buildings into nanogrids, with EVs as picogrids, connected together in a  fractal -like manner, becomes a replicable export business model; packaging together integrated  smart products and skills with Knowledge -as-a-Service expertise.     Re-Skilling & Up -Skilling for the TIR   Like previous industrial revolutions, TIR induces m ovements towards de -skilling. Digitalization,  human/intelligent machine interface, Big D ata analytics, advances in robotics, and automation  will displace, destroy and create new jobs. There is no consensus on the percentage of job  destruction due to these changes (it varies between 12% in Germany for ZEW estimates194 and  50% in Luxembourg or Germany for Bruegel calculations195) but it is crucial to invest in                                                           194 Bonin, H., Gregory, T. and Zierahn, U.

Complementary measures need to be taken : to up -skill workers  to be reactive to advances in technology and robotics ; to re -skill workers losing jobs due to TIR  changes; and to give future workers the high skills needed for the new jobs  created by the TIR.  In the short and long term: forecasting of occupations, qualifications and skills needed for jobs  impacted by TIR.”   In discussing the Digitizing of European Industry, the European Commission points out that 90%  of jobs in the near futu re will involve digital skills.  In the ICT profession alone, more than  800,000 unfilled positions are projected over the coming four years .196 The advancements in  smart manufacturing, and the digitization, robotization, and Internetization of industry requi res  a steady stream of digitally savvy workers and ICT -educated professionals in the metals,  chemicals, electronics, and construction sectors.     PROPOSALS     1 Business Model Innovation   1.1  Leverage and empower the “Haut  Comité pour l’lndustrie” [High Committee fo r Industry]  to develop an industrial eco -system.   The “Haut comité pour l’Industrie” is an established  national committee with high representatives from the government, industry and research.  The mission of the “Haut comit é” is to assure regular exchanges between members of the  government and experts from the industrial sector with the objective to safeguard and  support the existing industry; to create an environment conducive to help establishing to  new industrial activities ; and to support industrial actors active on the international market  and to identify new activity niches . The “Haut comit é” has an in -depth and holistic overview  of the current state, the opportunities and challenges faced by the Luxembourg industry.  The “Haut comité” would be a great platform for the main actors to meet regularly and to  set the priorities for the development of an industrial eco -system. Stakeholders include  companies, actors in RDI, government agencies , and the Business Federation Luxembo urg  (Fedil). The challenge will be empowering the various working groups to make concrete  proposals on their specific topics. Resource requirements include human resources in RDI,  and financial resource s to sustain promising projects.                                                            196 EC (2016) Skills and Jobs, Digital Single Market, Digital Economy and Society, European Commission, April 14,  2016, https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/skills -jobs . 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               237     1.2 Establish a BMI platf orm for facilitating ongoing communication and interaction between  diverse industry professionals  regarding TIR and Smart Industry  / IoT  opportunities,  changes, and actions .  1.2.1 Internet -based communication platforms are essential collaboration and innovation  tools for sustaining networking on initiatives and projects set up intra -firm across  functions (RDI, accounting, IT), inter -firm, and between sectors (buildings, grids,  mobil ity).   1.2.2 More knowledge can be communicated and retrieved more quickly, thoroughly, widely  and cheaply, while enabling ongoing sharing of comments and ideas.    1.2.3 Moreover, IoT tools enable communication represented and presented in a rich  diversity of ways (te xt, spreadsheets, data visualization, videos, audio, animated  walkthroughs, 3D virtual reality and augmented reality experiences, etc.), as well as  allowing for rapid formation of self -organized ad hoc working teams with specific  missions or goals.     1.3 As part of or in parallel with the BMI platform, set up a data -driven, visually mapped,  inventory of exergy opportunities.   This exergy platform would take the form of compiling  all of the energy, water and resource consuming processes and equipment in the in dustry  sector.   1.3.1 This is the first key step in developing a living roadmap and action map for implementing  exergetic efficiency -productivity gains.  It is also core to initiating an industry -wide  Knowledge -as-a-Service expertise as an export business model innovation.    1.3.2 One major caveat, exergetic gains always should be examined and applied from a  systems -integrated perspective rather than by focusing on single pieces of equipment or  artificially constrained limited packages of equipment.  For example, avoid  using  smaller -sized piping laid out with sharp (elbow) turns in favor of lower friction larger diameter pipes laid out straight and minimum turns.  This system vantage point results  in the reducing the size and number of necessary motors, pumps, and compr essors to  deliver the same chiller service with lower capex and opex.   1.3.3 At the office building scale, where U.S. utility sponsored energy efficiency retrofits  average 18% savings, a system -integrated deep retrofit can achieve 80+% savings. Many  of the savin gs that are cost -effective in the deep retrofit would not be cost -effective if  only considered as a stand -alone option.  For example, upgrading windows with ultra -
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               238     efficient glazings are costly, but cost -effective as a result of savings accruing from the  need for a smaller, less costly chiller system.   1.4 Use the BMI exergy data visualization platform to examine opportunities for making  aggregated purchases and procurement of high -efficiency equipment upgrades, as well as  installing onsite and distributed solar,  wind and storage systems acquired at closer to  wholesale cost.   The learning curve in aggregated purchasing becomes an integral part of  Knowledge -as-a-Service.     1.5 Use the experience process gained from establishing the BMI exergy data visualization  platform  to perform similar “Knowledge -as-a-Service” inventories  for domestic and  regional public agencies, educational institutions, commercial and agricultural facilities,  and residences.     1.6 Use the BMI platform for Industry professionals to map domestic and expo rt market  opportunities for efficiency, wind, solar, and storage technologies.  This should encompass  potential partnerships, as for example, ArcelorMittal working with Siemens and Statoil on  constructing offshore wind parks.  Partnering with Luxembourg’s f inancial and insurance  sector would greatly augment the Knowledge -as-a-Service expertise export BMI.     1.7 Industries should be encouraged to use all available free space on the roofs and in parking  lots to produce solar energy which they can either  return to the power grid or use for self  consumption.          2 Technical     2.1 Develop technology platforms for co -located industry and university researchers working  on common transversal issues (enabling).      High potential domains  include : IPCEI on High Performance Computing and Big Data  Enabled Applications (FinTech, Smart Space, Smart Agriculture, Smart City, Smart  Energy, Smart Water, Smart Building, Smart Mobility, Personalised Medicine, Smart  Manufacturing, Sma rt Materials, Civil Protection);  Robotic s (broad scope e.g. small  flexible robots, ergonom ics, AGVs, lifting, pick&place);  Nationa l Additive  Manufacturing Centre; National Composite Centre; Automotive Campus;  Smart  Industry.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               239      Align national research with needs of industry and other beneficiaries , to foster  serendipity innovation, risk sharing of research and innovation, and mutu al learning.    Bridge the valley of death (Technology Readiness Level 4 -7, i.e. between research  and industrial applications), by align ing Luxembourg ‘Smart Specialisation’ (RIS3,  http://s3platform.jrc.ec.europa.eu/regions/LU ) with  national priorities in the   research and industrial sectors.    Promote complementary multi -industry pu blic-private -partnerships, with  stakeholders to collaborate on common topics with governmental and financial   (public and private) support.    Address Transversal issues, including : cross -sectorial, cross -application products and  services;  overcome missing cr itica l mass in product/service lines;   valorize  innovation  in di fferent industrial applications, market segments, and sectors.    Launch lifelong learning programs  tailored to the need of industry and competences  of University of Luxembourg researchers.     Set up enabling technology platforms  to facilitate cost reduction of RDI through  mutualisation (sharing) of resources (researchers, equipment, facilities, etc.);  develop new applications  and provide foundations f or innovation (proof of concept,   scale up, ind ustrial transfer, mass production) through equipment, pilot lines,  enabling platforms, technology, and infrastructure.  Challenges to be faced and sub measures to be taken into account include: overcoming the difficulties of upfront  investment from private  industry when thre is no direct return on investment:  garnering public support to put initial technology platform s in place and have the  private sector contribute in the second phase. Other challenges that need  addressing: multi -partner PPPs are quasi non -existent; there is lack of critical mass in  multiple markets, sectors, and domains; the EC state -aid rules are becoming more  stringent; low private financing of ‘risky’ projects; high capital investment for   equipment; trouble filling gaps in national value chains (Foreign Direct Investment);  and the need to create start -ups to valorise innovation, IPR. The cities of Aachen and  Grenoble are readying initiatives to set up successful Eco -systems for research  cooperation.     2.2 Establish a platform for engaging relevant professionals  across sectors in identifying,  prioritizing, and addressing the myriad of technical challenges associated with scaling up  Smart Industry, and seamlessly interfacing with the Internets of communication,  renewable energy, mobility & logistics and buildings as nodes and nanogrids.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               240     2.2.1 Standards and protocols are important for ensuring a range of attributes, from  interoperability of system components and devices, to disassembly for circularity a t end  of useful lifespans.    2.2.2 Countries have taken different approaches, whether like Germany’s lengthy procedure  engaging stakeholders to establish IoT standards and norms, or on the other hand, the  more open -ended approach found in the United States, where rapid development is  pursue d with reliance on evolving de facto protocols.   2.2.3 The open source platform will enable an ecosystem to emerge and evolve, reflecting the  myriad of generic and specialized technical issues around which triple and quadruple  helix knowledge networks can form s ub-working groups.     3 Regulatory     3.1 Establish a quadruple helix knowledge network  for business to engage with government,  academia and key stakeholders for identifying needed changes in superseding regulatory  impediments with regulatory innovations.    3.1.1 Many public utility rules, planning methodologies, regulatory policies and financial  incentives are still designed to promote large -scale expansion of fossil and nuclear  power plants.   Many of these were never designed for, and now become impediments  to accelerating the scale -up of demand -side, IoT -based energy and resource efficiency  improvements, onsite and distributed solar, wind and storage, or the bidirectional  interoperability of buildings, electric vehicles, and power grids.   3.1.2 To overcome the inertia  shown to be the case among most public utility regulatory  agencies, a quadruple helix knowledge network can play a formative role in pushing for  essential changes.    3.2 Blockchain technology should be assessed and pragmatically integrated into Industry  opera tions  for performing a variety of functions.  As a distributed ledger tracking  transactions, protected by strong encryption and authentication, yet accessible for auditing  purposes, blockchain already is widely used by banking, financial and insurance firms .  But  its application across the economy is now being experimented with and employed.    3.2.1 One potentially large function is using blockchain in tracking bidirectional energy  transactions, as with onsite and distributed solar, wind, and energy storage system s,  connected to smart -metering systems. It could serve as the underpinning of a  burgeoning prosumer energy service market.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               241     3.2.2 Blockchain also is currently being explored for measuring and verifying resource,  pollution and waste flows, providing key metrics for advancing the circular economy.     4 Public Policy     4.1 Develop and promote the industrial scale recovery of critical raw materials from  electronic scrap or production residues collected around the world.   Terrestrial resources  of critical materials and rare earth  metals are limited and will be depleted  or increase  steeply in cost  over  the next few decades at current world economy growth rate. The EU  CRM list includes  20 critical materials (antimony, beryllium, borates, chromium, cobalt,  coking coal, fluorspar , gallium, germanium, indium, magnesite, magnesium, natural  graphite, niobium, PGMs, phosphate rock, heavy REEs, light REEs, silicon metal and  tungsten).  Recovery from scrap and residues is also an integral component of the  circular  economy idea pursued by  the TIR initiative , as well as integrating into the activities of the  transportation and logistics hub . This expands c ompetitive technology edge opportunities  for Luxembourg’s industry, u niversity , and public and private r esearch opportunities, as well  as attract ing new business  in this highly technologized field, including first mover  opportunities for some rare metals process es that are not yet developed or at pilot  level. It  will also c reate a large number of lower qualification profile jobs involved in  transportation  logistics and disassembling/segregation of electronic scrap.     4.2 Set-up smart spatial planning and management of business sites (industrial and  commercial zones).  Digital GIS visualization tools are essential for  mak ing the  best use of  energy and materials  and achieving zero waste and pollution targets  through industrial  symbiosis  and enhanced logistics. Examples are legion, highlighted by the following  opportunities : avoiding unnecessary transportation of people and goods ; closing material  loops by being energy efficient at every level (individual businesses, business site level, and  at a nation al leve l); promotion of  smart regional planning of business sites and integrated  designs of business parks with long -term added value for the economy, the environment  and society ; mapping existing heat sources (‘waste heat’), quantifying untapped material  flows (waste, off -gas and wastewater) and optimally matching these potential opportunities  with needs of new businesses (closed loop energy and material flow management systems) ;  creating energy  services from on -site renewable energy sources ; managing  and distributing   energy via  smart grid solutions (including energy storage solutions) ; making sure business  site management entities will be put in place (e.g. syndicates) ; making use of brown fields  instead of high quality arable land or valuable ecosystems ; ensur ing good connection to  public transport and logistics hubs ; foresee ing buffer zones between planned business sites 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               242     for the manufacturing industries  and existing settlements to avoid nuisances ; limit ing  excavation depth  during construction  to avoid excessive e xcavation waste , making use of  sustainable water management practices (minimiz ing sealed surfaces , favor ing green roofs  and walls , and plan ning  sustainable rain - and wastewater management systems) ; enhancing   cooperation between businesses (e.g. raise local  funds to be spent locally to improve  business park) ;  planning  joint facilities (meetings rooms, canteens, mobility solutions,  technical equipment, etc.) ; developing  multiple and flexible uses of a site that allows  adapting to future needs ; actively invol ving local or neighbouring population and future  users in planning phase s to increase acceptance and avoid or reduce future conflicts ;  planning  buildings as ‘material banks ;’ and t aking a human -centered design approach by  fostering  ergonomic architecture and techniques, integrated landscaping, and facilities to  accommodate the combination of  professional and private life.  There are a nu mber of  inspirational resources including  knowledge assets and know -how that can be tapped  and  whose results can be leveraged in the pursuit of future activities .197  4.3 Engage in a quadruple helix knowledge network between business, government,  academia and key stakeholders  to identify and prioritize the national, regional and EU wide changes that Luxembou rg’s leaders should promote.   4.3.1 For the Industry sector, the transaction costs and risks of developing and exporting IoT  and Smart Industry driven products, expertise and Knowledge -as-a-Service into other  markets can be mitigated by promoting generic adoption  of innovative public utility  regulatory reforms, planning methodologies, and how returns on energy investments  are calculated, and removing policy barriers and regulatory impediments for  accelerating the scale -up of TIR tools, technologies, products and s ervices.     5 Financial     5.1 Technology platforms need substantial investments:  e.g. National Composite Centre 100  million Euro over five year period (50% public / 50% private), IPCEI on HPC and BDA: H2020  program s totaling  over 6.7 billion Euro 2018 -2020 (European public funding).

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               243     references: Multi -domain includes  Campus Aachen (RWTH, Germany), CEA -Tech (Grenoble,  France); and, Focused: National Composite Centre (Bristol, UK), Automotive Campus  (Helmond, Netherla nds), and HighTech Campus (Eindhoven NL).     5.2 Build an acceleration program for start -ups whose vision it is to build products and  services aimed  at reducing carbon footprint  or other environmental benefits.   Innovation  is the battleground of the future. Luxembourg is focusing on building a n entrepreneurship  ecosystem in which both the public and private sector work hand in hand to facilitate and  support the emergence of new innovations  through the creation and development of  startup companies. Thus it is of great importance that we build an acceleration program  that would identify and support the most innovative ideas in the field of start up ecoinnova tions. The objective is to run the program for 3 years, with 10 companies/teams  selected each year from a t least 100 projects received.  From 30 companies selected over  three years (i.e., 2017, 2018 and 2019), 12 should have survived and developed by 2025.  The f ocus of the companies should be global with high growth potential. Combined  revenues should be 120 million € - with an average 20 per cent EBITDA. Combined Tax  revenue in 2025 – 4.3 million € (assuming a profit before Tax of 16.8 million € and an  average tax rate of 25 % ). 500 jobs will have been created.  The impact on the environment  should be measurab le - products and services should reduce  energy consumption by 30%  of the processes they will be employing  globally. Stakeholders should include: Ministry of  the Economy (Owner) – Fit for Start Program; Ministry of the Environment;  Nyuko/Technoport; Inter national Experts and Mentors; Lux Innovation  – Fit 4 Start  Program; University researchers, etc. Startup s selected would receive 50.000 €. Resources  needed: total budget over 3 years - 1.5 million €. Expenses for international mentors,  training and client e ngagement services: Accelerator program would include the facilitation  of 150 meetings with potential clients over a 3 month period; Lean Canvas Methodology -  200 € a year - Total 600.000 €).  Total expenses for the 3 -year program: 2.1 million €.  Companies wo uld be able to pitch for additional funds once they see sales traction –  through accessing additional funding or pitching to the Eco Innovation Seed Fund – 20  Million € endowment. (See measure: “Develop a private equity investment fund for  industry oriente d projects and companies in Luxembourg”).      5.3 Develop a private equity investment fund for industry oriented projects  and companies in  Luxembourg. When developing a vision for the “Industry” Pillar in the Third  Industrial  Revolution Lëtzebuerg , the working group identified an absence of seed and venture capital  for industry projects and companies. We see three specific types of needs: 1) Spin -offs from  Research and Industry lack offers for seed capital in conjunction with  existing managerial 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               244     support (e.g. LuxInnovation) (equity needs of approximately 0.2 – 1.0 Euro million per  project); 2) Luxembourg’s industrial companies lack equity providers for growth projects  (especially if companies cannot meet  balance sheet re quirements of commercial banks  –  equity needs of approximately 0.5 – 5.0 Euro million per project); 3) Foreign direct investors  sometimes need equity pr oviding partners in Luxembourg aside from strategic industrial  partners  (equity needs of approximately 1.0 – 10 Euro million per proje ct).  A private equity  fund focused on industry would assist  companies that are working in the industrial sector in  their growth projects. This would accelerate growth of Luxembourg ’s industrial activity. The  setup of a private equity investment fund can b e accomplished in approximately 10 months.  The following development phases are foreseen: a) Developing a strategy paper for the  fund (fund strategy, ideal investors, ideal projects, project funnel, industry focus,  management structure, etc) –Months 1 -3 b) Marketing of the fund towards principal   stakeholders including potential investors – Months  4 -6; c) Preparation of operations  (recruiting management team, defining main processes,  marketing of the fund towards  the public, etc. – Months 7 -9; d) Operation al start of the fund – Month 10 . Involved   stakeholders inclu de: The Luxembourgish government  aims to increase the percentage of  industrial production within the nation ’s gross domestic product. Universities and research  institutions have an interest in spinning off  technical business es and ensuring their success.   Companies have an interest in finding  adequate fu nding for their growth projects . Business  consultants (coaches for start -ups and entrepreneurs) and semi -public institutions  (e.g.  LuxInnovation)   have an interest in helping entrepreneurs to finance, set up , and grow their  business (ideas) by developing their strategies and partner networks . Key challenges are:   1) securing investors of the fund; 2) developing a partner network that identifies pro jects  and fills the project funnel; 3) recruiting a competent management team; and, 4) engaging a  competent advisory board that acts in the interest of the fund.  Resources needed: A first  fund should have a capital of approximately 15 -30 million  Euro, dep ending on the  investment project mix, to be invested within approximately three years. Project exit should  be possible within three to five years.  A management team requires an industry specialist  and a private equity fund specialist, plus support (approx imately 0.5 millon Euro expenses  per annum).     5.4 Partner with the financial and insurance sector  in setting up an Internet platform,  incorporating a triple or quadruple helix knowledge network with government, academia  and other stakeholders, to examine the range of financial instruments that can be applied  for accelerating Smart Industry start -ups, scale -ups, and expansion of domestic and  export business model innovation.  Disruptive start -up opportunities should be examined  for within existing companies (e.g . a skunks work) and new ones.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               245     5.4.1 Preferably, as with all of the other proposals, the objective is to align initiatives so that  the accumulated learning curves and experience curves provide spillover, crossover and  transversal benefits.    5.4.2 A large and expand ing portfolio of public and private financial tools have become  available, spanning a broad range of discount rates, IRR requirements, diversified risk  strategies, differing timeframes, and levels of financing.    5.4.3 Familiarity with and experience in using th ese diverse financial instruments is a valuable  component of developing an IoT -based Knowledge -as-a-Service.        6 Educational     6.1 Make companies fit for digitization (Internet of Things, IoT); define support measures –  check if R&D support measures are available (e.g. the new R&D law) for digitization of  production process.  A set of disruptive digital technologies will transform the  manufacturing industry. The digitization of the manufacturing sector will become a reality  and a challenge for industrial c ompanies. It is , at the same time , an opportunity for the local  players to render their production more efficient, to save on resources, time, money and  energy and to focus on the real added value. Therefore, technical guidance and financial  support will b e needed, especially for SMEs. Stakeholders to include: companies, Fedil,  Luxinnovation, Chambre de Commerce , and the Ministry of Economy. Challenges include  raising awareness among companies that digitization of production processes has become a  reality. Give guidance on: How will digital disrupt existing industries/business models?  Where should a company make investments in infrastructure, cybersecurity, and  partnerships?  Build use cases/showcases (IoT/Digitization of production process) to  demonstrate t o companies what is possible and feasible, through PPP projects, e.g. LIST,  University plus three to five companies. How to handle the huge amount of data collected?  How to make value out of it? For example: “Big Data in Manufacturing”; sensitive robotics;   energy and resource efficiency, etc. What can be the role of the existing Learning Factory  (http://www.learningfactory.lu/ )? Educate students and industry in “Operational  Excellence .”  6.2 Expand re -skilling and up-skilling workers in a digitalized and automated work  environment.  Investment in initial education to provide future workers with the high skills  needed to leverage  technology advances. Reform of the vocational training policy to ensure  ready access to r etraining services so that every employee has a fair shot to react to 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               246     evolutions induced by the Third Industrial Revolut ion. Stakeholders include  the g overnment  which  needs to invest and initiate reforms in initial education and vocational training to  make  the system of education and life -long learning fast enough to race ahead with  machines instead of racing against them; social partners who need to actively participate in  the anticipation of future needs and in the reforms of initial and vocational traini ng policies;  businesses  that need to anticipate the re -skilling of their workers; and universit ies (science,  technology , and engineers) need to offer related education programs (Bachelor, Master,  PhD, life -long learning). Challenges to be faced and to be t aken into account include: Now,  the employees who participate most in trainings are the highly qualified ones. It is  necessary to: enable each employee to obtain a diploma, a professional qualification or  certification to grow professionally through life -long learning, career enhancement periods,  Validation of the Acquisition of Experience (VAE), etc. and ensure the access of all workers  to skills training by removing access barriers (especially for low skilled ones): reduce training  registration fee s; adapt work organization and provide periods dedicated to up -skilling  training. Create critical mass, e.g. in robotics by combining skills and competencies of  universities of the greater region (Lux, Saar, Lorraine, Wallonia) to provide industry with a  comprehensive offer in advanced industrial robotics. (offering tailored research and in depth education)  - Expand the offer of vocational training and increase the responsiveness  of the vocational training policy to changes that will occur with the TIR. The  National  Training Centre (CNFPC) need to constantly adapt the training offer and provide more  continuous training programs targeted for industry.  -Develop "work based learning"  actions with a close relationship between enterprises and the formal educatio n system.  Resources required include:  Given the social nature of the measures to be implemented, a  public co -funding is needed to invest in initial education and vocational training. The  creation of a joint fund for training in industry is encouraged to c omplement existing  financial mechanisms in vocational training. Adaptation of existing legal texts that are not  mixed: collective access (1.) on one side and individual access (2.) on the other side: 1.  Continuing vocational training: social partners agree ment (2nd May 2003) and the Grand Ducal Regulation (30th March 2006); 2. Law of 24th October 2007 that gives rights to  employees to take leave for individual training.     6.3 Help educators design new curricula that incorporate the kinds of new aptitudes, skill s  and competences vital for IoT specifically, and the TIR more broadly.   Curricula should  include increasing intellectual capital through the STEM subjects (science, technology,  engineering, maths), as well as enhancing human and social capital skills thro ugh team  learning, brainstorming, communication, and designing and carrying out diverse projects. 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               247     The curricula should not be limited to classroom instruction, but include onsite apprentice  programs, real -world field experience, and online collective intel ligence networks (COINs).     6.4 Young people are rapid adopters of IoT technologies through gaming, social media, and  imaginative play and creation with 3D virtual reality and augmented reality devices (and  soon additive manufacturing with the availability of l ower cost 3D printers).    Teachers are  less likely to be as conversant as students with many of these IoT technologies. Cultivating  sophisticated and advanced skills, then, in the use of the myriad IoT/IoS/IoN tools and  technologies, should be developed th rough peer -to-peer initiatives, as well as through  reverse mentoring venues.  Reverse mentoring is on the uptake in business, where new  young IoT -savvy employees are being paired in reverse mentoring situations with IoT challenged veteran employees and sen ior executives.  An initiative with the aim of  promoting jobs in industry will start soon in Luxembourg: http://www.hellofuture.lu/ .      7 Research, Development & Innovation     7.1 Foster innovation and R&D in the field of temporary energy storage.  Use the example of  Luxembourg to progress in the development of advanced technologies for temporary  energy storage, including energy conversion at high efficiencies as well as the development  of energy recovery or multiple use of energy (e.g. use off -heat generated by cooling  processes to heat buildings or fresh water , etc. ). Industries could play a very important role  in the balancing in the grid while more unpredictable productions come to the market and  while storage capacities remain limited. Industry could operate fuel switches or react  thanks to flexible production levels and connected flexible production installations.  Common projects and actions have to be developed with industry. The main challenge is  the development of new  technologies, which allow a reversible conversion at highest  efficiency between different types of energies, as well as storage and recovery without  losses. Infrastructures required for these processes have to be at affordable costs  (investment and operat ion). Beyond this, so -called “smart grid” approaches, namely  including small unit power generators (few MW), which can further help to compensate the  imbalance between the global consumption and production, remain to be further  developed and could be part of the project focus. As transportation and logistics represent  a significant percentage in Luxembourg’s global energy consumption, these aspects could  be included as well. Develop a precise common vision amongst all stakeholders and define  priorities in t he technical R&D efforts. Set -up a shared fund and fund management system.  Gather a competent global project directors team, consisting of technical experts and other 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               248     stakeholders. Set the right incentives for the industry as a “user ” and “developer ” of  storage technologies. Investors could be public -private partnerships, including the main  industrial players (in their role as energy consumers).  Main R&D resource for the technical  development could be start -ups developing new processes and business models (many of  them are already working on the topic).  Developing approximate total investment  estimates will require the input of experts of the field (e.g. via consulting companies).   7.2 Spearhead an applied RDI joint consortium on ecologically sustainable, circul ar economy based on additive manufacturing and 3D printing resources and production processes.    With strong support by the government, L uxembourg’s research institutes in manufacturing  innovation in specialized industries should expand their leadership into advanced green,  clean and sustainable AM and 3D printing processes and resource materials .  7.3 Promote Smart Building Materials, with the research financed by both private and public  funds. The construction sector has to meet very high standards as regard s the energy  efficiency of buildings. Unfortunately,  many of the  building materials used to achieve this  goal have a poor environmental performance, as their production process is highly energy  intensive and their recycling is often troublesome if not impo ssible. A notable example is  expandable polystyrene (often referred to as “styropor”) used to insulate the facade of a  building. An assessment evaluating the environmental impact of the use of such a product  would reveal its negative effects relating to th e volume of energy needed to produce it and  the problematic disposal of it one its life cycle has come to an end.  A link can also be made  to the work of the WG “Building s,” suggesting entirely new ways to build houses.  “Lego based architectural design co ncept defined (buildings that can be almost entirely rebuilt   based on the same materials, fully disassembling).”  This idea is different from the one  mentioned above but it can be seen as a complementary element of a strategy aimed at  mak ing the building p rocess smarter.  Luxembourg could create a cluster comprising both  the industrial and the construction sector as well as public research institutes to develop  and ideally produce building materials which meet, or even exceed, the required efficiency  standa rds while their production process is less energy consuming and which are 100%  recyclable.   7.4 Engage research faculty and students to undertake applied research initiatives such as the  BMI proposal to develop a real -time data inventory and visual mapping platform of all the  energy, water and resource consuming equipment and processes in industry.  Students  and faculty gain real -world applied research experience, strengthen their aptitude and  competences, and help generate knowledge assets that other faculty and students can  build upon.

The production of CAD (Computer -  aided design) should automatically be implemented without losing time (ongoing  research) .   7.5.2 Computer Modelisation: modeling products and simulat ing their behavior, employing  the rich portfolio of d ata visualization, 3D virtual reality, and augmented reality tools.   7.5.3 Rapid Prototyping/ Additive manufacturing: create a prototype with physical properties  similar to the final product, in order to reduce concept -to-fabrication costs and time.  The fabricati on of finished products with complex shapes could be realized.   7.5.4 Open Innovation: promote the open innovation process by designing the collaborative  innovation network (COIN) platform to be open source, open access, and open device,  and foster the externaliz ation of research and development by including partners,  clients and suppliers.                           
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               250     FINANCE   OVERVIEW   Luxembourg is  an important financial center  at the heart of Europe. Banks, Investment  Funds, Insurance and reinsurance companies  and a multitude of specialized service  providers use Luxembourg as a hub to provide  banking services, asset management,  corporate lending, f und administration and  cross border distribution to a wide range of  international private and institutional  customers. Luxembourg's state of the art  infrastructure encompassing a high quality  legislative, regulatory and supervisory framework places its fin ancial center at the forefront of  innovation.   The convergence of the Communication Internet, Renewable Energy Internet, and automated  Transportation and Logistics Internet, atop an Internet of Things infrastructure, enables the  financial sector in Luxembou rg to reinvent financial services in a smart digital Third Industrial  Revolution economy.   The emerging “Finternet of Things” (the Financial Internet of Things) will transform every  aspect of financial services, foster new business models, and reshape the i ndustry over the  course of the coming decade. Financial services, more than any other industry, relies on the  collection, analysis, and transfer of data. No wonder industry analysts view the IoT as a game  changer for the financial services sector. Sensors connecting every device across the value chain  will generate Big Data in every sector of the economy, giving banks, other financial institutions,  and insurance companies a steady flow of vital economic data in real time. The data can be  mined with analytic s to create algorithms and apps that will allow the financial services industry  to increase aggregate efficiencies and productivity and reduce transactional and marginal cost  in back office functions, the delivery of services to customers, retail payments,  investment  advice, investment decisions, and trading by algorithms. The IoT will also enable banks to issue  virtual currencies.   As a financial powerhouse, Luxembourg has the unique opportunity to strategically consider  financial services that could facil itate and accelerate the transition to a digitally interconnected  Third Industrial Revolution economy. Critically, such reinvention undergirds a strategic Co-Chairs Pierre Ahlborn and Marc Wagener , and  the Luxembourg Finance  Working Group;   John Byrne (Foundation for Renewable Energy  and Environment), Job Taminiau (Foundation for  Renewable Energy and Environment), Michael  Casey (AGENTIC), Rik Willard (AGENTIC), John  “Skip” Laitner (Economic and Human Dimensions  Research Associates), and Jeremy Rifkin, TIR  Consulting Group LLC  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               251     reimagination of Luxembourg’s fundamental infrastructure components; communication,  energy, mobility,  buildings – all are now subject for a digital transformation. The potential of  such application is considerable. For instance, initial assessment reveals a nationwide €5.8  billion self -financing investment opportunity in building energy efficiency and roo ftop solar  energy alone. Similar investment levels could be applied in other sectors of the economy.  Indeed, Cisco reports that the digital transformation may drive “US $1.3 trillion of value at stake  in the financial services industry .” This, in turn,  can facilitate many other major investments and  market transactions that  will benefit the economy as a result of lower costs of energy  services.198   Future data management and digital technology infrastructure are positioned as key  component s of the transit ion to a TIR economy. Intelligent linking of the various technologies  (e.g., microfinancing, blockchain, crowdfunding, digitalization of infrastructure) can accrue  knock -on benefits that accelerate the TIR transition. For instance, energy efficiency effort s can  benefit from technologies that allow for real -time, digitalized data production regarding energy  consumption and precise calculation of avoided energy use through energy conservation  measures. Real -time data can, for example, pin -point peak shaving o pportunities, harvest  additional energy savings, ensure investor confidence due to enhanced data analytics, and  diagnose any potential energy saving shortfalls. 199 As such, data could both enable savings and  automate the measurement of actual whole -building  energy savings across a portfolio of  aggregated end -users. A big part of the promise of the new approach is its power in scale and  precision.   The maturation of the Internet has also spawned innovative new funding mechanisms including  crowd funding and mi cro currencies. With crowd funding, originators of a project put their plan  up on a site and pick a deadline by which the necessary funds have to be raised. If the goal is  not reached by this deadline, no funds are collected. This provision ensures that th e project has  enough financing to at least make a go of the venture. Various crowdfunding platforms offer  different forms of compensation. Donors can either pledge funds as gifts or receive the  comparable value of the funds extended to the borrower in the form of goods or services once  the project is up and running, or provide funds as a straight loan with interest, or invest in the  project in return for equal shares. Crowdfunding enthusiasts emphasize that it’s not about the  money. They enjoy being intimat ely involved with helping others pursue their dreams and feel  that their small contribution packs a wallop —that it really counts in moving a project forward.                                                            198 See: Cisco White Paper. 2015.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               252     Alternative currencies, often referred to as community currencies, local exchange trading  systems (LETS), or micro currencies, began to take hold in locales around the world after the  economic collapse of 2008. Alternative micro currencies are really social currencies that enable  the collaborative exchange of goods and services to flourish in the Shari ng Economy. As in other  areas of the Sharing Economy, people are bypassing the middlemen, the markups, and the  interest rates imposed by credit card companies, and exchanging their labor time directly with  one another.   But what makes this different from ol d-fashioned, one -on-one bartering of services is that Web generated apps provide individuals with a mechanism to store and use points, represented by  comparable labor time, for the exchange of all kinds of goods and services, in both the social  economy and  market economy.   There are more than 4,000 micro currencies in circulation around the world. Many of them are  based on the labor time one person gives to another in making a good, repairing an item, or  performing a service. The hours are stored in a time b ank, just like cash, and exchanged for  other hours of goods and services.   Other community currencies traded in LETS are designed to facilitate the exchange of goods.  The WIR currency in Switzerland credits sales against future purchases for its members. Wh en a  seller receives credit for an item sold, it can be spent buying another item from another WIR  member.   Community currencies are also employed, in part, to prevent wealth from leaking out of the  community. BerkShares, in the Berkshire region of Massachu setts, is one of a number of social  currencies that is designed to encourage local buying. Members purchase BerkShares from any  of the six banks in the region at the same exchange rate as the dollar, with a little extra bonus.  If a member deposits $95, he or she is given $100 worth of BerkShares from the bank, making  the exchange a net gain for the member. He or she then uses the shares to purchase goods and  services in local business establishments, which ensures that the money continues to circulate  in th e local economy.   Virtual currencies like Bitcoin are also proliferating in peer -to-peer digital networks. Industry  analysts expect to see the emergence of thousands of virtual currencies circulating on new  digital platforms in the coming decades. Luxembour g’s financial services industry is likely to  play a prominent role in establishing the new virtual currencies or managing the accompanying  platforms.   Bitcoin and other virutual currencies have suddenly become viable because of the emergence  of Blockchain technology. This new technology, once perceived as a threat to the very existence 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               253     of the financial sector, is beginning to be embraced by financial institutions anxious to reduce  fixed and marginal cost in their day -to-day business operations. Blockchain i s a digital  distributed ledger which allows parties to log transactions directly with one another,  eliminating intermediaries and centralized clearing houses. The near zero marginal cost of  blockchain transactions disrupts the conventional financial indust ry model, forcing the sector to  adapt or perish.   The new digitally mediated funding mechanisms make possible a new generation of investment  capabilities that foster a higher level of economic performance.200 Digital financial literacy go  hand -in-hand with t he new digital financial platforms and require a wholesale transformation in  financial education.  This should be a key priority, given Luxembourg’s status as one of the  leading financial capitals in the world.   A Synergistic Deployment of the Integrated P roposals Holds Considerable Promise   Plugging into an Internet of Things infrastructure and creating new business models will  reposition the financial sector in Luxembourg as the leader in the new digital economy.  European investment on infrastructure -related projects totaled $741 billion in 2012, much of it  to shore up a second industrial revolution general purpose technology platform that is  outmoded, and whose productivity potential has long since been reached.201 If just twenty five  percent of these funds were redirected and earmarked in every region of the European Union  to assemble an Internet of Things infrastructure, the Digital Union could be phased in between  now and 2040. Clearly, Luxembourg’s financial sector will play a critical  role in the investment  opportunities that accompany the build out and scale up of an Internet of Things smart Digital  Europe.   The European Investment Bank has recently reprioritized its lending criteria for the allocation of  regional development funds. I n the quest to advance the Digital Europe agenda and the  integration of an integrated single market, the EIB has prioritized funds focusing on the key  pillars that make up the infrastructure for the Internet of Things platform. These priorities  include all ocation of funds for the research, development, and deployment of digital  communication and Big Data, the digital Energy Internet, the digital Transportation and  Logistics Internet, and the adaption of digital technologies for smart buildings. European  Investment Bank funds are often leveraged with additional private funds to provide the  financial resources necessary for the build out of the new digital infrastructures. Nations like  Luxembourg seeking investment funds are best -served by developing road maps  that transform  their jurisdictions into fully digitalized economies.                                                            200 Willard, Rik and Michael Casey, The Agentic Group, The Blockcha in Opportunity in Luxembourg (May 19, 2016).   201 See: http://www.reuters.com/article/us -europe -infrastructure -slowdown -idUSBRE92R04H20130328  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               254     STATE OF PLAY AND LUXEMBOURG VISION   “Luxembourg: a sustainable, world -class financial hub at the vanguard of the digital revolution  making transformation happens.” The Finance Working Group (FWG) has had the opportunity  to sketch an overarching vision of where the financial sector - and the finance framework as  such - will head in 2020 and beyond. This vision strives to reflect the future desired state of the  financial framework. Setting aspirations first helps to set goals and objectives designed to make  the vision happen later. Key elements  to make the vision happen include:    A resilient and diversified international financial sector servicing customers in  Luxembourg, Europe , and the  world    A financial cent er that incorporates the digital revolution successfully    A financial cent er with a hig h capacity to adapt its offer in order to facilitate the TIR    A world -class framework for data protection and infrastructure for e -service    A worldwide leading hub for financial innovation, SRI and transparency where impact  and socio -economic sustainability  go hand -in-hand     The Financial Underpinnings of a More Productive Luxembourg Economy   If the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg is to elevate its level of economic performance to meet or  exceed expectations of the Third Industrial Revolution, it will need both pur poseful effort and a  different pattern of investments.  By purposeful effort we mean the set of new skills, smart  policies and programs that enable the development and deployment of energy efficiency  upgrades, renewable energy technologies and , more broadl y speaking, the substantial upgrade  of its existing infrastructure. The latter includes buildings, industrial operations, transportation  and telecommunication services, power and water supplies, etc.  By a different pattern of  investment, we refer to a hig her level of annual outlays in those infrastructure upgrades which  move away from the current generation of Second Industrial Revolution technologies and  toward Third Industrial Revolution digital technologies – the Communication Internet, the  Renewable En ergy Internet, and the automated Transportation and Logistics Internet atop an  Internet of Things platform.   As of 2014 Luxembourg is a €49 billion economy as measured by its Gross Domestic Product, or  GDP.202 While a small nation of 563,000 inhabitants, it has one of the highest per capita GDP s in  the world. Like all nations, however, it must confront the social and economic reality of both                                                           202 Luxembourg in Figures 2015, STATEC (Institut national de la statistique et des étude économiques), September.

The reason that  climate change has become such a big problem is the hugely inefficient use of energy and other  resources that results in the pumping of large quantities of greenhouse gas emissions into the  atmosphere  all around the globe .204 Were both Luxem bourg and the global economy twice as  energy -efficient as they are today, by definition only half of the energy -related greenhouse gas  emissions would be forced into the upper atmosphere. At the same time, the very reason that  the climate is burdened by an  excess of greenhouse gas emissions is the same reason the  economy is constrained by an array of costs which robs it of its overall vitality —that is, the  wholly inefficient use of energy and other resources. Hence there is the very real need to solve  both the climate and the economic problems together, through much greater emphasis on the  productive use of assets and resources. And here is where Luxembourg has a critical asset – its  financial prowess and strength – which must be redirected toward a more pro ductive  transformation of its technologies and infrastructure.   According to the data maintained by STATEC, t he Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has an estimated  3.3 Euros of capital stock for each Euro of GDP.205  In 2014, therefore, the nation’s total capital  stock was estimated at about €168 billion. Building stock is about €95 billion while transport is  €18.8 billion.206 There are two elements worth noting here. First, and most interesting,  Luxembourg appears to transform only 32 percent of total economic activity into GDP.  This is  closely related to Luxembourg  being  a very open economy, with exports reaching 213% of GDP  and imports 178%.                                                             203 Perhaps as a timely reminder of the growing problem of climate change, the weather editor for the Washington  Post,  Jason Samenow writes in a 16 May 2016 news story that the average temperature of the planet was 1.11  degrees Celsius above the long -term ave rage in April, shattering the old record from 2010 by 0.24 degrees Celsius.  He notes further that “2016’s average global temperature is so far out in front of any preceding year that climate  scientists say there’s basically no way it won’t become the warme st ever recorded.” See, Earth’s relentless streak  of record -warm months expands to seven .  204 By way of co mparison, the TIR Master Plan for Nord -Pas de Calais suggested an eventual efficiency  improvement that could reduce total energy use by about one -half with renewable energy technologies meeting  all remaining energy needs by 2050. This would effectively bri ng that region’s energy -related carbon emissions  down to zero. See, Nord -Pas de Calais Third Industrial Revolution Master Plan – 2013 , Jeremy Rifkin, Benoit Prunel,  Solenne Bastie, Francis Hinterman, John Laitner and Shawn Moorhead. Bethesda, MD: TIR Consulting Group LLC.  2013. For yet a different approach that relies more heavily on renewable energy technologies throughout the  world’s economies, see Jacobson, Mark and Mark Delucchi et al., 100% Clean and Renewable Wind, Water, and  Sunlight (WWS) All - Sector Energy Roadmaps for 139 Countries of the World , August 9, 2015.   205 Luxembourg in Figures 2015, STATEC (Institut national de la statistique et des étude économiques), September.   206 Perhaps also of interest, information and communication technologies are estimated to be about €1.6 billion.  Needless to say this amount will need to grow dramaticall y if we are to see a fully operational and productive  energy Internet, a logistics and transportation Internet, and a communications Internet that links all buildings and  other elements of the Luxembourg infrastructure. That, of course, will require large -scale investments.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               256     This compares to the United States which generates 56 percent of its output into GDP. A more  productive infrastructure which bui lds on a greater local capacity would likely increase this ratio  and provide the economy with a greater level of resilience for any number of reasons. Second,  Luxembourg has a Gross Fixed Capital Formation of €9 .4 billion per year.    If this is a reasonabl e proxy for annual investment in capital stock (or infrastructure), and if we  anticipate an almost three -fold expansion of the economy by 2050, one can quickly imagine  that 50 years or more may be needed to fully transition the economy from a Second Indust rial  Revolution mode to a Third Industrial Revolution infrastructure. Hence, the need to quickly  aggregate both supply and demand, and to accelerate the redirection of capital away from the  old and into the new. This brings us then to a key idea: an emergi ng coalescence around the  establish ment of  a Luxembourg Sustainable Development Finance Platform (LSDFP). This  proposal was first referenced by the Luxembourg Financial Working Group.207   The LSDFP complements the three key ideas set forth by the TIR Consulting Team: (a) the need  to build up a more productive capacity in the Grand -Duchy of Luxembourg through the more  efficient use of energy and other resources208; (b) the implementation  of a n adapted   Sustainable Energy Finance (SEF) model  to augment via bond issuers and private financial  sector actors,  the scale of phased -in capital that is required to transition Luxembourg into a  Third Industrial Revolution economy209; (c) the deployment of a new set of blockchain  technologies that can reinvigorate  the national investment capacity to continue the steady  march toward a higher level of economic performance.210 Financial education and financial  literacy have also been identified as key enablers and p riorities going forward. Moreoever, both  the Financial Working Group and the TIR Consulting Team have also advanced a series of  complementary financial strategies that can further build out the contribution of the financial  community.   In the discussion th at follows, these key elements are presented as a series of five  complementary proposals that might accelerate the economic performation of Luxembourg.  Proposal 1 focuses on the Luxembourg Sustainable Development Finance Platform as  envisioned by the Worki ng Group on Finance, accompanied by the Sustainable Energy Finance  model . Proposal 2 describes the potential development and deployment of the Blockchain                                                           207 See generally, TIR – Pillar “Finance” – Document de restitution (2 May 2016).   208 Laitner, John A. “Skip”, Exploring the Economic Benefits of the TIR Innovation Scenarios (19 May 2016); see also  Robert Wilhite Kathleen Gaffney, and Tiffany Chow, Navigant Consulting, Inc., The Third Industrial Revolution for  Energy - Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (19 May 2016).   209 Byrne, John and Job Taminiau, Foundation for Renewable Energy and Environment (FREE), Assessment and  Application of Sustainable  Energy Financing as Infrastructure Investment in Luxembourg: A “Sustainable Energy  Finance” (SEF) Strategy (19 May 2016).   210 Willard, Rik and Michael Casey, The Agentic Group, The Blockchain Opportunity in Luxembourg (May 19, 2016).

Proposal 4  provides an overview of a number of supplemental financial strategies. Finally, Proposal 5  describes the mobilization of a larger strategic effort to ensure success within the financial  arena.   PROPOSALS   Proposal 1: A Sustainable Development Finance Strategy   1.1 The Luxembourg Sustainable Development Finance Platform   The key project and recommendation in this section regarding the Financial sector as an  enabler consists in the creation of a central interface platform that would support the financing  of investable projects in  all the pillar sectors of sustainability (economic, social, environmental),  including TIR projects (but not limited to), as well as their promotion among potential investors  and project promoters.   This platform could be called the “Luxembourg S ustainable Development Finance Platform”  (LSDFP). The main idea is to have the “LSDFP” as a body to interface between potential financial  contributors (public and private) and project promoters (public and private) and to assess each  of the projects submit ted in order to ensure compliance with a given set of  eligibility criteria as  well as quality checks on the feasibility of the project, the value creation and the output of it to  potential investors.   Most TIR projects, if not all of them, will require  some  sort of financing  and investment . It is  therefore important to connect projects (of all sizes) to all types of potential investors via  different investment channels (see chart here attached).   This platform can provide potential investors and project promo ters with various advantages:    Provide access to privileged information and opportunities.    Allow financial contributors to invest according to their individual risk appetite and  expectations in terms of financial return and impact, including in kind.    Allow project promoters to submit project proposals in line with their policies, missions,  mandates or business plans.    Allow structured and blended financing (public/private) for better risk management (i. e.  through guaranties) and increased leverage.    Provid e quality and compliance certification.   The platform can be set up under the form of a PPP (private -public -partnership, see description  below). Project promoters will need guidance to choose the right financing instruments. The  eligibility of project proposals to the platform should be based on a preliminary assessment.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               258     A wide range of stakeholders will collaborate on the LSDFP. Besides investors and project  owners:    Government (national and local)    Relevant “ Etablissements publics”  (public law bodies)     Professionals and financial institutions/associations (ALFI, ABBL, ACA, Insurance  Companies…); Intermediate Financial Advisors    Asset managers    Audit firms    Luxembourg Stock Exchange LuxFlag211    UNPRI expert in Luxembourg212    Interested private sector companies PPPs    Civil Society Organizations, NGOs   The implementation of this project will help to bridge a gap that still exists between mutually  reinforcing types of (public and private) financial contributors and investors in se arch of  investment opportunities in the field of sustainable development, including the TIR, on the one  side, and project promoters in search of adapted financing for the implementation of their  projects, on the other side.   The results to be expected in th e economic, social and environmental fields will include:    Increased economic and financial activity;    Improved infrastructure (physical and digital) throughout the three constitutive pillars of  sustainable development: economic, social and environmental;    Enabling the pillar sectors and transversal axes of the TIR;    Leverage on private sector investment through smart use of public seed funding and  funding for risk mitigation and technical assistance;    Increased effectiveness and mutual reinforcement, in facing the complex challenges of  sustainable development, through a multidisciplinary and multi -stakeholder approach;    Credible contribution to the global public good of sustainable development and the  implementation of Luxembourg’s national commitments tak en under the universal  agendas of the Sustainable Development Goals (Agenda 2030) and the fight against  climate change (COP21 Paris Agreement);    Better access to education and health care, including in the form of an in natura return;                                                            211 The LUXEMBOURG FUND L ABELLING AGENCY (LuxFLAG) is an independent, nonprofit making, association  created in Luxembourg in July 2006 by seven founding partners who are the Charter Members. The agency aims to  promote the raising of capital for Responsible Investment sector by awa rding a recognisable label to investment  funds. Its objective is to reassure investors that the applicant investment fund invests, directly or indirectly, in the  responsible investment sector. The applicant fund may be domiciled in any jurisdiction that is  subject to a level of  national supervision equivalent to that available in European Union countries.

We may nevertheless need to ensure that the investor can also decide which type of project  and impact they want to invest in. Therefore , the financial solution should be based on two  possibilities : either a financial pool  from which  the project can be financed ; or, on the other  hand , through specific capital calls to further investor commitment.   In terms of resources, we can distinguish between financial resources and non -financial  ones:    Financial resources (both domestic and international):   o Public seed funding and funding for mitigating the risk of private sector investors  and for technical assistance at the project level;   o Private investment ;   o European Funds (e.g. Juncker Plan – Investm ent Plan for Europe).    Non -financial resources:   o Increased capacity for --     defining eligibility criteria,    project sourcing,    project design ad formulation,    project assessment (based on UNPRI  principles?),    financing needs assessment,    outreach to financ ial contributors and project promoters,    quality control, including through a labelling system, defining and  executing a communication plan,    administrative tasks.    Legal framework for crowdfunding and leasing   Figure 1 that follows provides a conceptual overview of how the LSDFP might function, and  encourage a greater collaboration and coordination among key entities within the financial  markets of Luxembourg. At the same time, an information box highlights several of the ke y  characteristics of the LSDFP.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               261      Information  Box: The Luxembourg Sustainable Development Finance Platform – Key Charact eristics   Preliminary remark on the legal form of the LSDFP:   A proper analysis on the optimal legal structure for the platform needs to be carried out. Regardless of the  legal form, the LSDFP is to be established in the spirit of a Public Private Partnership (PPP). Availabe legal  forms include the “classic” non -for-profit organization forms of asbl (“association sans but lucratif”) or  Foundation.   The new legal form of “société d’impact societal” (SIS; legislation pending) may also be considered for the  establishment of the LSDFP. However, in deciding the legal form of the LSDFP, at least two (to some extent  contradictory) aspects must be taken into consideration:    The status of SIS will probably to be bestowed through ministerial accreditation on commercial  companies (S.A., Sàrl, Sociétés en commandite...) and not on not-for-profit organisations (i.e.  asbl).    The SIS may very well be the status that best embodies the spirit of a PPP underlying the concept  of the match -making platform between project promoters and investors, both from the public  and the private sector.   Main characteritics of LSDFP:    LSDFP serves a public mission , i.e. providing sustainable financing for sustainable development.    The objective of this public mission justifies public seed funding  for financial risk mitigation and  technical assistance.    The i mplementation of the public mission requires financial and non -financial input from  private  sector actors .    A commercial perspective  motivates long term engagement of private sector actors.  Private sector actors respect the spirit of the initial public mission .   LSDFP is established and works as an interface between financial contributors in search of investable  projects, on the one hand, and promoters of investable projects, on the other hand. It provides financial  contributors access to investable proj ects in the economic, social and environmental sectors relevant to  sustainable development.   LSDFP launches calls for project proposals in the sectors of sustainable development, including TIR related  project proposals. It provides project promoters access to financial contributors and adapted financial  instruments.   LSDFF proactively reaches out to potential financial contributors and compiles investment proposals and  adapted investment instruments and makes them available to project promoters.   Luxembourg Sustainable Development Finance Platform (LSDFP) further details on:     People (Stakeholders)   o LSDFP is established and works as an interface between:    International and domestic financial contributors/investors (public, private,  institutional) and Intermediate Financial Advisors (IFA) in search of investable  projects, and    Promoters of investable projects, including in TIR related sectors.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               262                                                 Process ( Functions)   o LSDFP provides technical assistance to the promoters in the preparation phase of their   respective project. LSDFP analyses the demand for financing of investable projects and the  offer/availability of financing from public, private, institutiona l and blended sources.   o LSDFP advises and provides investors and IFA information on and access to investable   projects in the economic, social and environmental sectors relevant to sustainable  development, including/primarily the TIR related sectors:    LSDFP l aunches calls for project proposals in the sectors of sustainable  development, including the TIR related sectors.    LSDFP assesses the eligibility of project proposals and rates the project against  criteria such as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), th eir targets and  indicators (as approved by the United Nations) as well as the GRI criteria and  definitions, respectively their relevance in relation to the TIR.  The indicators,  flowing from the Sustainable Development Goals and their related targets,  acco rding to which the eligibility of sector projects for financing on the basis of the  match -making efforts of the LSDFP is to be assessed, should reach a level of  granularity taking into account relevant national specificities. As to their eligibility,  the s ubmitted projects may be ranked according to the number of SDGs they  credibly intend to serve. They must not produce any counterproductive effects in  relation to the other SDGs, and – in order to foster the social and human character  of projects – they sho uld allow for in -kind investment (i.e. skill sets) and return, as  much as for financial investment and return.   o LSDFP advises and provides project promoters access to potential investors and IFA  and  financial instruments adapted to their project activities.    LSDFP proactively reaches out to potential investors and IFA and compiles financial  commitments and adapted financial instruments and makes them available to  project promoters.    LSDFP proposes financing options to project promoters that are ada pted to the  financing needs of their project activities.   o LSDFP provides a book -keeping function of more or less precisely earmarked financial   commitments and actual financial flows towards and from investable projects.    Technology   o LSDFP organises an online  marketplace where investors/IFA and project promoters  can  meet.   o LSDFP manages a database collecting information about:    IFA and their financial instruments    Project promoters and their investable projects.   o LSDFP capitalises on pre -existing market infrast ructure and capacity (i.e. Angel -List,  European Investment Project Portal (EIPP) and Fundsquare) and explores the need for tailor made algorithms.

Some concluding thoughts and suggestions for the LSDFP :  • The establishment of an LSDFP should not be perceived or interpreted as an attempt of  the public sector to bail out of their existing (i. e. financial) obligations and  commitments, regardless of the se ctor activities that, in the future, may receive  financing through the match -making efforts of the LSDFP. On the contrary, the activities  of an LSDFP should leverage like -minded private investment in addition to existing  funding through the state budget.   • The governance structure of the platform (multistakeholder representation), its IT  infrastructure (adapted to the needs in terms of volume and reliability) and the  necessary skill sets (pluri -disciplinary) for its staff have to be carefully assessed.   • As to  the options to cover the operational cost of the LSDFP, the idea of a membership  fee for investors and a handling fee per project could be addressed.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               264       1.2 The Luxembourg Sustainable Energy Finance Program (LuxSEF)   As indicated in in the overview discuss ion, a critical financial mechanism that would underpin  the interaction between supply and demand for sustainable energy resources at infrastructure scale is called LuxSEF. LuxSEF operates in parallel to the LSDFP, in particular connecting with  participant s who have been informed and motivated by LSDFP , and who, in turn, can  design   and implement cost -effective energy efficiency and renewable energy investment  projects. It  enables infrastructure -scale change through structured and standardized arrangements  between capital providers, ESCOs, and program participants (public and private). Such a model  is necessary when one considers the significant self -funding potential that is available within  Luxembourg . By way of example, we can illustrate the potential scal e of a Phase I investment  scenario to upgrade the Luxembourg building stock to a higher level of energy performance.   Table 1 summarizes an assessment of the self -funding investment potential of buildings which  might be upgraded in the Grand Duchy. The inv estment magnitudes, a t full potential, cover  both rooftop solar energy and energy efficiency upgrades, amount ing to €5.8 billion over the  next ten years or so.  Of this €5.8 billion, the energy efficiency  investment potential is €3.2  billion while rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV) represent  €2.6 billion.  Further details  underpinning the magnitude of potential investmensts are provide d in subsequent discussions  that follow.213  Table 1.

This can unlock transformative, infrastructure -scale level investment and change. In  short, LuxSEF supports the work of LSDFP as it:    Packages Luxembourg community’s need for a more productive and sustainable  economy into actionable and financeable portfolios  that can attract low -cost capital,  and do so at a scale and rate of return that is attractive to investors;    Relies on standardized transactions  on a common, standardized documents platform  that accelerates supply and demand of sustainable energy finance a nd keeps  transaction costs low;    Guarantees energy and Euro savings  for investors and program participants alike that  match or exceed all financing and capital costs; and    Enables the market and stakeholders, including Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), civi l  society organizations, investors, relevant public law bodies, and intermediate financial  advisors, to collaborate in scaling up a Third Industrial Revolution transition.   To do so, the mechanism needs to be:    Self-financing: SEF economics do not require r egulated price increases to cover  renovation costs nor rely on taxes to capitalize renovation.    Market -tested: The SEF strategy draws from a $72.5 million market -tested application  that was rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s rating service. Other programs have  since been  implemented in California, Washington DC, and Pennsylvania.    Capable of unlocking a suite of technologies: The mechanism can be applied to a wide  range of different technologies.    Flexible: Different jurisdictions present different legal, policy and other conditions that  require the financial mechanism to be adaptable to local circumstances.    Capable of offering a broad range of benefits.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               266     1.2.1 SEF Characteristics Relevant to Luxembourg   At its core, the SEF model is anchored by an economic perspective that builds on a basic  principle of energy efficiency, or energy productivity, as it is made specific to Luxembourg --that  is, monetizing an array of savings which cost less than paying the reta il price for energy, water  and materials as the source of its capital investments. For example, a recent study of the  institutional building stock in Luxembourg found retrofit costs of 0.04 to 0.08 €/  kWh for the  majority of floor area in their sample. 214 The 2014 cost of electricity was 0.166 and 0.075  €/kWh for households and industry, respectively. The cost to save energy, therefore, is  considerably below the cost to use  that energy.    The gap between the cost to buy energy and the cost to save energy forms the basis for capital  investment. In other words, the direct savings (or the use of renewable energy to lower the use  of more expensive  energy resources ) are used to pay back initial investments that enable  the  reductions. Critically, SEF economics avoid the practice of many governmental and regulatory  programs currently in use which assess end users for funds that conventional utilities operate  to meet s ustainability goals. As such, SEF economics do not require regulated utility price  increases to cover renovation costs. SEF economics similarly does not rely on taxes to capitalize  renovation but reaps social advantages such as benefiting low -income househ olds.215   Capital investments are used to procure energy, water, and material conservation measures  and on -site renewable energy options to lower participants’ costs. Figure 3  offers a conceptual  overview of the SEF arrangement: capital investments are attra cted to implement energy  efficiency measures and renewable energy options up to the maximum point of savings  that  can be covered without raising the original energy costs of the participant. After debt service  payments have fully paid back the capital inve stments, over a period of 10 -14 years, all  remaining savings accrue to the participant of the program over the next 6 -10 years or so (with  the assumption of a typical project life of 20 years).                                                            214 Hoos, T., Merzkirch, A., Maas, S., Scholzen, F.

Conceptual overview of reduction of energy use an d costs for program  participants under SEF programming.   1.2.1.1 SEF: A Market -Tested Model     The SEF investment model was first applied in the United States. Operationalized through the  Delaware Sustainable Energy Utility (SEU) 216  in the U.S. state of Delaware, on behalf of six state  agencies and two institutions of higher learning, the Sustainable Energy Bond Series was issued  in 2011. The state -wide, tax -exempt bond issue raised $72.5 million in sustainable energy  capital from t he private market, sufficient to invest in energy saving measures that deliver a  guaranteed $148 milli on in aggregate energy savings.217 All-in program costs, including                                                           216 The SEU concept is the result of 20 years of research conducted by Dr. John Byrne and his colleagues at the  Center for Energy & Environmental Policy (CEEP) at the University  of Delaware. Additional information on the  model can be found at http://freefutures.org/seu -initiative/ .    217 Original planned issuance of the bonds stood at $67.4 million. However, a verage coverage of  orders and  allotments by maturity of the DE SEU bond offering was 1.2x. In addition, the $67.4 million par value Sustainable  Energy Bond was oversold within two hours of its offering. The serial bond issue generated premiums in excess of  $5 million and so ld at the low arbitrage yield of 3.67% over its 20 year debt service period.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               268     capitalized interest over the serialized maturity of the financing, were $110 million thu s  generating a $38 million premium benefit for the program participants.218  First year savings of the program are 3% above the guaranteed cost savings of 25%.  219 Annual  energy savings for the Delaware  SEU projects delivers an annual emission reduction of 46.8   million pounds of  carbon dioxide  (CO 2). Additionally, research contrasting the Delaware SEU  with conventional energy utilities in the United States finds considerable SEU outperformance  in terms of realizing energy savings.220 The serialized maturity schedu le of the DE SEU bond  offering provides the opportunity of combining short -term and long -term retrofits: the average  simple payback of the bond offering is 14 years with maturities as long as 20 years. Serialization  additionally enables cash flow optimizat ion resulting in lower overall interest rates: The  maturity schedule includes 1 -year bond maturities at 0.65% borrowing rate all the way up to  20-year maturities (rate = 4.37%) for a 3.67% effective borrowing rate. Noting the strong  general credit quality of the State of Delaware, the contractual guarantee provisions which  include an absolute and unconditional payment provision upon annual appropriation, 221 and  annual payments that are date certain and not subject to acceptance, Standard & Poor’s rated  the s ustainable energy bond at AA+.                                                                218 The Delaware SEU example offers a guide to how the Sustainable Energy Finance (SEF) model can unlock  significant energy savings when applied in a comprehensive strategy: a natio nal application of the model in the  U.S. along the same lines as described in this chapter would present a $25 billion energy investment market in the  public sector alone (i.e. applying the model in municipalities, universities, schools, and hospitals). Wh en applied at  this level, approximately 300,000 additional green jobs and 225 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emission  reduction could be realized.   219 Chu, C., Bruner, A., Byrne, J.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               269     1.2.1.2 LuxSEF: Unlocking Sustainable Energy Technology Portfolios   The LuxSEF option can be applied to a broad range of different technologies. Figure 4 shows  that the LuxSEF option could target, for instance, energy efficiency (in all sectors), sustainable  mobility, energy storage, renewable energy, and distributed generation.  To illustrate, an initial  assessment of LuxSEF application to Luxembourg’s rooftop solar and energy efficiency potential  was performed. This s ection briefly details how LuxSEF unlocks the investment potential of  these two technology options.     Figure 4. Overview of the LuxSEF strategy in relation to a range of technology options.   Energy Efficiency Potential in Luxembourg’s Building Stock   The Th ird National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) highlights the importance and the  opportunity of retrofitting the building stock  in the Grand Duchy . Using STATEC data, the usable  floor space per residential building type can be calculated by year of con struction.222 The  residential building stock captured in the STATEC data represents about 27.4 million m2.  Of  this, 18.7 million m2 can be classified as single family home and 8.7 million m2 as multi -family  home (includes both apartment blocks and semi -residential buildings). Regarding the  commercial building stock, data limitations are discussed in both the Third NEEAP and the TIR  WG ‘Building’ Final Outcome Document. Data availability is li mited to the non -residential                                                           222 Peltier, F. (2015). Regards (06) – sur l e stock des bâtiment et logement.

The total usable non -residential  floor space amounts to 8. 3 million  m2. In addition, public building stock data is, according to the  Third NEEAP, not available at al l. As such, an estimated combined building stock of  approximately 36 million m2 is available in the residential and non -residential market segments.      Estimating Luxembourg’s Rooftop Solar Energy Potential   A recent study from Fraunhofer Institute calculated Luxembourg renewable energy potential.223  Updating the findings from a 2007 study that estimated renewable energy potential, 224  Fraunhofer estimates that Luxembourg has a theoretical potential to generate 33.000 GWh/a  from solar PV. 225 In terms of t echnical potential, and specifically focusing on rooftop  deployment of solar PV (as opposed to PV on land or on building facades), the 2007 study  maintains that 127.000 buildings with an average 168 m2 yields about 21.3 million m2 of  rooftops. Considering that not all rooftops are suitable for PV deployment, the 2007 study uses  a 0.6 discount factor to produce a total rooftop space in the country of 12.8 million m2.226  Under the irradiation conditions and 15% efficiency, this translates to 2.004 GWh/a. Using  updated numbers – specifically an increase of the building stock from 127.000 buildings to an  estimated 160.000 buildings – the 2014 study increases the estimate to  2.524 GWh/a.227 At an  average rooftop space of 168 m2, that translates to a total rooftop space of 26.88 million m2  and, at a 0.6 discount factor, about 16.3 million m2 of rooftops that are available for solar PV  installation.    LuxSEF and Self -Financed Ene rgy Productivity   Strategically, a phased plan for Luxembourg could be developed that pursues energy use  reductions in the high -consumption building stock first (typically the older, non -retrofitted                                                           223 Schon, M., & Reitze, F.

A phased plan could  therefore be to deploy retrofit rounds in two -year increments that each cover 20% of the high consumption building stock for a tot al ten -year strategy.   Energy use conditions in high -consumption building stock can be lowered from the current 190,  160, and 180 kWh/m2a for single family homes, multi -family homes, and non -residential  buildings, respectively to 120 kWh/m2a. Indeed, 120 k Wh/m2a can be considered a  conservative value for retrofitted buildings that have benefitted from short - and long -term  energy conservation measures.229   Energy use conditions in high -consumption building stock can be lowered from the current 190,  160, and 18 0 kWh/m2a for single family homes, multi -family homes, and non -residential  buildings, respectively to 90 kWh/m2a. Indeed, 90 kWh/m2a can be considered a conservative  value for retrofitted buildings that have benefitted from short - and long -term energy  cons ervation measures. Such an approach lowers energy consumption of the high -consumption  stock by approximately 50% which would decrease total built environment energy consumption  by 1.67 billion kWh/a or about 27.5%. This is consistent with case study analys is of deep retrofit  performance.230 The investment potential of such a ten -year deployment corresponds to about  €3.2 billion. In terms of a first phase, where 20% of the high -consumption building stock is  retrofitted to the same level of 90 kWh/m2a, built en vironment energy consumption would be  lowered by 5.5% or about 335 million kWh/a. Such a deployment represents a self -funding  investment of about €665 million.   The contribution to electricity end -use reduction is illustrated in Figure 5 for both a Phase 1 and  a Full Project deployment.                                                            228 Buildings with ‘normal’ consumption patterns and even ‘low’ consumption profiles will likely also be availab le  for retrofitting at lower cost per square meter   229 For instance, Hoos et al. maintain that buildings can be retrofitted to at least 90 -100 kWh/m2a and Merzkirch et  al.

LuxSEF and a “Solar Luxembourg”   A phased  plan for a “Solar Luxembourg” could similarly be deployed in a ten -year timeframe  with five increments of 20%. Full Project potential, Phase 1 potential, and generation level can  be calculated. To allow for comparison, earlier obtained results for Amsterd am and Munich are  given as well.231  Using the solar city assessment framework developed by FREE232, many of the  assumptions held by Fraunhofer were used, with the exception of:    Unlike the two Fraunhofer studies, which both used 15% efficient PV modules in the ir  calculation, we used 20% efficiency levels here. 20% efficiency is in line with current  state -of-the-art in the market and a large -scale deployment as envisaged under a PV  bond offering within a SEF strategy should be able to negotiate high quality PV p anels.233    The framework reduces the Full Project potential estimate as it additionally takes into  account panel -to-panel shading effects and tilt angles of the PV modules.   The estimated Full Project potential stands at 1.38 GWp. It is clear that a signific ant potential  exists within Luxembourg a solar PV deployment would yield approximately 1.35 TWh of                                                           231 See Byrne et al.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               274     1.2.1.3 A Flexible Investment Model that can be replicated to fit Luxembourg’s Context -Specific  Requirements   The SEF investment model has received endorsements from the White House 236 and the Asian  Development Bank. 237 The SEF investment model was further recently highlighted by the  International Energy Agency (IEA) as being a model capable of driving urban energy  transformation. In terms of its application to other contexts, the SEF investment model and the  SEU authori ty model have diffused across the United States and globally.238 SEF models are now  active in Washington, D.C., Pennsylvania, and California. Seoul Metropolitan Government is  actively considering implementation of the application.   An example of SEF diffusio n and context -specific application is the Pennsylvania Sustainable  Energy Finance Program (PennSEF, operated by FREE and partners).239 PennSEF provides  technical and legal assistance, as well as low -cost capital, for energy improvement projects by  municipali ties (including counties and governmental agencies), universities, schools and  hospitals. For instance, the Regional Streetlight Procurement Program (RSLPP) (a program  element of PennSEF), assembles the resources to design, procure and finance the transiti on to  LED street lighting tailored to the specific needs of 40 municipalities in eastern Pennsylvania.  These 40 municipalities together represent over 700 thousand citizens. Importantly, the  PennSEF model shows a slightly different iteration compared to th e Delaware example:  PennSEF relies on an existing authority to issue the bonds – this illustrates the flexibility of th e  model as it can both rely on the creation of new authorities with bond issuing (i.e. the  Delaware example) authority or can rely on exi sting authorities (the PennSEF example where  the bond issuer is the Pennsylvania Economic Development Finance Authority).                                                                  236 https://www.whitehouse.gov/the -press -office/2011/12/02/w e-cant -wait -president -obama -announces -nearly 4-billion -investment -energ   237http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/publication/29817/second -asia-pacific -dialogue -clean -energy.pdf   238 International investigation is, among others, documented in a 2009 special issue of the Bulletin of Science,  Technology, and Society ( Bulletin of Scien ce, Technology & Society. Special issue: Sustainable Energy Utilities: new  energy strategy for the new climate. Volume 29, No. 2) . This special issue contains articles on SEU/SEF  investigations in, inter alia, South Korean, Indian, and African development contexts.   239 The Pennsylvania Treasury Department has partnered with the Foundation for Renewable Energy and  Environment (FREE), with financial support from the West Penn Power Sustainable Energy Fund, to develop a  prudent, market -based investment vehicle that promotes energy and water efficiency, clean energy generation,  economic development and environmental improvement.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               275     1.2.1.4 Benefits of a LuxSEF Application   In the context of sustainable energy finance , a series of SEF’s capitalization mechanism are  offered on a routine basis. Such a strategy has the following benefits:     Extra savings for program participants: Under SEF program mechanics, ESCOs are  incentivized to underestimate savings in order to meet est ablished guarantees and avoid  shortfall penalties. Typically, ESCOs guarantee about 96% of estimated savings.240  Remaining performance benefits program participants. Additionally, savings continue to  accrue beyond term of debt service to the benefit of progr am participants.    Non -energy benefits accrue to participants: Non-energy benefits (e.g., operational savings  or deferred maintenance) can be as much as 40% or more of the total economic savings  generated by such projects.241    Avoidance of interest cost penal ties for small program participants: Through pooled  financing, the program avoids possible interest cost penalties for small jurisdictions.242 This  is also recognized in Luxembourg’s Third National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (p. 31): “To  date, the municip alities in particular have been reluctant to use energy savings contracts.  This may be explained, among other things, by the often small structures of many  Luxembourg municipalities, as in general the economic benefits of savings contracts can  only be achi eved above a certain energy cost threshold .”   Overcomes geographic segmentation: Overcoming issuer size segmentation can also  overcome geographic segmentation as pooled financing opens access to  national/international markets to attract capital and enables rural and urban  participation.243    Economies of scale open  technology options: Pooled financing realizes economies of scale  in the procurement of energy conservation and renewable energy technology. Advanced,  higher cost  technologies become available.                                                            240 Shonder, J. (2013).

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               276     Unlock s deep retrofits: Energy conservation measures with short paybacks (‘low hanging  fruit’) can be used to unlock ‘deep’ retrofit options. ‘Deep’ retrofit options (i.e., measures  with long payback periods) provide significant savings potential – case study an alysis by  Rocky Mountain Institute of ‘deep’ retrofit success stories found an average 58% energy use  reduction.244    Technology portfolio approach: The program can include a wide array of energy, water,  and material conservation measures (electrical and thermal), combined heat and power  (CHP), distributed generation (e.g., solar PV), microgrids, smart energy management, and  transportation infrastructure;    Trains the market for transformative change: Finally, the structured approach outlined in  the SEF strategy primes the market, including ESCOs, issuers, bondholders, and program  participants, for future deployment of follow -up bond issuances. In other word s, the  approach trains ESCOs to operate at a scale previously inaccessible to their project -toproject business model, educates bondholders about the benefits and potential of the  program, and brings in future program participants. In effect, the program c reates and  nurtures an energy conservation and on -site renewable energy market that positions these  energy resources as infrastructure -scale options and trains all involved to reconsider these  energy choices in this manner.     1.2.2 How it could  Work in Lux embourg: Application of LuxSEF   A LuxSEF deployment strategy needs to properly integrate within existing legal frameworks and  leverage the strengths of the local setting, actors and financial ecoystems. In addition, as  visualized in Figure 7 below, LuxSEF a pplication fully considers the parallel deployment of the  LSDFP.  As described above, the LSDFP fulfils the communication function between project  promoters and capital providers. In addition, drawing from lessons learned with community  choice aggregation ( CCA) models, the LSDFP could fulfil a resource aggregation function  (Expansion Building Block, described in the next section).245 Importantly, flexible application  allows for LuxSEF integration into the overall mold presented in Figure 7 and operates under  the explicit recognition that there is no one -size-fits-all SEF -model applicable to all jurisdictions,  regional.   A LuxSEF application needs to, at least, consider the following:                                                            244 Rocky Mountain Institute (RMI) (2015). Deep energy retrofits using energy savings performance contracts:  success stories. Rocky Mountain Institute, Boulder, CO.   245 It is also possible that a separate authority could be established specifically tasked with this function or that an  alternative existing authority is tasked with this aggregation function.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               277     • Contrary to the SEF model as applied in the U.S. state of Delaware, where a newly  established public authority is granted authority to directly issue sustainable energy  bonds, the Luxembourg context suggests that using an existing authority (as is done in  the Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance Program, PennSEF) might be more  appropriate. This is especially true wh en one considers that the LSDFP  does not have the  authority to issue bonds. To enable the LSDFP to issue bonds directly would entail the  burdensome necessity to adopt specific legislation in this sense, which is not  recommended (see also the info box on the LSDFP above).     • As an interface between project promoters and investors, the LSDFP is not meant to  manage financial flows or raise capital itself. Issues regarding liability, regulation and  supervision would be diff icult to address and would risk hampering the main mission of  the LSDFP as a matchmaking interface between project promoters and investors. If the  LSDFP were to issue bonds or raise other funding, it would most probably duplicate  capacities and expertise r eadily available among existing public and private sector actors  (government, banks, companies etc.) with higher professional skills and means (over 3.3  trillion euros of net assets in investment funds and more than 300 billion euros AuM in  Private Banking ). Therefore, we would suggest that the LSDFP should rather focus on  bridging the well identified communication gap between project promoters and  potential investors and engage in “opportunity data mining”. Therein lies its genuine  added value.     • As stated  above, the LSDFP would support the financing of investable projects in all the  pillar sectors of sustainability (economic, social and environmental), including TIR  projects (but not limited to). In this light, the range of projects accompanied by the  LSDFP largely exceeds the realm of energy related projects (energy efficiency,  renewables) closely associated to the SEF model. In this light, LSDFP fully incorporates  energy related projects, but is not limited to the latter.     As outlined in the section o n the Pennsylvania Sustainable Energy Finance Program (PennSEF,  USA), existing authorities or organizations can be used to issue the bonds. As such, there is no  need for the LSDFP to broaden its mandate to include a bond issuing authority. Instead, the  LSDFP can focus on its communication and aggregation functions.   Nevertheless, the LSDFP can play a central role in the LuxSEF strategy. One such role is  visualized in Figure  7. Here, the LSDFP takes up the role of aggregator and interface platform 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               278     between bond issuers / investment fund / loan providers, ESCOs, and the private and public  sector as participating organizations.   The various contractual agreem ents that make up the LuxSEF approach and tie together the  participants (ESCOs, public and private program participants, bond issuer, and investment  funds) need some more explanation. As illustrated in  Figure 7  there are two routes available  that connect p articipating organizations (public and private) to the bond issuer via the LSDFP.  On the left hand side of  Figure 7,  a financing window is opened that is especially attractive to  the private sector. This financing window, which can be called a “service per formance”  financing window, relies on contractual agreements that enable off -balance sheet debt  placement but is accompanied by less aggressive savings. On the right hand side of  Figure 7  a  second financing window, which can be called a “guaranteed savings ” financing window, relies  on a different set of contractual agreements that particularly enable the public sector to pursue  aggressive savings.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               279       Figure  7. Overview of the potential workings of a Luxembourg Sustainable Finance Program (LuxSEF) that  outlines the various contractual agreements among program participants. The LSDFP takes up a central role as  aggregator and communication channel.   The strength of the LuxSEF approach lies in the program mechanics of the two financing  windows. As described below, the two variants of the model operate in a similar fashion. The  key difference between the two variants is the structuring of energy savings and billing.  In  particular, debt raised under the guaranteed savings variant is placed on the books of the  program participants. Such debt obligations are typically less attractive to the private sector  and, indeed, this variant of the model has been successfully appl ied in a public sector context.  The guaranteed energy savings model does allow for more aggressive energy savings and  unlocks longer investment options with longer payback periods.   The second variant, the sustainable energy services option, bills the cost  of energy savings on a  per kWh basis to the program participant. This bill can be an add -on to existing municipal billing  (e.g., waste, sewer, etc.). Program participants, under this variant of the model, do not carry  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               280     the debt on their books – they have o nly an obligation to provide payment for delivered  services. Paying off investments through monthly or bi -monthly billing cycles (much like a  power purchase agreement but now for savings), is typically more attractive to the private  sector. However, overal l, the second variant is less capable of unlocking very aggressive savings  opportunities.   Program Mechanics of the LuxSEF Guaranteed Energy Savings Variant   In Figure 7  the right hand side of the illustration notes several contractual agreements: a) a  guara nteed energy savings agreement (GESA), b) a performance based program agreement,  and c) an Installment Payment Agreement.  To provide insight into LuxSEF functioning as  described throughout this document, it helps to provide the various program steps that makes  up the guaranteed energy savings financing window:   1. First, the LSDFP performs its communication and aggregation function. This includes  surveying potential project promoters (both public and private) that are interested in  participating in the LuxSEF program. Interested public and private project promoters  sign a non -binding letter of interest (LOI). This group represents the pool of participating  organizations that will enter into the various contractual arrangements with the ESCOs  and the bond issuer.   a. A separate element not shown in  Figure 7 is that the L SDFP , if properly enabled,   could perform a pre -qualification of ESCOs that can participate in LuxSEF. Such  pre-qualification raises participating organizations’ confidence in the program.  Pre-qualification of ESCOs furthermore facilitates a smooth roll -out of the  program.   2. Participating organizations select one of the prequalified ESCOs – facilitated through  technical assistance and advice from the LSDFP –to perform a no -cost, pre -contract  audit. The selected ESCO presents an initial proposal based on the p re-contract audit.  This step provides participating organizations insight into their energy consumption  patterns and identifies potential saving and renewable energy opportunities.    3. Next, the participating organizations enter into Guaranteed Sustainable E nergy Savings  Agreements (GESAs) with the selected ESCOs. GESAs describe conservation services and  onsite clean energy generation services and defines service performance guarantees. All  guarantees are expressed in monetary amounts.

Participating organiz ations, ESCOs, and the Issuer enter into multi -year, performance based Program Agreements outlining data reporting, criteria for measurement of  services, job creation, etc.   5. The issuer of the bond enters into Installment Payment Agreements with participati ng  organizations. Participating organizations agree to make payments for installation of on site clean energy and energy efficiency upgrades.   6. If authorized, t he issuer dispenses  (tax-exempt) by -appropriation bonds secured by  payments under the Instalment P ayment Agreement. Alternatively, the issuer engages  with loan providers to raise the level of capital required.   The LuxSEF Sustainable Energy Services Variant   The second variant of the SEF investment model, incorporates components and lessons learned  from  tested financial frameworks such as on -bill financing, property assessed clean energy  (PACE), and power purchase agreements. As mentioned, this approach is typically seen as more  attractive to the private sector due to its handling of the debt. The progra m mechanics of this  variant operate in much the same way as suggested in Figure 7 :   1. First, the LSDFP performs its communication and aggregation function. This includes  surveying potential project promoters (both public and private) that are interested in  participating in the LuxSEF program. Interested public and private project promoters  sign a non -binding letter of interest (LOI). This group represents the pool of participating  organizations that will enter into the various contractual arrangements with th e ESCOs  and the bond issuer.   a. A separate element not shown in Figure 7 is that the LSDFP could perform a pre qualification of ESCOs that can participate in LuxSEF. Such pre -qualification raises  participating organizations’ confidence in the program. Pre -qualification of  ESCOs furthermore facilitates a smooth roll -out of the program.   2. Participating organizations select – facilitated through technical assistance and advice  from the LSDFP – one of the prequalified ESCOs to perform a no -cost, pre -contract  audit . The selected ESCO presents an initial proposal based on the pre -contract audit.  This step provides participating organizations insight into their energy consumption  patterns and identifies potential saving and renewable energy opportunities.    3. Next, the participating organizations enter into Sustainable Energy Services Agreements  with the issuer. Participants agree to pay issuer for the sustainable energy services 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               282     (including conservation and onsite clean energy generation) delivered during the term  of the  agreement (much like a PPA).   4. Participating organizations, ESCOs, and the Issuer enter into multi -year, Service  Performance Agreements describe conservation measures and onsite clean energy  generation, and define performance guarantee(s).   5. The issuer of the  bond enters into a Program Agreement with participating  organizations and ESCOs outlining data reporting, criteria for measurement of services  and job creation.   6. The issuer issues (tax -exempt) by -appropriation bonds secured by payments under the  Instalment  Payment Agreement. Alternatively, the issuer engages with loan providers to  raise the level of capital required or alternative routes for capital provision.   1.2.3 LuxSEF Challenges, Barriers, and Opportunities   1.2.3.1 Financial and Policy Conditions   As the leading center for investment funds in Europe (2nd worldwide), Luxembourg’s financial  expertise is well -positioned to apply the SEF sustainable energy financing strategy. As noted in  the 2015 Article IV consultation by the International Monetary Fun d (IMF), Luxembourg has a  stable political environment, a financial hub that serves all of Europe, and a central government  net asset position of about 20 percent of GDP which positions Luxembourg as one of two Euro  area sovereigns rated ‘AAA’ by all major  rating agencies.246   A European Commission Staff Working Document assessing the Luxembourg economy as part  of the European Commission’s annual growth survey also highlights the critical importance of  the financial sector as the main engine of economic growt h.247 However, the staff working  document reveals several weaknesses that could be of importance in the deployment of a SEF  strategy. For instance, while the existing vehicle fleet in Luxembourg is becoming greener and  more fuel -efficient, current mobility c onditions are far from the government’s sustainability  objectives. High motorisation rates and the insufficient supply of public transportation – a key  objective of the Luxembourg government is to increase public transport in all motorised forms  from 14.5%  in 2009 to 25% in 2020 – make mobility difficult. In terms of energy efficiency and  renewable energy objectives and targets, the document notes that further integration of smart  grid deployment is critical. Overall, Luxembourg is found to be on a path tha t will not meet its                                                           246 Internati onal Monetary Fund (IMF) (2015).

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               283     Europe 2020 targets concerning non -emission trading scheme greenhouse gas emissions.  Increased levels of investment are required.   Environmental fiscal reform opportunities exist in Luxembourg as well: Luxembourg has among  the lowest sco res of the EU member states on enacting taxes to address energy efficiency and  sustainability in the mobility, construction, agriculture, and water sectors.248     1.2.3.2 Green Bond Market   The Delaware SEU sustainable energy bond was the first of its kind to be issued in the United  States. The DE SEU $72.5 million bond offering is a part of a larger ‘green bond’ market. Europe  in general, and Luxembourg in particular, are strong promoters of the green bond market.  Indeed, Luxembourg offers an ideal environment  for climate finance as it can be seen as the  world’s green bond capital.249 In addition, Luxembourg is well -positioned to drive and benefit  from further green bond market growth. For example, t he Luxembourg Stock Exchange (LuxSE)  was the first stock exchange to list a green bond in 2007. Today, with more than 80 green  bonds listed by 20 issuers in 19 currencies, LuxSE is by far the leading exchange at international  level for this asset class.   In 2007, the European Investment Bank (EIB) pioneered the g reen bond option and, to date, the  EIB is the largest green bond issuer with €10 billion issued. Of particular interest in the context  of a Luxembourg SEF approach is the EIB’s repositioning of its role in the green bond market:  green bond issuance is now an “autonomous strategic goal” of the EIB’s Corporate Operational  Plan 2015 -2017. The EIB’s Climate Awareness Bond (CABs) series is a solid example of this new  objective: the EIB is building a benchmark yield curve and has, so far, issued five CABs in EUR to  raise the profile of the market. The current CAB yield curve sports three benchmarks: a) one  €400 million issuance at 11/2019 (4 years) maturity and 1.34% interest; b) two 11/2023 (8  years) issuances, one €400 million and the other €600 million, both at  0.5% interest; and c) two  11/2026 (11 years) issuances at €250 million each and both at 1.25% interest. The EIB is,  therefore well positioned to support the SEF approach in conjunction with the Luxembourg  financial centre.250                                                            248 European Commission (2016).

Document can be accessed at:  http://www.luxembourgforfinance.com/en/financing -climate -change -action     250 The roll -out of further green bonds is supported by the market’s increasing attention to environmental and  financial integrity through the Green Bond Principles. However, to use the green bonds as a part of a larger 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               284     With the recent signing of the  COP -21 Paris Agreement on climate change, the green bond  market can be seen as entering into a new stage where policy drives market growth. This is in  contrast to a) the first stage of the green bond market (roughly 2007 -2011) where, especially  multilater al development banks assured market growth and b) the second stage of the market  (roughly 2011 -2014) where investors and intermediaries became primary drivers of market  evolution. The market is growing rapidly: the London -based Climate Bonds Initiative, fo r  instance, catalogued a $41.8 billion market in 2015 while issuance was already at $23.2 billion   (as of May 2016)  and expected to reach $100 billion by the end of the year.251    1.2.3.3 Luxembourg ESCO Market   The ESCO market in Luxembourg will require furthe r refinement. The 2014 Joint Research  Centre (JRC) study on the European ESCO market, for instance, notes that “information about  the [ESCO] market or the companies working in Luxembourg is difficult to find. The ESCO  market is not active, and the latest r eliable information is from 2007, when 3 -4 foreign  companies were found to offer energy service solutions for Luxembourg”.252 While data is  scarce, the Third National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) outlines that the ESCO market  in Luxembourg is experi encing growth and sees the potential to develop the energy services  market as ‘high’. The document also notes that pilot energy saving contract projects are  underway. Overall, however, it appears that further development of the energy services  market, in p articular the development of ESCOs capable of participating in an SEF program at  the proposed scale might be required.   To overcome such potential obstacles, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will need to incentivize  the creation of ESCOs, certify proper traini ng and performance, guarantee early adoption with  the transformation of all government and public buildings into Internet of Things nodes, and  provide government -supported training for thousands of semi -skilled, skilled, and professional  workers that will be needed to transform the Luxembourg building and other asset stock.   Under the vision outlined here, the LSDFP is the one -stop -destination for financial contributors  and project promoters alike. The LSDFP is an innovative public -private partnership delive ring  energy efficiency, load reduction, clean energy services, material savings, transportation  investment, digitalized monitoring and verification and a range of other technologies and                                                                                                                                                                                      collective action strategy, the market  will be reliant on further efforts to maintain current standards. Support  policies could be formulated at the EU level to advance the market.   251 https://www.climatebonds.net/   252 Bertoldi, P., Boza -Kiss, B., Panev, S., & Labanca, N. (2014).

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               285     options. The creation of a LSDFP fits with the larger policy context a nd direction. For instance,  the Third NEEAP is considering the creation of a public financial institution to facilitate  investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy.     1.3 Establishing a Resource Aggregation Capacity    While the Luxembourg Sustainable Energy Finance (LuxSEF) model provides a useful  aggregation of demand -side projects (whether energy -efficiency upgrades or rooftop  photovoltaic systems), there are other complementary institutional arrangements that the  LSDFP may want to consider  to drive greater investments in renewable energy and energy  efficiency upgrades at an equivalent national or community  scale. One such model is a  complement  of energy cooperatives, referred to as Community Choice Aggregation (CCA).  CCA  is a vehicle that enables community governments to aggregate or pool energy customers to  purchase and develop energy resources, as well as to administer energy programs, on behalf of  their residents and businesses. This institutional arrangement allow s the local community to  shape the CCA program to prioritize desired benefits, including but not limited to, increased  investment in renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, economic development, carbon  reduction strategies, and workforce developmen t efforts.253  Like energy cooperatives, CCAs have the authority to buy and/or develop energy resources on  behalf of the residential, commercial, and government energy customers within its jurisdiction.  Whether heat or electricity, the energy continues to be distributed and delivered over existing  pipelines, electricity lines, and other infrastructure that is owned by a private company or  investor -owned utility.   By establishing a CCA program, cities and cantons  can take increased ownership and control  over th eir electricity generation and consumption. More than just buying and selling electricity,  a CCA provides a platform for managing the community’s energy resources through the  administration of energy efficiency programs, as well as the through the developm ent of local  renewables. Indeed, some local communities have been motivated to form community choice  programs as a means to achieve greater levels of renewable energy generation, encourage local  investment in energy resource development, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, amplify the                                                           253 With origins in the State of California, CCA is statutorily enabled  in California, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, New  Jersey, New York, and Rhode Island with a handful of other states considering legislation.  For more background on  the idea of a Community Choice Aggregation model as it might be applied in the Netherlands  or the region, see the  resources of Local Energy Aggregation Network (LEAN Energy US) at http://www.leanenergyus.org/ .  For a quick  review of energy cooperatives in Europe, see the Navigant report cited in foot note 1 of this overview.

For example, current aggregation contracts in the Midwestern part of the United  States are yielding up to 25 percent rate savings while rate savings on the East coast are  averaging savings of 10 to 14 percent (as of September 2013).255      Figure 6. Comparing the Community Choice Aggregation Authority Model with Private and Public Utilities 256  Source: http://www.leanenergyus.org/what -is-cca/    As explained by LEAN Energy US, an energy aggregation authority can be done on an opt -in or  opt-out basis (depending how the CCA or public authority is constituted). But, as they note:  “the most common and successf ul programs are opt -out. This means that consumers are                                                           254 Gordon, M. (2014). CCA and Microdgrids: Community Driven, Private Enterprise Models for Smart Grid  Innovation.   255 The data are from footnote 3 in the explanation offered at: http://www.leanenergyus.org/what -is-cca/ .   256 While this example draws on the business model of the electric utility, it could also be extended to include the  development, bulk purchase and distribution of transportation fuels, industrial chemicals, water resources, and  more.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               287     automatically enrolled after a successful public referendum at the local level, as was done in  Illinois and Ohio; or, enrolled when their local elected representatives (city council or county  board) vo ted to form or join a CCA program, as happened in California. The opt -in approach is  voluntary but participation rates are traditionally very low which reduces the value of group  purchasing and makes it harder for local programs to achieve economic viabili ty. Opt -out  aggregation achieves the necessary market scale for effective group purchasing, but allows a  customer to switch back to utility service or another energy provider at any time. Either way,  customers always have the choice to stay or go.”   LEAN Energy US further explains: “Because CCA is a revenue -based system —not government  subsidized —such programs are self -supporting from an existing revenue stream.” In other  words , the energy costs that consumers pay to a retail energy supplier or an inve stor-owned  utility “are bundled and redirected to support the group purchase of energy through a local CCA  program.” This can apply whether the service provided is natural gas or electricity, but it could  also be fuel oil or other energy carriers. As shown  in Figure 8 above, there is a clear separation  between energy production and the actual distribution of the different energy resources. As  envisioned here, the partnership with an existing energy supplier as the primary distributor is  one that is negotiat ed and established within the existing market structure. In California, for  example, the local utility has entered into a partnership with the CCA authority. In this instance,  the retail energy provider benefits from the group purchasing power through lowe r costs. As  LEAN Energy US notes, the utilities or other energy supplies are “made whole” through cost  recovery surcharges (or exit fees), also covering reasonable profits, as they lose energy sales. At  the same time, the energy supplier retains its owners hip and management of “the distribution  infrastructure, and all final energy deliveries, repairs, billing, and customer service functions.”   How might such an authority be administered? In the State of California, there are currently  three management option s. The most common approach is through an inter -jurisdictional joint  powers agency (JPA) that serves as a public, non -profit agency on behalf of the municipalities  that choose to participate in the CCA program. This is the model under which Marin Clean  Energy and Sonoma Clean Power operate, for example. A second option is a single city or  county that might structure a CCA through an Enterprise Fund; this is the model under which  Lancaster Energy Choice in California operates. In this option, the CCA is mana ged “in house” as  a separate program/fund within existing municipal or government operations. Still a third  option involves a commercial or third party management where the CCA’s operations are  delegated by contract to a private firm. This model is new in California so its risks and benefits  are yet to be fully vetted or realized.   What specific approach makes the most sense for Luxembourg? That remains open as it will  also depend on how the LSDFP/SEF might complement the operations and purposes of the CCA.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               288     Yet, this authority provides the means to further increase and organize the flow of energy  resources in ways that enhance LSDFP/SEF. In fact, new tools are now in play as blockchains are  giving more power to individual consumers to negotiate without a sin gle authority and match  energy resources with specific energy demands.257  1.4 Deployment  of the Sustainable Development Finance Strategy   The application of the Sustainable Development Finance Strategy, as described in the above  sections, can facilitate and accelerate the deployment of sustainable energy technologies  throughout all sectors of the economy. A series of key steps flow from the three building  blocks:   1. Creation of the Luxembourg Sustainable Development Finance Platform (LSDFP): The  LSDFP takes up a  central role and acts as a one -stop -destination for capital providers and  project promoters (both single and aggregated).   2. Introduction of LuxSEF: The LuxSEF strategy is introduced as a key mechanism that  structures financing between aggregated pools of s upply and demand, drives finance  supply, and provides project portfolios at infrastructure scale. The LSDFP plays a central role  in the establishment of the contractual arrangements between ESCOs, bond issuer/loan  providers, and program participants. To do  so, the LSDFP relies on a team of technical, legal,  financial, and policy experts. Any financing at the scale discussed here will require a trusted  advisor participant – a party that is not profit oriented and represents program participants  to ensure sav ings guarantee obligations are met.   3. LSDFP prequalifies ESCOs  based on their capacity to fulfil program operations, including  their size, pricing, etc. In doing so, LSDFP provides a strong market signal to the ESCO  market to develop in the direction of inf rastructure -scale energy efficiency and on -site  renewable energy generation provisions.   4. Interested parties sign a non -binding letter of interest (LOI)  and discuss their specific goals,  timeline, energy patterns, etc. with LSDFP.   5. The LSDFP brings together ESCOs and interested program participants . ESCOs perform no cost, pre -contract audits and present initial energy savings proposal. Participants sign  guaranteed energy savings agreement with their selected ESCO. Guaranteed energy savings                                                           257 Aviva Rutkin, Blockchain -based microgrid gives power to consumers in New York . 2 March 2016. In this case,  while solar panels on the roofs of terraced houses in New York City soak up sunshine, a pair of computers  connected to the panels quietly crunch numbers, counting how many electrons are being generated so that they  can be bought and sold as needed to neigh bors rather than go through a central authority or utility. This project,  run by a startup called Transactive Grid, is the first version of a new kind of energy market, operated by  consumers, which may very well change the way we generate and consume elect ricity. Although not referenced  here, these arrangements can also include much more than heat and power, but also transportation fuels, water  resources, and the flow of other materials, goods and services within the Duchy of Luxembourg.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               289     agreements include an investment grade audit, a construction proposal, a savings  guarantee, and a proposal for measuring and reporting savings each quarter.   The SEF strategy, under a LSDFP platform, can be extended to the rest of the European Union.  Here, too, it is importa nt to remember that there is no one -size-fits-all solution for  implementing SEF models. It is, therefore, worthwhile to note that SEF models always require  being properly calibrated to local settings. Nevertheless, with its first mover advantage, lessons  learned, and otherwise gained expertise, Luxembourg can recommend regions and other  member states to establish similar kinds of finance structurings, specialized to t he context of  those communities.   The Sustainable Development Finance Strategy can be captur ed in a visualization depicting its  potential value and ease of implementation. As indicated in the illustration below, the  Sustainable Development Finance Strategy can be positioned as a “flagship proposal” – a  proposal that Luxembourg can proceed to fund , design, build, and implement as a highest  priority. To arrive at the illustration, the Sustainable Development Finance Strategy was scored  along two dimensions: ease of implementation and potential value. A total integrated project  score of  89 points (ou t of 100) is achieved. The scorin g breakdown is provided below:   Proposal “1”: A Sustainable Development Finance Strategy:   Value Factors    Reduces final energy consumption : Assigned score is High (5), Weighting is 2, total score  is 10    Reduces CO 2 emissions : Assigned score is High (5), Weighting is 3, total score is 15   Increases % of renewable energy : Assigned score is High (5), Weighting is 2, total score is  10   Provides knowledge in subsequent projects : Assigned score is High (5), Weighting is 1,  total score is 5   Supports multiple TIR pillars : Assigned score is High (5), Weighting is 1, total score is 5   Strengthens Luxembourg assets : Assigned score is Med (3), Weighting is 1, total score is  3  Total Valu e Score = 47 points (y -axis).

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               291         Proposal 2: The Blockchain Opportunity for Luxembourg    Blockchains are an essential new technology for ensuring a more efficient, transparent, and  secure transaction -based economy. While there are very real concerns about security risks  associated with any information -based technologies, there is broad agreeme nt that blockchain  technology presents a unique opportunity for the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to lead a global  transformation in both energy and economic efficiency. This can, in turn, lead to greater  inclusiveness and vast potential wealth creation. Block chain technology is so integral to the  digital economy of the future that many of the ten bold projects envisioned by the Financial  Working Group’s contributions to TIR’s Smart  Luxembourg initiative cannot be optimized in its  absence.258    Over the past year , interest in blockchain technology, the distributed ledger system that  underpins bitcoin and other digital currencies, has surged internationally. The world’s biggest  banks, largest consulting firms, most influential non -government organizations and, rece ntly,  leading national and regional governments and central banks are all exploring blockchain  technology’s potential. More critically, there is now widespread belief that this technology will                                                           258 Early use of bloc kchain technologies required energy -intensive applications that might have partially offset the  full benefits of their use. At the same time, however, both research and advances in technologies indicate a rapidly  growing improvement in their application so  that anticipated energy needs by 2020 may be only three percent of  what was previously anticipated. See, for example, an interesting analytical exercise suggesting  that worldwide use  of the technology could consume as much power as Denmark, but probably won’t .  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               292     usher in sweeping new efficiencies globally by cutting out midd lemen and empowering end users and start -up innovators. Blockchain solutions are now being applied to everything from  the real -time supply of renewable energy resources at the neighbourhood level, to settlement  of stocks and bonds and the copyrighting of d igital music.   The Blockchain is a breakthrough that heralds the Internet’s next evolutionary phase and  provides the best existing technology case for effectively realizing the Third Industrial  Revolution. The first Internet phase, led by the development of  the World  Wide Web in the  1990s, vastly decentralized communication, while providing unprecedented access to  information. But it left in place an uneven playing field dominated by gatekeepers that meant  that inefficiencies and a lack of interoperability p ersisted, especially in finance, all because the  Internet could not solve society’s dependence on a centralized system of trust. In this second,  blockchain -led phase, developers are building the so -called “Internet of Value,” a system of  peer -to-peer infor mation exchange founded on a distributed trust network within a distributed  and decentralized system of governance. The Blockchain is generating new paradigms of trust  and accountability and it is evolving into a borderless, ownerless architecture upon whi ch  myriad new applications will be based.   Luxembourg is uniquely positioned to exploit this ground breaking technology. Sitting in the  middle of Europe and having already established itself as a financial powerhouse, the country  has an opportunity to grab a global leadership role in the Blockchain’s development. By moving  early, it can bring efficiencies to its own economy, helping to reverse a worrying decline in total factor productivity and competitiveness. As discussed later, it can then export that kno wledge  and related services to Europe and the rest of the world, dramatically scaling up the well -being  of Luxembourg citizens.   Luxembourg’s strong digital foundation also works to its advantage. With penetration of  ultrafast broadband and Internet usage a mong the highest in the world, there’s greater  potential for the network effects needed for the blockchain to succeed. Critically, the country  enjoys a disproportionately large population of highly trained software developers, with the  University of Luxemb ourg hosting a renowned school of cryptology – the discipline that lies at  the heart of all blockchain design. The Luxembourg School of Business has already hosted a  “blockchain bootcamp” to stir interest in the field. The ongoing development of this techn ology  will ensure that the world’s top cryptographers will constantly be in short supply. However,  Luxembourg is not alone in these global efforts and must act quickly to gain advantage.   But there is work ahead. A KPMG Luxembourg survey, as but one example , found that only 17  percent of asset management CEOs are worried about disruptive technologies such as the 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               293     blockchain.259  This suggests Luxembourg’s biggest industry may be vulnerable to the reality  taking hold around it. But it can seize an opportunity if  it incentivizes its fund -management  industry to move faster than those in other financial centers. In a world of open data, where  transactions and value exchanges of all sizes flow fluidly across borders and disparate  jurisdictions -- as well as across an d between humans and “Internet of Things” -connected  devices -- many of these initiatives will demand distributed trust. Any embrace of “robo”  financial advice, by way of example, will require that investment algorithms are subject to real time audits which  can be enabled by the Blockchain’s immutable record of changes of state.  That same tamper -proof ledger can also record and prove people’s self -sovereign assertions of  identity, the bedrock of the ambitious data vault project aimed at facilitating seamless , digital  execution of citizens’ personal and property rights.   The blockchain allows the issuance of the unique digital assets and crypto -securities, turning  crowdfunding schemes into liquid marketplaces for new capital formation. It’s also an  interactive  accounting platform with which government agencies and/or private institutions  can issue local B2B and B2C currencies to boost the internal economy in a manner that assures  users that their counterparts won’t renege on credit obligations. And it must feat ure heavily in  any green finance plan to fund energy projects at home or abroad, both because the blockchain  offers auditability of key data on carbon savings and because it allows for financial aggregation  and securitization of small, decentralized commun ity installations.   Regulation  can be both  the killer  and the enabler  of innovation  in this field.  With  that in mind,   Luxembourg’s  government  should  approach  it as it has other  such  opportunities,  seizing  on  regulatory  innovation  and reform  opportunities  to encourage  new  technologies  and markets.   The Grand  Duchy’s  dominance  in asset  management  and banking  demonstrates  how  this  approach  can let it carve  out an international  role and foster  a high -value -add,  wealth generating  export  industry.  This was seen  in its proactive  adoption  of the first UCITS  directive  of  1985,  which  turned  Luxembourg  into the second -largest  fund  management  center  in the world   and,  more  recently,  in its move  to encourage  family  offices  to domicile  in the country.  The  country  now  has an opportunity  to do the same  again  as early -stage  regulatory  guidelines   emerge  around  the blockchain  and virtual  currencies.  Luxembourg  has already  moved  quickly   to grant  licenses  under  the EU’s  new  “BitLicense”  rules  to firms  such  as payments  provider   SnapS wap  and bitcoin  exchange  BitStamp.  Service  providers  such  as bitcoin  wallet  and analytics   firm Blockchain  -- which  adopted  the name  of the ledger  as its own  -- have  been  so encouraged   by this approach  that they  set up headquarters  in Luxembourg.                                                            259 KPMG, “Management Company CEO Survey 2016,” p. 6.    http://www.kpmg.com/LU/en/IssuesAndInsights/Articlespublications/Documents/Management -Company -CEOSurvey -032016.pdf  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               294     Beyond fin ance, other key growth areas for Luxembourg to diversify its economic exposure  include biotech, logistics and energy, and especially greater energy productivity. As many new  applications for blockchain technology emerge, the government can and should capit alize on  these early successes by inculcating a startup -friendly regulatory space, not only to encourage  innovation but also to drive the agenda in Brussels and Frankfurt, setting standards for the  future evolution of regulations. The BitLicense rules, for  example, are a work in progress;  affording Luxembourg room to leverage its respected status as a trusted center for financial  management and break new ground. At the same time, local regulators should closely monitor  legal developments in competing jurisd ictions such as the U.K., which is aggressively positioning  London as a fintech hub. Ideas for innovation -friendly regulation can be lifted from the U.K.  Financial Conduct Authority’s “fintech sandbox” concept in which it has designed a “light touch”  pro-innovation regulatory framework for start -ups. Additionally, some insights might be gained  from examining the Greater Zurich Area’s push to domicile as many blockchain companies as  possible.   In particular, there’s an important opportunity to explore “regtech” ideas emerging out of the  blockchain ecosystem. The transparency, traceability and immutability of blockchain ledgers  means that -- contrary to the earlier, less well -informed view that t he anonymity of bitcoin  creates an escape route for criminals -- they can be a powerful tool for law enforcement.  Europol has recognized this by signing a MoU with blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. When  Big Data analysis is applied to the blockchain, regulators are finding it produces a rich trove of  information. In the U.S., for example, Homeland Security is developing a blockchain analytics  prototype. Meanwhile, a Washington -based group called the Blockchain Alliance is engaging  leading digital curre ncy firms in a collaborative working group with seven major agencies:  Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, the FBI, the IRS, the Secret Service, Immigration  and Customs Enforcement, the U.S. Marshals Service, and the Commodity Futures Trading  Comm ission.   The greatest  potential  may  lie in breaking  the paradigm  of analog  ID and delegated  KyC/AML   regulation  for money  transmission,  which  has kept  billions  of people  out of the global  financial   system  yet also failed  to prevent  an estimated  $2 trillion  in annual  money  laundering   worldwide.260 Leadership  for more  flexible  yet robust  system  can come  from  CSSF,  which  is  already  using  Big Data  analysis  to enhance  its surveillance  efforts.261 When  applied  to the                                                           260 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, “Money Laundering and Globalization,”   https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/money -laundering/globalization.html   261 KPMG, “Management Company CEO Survey 2016,” Interview with Simone Delcourt , Director,  Commission de  Surveillance du Secteur Financier. p. 7 -8.    http://www.kpmg.com/LU/en/IssuesAndInsights/Articlespublications/Documents/Management -Company -CEOSurvey -032016.pdf  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               295     blockchain,  these  sophisticated  analytics  create  ostensibly  anonymous  user  profiles  that are  extremely  effective  for discovering  money  launderers  and terrorist  financiers  and for  demonstrating  the harmlessness  of other  transactions  made  by many  poorer  economic  agents   that lack traditional  ID.  In effect,  these data -bundling  profiles  are a form  of identity  and,  when  combined  with  device   identity  protocols,  can empower  regulators  to block  targeted  nodes  of illicit  activity  while   keeping  healthy  financial  transactions  flowing  -- even  in the absence  of personal  identifying   information  (PII.)  As we move  to a more  complicated  global  financial  system  with  multiple   digital  currencies,  micropayments  and machine -to-machine  transactions  within  the Internet  of  Things,  this kind  of digital  ID approach  will be critical.  The CSSF  could  take  a lead  here,  pushing   the EU into the cutting  edge  of money  transmission  regulation.   Regtech ideas that are based on the blockchain should also be explored as a means of  overhauling the oversight of financial entities and money service busi nesses. Robust “multi -sig”  protections, for example, in which funds cannot be moved out of an account unless signed by a  combination of keys, could greatly enhance consumer protection and allow for less  burdensome capital requirements on financial startups . Designed appropriately, these new  systems can make it virtually impossible for a custodian to lose or steal a customer’s digital currency funds -- in fact, with the customer holding one of the keys, it challenges the very  definition of “ custody. ” Similar ly, the Blockchain’s powerful audit capabilities allow real -time  proofs of reserves; institutions can unquestionably demonstrate solvency to regulators and  customers alike, at any time of their choosing. This should both enhance regulatory oversight  and ob viate the need for time -consuming, costly quarterly reports that are out of date by the  time they are delivered.   Additional Core Blockchian Concepts for Luxembourg to Consider   The Blockchain gives rise to a number of core concepts with which to build a more versatile and  robust governance infrastructure for an economy. Examining these concepts  helps to frame the  various options facing the Luxembourg government. We will explore f our in particular -- the  device identity model , anchoring , tokenization  and smart contracts  -- and highlight their  application to potential projects that the government could pursue.   2.1 Identity and the Blockchain    The Blockchain  introduces  the Device  Identity  Model , a revolutionary  approach  to digital   identity.  Traditional  digital  identit y systems  rely on shared  secrets  and institutional   endorsements . Under  that model,  when  a user  creates  an account  with  a service,  the service   asks  the user  to choose  a secret  password , and then  attempts  to verify  an email  address  by 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               296     mailing  it a shared  secret  link or code.  Banking,  and other  services  that have  identity -based   regulations  also request  verifiable  personal  secrets  like previous  addresses,  mother’s  maiden   names,  and even  a taxpayer's  ID number  or a state  issued  ID like a driver’s  license  and passport.   These  systems  build  large,  centralized  databases  of personal  ID information  that are used  to  verify  identities.  As centralized  repositories,  they  become  single -vector  targets,  inherently   vulnerable  to increasingly  sophisticated  cyber -attacks.  That  means  that at the same  time  that  the value  of the information  contained  in them  increases  over  time,  they  also become  less  secure  over  time . One paradoxical  result  is that identity  theft,  fraud  and other  breaches  of the  identity  system  are easier  to perpetrate  against  older  people  with  identities  that have  accrued   more  value.   With  the Blockchain,  instead  of tying  blockchain -related  transactions  to accounts  with   usernames  and passwords,  transactions  are controlled  by a collection  of related  encryption   certificates.  This is the device  identity  model  and,  when  combined  with  the immutability  of the  Blockchain  ledger,  it has major  benefits  for security  and privacy.   Most  people  in Luxemburg  own  a variety  of devices  capable  of cryptographic  authentication,   such  as a smartphone,  a tablet,  a desktop  or laptop  computer.  Increasingly,  also,  computing   devices  are embedded  into machine -to-machine  networks  within  the so-called  Internet  of  Things.  As the locus  of authentication  shifts  to the user’s  devices  the would -be attacker’s  target   also shifts.  Rather  than  fraudulently  presenting  themselves  as any of the users  of a service  to  break  into its database  (or simply  downloading  a copy  of the hacked  database  online)  the  attacker  that’s  confronting  the device  identity  model  must  compromise  the actual  device  in the  user’s  possession.  The result  is much  less value  per attack.   As more  and more  online  services  leverage  the device  identity  model , expect  identity  fraud  to  more  intensely  concentrate  on older  systems  that still rely on shared  secrets  such  as passwords   and Government  ID numbers.  Important  applications  like Facebook  and ApplePay  already  rely  on Device  Identity  to protect  their  systems , but the Blockchain  was the first to exclusively  rely  on it. Additionally,  because  the ledger is distributed  across  a wide  array  of computers  and is  constantly  validated  by that network,  the security  around  the information  generated  by those   devices  is also profoundly  more  secure  than  anything  held  on a centralized  database.   The concept  will be vital  to the Luxembourg  Financial  Working  Group’s  proposal  for a data  vault   of citizens’  personal  and property  information  with  which  they  will use smart  contracts  to  transact  with  each  other,  with  corporate  entities  and with  the government.  Given  the  imperative  of securing  this highly  sensitive  pool  of data  -- and,  in so doing,  strengthening   financial  and government  security  while  protecting  personal  privacy  --, a transition  from  shared   secret  systems  of identity  to device -mediated  ones  secured  on the Blockchain  will be 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               297     important.  Rather  than  “Band -Aid”  solutions  to increasingly  vulnerable  centralized  databases,   the Blockchain  embeds  security  into its core  distribute d architecture.    Amid  the shift  to the device  identity  model,  users  will demand  a mix of multi-factor   authentication,  likely  including  encrypted  biometrics,  to secure  their  exclusive  access  to each   device.  The information  and protocols  pertaining  to those  factors  cannot  reside  on the device   itself,  but neither  can it be stored  in centralized  database,  which  would  recreate  a vulnerable   attack  vector  for the most  sensitive  of all personal  information.  Instead,  the Blockchain  could  be  used  to mediate  permissio ns via each  actor’s  unique  private  key access,  keeping  sensitive  data   outside  of hackers’  reach.     The Blockchain  can also greatly  enhance  security  within  the data  vault  infrastructure  itself.  Data   vault  models  such  as those  developed  by Oracle  rely on the dynamic  management  of database   access  privileges.  But decisions  to review,  revoke  and grant  access,  as well as changes  to each   privileged  user’s  modes  of authentication,  need  to be auditable  without  giving  away  the  underlying  information.  When  combined  with privacy -enhancing  tools  such  as homomorphic  or  zero -proof  encryption,  the Blockchain’s  time -stamped,  immutable  sequence  of ledger  entries   can create  an automatic,  unbreakable  audit  trail.  (It’s also relevant  to numerous  other   Luxembourg  initiatives  desc ribed  below,  especially  within  the context  of anchoring .) This will  give citizens  the highest  level  of confidence  possible  that administrators  of the data  vault  aren’t   abusing  their  power  and that information  residing  within  it can be trusted.   Getting  thes e digital  identity  principles  right  is critical.  Identity  is the bedrock  upon  which  so  much  else of Luxembourg’s  future  digital  economy  will be based.  Securely  identifying  the digital   actors,  be they  human  or device  will be essential  for any expansion  of smart  contracts,   micropayments,  programmable  money  and machine -to-machine  transactions.  These  are the  kinds  of interactions  that will give rise to smart  electricity  grids,  smart  transportation  systems   and the other  infrastructure  components  of an Internet  of Things  ecosystem.  But they  must  be  secure  from  attack  and protect  privacy.  A blockchain -based  model  will be a vital  part of that.       2.2 Anchoring/Auditability   A key reason  why the Blockchain  is described  as immutable  or tamper -proof  is because  proof of-work  mining  is cumulative.  In order  to persuade  the network  to change  an old transaction  on  the Blockchain,  a rogue  actor  would  need  to present  more  computational  work  than  the ledger   has benefitted  from  since  that  transaction . The current  computing  power  of the Bitcoin   Blockchain’s  network  is about  15 million  petaFLOPS,  or 15 zettaFLOPS.  The current  market  price   of computing  power,  according  to Wiikipedia,  is $0.08  per gigaflo p. If we take  this estimate,  it  would  take  roughly  $1.2  Trillion  ($1,200,000,000,000)  worth  of computing  power  to be 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               298     completely  dedicated  to the task of attacking  the Blockchain  in order  to even  have  a chance  at  changing  recent  records.  The older  a record  is, the more  computing  power  it would  take  to  change.  This is a level  of records  integrity  never  before  possible  for digital  systems  -- quite   probably  for anything  ever  produced  in the analog  or paper  worlds,  either.  What’s  more  -- and  importantly  for Luxe mbourg’s  purposes  -- it can be harnessed  by those  same  legacy  systems.   Every  critical  existing  database  can be given  this level  of security  in its past  records  by having   administrators  periodically  create  a SHA256  hash  of their  past  state,  and embedding  that into  the Blockchain.  This process,  which  allows  anyone  to later  compare  the original  set of data  to  this reduced  hash  format  and prove  a match  to ascertain  its integrity,  is called  anchoring .  Whenever  a past  record  doesn’t  reconcile  with  the anchor,  it constitutes  indisputable  proof  of  tampering.   It is far more  superior  audit  tool than  any of the human -dependent  tools  that the  big accounting  firms  use.  We strongly  suggest  that the government  of Luxemburg  pursue  anchoring  solutions  to improve   the integri ty of all financial  and government  record -keeping  systems.  Currently,  transaction  fees  on the Blockchain  are around  $0.07  per transaction.  For the cost of $0.07  per day,  the records   of a firm or agency  could  be made  completely  immutable  during  the daily  close. This has  significant  implications  for financial  accounting  as it almost  eliminates  the prospect  of  bookkeeping  fraud  and makes  the task of auditors  far more  comprehensive,  efficient  and less  expensive.    One public  database  that Luxembourg  could  subjec t to blockchain  anchoring  is its registry  of  property  titles  and liens.  This would  potentially  reduce  disputes  and thus  lower  transaction   costs  within  a real estate  market  that,  as mentioned,  has prohibitively  high  entry  costs.  Another   is the patents  regis try. Auditability  and accountability  to the recording  of IP could  help  to  differentiate  the Luxembourg  Intellectual  Property  Office  with  the objective  of attracting   international  patent  filings  and the startups  that generate  them.   One jurisdiction  that is already  applying  blockchain -based  strategies  to enhance  transparency   around  public  records  is the U.S. State  of Delaware.262 Given  that Delaware,  like Luxembourg,  is  responsible  for a large  amount  of corporate  registration  and licensing  data  due to the high   number  of incorporations  based  there,  it presents  a leading -edge  example  that bears  studying.   Delaware  is placing  public  archives  into a distributed  ledger  setting  and exploring  the prospect   of doing  the same  for company  registration  data  such  as records  of directors  and other  legal   matters.  And as an extension  of this auditability  feature,  which  can be enhanced  for other  uses   of the Blockchain,  the state  is also creating  a new  class  of distributed  ledger  share  for                                                           262 Vigna, P. “Delaware Considers Using Blockchain Technology,” May 1,  2016, The Wall Street Journal ,  http://www.wsj.com/articles/delaware -considers -using -blockchain -technology -1462145802  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               299     companies  incorporated  there.  This is intended  to allow  for automatic,  interoperable  updating   of underlying  shareholder  registry  data,  cutting  back  significantly  on the record -keeping  burden   for startups  and other  private  companies  that must  maintain  ever - changing  capital  tables  in  preparation  for public  listing.     Extending  these  ideas  further,  Luxembourg  could  also trial the use of blockchain -based  voting   for specific  initiatives.  Just as the Blockchain  prevents  double -spending  of currency,  it can also  prevent  double -voting,  potentially  allow  for seamless,  digital  and even  smartphone -based   voting  systems  in which  the citizenry  can enjoy  both  ease  of use and a high  degree  of trust.  An  early  application  could  apply  in the private  realm  of shareholder  votes,  but trials  of this voting   model  could  also be developed  for municipal  budget  items  and even  national  referendums.    This auditability  feature  of the Blockchain  can also be applied  to many  of Luxembourg’s  existing   industries,  as well as to the Luxembourg  Financial  Working  Group’s  various  projects.  In an era of  greater  demand  for transparency  -- with  new  EU requirements  for disclosing  bank  clients’  tax  records,  for example  -- blockchain -anchored  audits  will help  the Grand Duchy  stand  out from   other  states  as a home  of responsible,  accountable  governa nce.  As mentioned  previously,  it can  help  maintain  trust  in the proposed  data  vault  and can be applied  to the government’s  plans  to  expand  robo -advice  services  by ensuring  that investment  algorithms  aren’t  tampered  with.  It  can also improve  the integrity  of the underlying  data  upon  which  Luxembourg’s  giant  asset   managers  depend  for the pricing  of new  and existing  asset  classes.  Blockchain -based  audits  will  also be vital  to the administration  of green  bonds , a core  element  of the FWG’s  plan  to finance   the expansion  of renewable  energy  and carbon -saving  projects,  as discussed  below.     2.3 Tokenization   It is possible  to issue  a token  on the blockchain  that represents  a real world  security  like a stock,   bond,  title,  deed,  or even  a certificate  of authenticity  and which  can be moved  between   accounts  in that setting.  In capital  markets,  its promise  lies in real-time,  seamless  post -trade   clearing  and settlement,  as well as in migrating  custodial  services  from  an expensive  process  of  physical  asset  security  to one of automated,  software -backed  security.  The costs  of maintaining   the current,  intermediary -dominated  system  are significant,  not only  in the fees paid  to these   institutions  or the long,  multi -day delays  in concluding  transactions  but more  importantly  in the  hundreds  of billions  of dollars  tied up in collateral  and withheld  capital.  Unlocking  those  funds   will speed  up transactions  and release  liquidity  into markets  that have  been  starved  for it since   the financial  crisis -- as Luxembourg’s  asset  managers  know  too well.  Meanwhile,  if property   titles  are validated  and transferred  through  this means,  the provenance  can be proven  in realtime,  with  a clear,  immutable  record  of ownership,  liens  and other  attachments.  This can 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               300     greatly  lower  the friction  and costs  in real estate  transactions,  potentially  doing  away  with  title  insurance  and other  intermediary  services,  helping  loosen  up Luxembourg’s  tight  property   market.  .  When  combined  with  the secure,  remote,  automated  execution  of legal  claims  that’s  facilitated   by smart  contracts  (see below)  as well as blockchain -based  auditability  of source  data,  the  significant  reduction  in transaction  costs  that tokenization  allows  could  also foster  entire  new   asset  classes.  That’s  because  it becomes  cost-effective  to securitize  income  receivables  that  would  otherwise  be ineligible  for traditional  financial  engineering.  Examples  include  the  revenue  earned  by household  solar  panel  installations  or income  earned  from  temporary   housing  rentals.   These  new  blockchain  securities  will benefit  greatly  if there  is a benchmark  blockchain  issue   against  which  to price  them.  Here  lies a significant  opportunity  for the Luxembourg   government.  It could  follow  the lead  of the Monetary  Authority  of Singapore,  which  is  responsible  for issuing  all Singapore  Government  Securities  (SGS),  and is now  piloting  a  program  to do so over  the blockchain.  (In this case,  Singapore  is using  a private  blockchain,  not  by tokenizing  into the BItcoin  Blockchain.)263 Like Singapore,  Luxembourg’s  fiscal  situation,  with   debt-to-GDP  of just 21%,  is extremely  solid  - the two countries  are among  just thirteen  AAA rated  sovereigns  around  the world.  That  puts  it in a unique  position  to take  a leading  role in  creating  a euro -denominated  benchmark  blockchain  security.  The Finance  Ministry  should   explore  such  an option,  whether  over  a private  blockchain  or anchored  into a public  blockchain.   This is important  because  the blockchain  will likely  be a feature  of so many  other  securities  that  will be issued  to realize  Luxembourg  digital  aspirations,  including  that it become  a home  for  creating,  managing  and trading  green  securities.  Having  issued  the benchmark  bond  for these   new  asset  classes  will help  cement  leadership  of this important  new  part of the capital  markets.    Tokenization  also raises  the prospect  of sovereign  currency  itself  being  embedded  into the  blockchain.  Once  euro -backed  IOUs  are issued  into the Blockchain,  payments  can be transferred   across  this system  in fiat. That  could  allow  smaller  and medium -sized  financial  instituti ons to  transfer  funds  across  borders  without  paying  expensive  fee and collateral  costs  to  correspondent  banks.  Similarly,  local  exchange  trading  systems  (LETS),  substitute  currency   systems  aimed  at encouraging  localized  spending  in parallel  with  the nation al legal  tender   economy,  could  also be administered  in this manner.  With  Luxembourg  interested  in pursuing   such  options  to boost  the local  economy  -- in parallel  with  the financial  sector’s  internationally   driven,  euro -dominant  commercial  activities  -- this approach  is worth  studying.  Whether  it’s to                                                           263 Based on interviews at Monetary Authority of Singapore offices in Singapore, April 19, 2016  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               301     develop  a B2B credit  management  system  like Sardinia’ s Sardex264 or to nationally  extend   voucher  systems  such  as Redange’s  “Beki,”265 the Blockchain  removes  the risk that the  administrator  of the program  manipulate s balance  data  to allow  double -spending  or other   abuses.  What’s  more,  the traceability  and auditability  of blockchain  transactions  could  help  the  government  unlock  additional  benefits  from  the circulation  of these  tokens.  For example,  it  could  allow  the development  of automated  value -added  tax collection,  helping  to broaden  the  tax base,  which  the European  Commission  staff  has described  as an important  objective  for  Luxembourg.266  It should  be noted  that if there  is an expansion  in the use of digital  currencies,  be they   decentralized  currencies  such  as bitcoin  or digital  representations  of sovereign  currencies,  there   could  be a disruptive  impact  on banks  and therefore  on economies  with large  banking  sectors   such  as Luxembourg’s.  In fact,  banks  face  even  more  significant  disruption  if central  banks  go  ahead  with  plans  to issue  their  own  digital  currencies  under  a distributed -ledger  structure.  This  is being  studied  by the Bank  of Engla nd, the People’s  Bank  of China  and the Reserve  Bank  of  Australia.  It would  not be a surprise  if the European  Central  Bank  also studies  the prospect,   which  has been  a subject  of discussion  at Financial  Stability  Board -sponsored  meetings  to  explore  the monet ary policy  implications  of blockchain  technology.  The significance  for banks  is  that if individuals  and companies  are holdling  funds  simply  for payments  and short -term   custody,  a trusted  digital  currency  option  will make  them  less inclined  to hold  money  in short term  bank  deposits,  since  transactions  can simply  be managed  wallet  to wallet,  bypassing  the  banking  system.  While  that represents  a threat  to bank  income,  it must  be viewed  against  the  prospect  for greater  income  from  credit  issuance  as blockchain  technology  unlocks  capital  for  new  asset  classes  and for new  customers  among  previously  financially  excluded  populations.   While  such  shifts  are not imminent,  Luxembourg’s  banking  sector  need  to be prepared  for what   could  be a profound  realignment  within  the industry.  In the spirit  of the best  defense  being  a  strong  offense,  it’s yet another  reason  to develop  new  opportunities  to deploy  capital  within   new  asset  classes  such  as blockchain -based  tokenized  securities.                                                                 264 Posnett, E. “ The Sardex Factor, ” The Financial Times, September 18, 2015.  http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/cf875d9a -5be6 -11e5 -a28b -50226830d644.html   265 Luxemburger Wort, “'Sold out' bank notes - Redange 'Beki' currency, a victim of its own success,” Luxemburger  Wort, May 7, 2015. https://www .wort.lu/en/luxembourg/sold -out-bank -notes -redange -beki -currency -a-victim -ofits-own -success -554b2aa60c88b46a8ce58ca6   266 European Commission, “Commission Staff Working Document: Country Report Luxembourg 2016,” February 26,  2016; http://ec.europa.eu/europe2 020/pdf/csr2016/cr2016_luxembourg_en.pdf  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               302     2.4 Smart contracts   A smart  contract  refers  to a piece  of software  describing  a complex  process  involving  tokens   and participants,  such  as escrow,  delivery  vs. payment,  and other  common  financial  contracts.   An interesting  aspect  of smart  contracts  is that many  can be enforced  by The Blockchain  itself ,  instead  of by a third -party  institution.  Smart  contracts  and tokenization  promise  to obviate   entire  layers  of market  infrastructure  by having  the rules  that govern  the relationships  between   issuers,  owners  and traders  built  direc tly into the covenants  governing  a blockchain.  They  will  form  a quasi -legal  and automated  execution  layer  to usher  in an era of programmable  money   and open  a wealth  of powerful  new  applications  to give investors  greater  confidence  in the  execution  of their  claims  and interests.   The rising  interest  in Switzerland -based  Ethereum,  which  bills itself  as a decentralized  platform   for running  smart  contracts,  speaks  to how  important  this feature  is becoming  to the broader   applicability  of blockchain  technology.  In particular,  smart -contract  capability  will be important   to transactions  within  the Internet  of Things.  These  automated  transactions  must  be recorded   in a public,  decentralized  blockchain  that’s  secured  through  a robust,  distributed  consensus   algorithm;  the complexity  of relationships  between  devices  in an IoT ecosystem  means  that it’s  not feasible  to have  a centralized  platform  mediate  the transactions.  (This  reflects  the  Ethereum  platform’s  use in a number  of IoT-related  trials.)267 As Luxembourg  explores  sensor driven  “smart  city”  solutions  to the problematic  congestion  and mobility  within  the capital  city,  for example,  it will need  these  decentralized  smart  contract  structures  to regulate  the transfer   of funds  between  vehicles  and traffic  management  system s. In Luxembourg’s  finance  sector,   too, smart  contracts  will be the foundation  of new  derivative  and insurance  contracts  in which   payments  are triggered  by automated  data  inputs  rather  than  adjudicated  by an insurance  firm  or some  third -party  institution.    To optimize  the development  of this technology,  education  will be vital  -- especially  of the legal   profession.  An effort  to translate  these  software  code -driven  contractual  clauses  into  something  that is consistent  with  the analog  world  of existing  law is needed.  To this end,  the  government  is incentivized  to work  with  bodies  such  as the Barre au du Luxembourg  on  encouraging  education  for the profession.                                                                     267 Brody, P and Pureswaran, V, “Device Democracy: Saving the Future of the Internet of Things,” IBM, September  2014. http://www -935.ibm.com/services/us/gbs/thoughtleadership/internetofthings/  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               303     2.5 Social Disruption   It is important  to note  that phasing  in smart  contracts  and other  blockchain  applications  within   the financial  and legal  sectors  will likely  create  some  social  upheaval  in the form  of job  displacement.  Given  that Luxembourg’s  main  business  is banking,  as well as its supporting   infrastructure,  consideration  will need  to be made  for redirecting  and re-deploying  large  parts   of the workforce  as frictionlessly  and productively  as possible.   One possible  scenario  is that many  who  now  work  in these  evolving  sectors  can be re-deployed   through  Luxembourg’s  aggressive  push  to support  new  techn ology  development  in the  entrepreneurial  sector,  feeding  the very  change  that is being  created  in an extropic  value  loop.   With  their  accumulated  financial  expertise,  these  “new”  workers  might  also find employment  in  the emerging  global  microfinance  and microlending,  which  may  also tie into the tokenization  of  assets.      2.6 Green Finance   Smart  grids,  smart  homes  and buildings,  renewable  energy  and decentralized  community -based   energy  governance  are definitely  coming.  Because  these  will be constituted  by many  different   transacting  entities  and machines  -- in one,  important  segment  of the Internet  of Things  -- the  Blockchain  will become  the base  infrastructure  for regulating  the flow  of money  and energy   across  this intricate  web  of relationships.  It will provid e a mechanism  for automatically  auditing   and assessing  the vast array  of energy  and environmental  information  flowing  from  these   otherwise  independent  devices  in different  jurisdictions  and markets,  as well as market -pricing   mechanisms  needed  to optimize  resource  allocation.  As Vienna -based  energy  startup  Grid   Singularity  is showing,  the technology  can be used  to assess  the myriad  forms  of data  emerging   out of this complex  system  and thus  empower  public  electricity  administrators  to finely  tune   energy  distr ibution  at the lowest  cost with  minimal  carbon  emission.268                                                           268 Lacey, S. “The Energy Blockchain: How Bitcoin Could Be a Catalyst for the Distributed Grid,” Greentech Media,   February 26, 2016. http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the -energy -blockchain -could -bitcoin -be-acatalyst -for-the-distributed -grid 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               304     In this field,  we find bockchain  technology  sitting  at the intersection  of three  aspects : green   bonds,  green  microfinance  and crowdfunding.269 For one,  blockchain -proven  data  can be the  basis  upon  which bonds  issued  to finance  environmental  projects  are priced,  since  investors  will  demand  integrity  assurances.  Distributed -ledger  technology  will mediate  the flow  of  information  and money,  which  in turn  will foster  new,  negotiable  energy  and finance   instr uments.  These  include  contracts  backed  by low-scale  “prosumer”  generation  capacity  and  new  equity -like carbon -trading  assets  whose  dividends  are based  on the environmental  benefit   and cost savings  delivered  by the underlying  investment.  Such  investments  can in turn  be  bundled  into smart  contract -managed  securitizations  that also depend  on a blockchain  to  manage  a decentralized  securities  exchange,  creating  opportunities  for large  asset   management  firms,  as well as for individuals,  to participate  in microfin ance  and crowdfunded   investments.     As the recent  revelations  about  abuses  at U.S. fintech  firm Lending  Club  show,  it won’t  be  enough  to cut out middlemen  in crowdfunding  and other  “peer -to-peer”  lending  platforms;   these  big public  markets  for this vital  new infrastructure  need  the kind  of distributed  exchange   systems  enabled  by blockchains  and the device  identity  model.  In effect,  to accommodate  all  these  new  actors  and asset  categories,  the securities  industry  will move  toward  distributed   equity  and bonds  markets  in which  settlement  and clearing  occur  in real-time,  peer -to-peer   over  a blockchain.    Given  Europe’s  commitment  to a continent -wide  conversion  to renewable  energy,  these  new   asset  classes  may  quickly  evolve  into very  large,  liquid  and more  democra tic markets  for most   sought -after  investment  instruments  in the world.  If Luxembourg  leads  the way,  and embraces   the blockchain  infrastructure  that will secure  them,  it can become  a global  hub for the  origination,  collateralization  and trading  of these  products.     The overarching  goal  of these  initiatives  is a seamless,  Europe -wide,  integrated  network  of what   are otherwise  decentralized  energy  markets,  with  localized  generation  and consumption   monetized  through  the sale of both  contracts  and power  across  borders.   Given  the public  bond   funding  structure,  the Blockchain  will be essential  if trust  is to be instilled  in the data  emanating   from  the EU’s  28 different  countries  and 350 different  regions,  each  defined  by local  conditions,   standards  and regulations.  Blockcha in-based  smart  contracts  can be used  to design  derivatives                                                            269 As a supplemental note, i n many ways what we now call green or climate aware financing, green finance and  crowdfunding might be equally called Economic Performance Financing (EPF) through more traditional Economic  Performance Bonds (EBP).  In other words, and as already suggested, we  need to engage in both a higher level of  performance  and climate change mitigation and adaptation practices. If we don't achieve that multiple objective,  we may (or may not) achieve some environmental goals, but we may short -change the social and economic  goals.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               305     and other  agreements  that create  synthetic,  cross -border  energy  markets.  That’s  because  the  technology’s  capacity  for automation,  disintermediation,  powerful  data  analytics  and  micropayments  drives  transaction  costs  low enough  that liquid  markets  can arise  around   securities  whose  complex  structures  would  otherwise  make  them  unviable  for traditional   finance.      Proposal 3:  Extending the Boundary of the Luxembourg Solution   Building on the Luxembourg S ustainable Development Finance Platform, the Sustainable Energy  Finance Model, the aggregation of key energy and other resources in ways that drive large -scale  investment, and the introduction of Blockchain technology, w e also suggest that Luxembourg  assum e TIR -scale financial leadership within the European Union. It should consider introducing  a proposal or set of proposals to the 27 other Member States of the European Council as well as  to the European Commission and the Committee of the Regions. The inte nt of these proposals  would be to establish dedicated settings at the national, regional, and local level which might  then issue public bonds for the transformation of their national, regional, and urban  infrastructures into a digitalized, interconnected T hird Industrial Revolution paradigm.   Given the critical need to begin scaling up sooner rather than later, small transborder pilot  projects across the EU can be launched and evaluated in real -time with adjustments that are  made to ensure their on -going and evolving success. At some point, and with initial successes in  hand, financial and technical resources can be expanded to move pilot projects into the larger  scale of demonstration ventures across sectors, within communities, and eventually within  regions and nations.270 This is very much in the spirit of a phased -in approach using what has  been called experimental design271, or what we might call here real -time adaptive  management, to focus on achieving the multiple social, economic, and environmental  obje ctives. With an emphasis on learning as we go, rather than a typical "read y, aim, fire"  approach to problem solving, the management style should embrace an experimental                                                           270 As suggested by Byrne and Taminiau’s description of the SEF, financing and operating costs (other than interest  payments) can also be folded into the bonding capacity so that new revenues are not necessarily required. With a  series of initial suc cesses in hand, the confidence can build to ensure high quality bond ratings with funding that  covers both operations and investments.   271 The idea of experimental design is taken from Sullivan, Michael J., Fostering Innovation and Experimentation to  Improve  the Effectiveness of Energy Efficiency Programs.  Working Paper.  Sacramento, CA: California Public  Utilities Commission, 2008.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               306     mentality, but underscored again by real -time and ongoing evaluation to ensure continu ous  learning and improvement.272   At the same time, there is a very real need to promote the regulatory and policy elements that  will incentivize appropriate and credible ESCO development, certify proper training and  performance, guarantee early adoption with the transformation of all gove rnment and public  buildings into Internet of Things nodes, and provide government -supported training for  thousands of semi -skilled, skilled, and professional workers that will be needed to transition the  building stock into nodal Internet of Things platfor ms interconnecting in regions across the 28  Member States. There is a need for high quality technical proposals, regulatory proposals,  public policy proposals, financial proposals, new business models and business proposals, and  concrete projects and other  initiatives that reflect the collective judgement as to how best to  foster the goals, deliverables, and initiatives set forth by the Luxembourg working group to  transform the economy into a Third Industrial Revolution paradigm shift.     Proposal 4:  Complem entary Financial Mechanisms   The core ideas that underpin the creation of the Luxembourg Sustainable Development Finance  Platform, including both LuxSEF and blockchain deployment, can be accelerated by several  other financial strategies. With appropriate pr ogram design and implrementation, they may  enable a greater capacity to amplify the opportunity for larger -scale economic outcomes.  Following the listing in the Financial Working Group inventory, the complementary financial  tools are referenced and summari zed briefly here to serve as a further catalyst to encourage  the expansion of financial tools within Luxembourg.     4.1 Robo Advisors / Automated Advice   Robo -adviser start -ups, especially those which integrate artificial intelligence (AI) and data  analytics in underserved asset management arenas are on a disruptive trajectory (see HBR  Disruption Theory).273 Their impact should not be underestimated since theircurrent main                                                           272 The idea of “ready, fire, aim” is taken from the 1982 best -seller by Tom Peters and Robert H. Waterman, Jr., In  Search of Exc ellence —Lessons from America’s Best -Run Companies, HarperCollins.   273 *HBR: “Disruption” describes a process whereby a smaller company with fewer resources is able to successfully  challenge established incumbent businesses. Specifically, as incumbents focus on improving their products and  services for their most demanding (and usually most profitable) customers, they exceed the needs of some  segments and ignore the needs of others. Entrants that prove disruptive begin by successfully targeting those  overlooke d segments, gaining a foothold by delivering moresuitable functionality —frequently at a lower price.  Incumbents, chasing higher profitability in more -demanding segments, tend not to respond vigorously. Entrants 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               307     target is an underserved segment of the mass affluent and emerging affluent group of  individuals with liquid financial assets of €100,000 to €1,000,000.  This segment is typically  overlooked by private banking. Once their business model proves successful, some players will  start moving upmarket and offer highly customized services to the High Net Worth Individuals  (HNWI), at lower fees and potentially higher margins. At this stage, HNWI may adopt the new  service and happily accept its lower fees.   However, n ew players will need to gain the trust of investors and to deal with complex  regulatory hurdles. This constitutes an opportunity for traditional banks and asset managers  that, with a strong link to their customer base, are in a unique position to offer the ir services  such as hybrid robo -advice, which combine personal and automated advice.   The hybrid robo -advice sector is expected to grow to manage 10% of the world’s investable  assets by 2025, according to a Swiss research firm. MyPrivateBanking estimates th at the so called hybrid robo -advisers will manage $16.3 trillion (€14.7 trillion) within the next 15 years, a  process that could also reduce the cost of advice .13  The robo -advice industry is experiencing strong growth across Europe, wealth managers  creatin g their own platforms or partnering up and acquiring specialised start -ups. Luxembourg  can leverage its local expertise, ICT infrastructure and regulations to attract robo -adviser start ups and the robo -adviser units of traditional wealth managers. One pos itive step forward is to  create a center of expertise for AI and data analytics applied to asset management. For  example, specific courses might be set up at the University of Luxembourg as a first step to  attract and develop local talents. Niche markets m ight be established which focus on TIR -like  projects to attract venture capital and develop an ecosystem of startups that are focused on  TIR-specific applications of AI in the development of automated advice and process automation,  perhaps with a specific cluster from Luxinnovation. Other more extended strategies should also  be encouraged.     4.2 A Secure “Data Vault” as a Precondition to Smart Contracts   The Working Group is proposing to “Build a national secure data vault to drive efficiency and to  become t he leader in the design and implementation of smart contracts.” Luxembourg should  strive to set up a central, national platform where citizens and companies may upload any of  their personal data (name, address, property data, electronic medical data etc.);  a sort of “e                                                                                                                                                                                     then move upmarket, delivering the performanc e that incumbents’ mainstream customers require, while  preserving the advantages that drove their early success. When mainstream customers start adopting the  entrants’ offerings in volume, disruption has occurred. https://hbr.org/2015/12/what -is-disruptive -innovation  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               308     safe” hosting the data and giving the citizen or the company the possibility to grant access to  specific parts of this “vault” to selected stakeholders (e.g. government, banks, insurance  companies, medical suppliers, etc.).   Data would only h ave to be uploaded once and changes could be made centrally, automatically  updating contractual relations for these specific areas in the vault for which stakeholder access  is granted. The deployment of such a centralized secure data vault seems to be a pr econdition  for a nationwide roll -out of “s marts contracts” in the financial sector and beyond.   A roll -out of such an ambitious project would imply:    Identifying and defining a first viable proof of concept    Providing the technical, secured environment,    Cons idering a secured interaction between smart contracts and big data related  concepts   4.3 B2C Regional Currency   The FWG is exploring ways to “Support the deployment of B2C regional currencies in  Luxembourg.” Luxembourg might investigate the necessary financial  and legal mechanisms that  allow and enable municipalities to accept payments in regional currency.  This can be further  supported by generating additional research and consultations to extend that capacity.   So far, practically every real economy transaction is depending on the smooth functioning of  one single currency. This “monoculture” may be very efficient, but not necessarily always  resilient. New currencies could increase the resilience of the economy.   Regional currencies favor regional exchange. Beyond  the effects related to this, they also have  impacts  directly related to the TIR process:    Encourage the use of regional renewable resources for energy production    Encourage the re -use of material in the reg ion, hereby encouraging the use of reusable  materials, thus encouraging circular economy    Support regional production of food, by creating regional demand (“interlinkages”)   Regional currencies can be used to test TIR -related financial innovations such as b lockchain on a  small scale meaning low risk, low costs and quickly feasible. Testing a “crypto beki”274 quickly  would help to give rise to an adequate tool that could be used for the implementation of other                                                           274 Beki is the name of an established Luxembourg complementary currency. See: http://www.beki.lu/. In January  2013, the association “De Kär” launched the only existing complementary regional currency in Luxembourg, the so called Beki. The Beki p lays a key role in creating a regional and sustainable ecosystem.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               309     regional currencies.   Banks could offer credits in r egional currencies with lower interest rates and earn the same  margin than with higher interest rates. This supports sustainable development. Regional  currencies enable the linkage of social outcomes to financial ones. They can enforce regional  deployment of products by binding purchasing power to the regional economy and enable a  self-sufficient sustainable development / circular regional economy. Regional deployment of  products shortens transportation routes, reduces CO2 emissions, brings producers and  consumers closer together and enables social cohesion.   Regional currencies create sensitivity of consumers towards regional production and  consumption. They help creating positive feedback loops of regional exchange. Regional  currencies create cooperation ne tworks amongst companies and offer new companies access  to a network of cooperating companies. They tend to circulate faster and can have a positive  impact on turnover. (Demurrage increases this effect).   All these effects increase the resilience of the com panies and the entire ecosystem and help  increase turnover which both could have positive effects on jobs. Another socio -economic  effect would be that regional currencies create more cooperation between the companies of  the networks. Regional currencies ca n offer new business models for banks, based on exchange  fee charged to convert into standard currency and/or demurrage.     4.4 B2B Complementary Currency   In April 2015, NSNBC International asked the question “Is it time for the rise of local  currencies?”275  The question is highly consistent with the FWG recommendation to “ create a  complementary B2B -focused currency for Luxembourg and / or the Greater Region based on  mutual credit” analogous to WIR in Switzerland, SoNantes in France, and Sardex in Sardinia.  “Mutual credit” means that when a transaction is made between two companies, one “goes  negative” and the other “goes equally positive” on a central balance sheet managed by the  mutual credit organization. These “negative” and “positive” balances are the com plementary  money. All “negatives” and “positives” equal zero. This system creates money at the moment of  the transaction, meaning that it facilitates exchange for companies in lack of liquidity or helps  saving standard currency.   The system may be limited t o companies working on TIR -related projects or better conditions  could be offered to such companies and organizations. It can be combined with a credit system                                                           275 See: http://nsnbc.me/2015/04/14/is -it-time -for-the-rise-of-local -currencies/  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               310     based on securities. Especially when a demurrage is included in the system, credits can be  offere d at lower interest rates, making sustainable projects profitable.   Mutual credit tends to work in an anti -cyclical fashion in relation to the standard currency,  hereby helping to stabilize the economy. Due to its small area of circulation, it has similar  effects as regional currencies. Mutual credit  helps to increase the resilience of the economy  by  offering a further monetary option, which can be essential in times of credit crunch. It creates a  cooperation network between companies.   A sufficient money supply is essential for a smooth running of the economy. There can be  several reasons why the Euro system sometimes does not allow an adequate supply. One  reason could be that the economic growth is lower than the liquidity premium. This can lead to  a cred it crunch.   Just as any payment can create a chain reaction of further payments, any lack of money can  equally create a negative feedback loop. Thus a payment default, for whatever reason, can  create a negative chain reaction downstream. This is why, in ord er to keep the economy  running, it can be very important to have a secondary currency based on another mode of  operation. This is why this secondary currency can help stabilize the economy and jobs. It can  allow investments in TIR related projects such as renewable energies, by offering credits at  lower interest rates, making these projects more profitable. This helps the creation of  companies and jobs.   4.5 Crowdfunding   Peer -to-peer (P2P) lending provides more flexibility to the customer: Crowdfunding and o ther  participative platforms could replace some of conventional banking functions for borrowers  and lenders. Crowdfunding and traditional banking could become complementary rather than  mutually exclusive models. Some platforms extract additional informatio n to complement  standard credit profiles.  Crowdfunding and traditional finance could work in tandem to effect  first major changes within SME’s, project finance or start -ups (seed capital); in a second stage,  they could be developed/used to fuel investment banking activities in a P2P fashion (It would  be interesting for the Lux AIF’s industry). Crowdfunding could facilitate investment in TIR  projects.   4.6 Microfinance   Luxembourg is the leading financial centre for domiciling microfinance investment funds.  Coupled with other financial opportunities it makes, the Fiance Working Group suggests  promoting  microfinance for micro -and soc ial entrepreneurs in Luxembourg  by foste ring  “bottom -up innovative and sustainable projects.” While still a niche financial mechanism, 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               311     microfinance offers Luxembourg concrete opportunities for financing projects in the framework  of the Third Industrial Revolution. Especially social start -ups off er innovative solutions within  the sharing economy and are based on business models that have positive social and  environmental impacts. In the context of tighter lending policies and regulation, micro - and  social entrepreneurs can be excluded from the reg ular credit system. Microfinance as smart  money, combining financial support with training, coaching and mentoring contributes to the  financing of the TIR.   In Luxembourg, two microfinance programs exist so far, a foundation that can be used to build  upon f urther:    The “Coup de Pouce” program of FUSE (Fondation des Universitaires en Sciences  Economiques276) is an interest -free microcredit up to EUR 5.000 for young  entrepreneurs.    Microlux, a joint partnership between ADA277, ADIE278, EIF279 and BGL BNP Paribas280 is  the first microfinance institution for Luxembourg and the Greater Region. Implemented  in 2016, Microlux grants micro credits up to EUR 15,000 for business creation, “micro+”  up to 20,000 for business development and loans up to EUR 25,000 for social  enterprises. A network of experienced volunteers from the Luxembourgish ecosystem  accompanies and coa ches microlux clients.   Microfinance is facilitating investment in TIR projects. Based on the model of other  microfinance institutions, such as Qredits in the Netherlands, microStart in Belgium, Adie in  France and PerMicro in Italy, microlux is expected to  boost micro - and social entrepreneurship,  lower unemployment and improve job sustainability.       Proposal 5:  Building a Strategic Effort   To be successful, the above -described financial mechanisms need to be accompanied by a  wholesale transformation in Luxem bourg’s approach to financial education and regulatory  policies.                                                              276 See: http://eco.lu/Lancement -officiel -de-la-2e-vague.%2023%20http:/   277 See: http://www.ada -microfinance.org/en.   278 See: http://www.adie.org/.   279 See: http://www.eif.org/.   280 See:  https://www.bgl.lu/en/bank/homepage.htm  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               312     5.1 Financial Education   “Financial education: for an improvement at all levels”.    At a time when financial decisions become increasingly significant in the lives of citizens,  financial edu cation (financial literacy) becomes essential. Against this backdrop, a growing  number of countries have recently developed national strategies for financial literacy; a subject  matter which forms an integral part of the border topic of “economic education ”, which aims to  give citizens and professionals the key to understand and apprehend the economic and  financial world we live. Compared to other countries, Luxembourg appears to lag behind in  terms of financial education, although some players, often priva te, already offer financial  literacy educational modules to schools and/or the broader public. Luxembourg has not yet  adopted a true national strategy for financial education, nor has it officially designated a  competent authority in this field. There is also little research carried -out in this area.   The three vertical pillars of the Finance WG (IoT as game changer, new business models, and  the financial sector as an enabler) cannot be treated in silos. Initiatives already exist in the  three  verticals. However, the level of development varies from one sector to another. This has  to be addressed:    For students : existing educational program need to include more focus on financial  literacy and financial education    For teachers : exchange and information progr ams may need to be developed    For consumers : exchange and information programs may need to be developed    For professionals : specific programs should be included in conferences on the relevant  changes needed in financial education    At regulatory level, tech nologies departments have to be established or further developed.   Action at the level of financial education should commence as soon as possible. Regarding  secondary schooling , Luxembourg is currently prepar ing a comprehensive secondary education  reform bi ll. Ideally, financial and economic education should be ambitiously integrated within  the focus of this reform.   The overall aim should be the creation of a well -functioning ecosystem where all the actors  easily interact.  The main priorities include:    The st rengths and weaknesses of the Luxembourg population in the field of financial  education should be identified via an ambitious assessment study (e.g. there is a specific  module on financial education within the OECD PISA program that could be used as a  base line),  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               313      A long -term national strategy in the field of financial education should be defined and  implemented,    Financial education should be included into the general school curricula.   For consumers and professionals dedicated actions plans should also be rolled out. Dedicated  working groups should be created, implicating all relevant public and private stakeholder.   Luxembourg should strive to allow for a smooth interaction between the development of its  financial centre, on the one hand, and training and e ducation of local resources, on the other  hand.   The main objectives in this field are twofold:    to inform, encourage and motivate young people to experience entrepreneurship and to  look for opportunities in engaging studies in the domain of new, actual and future  financial instruments (ex. FinTech).    In the short term (2016) the holding of one or sev eral meetings between professional  decision -makers of the financial sector and teachers to exchange on actual and future  topics/instruments and issues in the domain of FinTech and their impact on the  Luxembourg Financial Sector could be envisaged.   5.2 Regu latory Framework Review and Adjustment   There is a clear role for the Luxembourg financial community as a first mover in a changing  European environment. Banks will indeed remain key actors but new actors emerge alongside  banks. If these new actors are pro viding financial services , they will have to be regulated just  like any other financial actor and under the same conditions. This is what is currently happening  in Luxembourg, allowing for a level playing field between “traditional” and “new” actors.   Thus,  the following considerations, even though if centered in the narrative on “banks”, have to  be read and interpreted as to allow for interoperability and standardization between the  different sectors in order to ensure that digitalization will be able to de ploy its full benefits  whilst continuing to cater for a level playing field.   If we want to have a well -functioning market implementing the new technologies, digitalization  and FinTech have to be considered in a global context, with regard to the actors and  the  services concerned. For instance, FinTech actors will face similar privacy issues as  BioTech/BioHealth actors, hence a common working structure should be put in place in order  to solve data privacy aspects together with the CNPD.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               314     We could anticipate in this context e.g.:    The new regulation on data protection, AML 4,    The ICT standardization,    The Digitalisation of the EU single Market,    Mifid II and the new financial instruments   Luxembourg should strive to anticipate the EU regulatory framework and t o identify the  advantages for the country included therein, in order to be a first mover within an EU  regulatory framework.   Luxembourg stakeholders encourage the TIR -team of experts to provide further advice and  guidance on how to reach this objective, e.g  by creating specialized task forces mandated to  study upcoming EU regulation in order to develop a strategy on the implementation process.   The digital transformation in financial services requires a fast paced regulatory adjustment by  EU policymakers in o rder to enable financial innovation for the benefit of consumers and the  EU economy in a fast -moving global context:    All sectors, not least banking, are being transformed by the new digital environment  and related innovative business models.    Banks are already leading actors in this transformation  and they contribute in many  ways to the new digital ecosystem, in particular through payments and digital banking.    Furthermore, they have embraced the digital innovation opportunity in many ways,  accelerating the rethinking of their traditional business model, proposing innovative  products/apps, engaging in FinTech partnerships, and financing innovative starts -ups.    In this sense, the new digital environment represents a great opportunity to develop  further financial services and bring the banking industry up to an even higher level of  performance to the benefit of its users.   o Note: Insurance and reinsurance companies are, next to banks, active players in  this field. Digitalization means a direct link between the client and the company,  not only to subscribe contracts but also to manage them actively, in particular in  case of a claim.   o In addition, (re)insurance companies are not only involved in the “digitalization”  because they make use of technology,  but also because they (partly) cover the  underlying risks.    Given this, as well as their prominent role of financing the economy (including the  digital economy), banks welcome an opportunity to act as a strategic partner for  building a  successful digital single market within the European Union .  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               315      This said, the current regulatory framework  is not properly adapted to the deployment  of digital financial services and needs further adjustments to be fit for the digital reality.  Currently, the regulatory framewo rk does not allow banks to take full advantage of  technological innovations, hindering the digital transformation of the industry and  obstructing the launch of innovative products and services.    Policymakers should ensure that EU regulation is adjusted to the digital reality also for  financial services. The focus needs to be on regulating activities  rather than institutions  that offer them. It is not a call for new regulations but more about adjusting,  simplifying, removing  obstacles and inconsistencies and  modernizing the EU  regulatory framework .    With this in mind, the Digital Single Market Strategy (DSM) – though to be generally  welcomed – should be reflected upon further, in order to take into account the  abovementioned aspects.   5.3 Holistic and Consist ent Deployment of Regulation   Digital transformation should be understood as a whole, seeking the right balance between the  drivers of change and the impact on the existing business model.   The current banking regulatory environment does not reflect the fast moving digital  phenomenon. New access methods fostering a real cross -border and cross -sector economy (e ID, e -signature, e -invoicing, online platforms etc.) may change the way business operates across  different markets. This complete shift of paradigm  requires a renewed approach in order to  efficiently balance benefits, risks and avoid market distortions. It means that banking legislation  should be adapted to the digital market reality.    Overall, the Digital Single Market strategy should consider and be aligned with existing or  forthcoming EU initiatives which will affect financial services.   It should notably be the case regarding the work currently conducted by the European  Commission to  build a Capital Markets Union (e.g. alternative –digital - investment platforms for  crowdfunding, Venture Capital) or on the Green Paper on Retail Financial Services (e.g. digital  cross -border sales in Europe). Some recent or on -going EU legislations do no t yet properly or  fully address the development made possible by digitalization, leading to certain contradictions  or inconsistencies that are potential obstacles to the Digital Single Market becoming a reality. It  is notably the case for the Payment Servi ces Directive (PSD2), the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR), the Network and Information Security Directive (NIS) or the 4th Anti-Money  Laundering Directive. Also, for instance, most EU regulators enforce cloud technology to be  compliant with local  outsourcing regulations (outsourcing regulations have not been  harmonized) which by definition is against the idea of the cloud (which is meant for cross -
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               316     border). These regulations can contradict with the core objectives principles of the cloud or  lead to  further inconsistencies.   5.4 Avoiding Fragmentation of Regulations   Currently the national consumer protection and contract laws differ throughout the 28 Member  States and companies usually need to act in accordance with the host countries’ national  consu mer protection laws and supervisory measures. It is also true that the retail financial  services market is still fragmented due to culture/language barriers, divergences in national  taxation, civil law and product specifications defined by national regulat ions and consumer  needs which remain mainly local.   At present, inconsistent requirements in different countries are hampering innovation in new  services. Banks and consumers are not able to reap the full benefits of digitalization. This is  particularly the  case regarding access to platforms, data privacy, cloud and big data.   5.5 Ensure the Right Conditions for Innovation to Thrive    Banks should be allowed to develop activities beyond traditional banking under the same  conditions as their competitors.   Consi dering the overall picture of how financial services are provided in the digital arena, it  is key to provide the right environment for banks to innovate.Banks planning to develop  activities beyond pure traditional banking (marketplaces, aggregators) or pot entially  integrating FinTech companies into their business models, should not be constrained by the  obligation to consolidate any subsidiary or affiliated company within the regulatory scope of  the parent company owing to capital requirements, level of sup ervision, security and  liability.    The principle of “same services/risks, same rules” should apply to all companies  regardless of the sector or location.   A competitive and innovative EU Digital Single Market features safeguards regarding  consumer protectio n, trust and security. Fair trade and open competition on the market  enables consumers to access a range of new competitive products with higher  performance. It also enables companies to offer products to a broader array of customers.  To do so, the right c ompetitive environment should be set and allow an open and fair  competition among the market players.   o Regardless of the sector: Because products and services will be under high pressure  to be  supplied instantly, safely and with a guarantee of quality, the principle of  “same services/risks, same rules” should apply to all companies offering similar 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               317     products and services whatever the market/sector they are targeting when it  involves comparable ri sks. All companies should benefit from the same  opportunities and flexibility to innovate.   o Regardless of the location (the global dimension should be considered): because  the DSM  should have a global dimension, it is also important to eliminate or reduce  the regulatory divergence with other non -EU countries such as the United States,  Asian countries etc.    For example, regarding accounting rules for intangible assets, there are  different treatments between the EU and US concerning capital  requirements/consumption for investment in software. In accordance with  the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) software should be  accounted as intangible assets and , as such, deducted from the “core capital”  of banks, while according to US Generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP) accounting standards, software is considered a tangible asset as  “plant, properties and equipment” and hence not deducted from core  capital. This creates a  competitive distortion between EU and USA banks.    On data protection and data value chain: an uneven international playing  field in the storage of data via cloud computing can be observed. EU players  face certain geo -localisation and data privacy restrictions whereas US players  do not and are able to use da ta stored on the cloud all over the world. There  are also restrictions to the development of new digital business models in  the cloud, with a worldwide architecture, based on the exploitation of data   All companies offering similar financial products and s ervices involving comparable risks,  whatever the market/sector they are targeting, should be submitted to the same rules (e.g.  AML/KYC) or offered the same flexibility as their competitors (e.g. prudential and compliance).  The Digital Single Market should insure a level playing field in the application of such measures.    EU policymakers should assess the opportunity of developing in Europe a regulatory  framework for experimentation such as e.g. regulatory sandboxes  that would be open to  all innovative player s. Given the huge potential for transformation, policymakers should be  encouraged to  investigate new ways of providing regulatory flexibility testing innovative  products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms without immediately  incurring all t he normal regulatory consequences of pilot activities, while at the same time  providing sufficient safeguards to consumers. Eligibility criteria would need to be the same  for all, both incumbents and new players.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               318     5.6 Understanding and Respecting Basic Ba lances   New customer centric models demand a broader and more comprehensive clarification of  customer protection rules, the role to be performed and liabilities to be borne by new business  models. If this point is considered, customers will be able to enjoy  much better protection in  relation to their funds and their purchases as well as to their privacy and ability to interoperate;  The regulatory framework should properly balance the promotion of new digital value  propositions while ensuring appropriate cons umer and investor protection, data privacy,  security and prudent risk management.    In addition, strengthening cooperation and raising the awareness of EU citizens on the  growing  threats from cybercrime is crucial . Financial institutions are one of the prima ry  targets for cyber -attacks. As a result, the industry is committing considerable IT investments  towards protective measures for customers and to maintain trust. These protective  measures should also encompass more initiatives to increase the awareness of  the  employees in the financial sector. Making digital finance secure and building trust should be  a concern for all, including public and private actors.   It notably implies the establishment of a legal framework and creation of a Joint  Public/Private Cybersecurity Platform:   ⁻ To exchange information about latest risks and trends.   ⁻ To exchange best practices in cyber -crime prevention.   ⁻ To disseminate the awareness about the cyber risks among the industry peers and the  public.   Certainly, the (re)insurance sector has an important role to play for increasing the  understanding of the cyber threats, as it covers the risks for now several yea rs. If initially the  covers were restricted to the costs associated to the appointment of IT specialists to deal with  the incident, the covers embed now loss of data and liability. This means that the (re)insurance  sectors has gained experience in preventi ng the incidents, understanding the origins and  restricting the consequences. This experience should be leveraged.   At the same time, banks are facing increasing information and incident reporting requests from  various authorities (SSM, ENISA, national comp etent authorities , etc. ). A coordinated and more  harmonized approach between various authorities would optimize banks efforts in this field.   Ultimately a clear harmonized legal framework regarding incident information sharing between  companies should be pu t in place. Concrete actions are urgently needed at the European level.  These actions should be supported by the Luxembourg Government as almost any piece of  Luxembourg legislation is derive d from EU regulatory framework.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               319                                                        INFO BOX – 10 THEMES TO BE ADDR ESSED FOR A SU CCESSFUL DIGITAL  TRANSFORMATION   1. General legislation and regulation of the financial sector: Transformational change  requires intense cooperation between industry, lawmakers and regulators.  Regulators will play a key role to ensure a level playing field as well as protection .  Success can only be granted within the European Digital Single Market (striking the  right balance between enabling innovations, ensuring stability, protecting  consumers, and preventing financial crimes as well as avoidi ng market  fragmentation) and beyond.     2. Cloud: Create an appropriate framework (including by promoting ICT standards) that  allows EU financial services to innovate by using cloud technologies taking into  account the international dimension. Ensure level play ing field among European  (compliance with local outsourcing regulations…) and non -European actors (e.g.  data location restrictions)     3. Data (data value chain and privacy): Ensure legal certainty on the use of Big Data and  open data and a common understanding on key concepts such as data ownership  and anonymisation and pseudo -anonymisation. Provide for an appropriate  regulatory framework (including assessing further the impact of the recent data  protection regulation  on digital banking) which ensure a fair access to (open) data,  and allows for the development of competitive business models based on data, as  well as a comprehensive use of data analytics while ensuring safeness and privacy of  personal data within the EU  and:      Allowing balanced restrictions on profiling (notably for a full use of data  analytics to the benefits of customers, as well as e.g. in the assessment of  creditworthiness and fraud prevention);     Considering the international dimension by promoting  consistency between  EU rules and rules applicable to non -European actors;     Allowing a wider range of (pseudo -) anonymised data processing for client’s  personal data.       4. Platform and infrastructures: Regulate digital platforms and infrastructures to  ensu re a high level of security (including strong authentication) and a balance rights  and liabilities of third party providers. Regulate access on a reciprocal basis for  financial institutions to customer related information held in other digital platforms.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               320                                                5. Access/e -identification/e -signature: Harmonise the rules of digital access (including  customer on -boarding, authentication and KYC processes) to banking services and  product, and ensure interoperability within the EU by promoting banking initiative  where b anks are  providers of digital identity services, possibly in collaboration with  public authorities ; remove  existing barriers to the cross -border use of electronic  identification by defining “banking assurance levels” for authentication purposes  and by p romoting an interoperable environment with the recognition of a  preferential use of cross -border national e -IDs in agreement with public authorities;  establishing common e -KYC standards for individuals and companies and common  standards for document authen tication and procedure to ease the use of e signature at domestic and cross -borders level.            6. Payments and aggregation: Establish harmonized licenses, conditions of approval  and supervision across EU to operate with transactions, payments and financi ng and  foster the viability of European card and payments business models. Make sure that  the same level of consumer protection and data privacy is implemented by all the  actors in the payment and aggregation chain. Ensure a fair allocation of rights and  liabilities amongst all actors in the payment/aggregation chain.      7. Cybersecurity: Ensure high standards of cyber protection requirements for entities  and third party providers accessing platforms and bank accounts. Avoid duplicative  reporting requirements.  Raise awareness towards public authorities, industry and  consumers on potential cyber risks & threats. Create the appropriate framework and  network for information sharing (threats, incidents ad countermeasures)     8. Blockchain technologies: For the financial  services sector Blockchain technology  could provide opportunities to overhaul existing banking infrastructure, speed  settlements and streamline stock exchanges; EU framework (although perhaps  premature to consider any regulation at this stage) should put the banking sector in  the position to take full advantage of solutions using this technology.      9. Alternative lending and investments (assets and liabilities): Ensure consistent  harmonization and supervision of investment and lending licenses to ensure  customer and investor protection; Ensure a level playing field among EU players and  with non EU players, remove inconsistencies in EU legislation and obstacle to  innovations.       10. Digital skills: Improve employee’s skills and competencies focusing on the conduc t of  a digital/online business in order to guide customers through online product and  services. Improve job rotation practice, to help incentives for knowledge exchange  and to build multi -skill professional profiles (e.g. through structured job rotation).      
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               321      SMART ECONOMY   OVERVIEW   Luxembourg already ranks number one in  Internet penetration in the European Union,  with 100% coverage. 99.4% of households have  mobile phones and 94% of all households have  computers. Eight out of every ten  households  have  high speed access. In addition, 9 out of 10  businesses use broadband connection.281   Luxembourg also boasts a highly advanced ICT  sector which accounts for 6.6% of the total gross added value of the country. The ICT sector  accounts for 4% of employment in Luxembourg. Moreover, Luxembourg hosts some of the  leading ICT companie s including Amazon, Ebay, Vodafone , and  Rakuten.282  These numbers constitute an important starting point for the continuous build -up of a growing  ICT infrastructure in Luxembourg that  must be able to sustain the exponential traffic growth  rates foreseen in t he future. For example, world mobile data traffic is expected to grow to 30.6  exabytes per month by 2020 .283  Tim Berners -Lee put the World Wide Web online in 1990. Today, a younger generation is  studying in global classrooms via Skype and FaceTime, socializi ng with cohorts around the world  on Facebook, gossiping with hundreds of millions of peers on Twitter, sharing photos on  Snapchat, contributing to the knowledge of the world on Wikipedia, tapping into virtually all of  the information generated in the world  on Google, and taking free Massive Open Online  College Courses and receiving credits.   The World Wide Web is simple in design and acute in impact. The Web allows anyone, anytime,  anywhere, to share information with anyone else, without having to ask permis sion or pay a  royalty fee. The Web is designed to be open, universally accessible, and distributed.                                                            281 See: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics -explained/index.php/Information_society_statistics_ _households_and_ individuals   282 See: http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/7141198/4 -21012016 -AP-EN.pdf   283 Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2015 –2020,  http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service -provider/visual -networking -index -vni/mobile -white paper -c11-520862.pdf  Co-Chairs Claude Strasser and Mario Grotz , and  the Luxembourg Smart Economy  Working  Group;   Michael Waidner (Fraunhofer SIT), Philipp  Krüger  (Fraunhofer SIT), Giovanni Corazza  (University of Bologna), and Jeremy Rifkin, TIR  Consulting Group LLC    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               322     Three and a half billion people, nearly half the human population on Earth, are currently  connected to the Internet. Recently, China began manufacturing $25  smart phones with more  computing power than what was used to send our astronauts to the moon, increasing the  prospect that soon the entire human race will be connec ted and communicating with one   another, sharing knowledge, work, and entertainment, making new fri endships and finding  mates at near zero marginal cost in the largest extended fictional family in history.284 The  Communication Internet is erasing border after border and connecting the human race in a  single, global, virtual public square – and the marginal cost of participating is nearly zero and  virtually free.   And now, even the airwaves are becoming free. New technologies for managing  communications and Big Data over the radio frequencies are changing the very nature of  broadband  communications. Smart antennas, dynamic spectrum access, cognitive radio  technologies, and mesh networks are among the new technologies that are expanding the  spectrum to a cheap and abundant resource by using it more efficiently and with greater agility.   This will result  in both licensed and unlicensed use of spectrum, addressing the needs for  ultrabroadband access, mission critical services, and the Internet of Things with trillions of  interconnected devices. Evolved WiFi and 5G networks hold the promise to fulfil these dreams.   But open, transparent, and free communication is not assured. The Internet communication  revolution has a dark side. Universal interconnectivity makes possible the democratization of  communication and the flow of Big Data, but also poses serious ch allenges. How do we ensure  network neutrality as well as critical services in an interconnected world?  How do we prevent  governments and global companies from monopolizing the Internet for political and  commercial gain? How do we protect personal privacy and guarantee data security? How do we  prevent cybercrime and defend against cyberterrorism in a world where everyone is  connected? How do we build resiliency into the communication system to avert a massive  disruption and even collapse of the platform?   The Dark Net is already ever -present, and becoming a dangerous menacing force that could  forestall and even derail the journey into a more democratic, cosmopolitan, and ecologically  sustainable society. Local and global efforts that keep the Communication In ternet up and  running and Big Data flowing freely and not subject to massive disruption will define the  political struggle in the coming decades, especially in highly developed nations like Luxembourg  that are far ahead in the build out and scale up of a u biquitous communications network, and  therefore more likely to be vulnerable to the forces of the Dark Net. In preparing for a Third  Industrial Revolution future, Luxembourg will have to devote considerable human and financial                                                           284 See: http://www.wsj.com/articles/mozilla -to-sell-25-smartphones -1402466959  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               323     resources to build resiliency  into every part of the communication and Big Data network that is  emerging.   The dot -com bubble of the late 1990s was a misestimate of the timing, not the magnitude, of  the digital revolution. Today, digital technology is replacing labor in increasingly c omplex tasks.  This process of labor substitution and disintermediation has been underway for some time in  service sectors – think of online banking, enterprise resource planning, procurement or  customer relationship management. And it is spreading to the p roduction of goods, where  robots, cyberphysical systems, new sensor technology and 3D printing are displacing labor.  Luxembourg and the EU are part of this global digital transition towards a world in which the  most powerful global flows will be ideas, e -services and digital capital, not goods, traditional  services, and traditional capital. The rapidly growing digital component of global flows  exemplifies this trend285:    The transition into a seamless emerging Digital Era will favor regions that build the  infrastructure, institutions, skills and business environments that their innovators, companies  and citizens need to participate fully.   Adapting to this digital transition will require shifts in mindsets, policies, investments (especially  in human capital), and increasingly also models of employment and distribution. For an agile,  wealthy and advanced economy such as Luxembourg, this creates new openings to carve out                                                           285 Global flows in a digital age: How trade, finance, people, and data connect the world economy , McKinsey Global  Institute Report , April 2014.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               324     profitable roles in the new digital global economy. Already a world leader in digital adoptio n,  Luxembourg has a competitive advantage when it comes to the build out and scale up of a  Third Industrial Revolution digital infrastructure.   Not surprisingly, the objectives set out in the Luxembourg national strategy far exceed those  set by the Digital  Agenda for Europe. “The national plan aims for networks with ultra -high speed rates, more precisely 1 Gbps for 100% of the population in 2020. 85% of the population  may already be connected at rates of 30 Mbps or higher. ”286 This leads to the question how  Luxembourg can scale and monetize this competitive advantage beyond its established core  ICT business.    On the other hand, we believe that shortcomings as recently listed in the EU Commission’s  Country Report on Luxembourg287 and also the World Economic Foru m Networked Readiness  Index288 especially in targeted Public and Business R&D Investment (despite positive  investments and reforms at the University of Luxembourg and LIST), suggest that the overall  Business Environment is still lacking an Entrepreneurial Ec osystem (despite the introduction of  new seed funding structures and the Fit4start program). Moreover, Luxembourg has relatively  high regulatory barriers in the service sector (notably in business services and retail), is  experiencing negative productivity  growth, relatively high unit labor costs, below EU -average  PISA students ’ performance, especially in mathematics and science (not to mention the  universal bottleneck in computer science education), risky reliance on diminishing tax revenues  from a legacy financial sector, and relatively high youth unemployment.   If properly addressed, these positives and negatives can spur a sense of urgency on the part of  the Government of Luxembourg and other key stakeholders to act beyond previous initiatives  and diversi fy Luxembourg’s economy towards a truly sustainable and scalable Third Industrial  Revolution. To quickly advance the new economic paradigm, Luxembourg will need to draw  upon its prior success in the ICT sector and begin a rapid build out of a digitalized Renewable  Energy Internet and digitalized Mobility Internet alongside its already developed  Communication Internet connected by an Internet of Things platform.   Based on lessons learned from comparable second mover (in comparison to Silicon Valley)  smart ec onomy hubs such as Tel Aviv, Singapore, London, Barcelona and Zurich, we strongly  believe that strength in only one aspect of a digital/smart economy (namely Luxembourg’s                                                           286 See: https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/country -information -luxembourg#summary -of-broadband development -in-luxembourg   287 Commission Staff Working Group Document: Country Report Luxembourg 2016 , European Commission,  February 2016.   288 The Global Information Technology Report 2015: ICTs for Inclusive Growth, WEF, Cornell University, INSEAD,  2015.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               325     outstanding digital infrastructure) is not sufficient to sustainably boost overall ec onomic  performance, tax revenue, and employment. What  is needed is an interactive mix of  institutions, skills, business ecosystems, regulation and infrastructure. For comparison, we point  to the good “Smart Economy” performances across the board  in Singapo re289 and Switzerland  as shown in the WEF table290 below.   Both locations faced comparable legacy financial sector models and similarly challenging policy,  investment, demographics, human capital and productivity challenges as Luxembourg but  managed to find th eir respective sustainable niches in the global digital economy.                                                                289 Compare Singapore’s focus on 3 Strategic Thrusts , Infocomm Media 2025 Report, Ministry for Communication  ans Information Singapore, A ugust 2015.   290 The Global Information Technology Report 2015: ICTs for Inclusive Growth, WEF, Cornell University, INSEAD,  2015.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               326     STATE OF PLAY AND LUXEMBOURG VISION   Based on deep collaboration between the Luxembourg Working Group and TIR Consulting  Group LLC, “Smart Economy” should be approached as a de -siloed META -pillar, which brings  together communication, energy, and mobility in a seamless infrastructure made up of the  Communication Internet, the Renewable Energy Internet and the automated GPS and driverless  Mobility Internet in a super Internet that will fundamentally change the way Luxembourg   manages, powers, and moves economic activity ac ross its myriad value chains.  Moreover, this  Meta -Pillar should be leveraged to define and further develop a specific co re strategic vision  that transcends and integrates not only the five Smart Economy themes proposed by the  Luxembourg Smart Economy Working Group  but also the other sub -pillars in the evolving  Luxembourg Third Industrial Revolution Strategy Study.   Accordin g to Townsend and Lorimer , digital masterplans  are most successful when they aspire  to be visionary.291 Vision , in this context , is understood not so much as a detailed blueprint but  as an overarching theme that enables an effective implementation of the mas terplan over time  and across changing stakeholders and public -private partnerships (governments, CEOs and  change of transition team leaders ).   Luxembourg has considerable assets and knowhow when it comes to broadband, Wi Fi and  specialized Tele com infrastru cture, FinTech, EU -regulatory leverage through local EU  institutions and offices, legacy in registration and incorporation of legal private and business  entities for global customers, taxation and accounting know -how, scaled “trust economy ,” and  several  small scale e -Administration pilot projects.   Recognizing the value of data flows, many locations are trying to create the “next Silicon  Valley.” But innovation is notoriously hard to orchestrate —and that is not the only way to  participate in the digital g lobal economy. “Our experience shows that countries benefit from  receiving cross -border digital flows as well as producing them. In other words, countries do not  need to transform themselves into digital content or platform producers to benefit from global   data flows. ”292   It is therefore our advice to formulate one core strategic vision that builds upon Luxembourg’s  existing assets as described above, positioning Luxembourg both as a producer and as a                                                           291 Digital Master Planning: An Emerging Strategic Practice in Global Cities , NYU Marron Institute of Urban  Management, June 2015.   292http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Business%20Functions/McKinsey%20Digital/Our%20Insights/Dig ital%20globalization%20The%20new%20era%20of%20global%20flows/MGI -Digital -globalization -Full-report.ashx  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               327     recipient  of digital flows, and develop these strands fur ther into an overarching theme that can  position Luxembourg as a leader in the journey to a smart Digital Europe.   The “digitized Internet of Things Economy” will inevitably have a deep impact on the way we  live, work, and relate to each other. In this inte rconnected world, data is the new oil that fuels  the economy and a smart use of data will be the most valuable asset to stay ahead of  competition in terms of innovation, client retention, efficiency and productivity. ICT is clearly  the enabler to free the economic potential across all the critical sectors that make up the  Luxembourg commercial space. The Luxembourg working group nevertheless shares the view  that while a “digital economy” is at the heart of a “smart economy ,” other elements need to be  taken into consideration to reap the full benefits of this transformational process.  The working  group has built its report around the following building blocks:    What is the vision for a “Smart Economy” and, more importantly, what should it achieve  in terms of b roader societal goals;    What is the current positioning of Luxembourg in the digital economy (SWOT analysis) ;    What is the roadmap to achieve a “Smart Economy” in Luxembourg and what are the  key topics to focus on.   The Smart Economy should reconcile quanti tative and qualitative growth targets to allow  Luxembourg to maintain its high living standard while dramatically lowering the marginal cost  of producing and distributing goods and services . With this in mind, Luxembourg has prioritized  three overriding lo ng-term goals :    Competitiveness and efficient use of resources    Digital Inclusion, “Buy in” by society at large    Sustainable growth and social welfare model   In the past decades Luxembourg has created exceptional wealth for the country, building on  the strengths of its open and export driven economy. This growth model is nevertheless not  sustainable in the longer term without a smart approach towards economic and societal  developments. Indeed, the current growth model poses serious drawbacks for the coun try  (example: financing social security and pensions, environmental impacts, increasing workforce  and population, dependency on financial sector , etc. ) and for its neighboring countries  (example: the flight of skilled workforce and fiscal resources). Luxem bourg also has to cope  with a changing international environment, particularly in regard to regulations and taxation  issues where international institutions undermine the sovereignty rights of national  governments.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               328     The smart economy concept reconciles the economy with the principles of sustainability  through the use of ICT for inclusive growth, economic diversification and social empowerment.  ICT is used to enhance quality, performance and interactivity of services, to reduce fixed costs,  decrease ecologica l footprint, and improve connectivity between users.   Smart economy development, through the increasing use of the Internet of Things (IoT  platform), generates a high quantity of data requiring an extensive infrastructure, resilient  information highways, da ta centers, as well as high -performing computing power, allowing real time exploitation of data.   Innovation is the key to a smart interconnected economy: new ideas help to generate economic  activity as well as to attract new businesses and new workers. The  Internet of Things society  fosters deep collaboration in ever -expanding webs, enabling traditional industries and new  start -up entrepreneurial enterprises to transition from the conventional adversarial relations in  traditional markets to shared open -sour ce relations on a burgeoning commons. Working  collaboratively to solve problems and create new opportunities is crucial to a thriving smart  economy. Through connectivity, the collaboration models are redefined.   Digital technologies play a central role in value creation in the economy and bring a radical  transformation to research and development and to the production and distribution of goods  and services. Areas like Big Data, the Internet of Things, and automatization processes offer  great opportunities f or every sector and industry.   Luxembourg’s Smart Economy working group has identified four critical areas that underline its  current strengths a nd weaknesses :    State of the art ICT infrastructure ; Luxembourg is well -positioned according to latest  statistic s.    Business' inte gration of digital technologies ; Luxembourg is weak compared to the EU  average, especially as regards SME’s.    ICT Skills ; Luxembourg lacks the expertise to deploy the digital revolution and the  educational system is not positioned to over come the digital skills gap.    Framework conditions that stimulate  the uptake of new technologies ; Luxembourg is  generally perceived as “business friendly” but room for manoeuvre is shrinking and  competition is strong.        
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               329       
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               330     Moving towards a smart economy requires a systemic approach wi th clear milestones that  enable  the country to become a hotbed of opportunities, talent and innovation.  A  comprehensive  strategy should focus on five mutually reinforcing pillars embedded in a  coherent action plan with short and long term deliverables:    Smart Governance : The objective is to identify key factors to be addressed in moving to  a digital era as well as to presen t its findings for a change management app roach to be  achieved over a timel ine from 2016 until  2036, with the concise goal to have a new  governance model in place and running by the start of the country’s bicentennial in  2039.    Smart People:  A smart economy  will be based on a society which embraces underlying  technological changes. Emphasis will need to be placed on digital inclusion, new  managerial/organizational skills that are required to compete in the digital age,  education and lifelong learning, and fo stering new talents and skills that anticipate  changes in the labor market.    Smart Public R&D Spending : Luxembourg’s economic future will depend on how  effectively it develops a National Innovation System. The stakeholders in the public  sector, private sec tor, academic community, and civil society will need to establish a  myriad of collaborative networks to share knowledge and best practices in the pursuit of  cutting -edge R&D projects and initiatives that can effectively transition Luxembourg into  a flaship  Smart Economy.    Smart Use of Digital Technologies in Business and Society: Disruptive business models  and improved production processes, empowered by digital investments, will generate  new national and international market opportunities. Luxembourg will n eed to fully  exploit these opportunities to become a more promising place to invest and do  business. Although a leader  in broadband penetration, Luxembourg will need to pursue  an aggressive digital master plan to encourage the integration and smart use of new  technologies by businesses across all the industrial sectors.     Approach to Smart Regulation: Luxembourg will need to transform its regulatory  regime to accommodate the new challenges and opportunities that come with the  transition from a Second to a T hird Industrial Revolution economy. The digital  technology revolution favors ever -expanding connectivity across political boundaries  and business sectors, forcing a disruption in conventional business practices and  commercial relationships. New regulations , codes, and standards will need to be put in  place to encourage a more distributed, transparent, and collaborative approach to  commerce and trade and the pursuit of a more sustainable ecological society.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               331     PROPOSALS     1 Business Model Innovation   1.1 Foster and focus applied research in the key areas of smart city, smart energy, smart  space, autonomous driving, High Performance Computing, Big Data enabled applications ,  and FinTech. The University of Luxembourg, LIST and other applied research stakehold ers  are on the right  path but not yet sufficiently focused, staffed and funded to foster know how transfer from academia to business and society through Dual -Use oriented applied  research projects. The motto should be “q uality, focus and excellence over  quantity .”  Luxembourg should explore other best practices including a comparison with ETH Zurich,  Fraunhofer SIT, IBM Research, the National University of Singapore and EPFL  (EcolePolytechnique Federale Lausanne).     1.2 Streamline the overall transition process b y focusing on a few Lighthouse Projects/Smart  specializations  clustered around the E -Luxembourg core strategic vision. Smart  specialization is an innovation policy concept designed to promote the efficient and  effective use of public investment in research . The goal of smart specialization is to boost  regional innovation in order to achieve economic growth and prosperity, by enabling  regions to focus on their strengths.     1.3 Foster Entrepreneurship through innovative start -up ecosystems.  Considera tion should be   given to a Yozma -type fund, tax incentives for VC investments, the establishment of  entrepreneur centers at LIST and the University of Luxembourg, and entrepreneur  exchange programs with established innovation hubs in the US, EU and Asia.      1.4 Cyber securit y and cyber resilience are crucial factors for building a sustainable and  reliable smart economy. To provide a full spectrum of services, a clear distinction should  be made between regulatory and business aspects. Cybersecurity Regulation at the  national l evel needs a dedicated agency, like the newly established ANSSI, in addition to an  inter -departmental coordination body like the CSB. Cybersecurity for the Private Secto r  (Cybersecurity as a Service , CaaS) needs services provided by an organization such as   “SMILE GIE.” The underlying ICT of Luxembourg’s  smart economy needs to be resilient to  malicious attacks or acts of nature. There is tremendous  potential for Luxembourg  to  contribute to the growing global demand for cyber resilience and cyber security pro ducts  and services, given that  cyber security is a high -growth sector with a projected volume of 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               332     $140bn by 2024. Since cyber security and cyber awareness is crucial for a smart economy,  Luxembourg  might provide c yber security training courses – including o nline training –  by  focusing on the specific needs of Luxembourg and its  economy.  Another crucial element of  Luxembourg’s cybersecurity strategy is the introduction of a dedicated Cybersecurity  Venture Capital fund to foster disruptive commercializations through early stage and  potentially Series A/B funding.      1.5 Develop and foster Data Analytics in Banking and Finance with a focus on innovation.  Use  the synergies of related initiatives like “Luxembourg for Finance ,” “Digital Lëtzebuerg ,” “ICT  Cluster” and private sector infrastructure to further develop and expand existing data  centers. The  European Commission’s  “Country Report Luxembourg 2016” states: “The  financial sector represents the main economic engine of the country with a share of 27 % of  total val ue added and 11 % of total employment in 2014. While Luxembourg’s predominant  business model is based on fund administration (the second largest center worldwide, after  the US) and wealth management, banking and the insurance sectors are also important.  Luxembourg has weathered the financial crisis relatively well, mostly due to the high  degree of diversification and specialization of its financial sector.” At the same time  Luxembourg is strong in data centers, and especially with regards to  financial insti tutions:  “Luxembourg boasts one of the most modern data center parks in Europe and has 19 data  centers in operation, with a total net floor space of over 40 000 m² (over 440 000 ft²),  surpassing cities like Stockholm or Brussels with regard to shared IT Ro oms. Many major  public and private players have established their data centers in Luxembourg, including the  European Commission and many financial institutions.”293    1.6 Digital Innovation Cluster for Autonomous Driving.  This innovation cluster will shape  tomorr ow’s safe and intelligent mobility through researching and testing self -driving  vehicles. For this purpose, realistic traffic scenarios will be addressed in a test field  infrastructure in Luxembourg. The project will also pave the way for economic ( e.g. th e  Sharing E conomy), legal (e.g. data protection issues of autonomous driving), technological  (each car is interconnected to each other, and Internet -connected to the cloud), and  cybersecurity (automotive cyber security) R&D to successfully usher in  autonom ous driving,  car-to-car, and car -to-infrastructure networking. The project will be linked to E -services  such as car registration and taxation services through the E -Luxembourg portal.  “Luxembourg is centrally located in the automotive heart of Europe. At t he crossroads  between Germany, France and Belgium, it offers ‘just -in-time’ access to the major                                                           293 Source: LUXEMBOURG and ICT: a snapshot  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               333     European car manufacturers and assembly plants. It is an ideal location for component  suppliers with a multi -customer base to deliver their products easily and directly.”294   Recently, the Grand Duchy has opened an Automotive Campus: “This industrial site is  dedicated to research and innovation in the automotive sector.”295    1.7 LUX-TIR Long -Tails and Multi -Sided Platforms.  Two new business models enabled by the  Internet , and now the advent of the Internet -of-Things, are the so -called Long -Tail and  Multi -Sided Platforms business models. Long -Tails refers to the possibility of companies  efficiently aggregating a large quantity of very small market niches, each of which wou ld  have been insufficient to support a traditional business model. Overall, this aggregation  potentially leads to a significant market share. On the other hand, Multi -Sided Platform  businesses offer a platform that can be used by multiple customer segments  that are not  mutually independent. The paradigmatic example is the Google approach, where the two sides are the Internet users on the one hand, and companies looking for advertising for  their products on the other hand. The aim of the LUX -TIR Long -Tails and Multi -Sided  Platforms project is to launch funding actions specifically targeted to start -up companies  that are based on these business models, heavily exploiting the possibilities for value  proposition, customer segmentation, distribution channels, cus tomer care, offered by the  Internet and possibly by IoT. It is a new form of Call -for-Start -Ups, not based on the product  but rather on the business model. The definition of the project should be completed by  mid-2017, and the first funding opportunities c ould be available  by the second half of 2017.     1.8 LUX-TIR OTT . The major winners in the business arena of the Information Society are the  Over -The-Top (OTT) companies, such as Amazon, Facebook, Google, etc, who exploit the  possibilities offered by the Internet without possessing any crucial part of the physical  teleco mmunications infrastructure. At a moment when the discrepancy between offered  traffic and average revenue per unit (ARPU) is growing dramatically, this translates into  growing margins for OTTs and diminishing returns for telecom operators. Clearly,  telecom munications companies in Luxembourg are already deciding their strategy in this  crucial domain. The aim of the LUX -TIR OTT project is to give both incumbents and possible  new start -ups a strong message in favor of the exploitation of the OTT business parad igm.  Indeed, without this component, the Telecommunications infrastructure in Luxembourg  will bring most of its benefits to companies based outside of the country.                                                              294 See: http ://www.ilea.lu/html/automotive.html   295 See: http://www.luxembourg.public.lu/en/actualites/2016/03/24 -automotive -campus/index.html  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               334     2 Technical     2.1 LUX-TIR 5G.  Regions around the  world are investing in 5G, the new standard that will  fundamentally transform the way society communicates by addressing three segments:  ultra -broadband communications, the Internet of Things (IoT), and mission critical services.  5G systems and networks wil l constitute the essential and critical infrastructure of the  economy of the future. Those countries that introduce 5G solutions first will enjoy an  advantage in transitioning into the Third Industrial Revolution. Clearly, telecom industries  in Luxembourg have their own strategy for 5G; yet, it is important to coordinate efforts in  the country and in Europe since other r egions around  the world are quickly moving   towards early experiments and deployments. The European Commission is therefore calling  for an “Action Plan for 5G .” The LUX -TIR 5G project aims at positioning Luxembourg as one  of the first adopters in the 5G arena. Given that countries around the world are expected to  develop 5G technology standards and regulations, Luxembourg should position itself  strategically as a pilot region for demonstrating and testing 5G technologies and enter into  a collaboration with Horizon 2020 5G -PPP to set up demonstration  projects. This action is  urgent, given that test demonstrations of 5G technologies will take place mainly in the  2017 -2018 timeframe. Definition of the 5G plan and roll -out should be completely defined  by the end of 2016.     2.2 LUX-TIR Satellite 5G. Luxembour g – thanks to the presence of SES – has a very strong  position in satellite operations and, therefore, in the provision of broadcasting and  broadband services . Until now , satellite technology has remained at the margin in the  development of the 5G standard ; this represents both a challenge and  an opportunity. The  goal of the LUX-TIR Satellite 5G project is to foster  satellite technology and allow it to  become an integral and integrated part of the network infrastructure of the future. The I oT  can take advan tage of the peculiarities of satellite communication.  It is a fact that natural  disasters stemming from climate change or human attacks, possibly of a terrorist nature,  create the possibility to have disruptions of service in areas of variable size, from l ocal to  regional. These conditions must be prevented, detected, mitigated, and finally resolved as  quickly as possible, in order to minimize their impact on society. In other words,  Luxembourg will need to build a high degree of resilience into its communi cation network  to address potentially catastrophic disruptions from climate change and cyberterrorism.  It  is therefore crucial for the telecommunications network to be both self -healing and  redundant. 5G is designed to be a software -defined network, in whi ch functions are  virtualized over general purpose hardware. This is a key characteristic that allows the  network to be reconfigured almost instantaneously, and services to be restored in minutes. 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               335     Therefore, the intrinsic resilience of 5G networks is much h igher than that of previous  technologies, both cellular and Wi-Fi. However, in the case of a major blackout, this degree  of resilience may not be sufficient . In these conditions, it becomes necessary to have  alternative means for communications which do no t rely at all on ground infrastructure.  Satellite communications, including the use of high -altitude platforms ( e.g. stratospheric  balloons), become the preferred back -up solution in extreme conditions. Clearly, this  requires that satellite links and gatew ays be included and their characteristics duly  considered in the design of the 5G network standard to assure a high level of resilience.  Given these fundamental characteristics, a special R&D program on LUX -TIR satellite 5G  technologies should be initiated  as soon as possible.     2.3 LUX-TIR IoT Test -Bed. The TIR paradigm is based on the build out of IoT networks to  interconnect people, cars, buildings, and cities with digital infrastructure to collect Big Data  that can be processed to provide analytical information for strategic decision making. To  date, I oT networks have been developed vertically with proprietary technologies. An  institutional LUX -TIR IoT test -bed initiative would boost the development of open -source  IoT technologies, positioning Luxembourg at the forefront of this crucial element of the  smart -economy architecture. This should be done in conjunction with the seven  lighthouse  initiatives that have already been kickstarted in Luxembourg: High Power Computing (HPC) ;  Big Data enabled applications ; autonomous driving ; smart city ; smart space ; smart energy ;  and FinTech. Some of these initiatives have been described in the Important Project of  Common European Interest ( IPCEI) document which establishes these projects as a top  priority for the Luxembourg Government. The LUX -TIR IoT test -bed project aims at the  development of a Luxembourg -wide wireless sensor network for IoT applications. Several  applications can be addressed. For example, in the automotive sector, the IoT test -bed  would aim at the collection of information from all cars transiting in to the Luxembourg  territory, to extract distributed information about traffic and pollution, and drive the  decisions for corrective measures. Incentives should be given to those who participate in  the LUX -TIR IoT test -bed initiatives, for example as discou nts on tolls or insurance (which  can be dynamically based on usage, routes, times schedule, and so on). It would be  reasonable to define the scope of the LUX-TIR IoT test -bed project within the first quarter  of 2017, for a start up in the second quarter of  2017.     2.4 LUX-TIR cross -institute initiative. Luxembourg has an impressive number of excellent  initiatives and institutes in crucial sectors. For example: Luxembourg Centre for Systems  Biomedicine (LCSB), Luxembourg Institute of Health (LIH), Luxembourg Ins titute of Socio Economic Research (LISER), and Luxembourg Institute of Science and Technology (LIST). All 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               336     of these sectors will be profoundly affected by the Third Industrial Revolution, and a  complete understanding and mastery of the ensuing issues will e ntail an inter -disciplinary  approach. In order to position Luxembourg in an anticipatory seat, it makes sense to design  cross -institute initiatives with long -term ambitions and goals. The LUX -TIR cross -institute  initiative aims at identifying research them es of common interest between LCSB, LIH, LISER,  LIST, and the University of Luxembourg (and possibly other institutes) in the realm of the  Third Industrial Revolution and its impact on the Smart Economy. Many of these themes  can be funded for a short perio d of exploratory research, and the outcomes can be subject  to independent review. Only a few selected themes should then be pursued for a longer  term. Initial themes proposals: mid -2017. Exploratory phase: until end of 2017. Research  on selected themes: 20 18-2020.     2.5 Software Development. Software development skills are crucial in the IoT Economy. LUX  could focus on developing and attracting talent in LUX -specific areas within this field. For  example :  2.5.1 Migration of l egacy application – as businesses and public organizations change the  functioning of their ICT systems to adapt to new standards , migrating applications  becomes a  technology service and skill set.   2.5.2 Cloud architecture – many digital services are now consumed  on virtual  infrastructure  found in numerous locations connected via the Internet (“the cloud”); applications are  required to be  optimized for this deployment and delivery model.   2.5.3 Mobile platforms – many applications now need to be optimized for tablets and   smartphones . This impacts  how mobile applications are managed and secured. Mobile  platforms will increasingly run by secure containers (an authenticated encrypted area of  a user's mobile device) which will enable the improved management of secure data on  mobile devices that can be used to block  sensitive corporate information from personal  information.   2.5.4 Bespoke applications – while many applications are available off the shelf or as cloud -  based services, the develop ment of  bespoke applications must be purs ued to suit  organizations’ specific infrastructure and needs.   2.5.5 User experience – the adoption of digital products and services is linked to the ease of  use of the technology – both in the mass market and in specific areas such as health.  The idea goes beyo nd design of the product and service and captures  the complete set  of interactions a user has with the provider.        
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               337     3 Regulatory     3.1 E-Luxembourg:  The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will be the first country to offer  comprehensive digital E -Registration to EU and non -EU individuals and companies.    3.1.1 E-Registration in Luxembourg will enable global E -Registrars to access a growing number  of services and bene fits at low cost and high speed through one unified, secure and easy  online application portal , thus allowing them to access the entire EU market digitally  through the trusted Luxembourg Digital Registration Gateway.  This core strategy was  inspired by E -Registration, E -Identity and E -Residency innovations and experiments in  the State of Delaware (USA), Singapore, London and Estonia and further develops these  early stage conceptual frameworks to fit the specific Luxembourg ecosystem and its  unique role as th e EU’s first nation state and test lab for EU -wide regulation. The goal is  to establish Luxembourg as the first country to successfully implement trust - and  technology -driven E -Registration on a large and lucrative scale.   3.1.2 One of these initial services will  be centered on company creation: Luxembourg will be  the first country in Europe that allows the establishment of a  fully -fledged European  company with headquarters in Luxembourg with a few clicks online.   3.1.3 Register a new company over the internet; Change da ta in the business register; File  annual reports; Detailed inquiries about other companies; Digitally sign documents and  contracts; Encrypt and transmit documents securely; Administer the company from  anywhere in the world; Conduct e -banking and remote mon ey transfers; Access online  payment providers; Declare taxes online; Inclusion in EU legal framework.     3.2 Make Luxembourg a Pioneer in realization of General Data Protection Regulation for the  Financial Industry.  The achieved legal security will result in a c ompetitive advantage for the  Financial Sector. According to the European Parliament , the new rules of the General Data  Protection Regulation include provisions on:   3.2.1 Right to be forgotten; "Clear and affirmative consent" to the processing of private data  by the person concerned; Right to transfer data to another service provider; The right to  know when your data has been hacked; Ensuring that privacy policies are explained in  clear and understandable language; and stronger enforcement and fines up to 4% of  firms' t otal worldwide annual turnover as a deterrent.     3.3 LUX-TIR Net Neutrality . Openness and Internet transparency are clearly desirable in order  to create the best possible conditions for TIR businesses. However , mission critical services,  as well as busine ss models based on the freemium paradigm, require the possibility to  modulate the Quality of Experience (QoE) provided to the final users of the infrastructure. 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               338     Finding  the best possible compromise between these two conflicting elements is a very  important  issue that should be tackled at the European level: the LUX -TIR Net Neutrality  initiative aims at contributing to this effort with a study on defining a regulatory framework  that will allow both content agnostic -network operation and smart QoE provisions.  These  apparently conflicting goals should be addressed with an end -to-end approach in mind,  very similar to the concept that brought to life the Internet itself. The regulatory  framework should be layered, with neutrality increasing towards the lower laye rs of the  regulatory stack. The Net Neutrality initiative could be defined in the first half of 2017 and  run for one year, until mid -2018.     3.4 Develop a LUX -TIR Digital Rights Declaration and Accompanying Regulations. The Third  Industrial Revolution will brin g to life new forms of society, with the coexistence of human  beings and advanced forms of artificial intelligence, anthropomorphic and non -  anthropomorphic. Interconnections between humans and things will constitute the fabric  of interaction, information exchange, transactions, and decision making. Exclusion from   this network of interconnections will be a new kind of impoverishment and injustice. A  definition of the concept of digital rights, which is a subject of active debate today, will be  necessary as well as the definition of a regulatory framework to ensure that these digital  rights are guaranteed to all. As for the previous point, this is an issue that must be tackled  at the European level. The LUX -TIR Digital Rights project aims at exploring what  contribution Luxembourg can make to this fundamental issue, t aking advantage of its small  size and sovereignty. The overall objective could be to make Luxembourg a flagship in the  domain of Digital Rights provision. The widespread ICT infrastructure which is available  today is an excellent starting point to eliminat e any forms of digital divide. Definition of the  Digital Rights strategy for Luxembourg could be completed by the first quarter of 2017.  Ensuing actions could follow in the next three years.     3.5 LUX-TIR Future Spectrum . One of the critical elements of the 5G network will be the  exploitation of the millimeter -wave spectrum for ultra -broadband interconnections with  peak data rates up to 10 Gbit/s. Several frequency bands in the range from 27 to 86 GHz  have been designated during the World -Radio Conference 2015 ( WRC -15) to study their  possible application to future 5G networks. Final decisions will be made at the next World Radio Conference in 2019, WRC -19. In view of the LUX -TIR 5G project described above,  Luxembourg can take a proactive regulatory approach to th e spectrum.  The LUX -TIR future  spectrum project aims at the identification of specific portions of the millimeter -wave  spectrum to be used for experimentation over the Luxembourg territory. This project only  makes sense in conjunction with the LUX -TIR 5G and LUX -TIR satellite 5G initiatives. In 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               339     identifying these bands, great care must be taken to the allocations for terrestrial and  satellite segments, ensuring both a path to the digital future and a guarantee for present  investments. Decisions on spectrum must be made within the first half of 2017.     3.6 LUX-TIR Private Transparency . The title of this project clearly contains an oxymoron, which  reflects the contrasting needs of providing privacy, trust, and security on one side, and  availability of data for anal ytics on the other side. Striking  the best balance between these  needs is clearly a crucial issue. The LUX -TIR Private Transparency project aims at launching  a regulatory study for the identification of measures that can provide the necessary  interface bet ween individuals who should be protected and big data applications, which  should be enabled. Alternative anonymization procedures should be considered,  benchmarked and tested.  This project could benefit from the collaboration of several  institutes, such a s LIST, LISER, the University of Luxembourg, as well as the Government. It  is a medium term project with a life span of around three years.       4 Public Policy     4.1 Institutionalize the implementation of a national steering committee  tailored after the  Singapore 2025 model, composed of a mix of inside and outside experts, elected officials,  business leaders, academics, and civil society organizations, with an independent budget  and direct access to political decision makers, that can work with neighborhoods, the  school system, and local businesses, with the mission of providing an ongoing public forum  that can engage the entire country in the transition to a smart Digital Luxembourg.     4.2 Early adoption through strategic and expert customers:  The Luxembourg Government and  leading Lux embourg  corporations should position themselves as strategic customers and  test vehicles (compare the high -tech digital strategy of German P ost and German SINTEG in  energy ).   4.2.1 Create an agile delivery process that responds to the changing req uirements of  purchasing of ICT products and services to ensure solutions meet requirements.   4.2.2 Ensure that Luxembourg  has an exemplar digital infrastructure in and around  urban  areas and administrative units.   4.2.3 Provide an integrated, agile platform, based on open standards which expose  appropriate data and service APIs to nurture the development of an innovative  ecosystem.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               340     4.2.4 E-Procurement: Make it easier for local businesses, particularly SMEs, to do business  with the Luxembourg  Government.     4.3 Digital Inclusion .  Digital inclusion in Luxembourg  should consider not only future  generations but also the current generation. The global population is ageing rapidly.  Between 2000 and 2050, the proportion of the world’s population over 60 years will double  from about 11% t o 22%. The absolute number of people aged 60 years and over is  expected to increase from 605 million to 2 billion over the same period. Luxembourg   should examine methods and programs to deepen the understanding of disruptive  technologies as well as their u tility and the opportunities they bring to all age cohorts  across Luxembourg’s society.     4.4 Luxembourg should examine the formulation of public policymakers’ tools to foster a  local Venture Ecosystem  comparable to what the Coller Institute developed for the VC  ecosystem in Israel.  These tools should focus on three areas: 1. funding, 2. taxation, 3.  stock market access.   4.5 E-Luxembourg as Core Strategic Vision . Setting up more open approaches to policymaking  and public service delivery requires governments to re -organize themselves around user  expectations, needs and associated requirements, rather than their own internal logic and  needs. The “Recommendation of the Council on Digital Government Strategies” of the  OECD states:296 “The challenge is not to introduce digital technologies into public  administrations; it is to integrate their use into public sector modernization efforts. Public  sector capacities, workflows, business processes, operations, methodologies and  frameworks n eed to be adapted to the rapidly evolving dynamics and relations between  the stakeholders that are already enabled – and in many instances empowered – by the  digital environment. To this end, digital government strategies need to become firmly  embedded in mainstream modernization policies and service design so that the relevant  stakeholders outside of government are included and feel ownership for the final outcomes  of major policy reforms.”                                                                        296 See: http://www.oecd.org/gov/digital -government/Recommendation -digital -government -strategies.pdf  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               341     5 Financial     5.1 LUX-TIR FINTECH. Next generation Fintech brings together the world of finance with the  new opportunities brought forth by the build out and scale up of a Third Industrial  Revolution infrastructure and the new business models and practices that accompany it.  Given the key relevance of the financial secto r in Luxembourg, Fintech for SMEs is a  formidable opportunity. SMEs often suffer from inadequate funding because the finances  of SMEs are characterized by high risk and low scale. Because FinTech solutions are  efficient and effective at lower scale, small businesses will be one of the main beneficiaries  of FinTech’s disruptive power. The LUX -TIR FinTech project aims at developing a new set of  products tailored to the needs of small businesses. Funding initiatives can include: “peer to-peer” lending, merchan t and e -commerce finance, invoice finance, online supply chain  finance, online trade finance, etc. The LUX -TIR FinTech project should consider both the  enabling factors that are critical to ensure rapid growth (availability of data, a supportive  regulatory  environment, the provision of sufficient investor capital, financial education)  and the relevant risk factors (limited protection of retail investors, potential extension of  funding to unworthy borrowers, systemic risk due to a partly unregulated sector).      6 Educational     6.1 The LUX -TIR Education for Creativity project  aims at bringing Luxembourg to the  forefront in the design of new educational curricula for the citizens of the future post -TIR  society.  Start -up ecosystems thrive in multidisciplinary settings. Luxembourg  could develop  (in collaboration with public and private organizations) specific TIR -related interdisciplinary  curricula, projects and programs at universities, incubators, start -up compet itions and  international entrepreneur exchange programs to foster entrepreneurship and  commercialization. Compare the GSVA (German Silicon Valley Accelerator) and German  EXIST Program. Both domain -general and domain -specific approaches to creative thinking   should be contemplated. Neuroscientific, cognitive, social, and cultural perspectives must  be considered. Theoretical and practical approaches to idea generation must be developed  and transformed into subjects for schools, universities, as well as life -long training  programs.     6.2 Introduce Scratch to Luxembourg schools . Mitch Resnick at the MIT Media Lab helped  create Scratch and ScratchJr., computer languages designed expressly to introduce children  to programming: "Coding is not just a set of technical skil ls. It's a new way of expressing 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               342     yourself. It's similar to learning to write — a way for kids to organize, express and share  ideas. But instead of putting words into sentences, now th ey can create animated stories. ”    6.3 Educate the educators. The teacher pipe line is one of the biggest issues in teaching  computer science. Currently in Luxembourg, there is no certification for teaching computer  science. We're merely taking people who trained to be teachers and giving them some CS  knowledge so they can step into a classroom and help kids. Luxembourg needs  to ratchet  up the qualifications of teachers overseeing computer science instruction.     6.4 Involve the local tech industry . Luxembourg should better mobilize companies and  research institutions to engage their engin eers and scientists to volunteer in schools, to talk  in the classroom, or run a whole -day hackathon – like Google did last year at the Academy  for Software Engineering – or job shadowing, or taking students on as mentees.     7 Research, Development and Innovation     7.1 Strengthen partnerships with applied science organizations  such as Fraunhofer Society to  foster the transfer of E -Luxembourg academic know -how into the economy and society.   LIST is on a good path but not yet sufficiently focused, staffed, funde d and embedded in  international applied science structures to fulfill its role as intermediary between academic  R&D and concrete E -Luxembourg business, society and government applications.  Therefore,  partnerships with larger and international applied scien ce networks will be  necessary.     7.2 LUX-TIR Decentralized Exploration . Luxembourg’s approach to  providing financial support  to R& D and new entrepreneurship has been characterized so far by a high degree of  centralization. The main emphasis has been placed on firms that drive economic growth  and job creation, with a strong pre -screening role enforced by LuxInnovation, tasked with  the objective of eliminating immature project ideas even before requests for funding. This  approach is both sensible and rational; the only problem is that it very rarely leads to  disruptive innovation, as one would expect to come out of the United States, wh ere  “failure” is very much tolerated in favor of taking very significant risks towards disruptive  objectives (Silicon Valley being the first example). The aim of the LUX -TIR Decentralized  Exploration project is to introduce a new balance in the financial s upport of RDI to  encourage the funding of more unfiltered risk -taking and potentially disruptive innovation  actions. An 80/20 split (or even 90/10) might be appropriate: 80% of the resources could  remain in line with current risk standards, while 20% of th e resources could be dedicated to 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               343     supporting (with a relatively moderate funding grant per item) more exploratory projects  that have relatively small probability of success, but with significant potential for disruption  if their goals are achieved.     7.3 LUX-TIR One -for-One PPP. A clear trend in providing financial support to RDI for industry is  to form public -private partnerships (PPPs) that have the main purpose of using public  funding to leverage an equal (or higher) investment by the private side. For clear  reasons of  strategic business protection, it is usually very hard to actually quantify the investment  from the private side, which may somewhat limit the effectiveness of the PPP. The aim of  the LUX -TIR One -for-One PPP project is to formulate an alternati ve form of PPP in view of  the distributed collaboration schemes that will characterize the post -Third Industrial  Revolution society. The idea is that for each unit of public funding that a company receives  for the support of strategic RDI, the company must  invest an equal amount for outsourced  research, commissioned to either the University of Luxembourg, or to research institute s in  Luxembourg, or even strategic (but public) research partners from Europe and around the  world . This mechanism holds the poten tial of boosting the open innovation paradigm.                          
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               344     CIRCULAR ECONOMY   OVERVIEW   An initial analysis by the TIR consulting team  suggests that for every euro of economic activity,  the Luxembourg economy generates about 2.5  kilograms of waste. Yet, there are promising  developments in the steel and chemical indus tries,  the food and agricultural sector, as well as in  financial services and the development of  information technologies (among others) to suggest that such wastes can be profitably reduced  over time and that investments can be planned and implemented to increase overall economic  productivity.   The Circular Economy (also called circularity) is  both  indispensable to the goal of increasing  aggregate efficiencies and reducing ecological footprint , as well as a source of new innovations  with multiple ancillary  benefits . The circular economy is designed to mimic the material and  energy flows in mature ecosystems where resources are continuously appropriated, used,  redistributed, and recycled for future use. Circularity spans three areas: the production of  goods and services, consumption and behavior, and waste valorisation .   These fields are expressed in seven pillars: sustainable supply, eco -design, industrial ecology,  functional economy (or functionality), responsible consumption, increase of the life duration,   and recycling. Sustainable supply concerns the way resources are extracted with the goal of  minimizing the environmental impact and optimizing the extraction process. It is valid for  energy and minerals, but also for agriculture and forestry. Eco -design a ddresses all the ways to  improve  the environmental impact s of goods, optimizing the aggregate efficiency of matter  used, including life -cycle analyses. Industrial and territorial ecology mediates the relationship  between the biosphere and human societies t hrough the knowledge of material and energ y  flows  across economies. The functional economy emphasizes the use of a product rather than  its ownership. Responsible consumption focuses on making economic choices based on  evaluating the sustainable life cycle of a product or service. Recycling is a well -known process  by which used  products are re -introduced into the industrial chain of production. For example,  currently, small companies are manufacturing 3D printed products from recycled plastic, paper,  and met al objects.

Withana and E.  van Dijl (IEEP), 2014, report funded by Environment’s Framework contract for economic analysis  ENV.F.1/FRA/2010/0044.   The Renault plant in Choisy -le-Roi outside Paris is a good example of circularity across a  company’s value chain. The Renault plant “remanufactures” automotive engines, transmissions,  injection pumps, and other parts for retail. The plant facilities use 80% less energy , 90% less  water , and generate 70% less oil and detergent waste in its operations than i ts competitors,  giving it higher operating margins.   Renault designs its parts to make them easier to disassemble and reuse. Renault also  collaborates in joint ventures with a steel recycler and waste management company to secure  the necessary expertise to  optimize the lifecycle of their parts. Finally, Renault motivates its  suppliers to increase aggregate efficiencies and reduce waste in the supply chain by rewarding  them based on performance contracts – paying them for the efficiency gains – rather than  simply paying for the purchase of the goods.     
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               346     It should be emphasized that the circular economy is much more than recycling and restoration  of materials used. Keeping resources in circulation for as long as possible is also a critical aspect  of the circula r economy.  In the Sharing Economy , the increase in product usage means  extracting higher value from the resources. This leads to an increase in  aggregate efficiency and  productivity. An Accenture assessment projects that savings in materials, recycling, an d  restoration, will likely exceed $4.5 trillion by 2030 in the global economy while increasing  productivity, reducing fixed and marginal costs, creating net new jobs, and lowering ecological  footprint.297   The maturing of an interconnected digital network co mposed of the Communication Internet,  Energy Internet, and Mobility Internet enables individuals, small and large businesses, non profits, and other institutions to use High Performance Computing (HPC) and Big Data Analytics  (BDA), along with machine intel ligent (cognitive computing) algorithms to continuously increase  these interconnected Internet networks’ aggregate efficiencies and reduce their ecological  footprint in managing, powering, and moving  economic activity in a virtuous circular economy.                                                              297 See: https://newsroom.accenture.com/news/the -circular -economy -could -unlock -4-5-trillion -of-economic growth -finds -new -book -by-accenture.htm  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               347         Recall, aggregate efficiency measures the ratio of potential to useful work in every economic  conversion. The higher the aggregate efficiency, the less material and energy are wasted in the  conversion process. The build -out of an IoT infrastructure across L uxembourg provides a  technological platform for tightening circularity across every conversion on every value chain.  The IoT platform also assists circularity in another way. By reducing the marginal cost of  producing and distributing virtual and physical goods to near zero, the IoT fosters the growth of  the Sharing Economy. The Sharing Economy is by its very nature a circular economy. Goods and  services are redistributed over and over , enabling a much higher efficiency per used resource.   The Luxembourg Eco Innovation Cluster of the Ministry of the Economy and the Ministry of  Sustainable Development and Infrastructure is charged with the responsibility of advancing the  circular economy, green mobility, and sustainable cities and smart technologies. The missio n of  the Luxembourg EcoInnovation Cluster is to assist companies in the promotion of eco technologies, the development of new environmental solutions, particularly in sustainable  construction, building public awareness around green technologies, and promot ing public private partnerships to advance a smart sustainable Luxembourg. The Luxembourg  Making Smarter & Integrated Sectors  Grids+Vehicles+Buildings+Industries  The Next Industrial Revolution  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               348     EcoInnovation Cluster will play a key role in advancing a circular economy across all of  Luxembourg’s industrial sectors as the country transitions into a low -carbon sustainabl e  economy.     LUXEMBOURG STATE OF PLAY AND VISION   Our thinking is largely dominated by linear mindsets where the increase in consumption is at  the center of economic growth. Most of the companies operate their businesses based on  traditional economic concepts , and existing infrastructure is designed around this linear model.  Continuing to design, construct and operate the economic infrastructure and built environment  in a linear fashion incurs greater risks and expenditures, increasing opportu nity losses and  costs, including failures to future proof against system shocks, uncertainties and surprises.  In  sharp contrast, shifting to a circular model in designing, constructing and operating  infrastructure and the built environment goes beyond res torative features and enhances the  qualities of resilience, robustness, flexibility, and anti -fragility, that are best positioned to  respond to future uncertainties and surprises. Neglecting or delaying the shift results in more  expensive retrofits in the future  or passing on opportunities to retrofit because of excessive  costs.  A crucial aspect of circularity is to perform penetrating assessments of why and what  infrastructure is needed – the (multi -)functional benefits to be gained – and then apply deep  design practices integral to achieving circular economy outcomes. The objective is to establish  design principles that lead to “ feeding products, components, and materials back into the  appropriate value chains, ” resulting in “ a healthy economy that is ins pired by and in balance  with nature. ”298  The positive attributes resulting from shifting to a circular economy are applicable to the entire  throughput stream of economic activities, processes, and supply networks. Existing supply  chains are very often highly  complex and long and make it almost impossible for the final  producers to identify all the materials, components and ingredients, which have been used in   the goods they sell. Most companies have suppliers from outside Luxembourg, and even from  outside Eur ope.   The awareness of these issues is increasing and there are several promising initiatives currently  underway to incentivize a circular economy in Luxembourg. Actors from government and  private research institutes have been pooling their skills through a  technology platform  established within the "Luxembourg Institute for Science and Technology" (LIST) to boost the                                                           298 Circle -Economy (2014) Designing for a circular world: circular design principles, October 06, 2014, www.circle economy.com/designing -circular -world -circular -design -principles/ .  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               349     development and processing of innovative materials in fields like the automotive industry and  aeronautics. It is estimated that the composite materials sector in Luxembourg is already  generating a turnover of almost € 400 million per year and employs 1,600 people. Launched in  2016, the future National Competence C enter will employ 60 people when fully operational.   Today, it is nearly impossible to know the exact composition of end user consumer products  (down to parts per million [ppm] levels). If the goal is to maintain a high quality throughout the  use and re -use (up -cycling) phase, it is essential to know the exact composition of the material.   This issue is further complicated by the protection of intellectual property.   Moreover , implementing circularity across the value chains in Luxembourg is complicated by  the issue of storage and security of data. Widespread  protection of product recipes by the  companies prevents a transparent exchange of information. As a result, many of the  components that make up the supply chain remain unknown even to the final manufacturer of  a finished consumer good. Blockchain could be  a solution. A decentralized collection of data  allows every enterprise across a specific supply chain to track information on materials and to  store it in a secure way. Due to Luxembourg’s strong ICT commitment, the country boasts  several young ICT compan ies actively engaged in research on blockchain processes. At this  stage the development is highly Fintech oriented but could easily be adaptable to general data  storage and material information tracking.   Luxembourg’s IT infrastructure is among the best and  most secure in Europe and the world and  is complimented by excellent network coverage. The investments in the digital infrastructure  over the last decade should be fully exploited to generate economic activity on a cross sectorial  basis. The recently anno unced “Important project of common European interest on high  performance computing and big data enabled applications (IPCEI -HPC-BDA) ," in which  Luxembourg will play a key role, will further strengthen the ICT ecosystem of the Grand Duchy  by adding a strong  HPC (High Performance Computing) competence and granting access to  exceptional computation power for simulation and data processing purposes.   While the current thinking in Luxembourg is technology -driven, there is not enough focus given  to biological reso urces; i.e. how biological materials flow back and forth through the technical  supply chain cycle and the subsequent impacts on biological resources that result from  overreliance on a linear consumption model. Environmental and social burdens and costs are   rarely internalized in the process/product but, rather, transferred to the public sector or society  at large. The post -consumer material cycle illustrates that there is, as yet, a lack of a common  view on what is ‘waste’ and how it should be treated. More over, c urrent regulations and the  large number of actors in the decision making process may significantly delay the  implementation of new ideas. Indeed , current national and international regulations often 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               350     prevent a circular approach.   Furthermore, the exi sting infrastructure is poorly designed for reverse logistics, and large scale  recycling units are blending many different products within only one material category. In this  way, all the different material compositions get lost and the quality and economi c value of the  resulting blend tends to be poor. Global supply chains make it difficult to precisely define  material flows and close loops at the local or regional level. Big players like the  telecommunication company POST have meanwhile recognized the iss ue and developed a  business case around reverse logistics. There is now, more than ever, an opportunity to invest  in reverse logistics and to combine it with either technical skills (repair service) or lower skilled  jobs around the dismantling and recovery  of resources.   It will be very difficult to overcome a cultural reluctance to fully understand the concept of  what a circular economy really means. Conventional cultural values present a set of challenges,  linked to a conservative Luxemburgish approach tha t is based on possession of goods.   The general awareness about the circular economy in Luxembourg is still in the starting blocks.  Luxembourg’s business community is increasingly interested in the circular economy as it  understands not only the sustainabil ity aspects, but also the economic advantage of  implementing circularity across the value chains. Many initiatives have been taken by the  Government (the ministry of economy and the ministry of sustainable development and  infrastructure), the chambers of c ommerce and craft trades, as well as the Eco Innovation  Cluster. The recent participation of Luxembourg in the “Incoming Trade Mission” organized by  the Netherlands CE Hotspot has lead to a new CE Hotspot summit that will be organized by  Luxembourg in 2017.   Education and communication will be critical to the success of a circular economy in  Luxembourg. To date, there are only  a few possibilities to undergo CE training. Unfortunately,   Luxembourg’s  labor force does not yet have the right work skills to make us e of the existing  technology. Efforts should be undertaken both on a primary and secondary school level, during  apprenticeships and university studies, as well as life -long learning initiatives to prepare the  Luxembourger workforce with circularity princip les and practices. Teachers have to be  retrained as well.   Luxembourg has several organizations (like “SuperDreckskëscht”) that currently reach out to a  high number of companies and citizens, and which could be key actors in fostering  a growing  awareness o f the vast merits in introducing circularity across every aspect of Luxembourg’s  society.   Luxembourg’s financial sector has a key role to play in the transition to a circular economy. 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               351     Initial investments may be higher than those for the linear model and f ull benefits can only be  realized once all the elements are in place. Currently, the linear model is encouraging the use of  cheap raw materials to advance short -term financial gains. Therefore,  it is difficult to anticipate  a business change, which compete s with the linear thinking. The public sector could easily play  a key role in encouraging the “pay for performance” concept in which return on investments  are secured by the increase in aggregate efficiencies and productivity and reduction in marginal  cost and ecological footprint.   Luxembourg is also developing the logistics infrastructure. Luxembourg’s mobility landscape is  changing rapidly. The national telematics project, the new tramway and a new railway station  granting direct access to the business center of Kirchberg are three visible examples of this  evolution. At the same time, mobility is changing globally. Car and bike sharing initiatives are  emerging in ever more cities, hybrid and electric buses and cars are appearing on our roads  while owning  a car is becoming less and less attractive. Access to mobility starts to replace  ownership.   Luxembourg’s Circularity Vision   Luxembourg will be the first circular nation, where new business models based on the product as-a-service principle become standar d. All public procurement will be aligned around the  circular economy. Contracts will be performance -based. Luxembourg will have developed  know -how around eco -design and product life assessment. Luxembourg will have an adapted  resilient infrastructure that  promotes local renewable energy production, storage and sharing,  short and local resource loops, a continuous water loop and reverse logistics. In addition, the  new infrastructure, designed to fully integrate CE principles, will be able to manage (in term s of  storage and calculation) a large set of data, linked to each product. Luxemb ourg will have  created a legal framework that allows the exchange of product related information between  suppliers, by guaranteeing a level of confidentiality. The national ta x system will support  companies implementing a circular approach. Luxembourg will have gained the technical  experience to make life cycle assessments and to evaluate how circular a business is.   Moreover, Luxembourg will have a detailed national measurement  system in order to  determine both quantity and quality of the different material flows. Luxemb ourg needs to  become a key actor in the greater region in order to establish regional and/or local supplier  communities and will contribute significantly to clos e these loops. In addition, Luxembourg will  implement a series of seamless biological loops.   The above -stated goals will be achievable if we make eco -design and the basic principles of the  circular economy part of our education and life -long training syste m. With the circular vision,  the word ‘waste’ no longer exists. Circular education will teach the students the necessary skills 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               352     needed to innovate and move towards a circular economy. Future generations will be able to  adapt and cope with constant change, and will have a deeper systemic understanding of the  biological cycle and be capable of using the latest technologies to create a virtuous circular  society.   A clear opportunity for Luxembourg is the commitment from the current government to  implement a cir cular economy strategy. An effective local network will need to be  backed by a  strong financial sector.   With the government’s full support and the right legal framework, Luxembourg could become  the global center for a “safe but transparent” approach to pro ducts as services. Such a  transparent approach empowers prosumers and companies by providing the tools for a  distributed and decentralized approach to marshalling local materials and creating seamless  product loops in line with the TIR philosophy of establ ishing a distributed, transparent, and  democratic approach to renewable energy production.   Interconnecting the Circular Economy   Just as circularity is indispensable to the goal of increasing aggregate efficiencies and reducing  ecological footprints, it is,  in turn, contingent upon an interconnected digital network  composed of the Communication Internet, Energy Internet, and Mobility Internet in managing,  powering, and moving  economic activity in a virtuous circular economy (CE).   The scale and complexity of  the European Union’s €14.3 trillion economy, let alone the €70  trillion global economy, is so vast and data -massive that to perform the granular -scale tracking  of energy, materials, chemicals, water, and related levels of emissions, air and water pollutan ts,  hazardous wastes, soil contaminants, sewage and toxic effluents requires advanced computing  technologies integrated with the Internet of Things, Services and Networks (IoT, IoS, IoN).      The world produces a prodigious quantity of data, information an d knowledge – as much in 24  months than in recorded history, according to Google Chairman Eric Schmidt.  Data usage over  the Internet in 2016 is projected to exceed a trillion gigabytes, or one zettabyte, and this  amount is predicted to double over the nex t 36 months.  More than 10 billion device s are  connected to the Internet  and that number may explode 10,000 -fold to 100 trillion Internet  connected wireless smart sensor network devices within the next 15 years (see visual below).   Such exponential growth rates have been most recently witnessed with mobile phones.  Mobile  data traffic has grown nearly 400 -million -fold over the past 15 years, according to Cisco’s 2016  Visual Networking Index report.   Luxembourg is poised to take advantage of this extraordina ry techno -takeoff.  Over the past 15  years the nation has quintupled its public R&D support, with a strong focus on advanced ICT 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               353     (HPC and BDA) to help power the engine of a knowledge -based economy.  This public  commitment has attracted top-flight researche rs.  A February 2016 review by the European  Commission highlighted the fact that Luxembourg’s “scientific performance of the public  research system has progressed very rapidly and is now above the EU average.”299  RDI and the Greater Region   Luxembourg is strategically located to foster circular economy innovation in material and  resource advances. Over half of the nation’s public R&D funding supports companies in applied  research on materials, and there is solid co -operation on materials with  the Greater Region. The  Greater Region can be leveraged as a Circular R&D Community for Materials development.  The  IntermatGR university consortium engaged in research on materials is a case in point. Research  areas include biobased additives and composi tes designed for circular cycles; Designs for  disassembly, as well as robotic -assisted disassembly; 3D additive manufacturing and demanufacturing; Adapting Life Cycle Assessment to measure positive impacts; and joint progress  in revalorization processing (e.g. concrete recycling). Luxembourg also consistently ranks  among the top EU Innovators, as indicated in the annual Innovation Union Scorecard.300  The circular economy is already “a competitive imperative for Luxembourg,” according to the  conclusion of the  508-page commissioned study entitled Luxembourg as a Knowledge Capital  and Testing Ground for the Circular Economy,  National Roadmap for Positive Impacts .301  Luxembourg’s industry sector is singled out as demonstrating leadership on circularity.   Companies,  including ArcelorMittal (steel), Eurofoil and Norsk (aluminum), Guardian Industries  (glass), Tarkett (flooring), and Tontarelli (plastics) are among the industrial leaders in  implementing circularity across their value chains.                                                            299 EC (2016) Commission Staff Working Document, Country Report Luxembourg , European Commission , Brussels,  February 26, 2016, SWD (2016) 84, http://ec.europa.eu/europe2020/making -it-happen/country -specific  recommendations/index_en.htm   300 EC ( 2015) Innovation Union  Scoreboard 2015 , by Hugo Hollanders, Nordine Es -Sadki and Minna Kanerva  fromMaastricht Economic and Social Research Institute on Innovation and Technology (UNU -MERIT) as part of  the European Innovation Scoreboards project for the Eur opean Commission, Directorate -General for Internal  Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs.    301 Katja Hansen, Douglas Mulhall and Markus Zils (2014) Luxembourg as a Knowledge Capital and Testing Ground  for the Circular Economy,  National Roadmap for Positive Impacts.

An estimated €1 billion of circular economy activities currently occur in Luxembourg, employing  upwards of 15,000 citizens, mainly in industry, as well as in buildings and construction, and  retailing.  Retailers like Oikopolis (organic produce) and Cactus (supermarkets) have cultivated  supplier networks for local products. Traditional resource management firms like SDK (waste  recycling), Valorlux (management of household packaging waste flows), and Ecotrel (WEEE  compliance collection and recycling) are prom oting innovative approaches to educate the  public on circularity through mobile apps.     13 Trillion Sensors (TSe nsors) Visions •Mobile sensor marke t for vol umes not  envisionedby leading marke t research  organizations in 2007, grew exponentially  212%/y between 2007 and 2012.   •Several organizations created visions for a  continued growth to trillion(s). •Market  research  companies  don’t  yet  see  it. •Explosion to trillion(s ) is likely to be driven by new  application s not yet envis ionedby leading market   research organiz ation. •Foreca sting  thus needs visionaries! 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5  1995 2000 2014 2020 People On line  Smartphones People Online (billions) Machine-to-Machine (M2M)Two Explosive Exponential Trends driving IP addressable Internet of Everything (IoE) Source: Benedict Evans, Industrial Internet,11-2014, Partner, AndreesenHorowitz; and, B.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               355     The near -term potential value in advancing Luxembourg’s circularity practices is estimated to  approach €1 billion annual net -material cost savings, including generating several thousand jobs  within 36 months.  This would require scaling circular activities throughout the automotive,  construction, financial, logistics, manufacturing, and RDI sectors. Several dozen actions are  underway in Luxembourg to expedite circular eco nomy benefits.     Regional and Global Export Growth Opportunities   Circularity is viewed as a local opportunity as well as an export opportunity, given the massive  global economic potential.  The report, Luxembourg as a Knowledge Capital and Testing Ground  for the Circular Economy, highlights the €7 trillion in renewable energy economic growth  worldwide, and how Luxembourg’s key industries could prosper by providing the important  material components, including manufactured steel, glass and carbon composites.  Luxembourg’s financial sector, with some €3 trillion of investment funds, could also play a  critical role in financing circularity across the 28 Member States.  That estimate may seem high ,  but it turns out to be very modest.   Consider the following renewab le power examples for wind and solar, which are discussed in  greater detail in the TIR Strategy Study chapter on Industry .  Luxembourg’s ArcelorMittal is a  major player in the wind power industry, most recently involved in providing the steel for  construct ing the 30 MW wind platforms off the cost of Scotland.  Each MW required roughly  116 tons of ArcelorMittal’s (recycled) steel.   How many megawatts of wind power could be installed at competitive prices over the next  three decades? The most recent nation -by-nation world renewable energy assessment pro vides  illustrative calculations.302  One-third of total global energy needs can be satisfied with 1.96  million turbines of 5 MW each (1.2 million offshore and 0.76 million onshore).  The calculated  world market op portunity amounts to more than €19 trillion (2016€)  between now and 2050.  And how much steel would it demand?   Assuming 500 ton nes of steel per 5 MW turbine, the  total global amount would be more than one billion tonnes, or roughly 12 times the amount of  steel ArcelorMittal shipped in 2014.                                                                302 Jacobson, Mark and Mark Delucch i et al .

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               356     Product -as-a-Service   Wind power has multiple aspects contributing to a circular economy.  The reuse and   remanufacture  attributes of wind towers , turbine blades, and platform s nicely comport with  the wind industry evolving towards the products -as-services business model. Some 80% of the  materials required to build and install a wind turbine are steel.  Steel is the most reused and  recycled material on earth. Over 90% of steel produced is both reusable and recyclable over  and over again.  At the end of a wind turbine’s useful life, the tower can be recycled,  remanufactured and reused, further extending its useful life, and eventually 90 to 100 percent  of the steel is recaptured and recycled ad infinitum .303  The benefits of recycled steel are clear when compared  to producing steel from virgin ores.   Producing 1 tonne of steel from iron ore in the blast furnace ( BF) to basic oxygen furnace  requires  1.4 t of iron ore, 0.8 t of coal, 0 .3 t of limestone, and roughly 1/8th of a tonne of  recycled steel.  Producing the same tonne in an electric arc furnace (EAF) begins with 0.88  tonnes of recycled steel, and requires 50 times less coal (16 kg) and nearly five times less  limestone (64 kg).  In addition, recycling steel requires significantly fewer inputs: 90% less virgin  materials 75% less energy, and 40% less water; and, significantly lower outputs: 97% less  mining waste, 86% less air pollutants, and 76% less water pollutants.304     Incenting B etter Circularity Practices   Luxembourg has embraced the principle of polluter pays and user pays, yet there are many  resources consumed annually in the economy that end up as discharged waste, emissions,  pollutants, and contaminants.   In the case of the circular economy, diminishing these externalities is advanced by creative  ingenuity, invention and innovation in designing, producing, delivering and consuming these  goods and services, and ultimately and ideally, in a cradle -to-cradle, waste -as-nutrients circular  process.   A long -standing way to motivate and incentivize better and wiser use of resources and  preventing, reducing and minimizing negative externalities, is through including the social and  environmental costs of these externalities in the cost of doing business a nd price of consuming  goods and services.  The European Commission DG Environment recently issued a 2200 -page  assessment, Study on Assessing the Environmental Fiscal Reform Potential for the EU28 ,                                                           303 WSA (2012) Sustainable Steel, at the core of a green economy,  World Steel Association.   304 Genet, Marcel (2012) EAF and/or BF/BOF: Which route is best for Europe?

In the case of Luxembourg, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are a substantial externality in  need of deep reductions.  While significant reductions have been achieved by the industrial  sector (e.g., the steel sector switching to energy and resource efficient electric arc furnaces that  use recycled steel as feedstock, reducing coal emissions by 96%), emissions from the transport  and power sector have  soared. Transportation emissions have climbed 152% while the power  sector experience d a rise in emissions of 3000%, due to constructing new and combined cycle  natural gas plants and combined heat and power systems, as shown in Figure 25 -2.   Source: Eunomia (2016), citing Source:  International Energy Agency (2014) Energy Policies of IEA Countries -  Luxembourg: 2014 Review, 2014, p.32.     Among EU Member States, Luxembourg has the highest level of GHG emissions per capita, and  even among the highest worldwide, surpassing 24 tonnes o f CO 2-eq per capita in 2012.  Luxembourg is currently projected to exceed its 2020 emissions reduction target by 23 percent.   A major recommendation by the OECD is for Luxembourg to reduce non -resident fuel  consumption by means of raising the level of fuel taxation in alignment with EU averages.  Cross -border commuters increased 350% between 1990  and 2012.   Luxembourg’s tax rates for both fossil fuel products and electricity are significantly below EU  averages, barely at the minimum level set in the Energy Ta x Directive  (ETD).   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               358     Diesel fuel excise fees are so low that they promote “fuel tourism” with non -residents fueling  up in Luxembourg to take advantage of the low fuel prices. While this policy reaps the  government tax revenues from non -residents (€745 milli on in 2015) it is having pernicious,  unwanted side effects.  Traffic congestion, noise, and exhaust pollution from the diesel fumes  are a daily nuisance.  Luxembourg incurs an annual energy trade balance deficit because of its  need to import over 95% of pe troleum and natural gas products. The steep rise in  transportation CO 2 emissions is proving difficult to curtail.  And Luxembourg has among the  highest motorization rates in the EU, and well as among the EU’s highest amount of time spent  driving.   Another c onfounding policy is Luxembourg’s vehicle registration fee, which is the same (€50)  regardless of whether the vehicle is fuel sipping or diesel guzzling.  Most European countries  have implemented variable vehicle registration taxes/fees, based on fuel effi ciency/inefficiency,  fuel type, and level of CO 2 emissions.   For example, the Netherlands (as well as Spain and  Ireland) reduces registration fees for the most fuel -efficient cars.  To register a Ford Fiesta costs  €7,080, whereas a comparable priced Fiat 500 only incurs a €2,386 registration fee because it  releases much lower CO 2 emissions. This similar policy practice in Ireland led to 90% of vehicle  sales in lower -emission vehicle classes. Luxembourg’s one fee fits all sizes, on the other hand,  has no in fluence on the buyer’s vehicle selection. Moreover, the Luxembourg tax regime in  regards to company cars results in including a vehicle as in -kind benefits to employees’  remuneration offers.   A key part of the 2016 Study on Assessing the Environmental Fiscal Reform Potential for the  EU28, issued by the DG Environment of the European Commission, are recommendations  reflecting the full costs of fossil fuels.  The recommendations , summarized in Tables 25 -4, 25 -6  and 25 -9, offer guidance for Luxembourg lawmakers and stakeholders.     Waste Streams   If there is an eye -opening reality to the loss of wealth in the linear economy, it is captured in  the fact that 50 to 75 percent of all natural resources consumption becomes pollut ion and  waste within 12 months.305  Closing the loop, turning wastes into nutrients, reducing the need  for virgin resources, and innovating through pursuit of biomimicry  processes, are essential for  expanding prosperity and wellbeing while collapsing waste a nd pollution.                                                               305 Matthews, Emily et al  (2000) The Weight of Nations , http://www.wri.org/

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               360     Sanitation and  Wastewater Treatment   As mentioned in the TIR Strategy Study Food chapter , Carole Dieschbourg, the Minister of the  Environment, reported in 2015 that more than 70% of Luxembourg’s surface water  may not  comply with the EU's 2015 targets for chemical and biological quality (EU Water Framework  Directive). Roughly one -tenth of the below ground monitoring points indicated nitrates  exceeded concentration limits. In shifting from the conventional linear model to a circularity  model, Luxembourg’s scores of towns  and communities with small population sizes could  pursue ecologically sustainable, modular, distributed wastewater treatment systems. The  innovations in this field are fast evolving, with the following chart indicative of the range of  approaches.   Wastewat er treatment options     Source: Wendland and Albold (2010)308                                                           308 Wendland, Claudia and Andrea Albold (2010) Sustainable and cost -effective wastewater systems for rural and  peri-urban communities up to 10,000 population equivalents, Guidance paper, Women in Europe for a Common  Future, http://www.wecf.eu/ .  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               361       According to Eurostat, half of Luxembourg’s solid waste was either landfilled (17%) or  incinerated (33%). Luxembourg exported 172 kg per capita of hazardous waste in 2013, the  highest of all European nations, followed by Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands.   The EU’s 2015 updated legislative proposals  on waste  established specific targets for waste  reduction, setting out robust long -term stretch goals. Among the targets include:    Recycling 65% of municipal waste by 2030;    Recycling 75% of packaging waste by 2030;    Binding landfill target to reduce landfill to a maximum of 10% of municipal waste by  2030;    Ban on landfilling of separately collected waste;    Promotion of monetary and fiscal instruments to discourage landfilling;    Simplified and enhanced definitions and harmonized calculation methods for recycling  rates throughout the EU;    Concrete measures to promote re -use and stimulate industrial symbiosis - turning one  industry's by -product into another  industry's raw material;    Incentives for enhanceing recovery and recycling operations (e.g., for packaging,  batteries, electric and electronic equipments, vehicles).   Most of of these initiatives are focused on reducing “less bads” generated by the linear  processes of the Second Industrial Revolution.   The expansion of the Third Industrial Revolution  is predicated on wastes being largely prevented through whole systems integrated design,  combined with any remaining wastes used as nutrients embedded in close d loop processes  during a product’s lifespan.  Closed loop processes encompass every facet and aspect of  economic and social activity.     Biosphere Valley – Rewilding Natural Landscapes   The Internet of Communications, Internet of Renewable Energy, and Inter net of Mobility and  Logistics created by the Silicon Valleys of the world are essential features of the Third Industrial  Revolution.  They necessarily operate within, and are fully dependent upon, the planet’s  biosphere, that thin layer surrounding the ear th and vertically stretching up 19 kilometers into 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               362     space.  The health and wellbeing of humanity and the sustainability of the global economy are  intimately dependent upon the biosphere.  There are a myriad of complex social -ecological  linkages ceaselessly occurring, embedded within and throughout the world’s Biosphere Valleys.    Regional and national Biosphere Valleys, integrating rewilded nature corridors into the socio ecological fabric enhance important long -term qualities such as resilience, adaptability, vitality,  anti-fragility, and vigor. These qualities hold current citize ns in good stead, while also acting on  our moral responsibility to maintain a healthy planetary biosphere for the many generations to  come.   The Third Industrial Revolution is poised to trigger exponential growth in world economic  productivity , while at th e same time greatly diminishing the immense biosphere impacts caused  by First and Second Industrial Revolution technologies. Rewilding of biosphere valleys provides  the assurance and insurance that these social -ecological processes will sustain and maintai n  flourishing life on earth far into the future.   Civilizations over the ages largely ignored maintaining the integrity of the biosphere, often to  their peril.  Archeological research has uncovered repeated collapses of earlier societies,  invariably due to overusing and severely degrading their biosphere endowment.309,310 Earth  satellite imagery reveals Humans Appropriate nearly 40 percent of the global terrestrial plant  Net Primary Production (HANPP); and more recent satellite mapping indicates “75% of the  plan et’s land surface is experiencing measurable human pressures.”311  Expropriation of the  land surface Net Primary Production, along with the soaring rates of marine and freshwater  aquatic species die -off from overfishing the oceans, has driven up the current rate of species  extinction to 1000 times faster than the natural background rate. With human population and  resource consumption continuing to expand, it is estimated that the remaining “available”  terrestrial NPP amounts to only 10 percent (when unproduct ive and remote lands, plus  underground NPP like roots, are removed from the total).312    There are further risks to biodiversity and natural habitat loss as the global economy phases out  fossil fuels. The historical consumption of Net Primary Production (NPP ) for satisfying energy  demands was replaced in the first and second industrial revolutions by mining underground                                                           309 Tainter, Joseph (1990) The Collapse of Complex Societies, Cambridge University Press.   310 Butzer, Karl W.

This, in turn , has generated a revival in mass production of  bioenergy, threatening a far greater consumption of the Earth’s remaining Net Primary  Production. The risks to biodiversity and ecosystem services becomes clear when we recognize  that satisfying the world con sumption of fossil fuels with bioenergy substitutes would consume  more than 400 times the planet’s entire NPP.313  World -renown biodiversity scientist, Harvard Professor E.O. Wilson, exhorts humanity in his  recent book, Half Earth, Our Planet’s Fight for Life :  If biodiversity is to be returned to the baseline level of extinction that existed before the  spread of humanity, and thus saved for future generations, the conservation effort must  be raised to a new level. The only solution to the “Sixth Extinction” is  to increase the area  of inviolable natural reserves to half the surface of the Earth or greater.   It has taken more than a century to set aside about 13% of Earth’s land surface into wilderness  reserves, nature parks, and protected areas.314  Oceans and coa stlines, already suffering some  of the  most damaging consequences (40% of the planet’s coral reefs are dead, including 80% in  the Caribbean, and over 50% of the Great Barrier Reef now dead with 95% threatened with  permanent loss), have not received as much  protection. Just 3.3% of the world’s oceans and 7%  of coastal areas are protected areas.315  Some nations have pursued protection of significantly  higher percentages of land surface.  The ten top nations have set aside 40 to 60+ percent of  their lands in bi oreserves and conservation.316 A large fraction of the nature parks  unfortunately are not well protected; half of them are being exploited due to lax or absent  enforcement.317  Most problematic is the fact that nine out of ten of the planet’s classified  threat ened floral and faunal species are located mainly outside existing protected zones.318                                                           313 Dukes, Jeffrey S.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               364     To its great credit, Luxembourg has nearly tripled its terrestrial protect ed area, from roughly  12%  in 1990 to 35 % as of 2014.319  This goes well beyond the international target set by the  Convention for Biological Dive rsity of protecting at least 17% of terrestrial habitats by 2020.320   It is important to understand that the principle of circularity does not simply extend from the  extraction of resources from the environment and the recycling of used products back into the  environment. There is an increasing awareness of the need to prope rly nurture the 19  kilometers – from the stratosphere to the water – that makes up a country’s biosphere zone.  The recycling of used materials back into Luxembourg’s natural environment, therefore, needs  to go hand -in-hand with stewarding nature’s circular  flows that allow the biosphere to flourish.  A rejuvenated biosphere, in turn, provides the sustenance to maintain a sustainable quality of  life for present and future generations in Luxembourg. With its current commitment to  maintain 35% of its landmass a s protected space, Luxembourg can serve as an exemplary  rewilding model for the rest of the European Union.   There are roughly 375 identified faunal species of amphibians, birds, mammals and reptiles,  and more than 1 ,250 floral species of vascular plants i n Luxembourg.  None are endemic to  Luxembourg (indigenous to the nation), but many are endemic to Europe.  Roughly 2% of the  species are threatened with extinction.321 According to the IUCN’s Red List assessment of  Europe’s 6,000 species, roughly 12% are loc ated in Luxembourg (695), with 2% listed as  threatened.322  The 2050 European Union Biodiversity Vision is far more challenging to achieve and sustain.   According to the mandate, “the ecosystem services it [the Biosphere] provides – its natural  capital – are protected, valued and appropriately restored for biodiversity's intrinsic value and  for their essential contribution to human wellbeing and economic prosperity, and so that  catastrophic changes caused by the loss of biodiversity are avoided.”323                                                           319 World Bank (nd) Terrestrial Protected Areas (% of total land area) ,  http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/ER.LND.PTLD.ZS .   320 UNEP (nd) Target 11 - Technical Rationale extended (provided in document COP/10/INF/12/Rev.1), Quick Guide  (Target 11),  Strategic Goal C : To improve the status of biodiversity by safeguarding ecosystems, species and  genetic diversity, Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011 -2020, including Aichi Biodiversity Targets,  Convention on  Biological Diversity, UN Environment Programme, https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target -11/.   321 Mongabay.com (na) Luxembourg Forest Statistics,  http://rainfo rests.mongabay.com/deforestation/archive/Luxembourg.htm .   322 IUCN (2013) Luxembourg’s biodiversity at risk, A call for action, May 2013, European Red List, International  Union for the Conservation of Nature, Global Species Programme, http://www.iucnredlist.org/europe .   323 CBD (na) The 2050 EU Biodiversity Vision, National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans (NBSAPs), Convention  for Biological Diversity, https://www.cbd.int/nbsap/about/targets/eu/ .   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               365     Climate dest abilization is the key threat of catastrophic change. Humans have become a  planetary volcanic force – releasing the greenhouse gas (GHG in carbon -dioxide equivalents,  CO 2-e) emissions every 10 hours equivalent to the 1992 Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption.  Failure to halt these CO 2-e emissions will result in the equivalent of 90,000 human -triggered  volcanic explosions this century.  CO 2-e directly increases the Earth’s temperature, as well as  causing water vapor to increase in the atmosphere.  Water is anoth er GHG, which results in  further raising the global temperature.324  Scientists estimate each 1 degree Celsius rise in  global temperature activates 7 percent more water vapor in the atmosphere.   Climatologists calculate that this additional water vapor  leads to a feedback loop doubling the  amount of warming directly caused by CO 2. That is to say, a 1°C rise triggered by CO 2 will cause  the global temperature to go up another 1°C as result of the increased water vapor.   Humanity’s current emissions trajectory is  projected to increase global temperature by 5 to 7  degrees Celsius this century, injecting 35 to 50 percent more moisture into the atmosphere.   The 1-degree  C rise already occurring has unleashed a costly, continuous series of local and  regional catastrop hic weather patterns (e.g., numerous 1 -in-500-year floods, droughts,  wildfires, severe storms, recurring within months or several years).  The one certainty about  future weather is it will be filled with uncertainty and the increasing frequency of catastro phyrelated weather disasters.   Herein lies the importance of rewilding; biosphere valleys augment resilience to deal and cope  with climate -triggered catastrophic events.  Rewilding, as a protected area design approach,  emerged over the past half century fr om ecological research in half a dozen field research and  scientific investigative disciplines.325  It is not currently known how much of Luxembourg’s land set -asides constitute s comprehensive  rewilding practices. But as E.O. Wilson and scores of scientists have argued, rewilding is an  imperative worldwide.  Undertaking rewilding in only a few localities, or implementing half hearted measures, is inadequate.  Just as a circular ec onomy will only fully function when  implemented by most localities in the global economy, so is the case with rewilding. Indeed,  rewilding undertaken mainly by industrialized nations will have negative consequences if it  results in fulfilling the demand fo r goods by shifting production and resource consumption to                                                           324 Chung, Eui -Seok, Brian Soden, B.

One of the first steps should be to convert current heat losses into a usable energy  source for further use. Industry is a key actor in the circular economy as the highest impact is  created if p roducts are designed for continuous cycles. Beyond the technical issues, the actual  business model will have to be adapted toward a new approach: product as a service.      Finance   The finance sector often plays the role of business enabler. The development of new business  models requires different views and approaches towards financing. Circular economy projects  might need higher initial investments but will have important returns in the longer term. The  funding sector might be interested in investing in ‘ci rcular’ companies, creating positive  impacts. Therefore, it will be important for the finance sector  to understand the underlying  circular approach. Tools for evaluating how circular a business really is, will be needed.   The  financial industry should inv estigate how the blockchain technology can be used in a large  range of applications, where data privacy and transparency are required. Virtual currencies  could help to make sharing platforms work.     Mobility   Reverse logistics, car/truck pooling, multimoda l transport, and driverless and electric and  hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, are commonly identified areas that need to be pursued in ushering  in the Mobility Internet.

But the  current lithium -ion batteries are not yet designed for continuous loops. Therefore, the battery  technology should not only be looking at how to increase the energy storage density, b ut also  how to recover 100% of the used materials at a high quality. The research for new concepts (for  example fuel cell) should continue.  Driverless vehicles will contribute to significantly reducing  the logistics (and reverse logistics) cost, enabling the development of more continuous material  loops.       Buildings   Integrated and integral building design should aim for buildings that are energy positive and  that act as material banks (BIM -process). In addition, they are connected in multiple ways to  the Internet and will generate large sets of data (i.e., instant information about material flow  through a building). New urban collaborative and sharing concepts should be promoted (for  example, urban farming on rooftops).   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               368         Food   Local and organic production of food is certainly a circular approach. In addition, the sector  should focus on how to close the biological loop by bringing back the nutrients to the soil. The  farmers should look at how they can create additional positive i mpacts  like, for example ,  BIM7+ (Cradle-to-Cradle) Cradle$to$Cradle'Con6nuous'Commissioning''
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               369     storage of carbon in the soil, or working the fields in such a way that high quality drinking water  can be obtained. Agriculture will also need to evolve into new bio -based products  like  Miscanthus  spp. for the construction industry.     Energy   Making better use of the wasted heat is one possible approach to reduce our dependence on  fossil fuels. Onsite and distributed energy systems based on renewable energy sources are a  key part of a circular eco nomy. Highly flexible pricing models (reflecting the actual  demand/offer situation) could enhance the shift to distributed energy production and  accelerate this transition. The new technical solutions for renewable energy production and  storage should also  be designed for continuous loops.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               370       Smart Economy   One way to improve the quality of our raw material usage is to improve the amount and quality  available for each product. This represents a whole new area of opportunities for implementing  a smart econom y, based on the Internet of Things and fully automated processes (for example:  data exchange, logistics tasks). Like the other pillars, the new infrastructure needs to be  designed for disassembly and re -use as well   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               371       Source: Stahel (1997)327    Prosumers   In a distributed future, where a more effective use of resources is the norm, the consumer acts  more  and more as a producer as well  (energy, small service or equipment provider and even  investor). This requires a significant change of mindset for our society.  In a circular economy the  access to a service is considered to be more important than the possession of a product. This  social and technological revolution requires a different education system that can explain the  reasons why we need to change and provid e the right knowledge base for the next generation.                                                                    327 Walter Stahel (1997) "The Functional Economy: Cultural and Organizational Change."

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               372     PROPOSALS     1 Business Model Innovation      1.1 Develop an Internet platform and LuxLoop app for the purchase, exchange and  distribution of secondary sourced materials  (short term example: excavation waste).    Create product descriptions, procedures and criteria. Establish quality assurance for the  information going into the database. Implement the required legal framework.  Develop  the LuxLoop mobile App for easy exchange of technical data, specifications, av ailability  and quantity. This is key for raising awareness about the circular economy.     1.2 Pursue a 100% renewable power economy for Luxembourg by 2050.  The precipitous  decline in the cost of wind and solar power should be seen as a n EU regional and global  market potential.  By making a national commitment, Luxembourg positions its leading  businesses, research centers, and financial sector to accelerate their learning and  experience curves by making the transition and transformation o f the current  predominantly fossil and nuclear powered grid to a 100% renewable one.  Luxembourg has  a well -integrated electricity system, with interconnectors enabling power exchanges  between wholesale operators.  The Fraunhofer Institute has performed an  economic engineering assessment for a 100% highly energy efficient, renewable -powered  Luxembourg economy.     1.3 Engage the farming community in producing wind and solar PV power as “cash crops.”    Of the nation's total land area of 2,590 km2, roughly 52.6%, or 1,310 km2 (131,000  hectares), consists of agricultural lands.  The opportunities for transitioning to Renewable  Smart Power could provide a valuable additional  revenue stream for rural farmers.  As an  example, consider satisfying 22% of Luxembourg’s total energy needs through farm -based  wind power.  It would involve harnessing 8.6% of the nation’s technical wind potential,  which could be accomplished with 319 installed turbines, each 5 MW rated power (total of  1,594 MW nameplate capacity).  The spacing area  would occur over 202 km2 (roughly 15%  of agricultural land area, of which 90+% would still be available for farming). The  estimated LCOE (levelized cost of electricity) is estimated at €cents 7/kWh.  The upfront  capital cost (in 2016€) is estimated at €1.89 billion, with an energy simple payback of 4.3  years.  A farm cooperative could be established to carry out this opportunity for the  farming community.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               373       1.4 Promote agricultural, local and organic products . There are existing organic grocery  stores sellin g regional products in Luxembourg. There are also local organic production  initiatives: Naturata, Oikopolis. What is needed is greater support for the development of  expanded organic agriculture, resulting in positive impacts generated by the farmers. This   will require ongoing research combined with pilot projects to investigate potential positive  impacts, for example chemical free areas, changes in yields, and soil carbon enhancement.     1.5 Promote the Circular -Design of products and new business models.  Potential  collaborators in circular design include the Design School CAD Wiltz and the FAB Lab (3D  Laboratory) in Belval, Esch -Alzette.  The EU ECO Design Directive – the REACH process –  promotes circular design requirements at the EU level and offers finan cial support for  specific R&D projects. Part of the mandate of the REACH program is to definine minimum  design standards. Luxembourg should champion the expansion of the existing ECO design  directive to include a circular approach. Circular design should b e phased -in as a  mandatory module in technical education and efforts should be made to attract design  schools to Luxembourg.     1.6 Promote new business models: Product -as a -service and circular supplies.  Some  examples of product -as-a-service exist already in Luxembourg, e.g., agricultural machines  and toys. Identify other products with potential to be shifted from traditional “buy and  own” to “use as a service” and promote such transitions. Develop new bu siness models  and support pilot projects via specific national support programs (Fit 4 circularity). Provide  financial support for this type of approach. Expand research in new IoT technologies  (smart tags, low cost sensors, IoT tools and techniques, mobil e apps) to help in the  implementation of such a system.  Promote public procurement that allows 'pay for  performance’ contracts. Revise tax system to give preference to 'usage' of a product  versus the possession of a product at the moment when the purchasi ng decision is made.     2 Technical     2.1 Develop nutrient recovery in wastewater treatment stations . Promote segregation of  problematic waste streams at the source. Establish pilot projects for extracting phosphates  and support research for extraction of other n utrients, followed by large -scale recovery  programs.  Implement infrastructure to separate grey water and wastewater.  Require all  new wastewater treatment station s to recover phosphates.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               374     2.2 Pilot test blockchain technology to track circular economy inputs, throughputs, and  outputs of supply chains and value chains of public institutions and private businesses .  Blockchain is a distributed ledger that encrypts transactions that are also auditable.  Blockchain appears to be a useful tool for tracking, measuring and validating the flows of  waste, pollution, and overall resource use.  Blockchain could serve as the repository of  metrics indicators in the circular economy.     2.3 Support a collaborative innovation network (COIN) platform for designers, practitioners,  and related professionals to interact, share and cultivate pathways for scaling up both  skills and investment in circular product design and production which could facilitate  greater re -use, remanufacture, repair and recycling.         3 Regulatory     3.1 Implement a taxa tion system that places the nation as the EU circular economy leader;  or at least raise circularity to levels commensurate with the EU average .  A key part of  the circular economy is internalizing the costs associated with externalities incurred during  economic activities.  Luxembourg embraces the principles of polluter pays and user pays.  An innovative tax system motivates actions to innovate on the production side through  resource efficiency improvements that cut costs, as well as motivating customers to  purchase more energy and resource efficient products to lower costs.  This systematic  change aims at increasing the tax rate on material consumption, while incentivizing the re use of high quality materials / components with lower taxes. The additional tax  income  should be used to lower the work related taxes in such a way that the total tax burden is  not increasing. Luxembourg’s current environmental taxes amount to 2% of GDP, down  from the 2004 level of 3.03% of GDP.  According to the January 2016 report on  Environmental Fiscal Reform issued by the DG Environment of the European Commission,  Luxembourg’s current rate is among the lowest in the EU28: ranking 20th for overall  environmental taxes as a percent of GDP, 24th for taxation of pollution and resources, and  25th for transport (excluding fuel).328                                                             328 Eunomi a (2016) Study on Assessing the Environmental Fiscal Reform Potential for the EU28 , January  2016, by  Eunomia Research & Consulting Ltd for the DG Environment of the European Commission,  http://www.eunomia.co.uk/reports -tools/study -on-assessing -the-environmental -fiscal -reform -potential -for-theeu28/  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               375     4 Public Policy     4.1 Provide financial incentives to facilitate development and implementation of an Internet  platform and LuxLoop app [described in 1.1 above] for the purchase, exchange and  distribution of secondary sourced materials. The funding is needed in order to develop   the required information, secure storage space on data centers, engage technical know  how to build and maintain the database, and to assemble a communication team that  explains and promotes the “Luxloop” App.     4.2 Foster the use of "wasted" energy, continue improvements in energy efficiency, and  expand the use of renewable power  [see 1.2 above] . Develop and maintain a ‘re -usable  energy source/flows’ inventory map. The European Energy Directive (2012/27/EU)329   already requires large consumers to know their ener gy losses, and the Luxembourg  National initiative, Pact climat ( http://www.pacteclimat.lu/fr  for municipalities) promotes  energy consumption data collection and local actions to reduce the energy bills.  Integra te  apps into the inventory map that enable calculating the cost of capturing re -usable energy  for additional purposes, as well as links to case examples of where this has been done,  experts who can be contacted, and financial incentives available from diff erent entities,  e.g., EU, national, municipal, utility, third parties.  Determining the cost -effectiveness of  harnessing re -usable energy should be compared to upgrading the existing operation with  more efficient and potentially cost -saving electrification  alternatives, which could lead to  removing the existing thermal conversion process (e.g., as the steel industry has done in  replacing Blast Furnaces/Basic Oxygen Furnaces with Electric Arc Furnaces).   4.2.1 Develop reusable energy pilot projects, for example, gr eenhouses on top of industry  roofs.     4.3 New economic zone developments should take into account the expected valorization of  energy losses and renewable energy production during the planning phase and design of  new infrastructure . Traditional and conventional planning and design layouts have  typically overlooked or ignored synergistic opportunities that realize both capit al and  operating expenditures. Examples include: layout of adjacent businesses for taking  advantage of cascading energy processes  (a model case of an industrial symbiosis network                                                           329 CEN/CENELEC (2015) European Standards for Energy Audits: helping companies to co mply with requirements of  the EU Energy Efficiency Directive , European Committee for Standardization/  European Committee for  Electrotechnical Standardization, July 9, 2015, http://www.cencenelec.eu/News/Press_Releases/Pages/PR -2015 06.aspx  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               376     is Denmark’s Kalundborg Eco -Industrial Park ); integrating safe pedestrian and bicycle  paths, as well as convenient transit interconnection points; spatial orientation and shaping  of buildings to optimize en ergy efficiency and solar gains, while avoiding shading and  ensuring each building has solar access; and designing surrounding landscapes and street  layouts that take advantage of the diurnal and seasonal microclimate conditions (e.g.,  avoid creating artif icial wind tunnels, promote breezeways, include shady walkways with  tree canopies, as well as sunny areas and wind breaks).  There are open source software  programs available for performing these myriad tasks.     4.4 Establish a national policy that integrates the development of a circular economy  throughout Luxembourg’s economic sectors . Catalyzing the circular economy is, in a very  fundamental way, a core part of Luxembourg’s strong policy priority promoting a  diversified, knowledge -intensive economy by taking  advantage of IoT (HPC and CBA) tools  and technologies. Just as smart buildings, smart grids, smart vehicles, and smart  manufacturing all require continuous measuring and analyzing of Big D ata to determine  and ensure performance as designed, so is this the  case with the energy and material  flows constituting the circular economy.  To avoid lost opportunities and seize unfolding  opportunities, the circular economy should be recognized as a linked and vital component  of advancing the interconnected digital Communication Internet, Renewable Energy  Internet, Mobility and Logistics Internet, Buildings as nodes (and nanogrids), and the  Internet of Things.     4.5 Prioritize large -scale circularity initiatives in the industrial, commercial, and agriculture  sectors .    4.6 Identify and remove the barriers and impediments currently limiting public procurement  practices and incentives in government and public agencies from purchasing sustainable,  green, resource efficient products and services .  Engage business firms to help i dentify  and eliminate these barriers.     4.7 Promote the establishment of material passports for every technical product. Leverage  the ongoing developments of the EU Horizon 2020 -sponsored Buildings As Material Banks  (BAMB), now underway with sixteen  partners from eight European countries.  The goal is  to integrate circularity practices in the building sector, including reversible building design,  as well as business model innovations, decision -making and management models, and  policy propositions.330                                                           330 BAMB, Buildings as Material Banks, http://www.bamb2020.eu/about -bamb/ . 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               377       4.8 Establishm ent of a material examination office. Creation of a national institute whose  mission is the control and analysis of specific products in order to validate the quality of  the used materials and to certify their technical nature. This institute should act  independently and should not be subject to producers or suppliers. This office would also  issue material passports.     4.9 Material passports should be promoted through public procurement.  Material passports  integrated with blockchain technology could provide cont inuous tracking of products.  Material content and assembly methods would always be traceable, and enable taxation  to be automated, depending on the final destination of the product. Minimum legal  standards for healthy design and design for disass embly shou ld be established and  periodically reviewed, for inclusion in material passports.     4.10 Promote energy network stability and cost savings through instant pricing and local  energy storage .  Expand installation of smart meters, and implement a flexible short term  energy pricing scheme which contributes to stabilizing the networks, saving money for  both end -users and operators, supporting distributed production plants, and achieving the  100% r enewable energy goal faster. Promote smart -controlled equipment for enabling  participation in real -time demand response options. Support technical development of  energy storage solutions that are re -usable. Support fully autonomous energy  consumption by el ectronic devices and machines, connected to the I nternet, and  automated energy storage based on energy availability and short term provisions around  local consumption and production.     4.11 Through a public -private partnership , promote  smart supply chains, intel ligent assets,  and standardized logistics container/tray pool.  Spread use of existing technologies (RFID,  geo-localization) for high value items together with other information like usage, need for  repair, and storage conditions (humidity/ temperature). Fo ster standardized packaging  solutions for all local postal, parcel and logistic companies managed in a central pool.  Develop a demonstration smart warehouse, that can easily be adapted to future needs  and that detect material flows through the building. Develop low cost technologies to  ensure track ing of goods, and packaging  materials , and of transportation equipment for  multiple industries (logistics, food, automotive suppliers, medical). Develop safe data  transmission protocols (e.g., blockchain technologies).    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               378     4.12 Promote sharing equipment and tools.   A number of local sharing  initiatives exist. For  example, dingdong.lu provides a sharing service for household items. “Maschinenring  Luxemburg” rents large machinery to farmers. COMAT  rents materials for the construction  sector and for other industries and public institutions. Pub lic authorities should promote a  wide range of enterprises to allow families and businesses to share an array of items that  are only needed on a short -term basis.     4.13 Establish a new Commissioner on Rewilding  to oversee already existing rewilded  conservation areas . Rewilding is based on trans -disciplinary, multi -disciplinary, and inter disciplinary research, experiments, actions, and adaptations.  It is an emergent scientific  field of non -linear dynamics in complex systems that require adaptive management over   time as new insights and findings from diverse fields of research and modeling indicate  modifications are needed.  A Commissioner on Rewilding is essential for ensuring a robust  initiative to protect, steward, and sustain Luxembourg’s swath of the Planeta ry Biosphere.  Bringing together citizen stakeholders and experts from academia, business, and  government, into a quadruple helix of knowledge innovation will be vital for fleshing out  Luxembourg’s unique rewilding opportunities and challenges.     4.14 Partner with neighboring nations and the Pan European Ecological Network to  implement transboundary rewilidng core areas and corridors. Earth systems sciences,  ecological network theory, and multi -level evolutionary framework analysis have each  provided co mpelling insights and reminders that the biosphere is not cons trained by  political boundaries.331  A fully effective rewilding initiative will require partnering with  other regions and  nations (given the vast span of many seasonally migratory species).  The  same TIR technologies will be essential for collecting, monitoring, and evaluating  continuous streams of big data, and making informed judgments on adaptive management  options.     5 Financial     5.1 Shift taxes off of people and onto environmental pollution and emissions .  Taxing labor  discourages expanding employment, while failing to fully tax environmental externalities  remove s incentives to reduce or eliminate pollution and emissions.  Environmental taxes                                                           331 Schimel, David, Kathy Hibbard, Duarte Costa, Peter Cox, Sander van der Leeuw (2016) Analysis, Integration and  Modeling of the Earth System (AIMES): Advancing the post -disciplinary understanding of coupled human – environment dynamics in the Anthropocene, Anthropocene Journal , March 2016,  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ancene.2016.02.001 . 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               379     in the EU have declined in recent decades, and now con stitute 2.5% of EU GDP.332  While  environmental regulations have replaced some tax needs there remain greater  opportunities. For example, a revenue -neutral carbon fee on all CO 2 emissions would  incentivize increasing efficiency -productivity improvements and shifting to near zero emission solar and wind power, while minimizing the impact by providing a tax return to  citizens that left them financially whole.333    5.2 Modify the tax syste m to promote re -using of resources instead of using primary raw  materials . Establish financial incentives promoting the use of secondary source materials  as raw material, as well as financial incentives promoting eco -design / material selection  /  design fo r disassembly.     5.3 Establish a taxation system for the use of new resources in non -consumable products . A  change in the tax system is required to shift purchasing perspectives from the linear “take make -dispose” model to “retake -remake -reuse -reduce -recycle” c ircular model. The  specifics should be fleshed out through a public -private task force that reviews the  experience and evidence of how such tax systems are working in other nations, and makes  recommendations for modifying Luxembourg’s tax system.     5.4 Incentiv ize dismantable "zero emission" buildings . Luxembourg has already mandated  that beginning in 2017 the passive house standard (Class A) will be required for new  residential buildings.334 In addition, f inancial incentives for energy positive housing,  renewable  energy production, and dismantable buildings should be implemented.     6 Educational     6.1 Promote new educational curricula that h elp student learn new aptitudes, skills and  competences for circular product design and production.                                                               332 Mathé, Milena, Gaëtan Nicodème and Savino Ruà (2015) Tax Shifts , European Commission, Working Paper No.  59, Euro pean Commission’s Directorate -General for Taxation and Customs Union, October 2015.   333 Komanoff, Charles (2016) Revenue -neutral Carbon Tax FAQ, Carbon Tax Center, http://www.carbontax.org/ .  334 Lichtmeß, Dr. Markus an d Dr. Jens Knissel (2013) Nationaler Plan Luxemburgs zur Erhöhung der Zahl der  Niedrigstenergiegebäude im Rahmen der Richtlinie  2010/31/EU vom 19.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               380     6.2 Promote the circular business  approach with large -scale awareness campaigns.   Currently, different initiatives are ongoing  including the Fit4Circularity initiativ e; the  Superdréckskëscht  which  provides information to companies and households; and the  nearly three decade environmental f air of the Greater Region, Oekofoire. Local/regional  transition networks exist: (Transition Minett). Large and medium size companies have an  RSE [social and environmental responsibility] coordinator analyzing the positive and  negative impacts of the compan y. Promote a new circular economy (CE) EU label. Use the  2017 CE event to make existing initiatives visible. Run a large -scale nationwide  communication campaign to promote the idea that access to a product is cool and trendy,  as well as promote the positiv e impacts created by a circular approach. Integrate CE  training and competence as part of the Luxembourg education system in the primary and  secondary schools, universities, and in lifelong learning programs. Propose products that  can be labeled as circula r (C.E. labeled) on an EU level. Establish a public procurement plan  for purchasing an increasing percentage of CE certified products.     6.3 Encourage school systems to encompass contemporary topics like: Social and solidarity  economy, circular economy and new (IoT) technologies.  Currently, basic introduction  training programs are developed for both primary and secondary school as well as for  training professionals. Specific ITC courses exist but are not standardized.  Going forward,  develop classroom , online , and field  training programs to educate teachers. Review  current teaching programs for each school level. Run pilot projects in different schooling  systems. Pilot lifelong teaching programs. Roll –out new concepts for the future.     7 RDI     7.1 Promote the development  of Bio -based batteries through public -private partnerships.    The government, Goodyear , and IEE of the Automotive campus in Bissen are currently  providing state -of-the-art facilities to firms engaged in technical innovation of automotive  components. Luxemb ourg is an ideal test bed for new developments of electric cars.  Also  underway is the joint project with Volvo Buses and ABB to engineer and commercialize  electric and hybrid buses employing direct current (DC) fast charging systems based on  open standard s.  A parallel joint effort should also be undertaken in the development of  bio-based batteries: how to re -introduce them back into the biological cycle by initiating  pilot projects and supporting research into battery solutions where all the components  could be reused later on. Support research into storage solutions and seek to become the  international expert for bio -based batteries and the build up of the recovery  infrastructure.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               381       7.2 Develop bio based nano -composites, designed for easy disassembly . A new na nocomposite center was established in 2016, operated under the PEARL program and funded  by the Luxembourg National Research Fund (FNR).  Vigorous and sustained investment  should be supported in the development of bio -based nano -composites that can be  disassembled again in a safe way.  Also initiate pilot projects, and promote new innovation  with bio -based composites in the building sector.  Strive to become the international  expert center for bio -based nano -composites, and the worldwide leader for disassem bly  on a molecular level of composites.     7.3 Support research programs for technological solutions and innovation in technologies  for renewable energy, energy storage, and energy transportation . Leverage the RDI  already underway through EU initiatives, as well  as in other nations and corporations.   Given Luxembourg’s leadership push in ICT/IoT technologies, as well as its financial  prowess, examine how these two sectors can both take advantage of and build upon this  larger pool of RDI, as well as promote commer cial expansion.     7.4 Public RDI and Private sector RDI need to align and leverage their efforts for advancing  aggregate efficiency -productivity gains through HPC & BDA tools and technologies .  According the European Commission, Luxembourg leads the EU in public  RDI scientific  performance, whereas private sector RDI has declined well below the EU average, noting,  “the volume of public sector research and innovation financed by businesses represents  only 0.017 % of GDP compared with an EU average of 0.051 %.”  Par t of the drop is due to  the nation’s shrinking industrial base . The largest sector of the economy, f inance, does  relatively little public RDI.  Applied research is what firms need, and public research  centers should collaborate with firms in the design of a mutually beneficial ecosystem of  activities.  The network and sharing platform of Luxembourg’s Eco Innovation Cluster  appears to be moving in this direction, with a quintuple helix knowledge network  comprised of a myriad of business sizes and product lines, along with government  agencies and other academic and research institutes.     7.5 Perform a rewilding inventory of already existing lands and inland waters  under  conservation protection arrangements . Determine the additional actions required for  ensuring that already protected areas are being transitioned into rewilding structures and  functions, and are sustained even as climate change dynamics unfold.  This involves multi faceted and multi -level research efforts to protect native floral and faunal species (above 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               382     and below ground) that evolved during the Holocene (past 11,700 years).335 The long -andslow and short -and-fast temporal cycles historically occurring at different spatial  dimensions in and between the diverse ecosystems of the biosphere are undergoing  dramatic change due to climate destabilization. The data capabilities of TIR Int ernetization,  digitization and AI technologies are central to achieving and sustaining effective rewilding  efforts. The Big Data  will have to be mined via complex socio -ecological systems -theory  modelling to sustain local ecosystems in a rapidly changing c limate.                                                                                           335 Bai, Xuemei, Sander van der Leeuw, Karen O’Brie n, Frans Berkhout  (2016) Plausible and desirable futures in the  Anthropocene: A new research agenda, Global Environmental Change  39:351 –362,  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2015.09.01 7.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               383     PROSUMERS & SOCIAL MODEL   OVERVIEW   Capitalism is giving birth to a progeny. It is called  the Sharing Economy on the Collaborative  Commons. This is the first new economic system to  enter onto the world stage since the advent of  capitalism and socialism in the early 19th Century ,  making it a remarkable historical event. The  Sharing Economy is already changing the way we  organize economic life, offering the possibility of dramatically narrowing the income divide,  democratizing the global economy, and creating a more ecologically sustainable soc iety.   Like every parent -child relationship, the two economic systems generally cooperate but  occasionally are at odds. And while the capitalist parent will need to nurture its child and allow  it to mature, the child will also transform the parent in this unfolding relationship. We are  already witnessing the emergence of a hybrid economy, part capitalist market and part sharing  economy on the Collaborative Commons. To the extent that capitalism can create new business  models and practices that will support the development of the sharing economy, it will prosper  along with its offspring.   The triggering agent that’s precipitating this great economic transformation is zero marginal  cost brought on by the digitalization of communication, energy, and transport, and now the  introduction of the Internet of Things platform. Businesses have always sought new  technologies that could increase productivity and reduce the marginal cost of producing and  distributing goods and services, in order to lower their prices, win over consumers and market  share, and return profits to their investors. They never anticipated, however, a technology  revolution that might unleash “extreme productivity” bringing marginal costs to near zero,  making information, energy, and many physical g oods and services nearly free, abundant, and  no longer subject to market exchanges. That’s now beginning to happen.   The near zero marginal cost phenomenon wreaked havoc across the “information goods”  industries over the past decade as millions of consumer s turned prosumers and began to  produce and share their own music via file sharing services, their own videos on YouTube, their  own knowledge on Wikipedia, their own news on social media, and even their own free e -books  on the World Wide Web. The zero marginal cost phenomenon brought the music industry to its  knees, shook the film industry, forced newspapers and magazines out of business, and crippled  the book publishing market.

Economists acknowledge the powerful impact zero marginal cost has had on the information  goods industries, but until recently, have argued that it would not pass across the firewall of the  virtual world into the brick -and-mort ar economy of energy, and physical goods and services.  That firewall has now been breached.

In the digitalized Sharing Economy, social capital is as vital as market capital, access  is as important as ownership, sustainability supersedes consumerism, collaboration is as crucial  as competition, virtual integration of value chains gives way to lateral economies of sca le,  intellectual property makes room for open sourcing and creative commons licensing, GDP  becomes less relevant, and social indicators become more valuable in measuring the quality of  life of society, and an economy based on scarcity and profit vies with a zero marginal cost  society where an increasing array of goods and services are produced and shared for free in an  economy of abundance.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               386     People in Luxembourg and around the world are already transferring bits and pieces of their  economic life to the Shar ing Economy. Prosumers are not only producing and sharing their own  information, news, knowledge, entertainment, green energy, transportation, and 3D -printed  products in the Sharing Economy at near zero marginal cost. Forty percent of the US population  is actively engaged in sharing homes, toys, tools, and countless other items. For example,  millions of apartment dwellers and home owners are sharing their living quarters with millions  of travelers, at near zero marginal cost, using online services like Airb nb and Couchsurfing. In  New York City alone, Airbnb’s 416,000 guests who stayed in houses and apartments between  2012 and 2013 cost the New York hotel indust ry 1 million lost room nights.

New regulations will have  to be enacted to ensure the social security benefits of a growing freelance workforce.  Additional regulatory policies will need to be adopted to promote a level playing field between  the ma rket economy and the Sharing Economy.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               387     Procedures will need to be put in place to track and record shared work and the exchange of  goods and services for the purposes of charging taxes, measuring social security contributions,  and providing accurate statis tics for national accounting purposes. The Sharing Economy will  also require new codes and regulations to ensure product safety and protect consumer rights.   The migration of employment from the automated market economy to the Sharing Economy  and social ec onomy is going to fundamentally change the nature of work. Government  agencies, universities, and think tanks will need to explore, analyze, and assess how the  changing nature of employment – flexible working hours, part time employment, and  augmented virt ual reality work environments – will affect quality of life indicators, including  changes in conception of selfhood and identity, sociability, and cultural affiliations.   The digital Third Industrial Revolution  not only impact s job opportunities and the working  environment in the mid to long term, but is already changing today’s working conditions. The  massive diffusion of digital tools changes the way work is being organi zed, structured and  executed. Digitalisation creates new possibilities such as remote working and virtual teams. The  other side of the coin is the acceleration of work, new command and control options,  and the  risk of information and communication overload. In addition, digitalization brings on a spate of  new is sues regarding changes in management and training. To benefit both employers and  employees, related work -life balance and legal issues will need to  be tackled.   The advent of the S haring Economy via online intermediation platforms also raises specific  ques tions regarding  working conditions and social welfare  by service providers who share  assets, resources, time and skills. Substantial new questions arise with the emergence of the  Sharing Economy. For example, are services providers – car share drivers and home sharing  providers – engaged by companies like Uber and Airbnb independent contractors or employees  of the companies whose platforms they use? The classification depends on the degree of  subordination or dependency between service provider and intermed iation platform and is  crucial in terms of social insurance coverage, working hours, working place safety and the like.  The quality of the job (formal or informal) and the income generated  are connected issues.   The emergence and maturation of the Sharing Economy alongside the conventional capitalist  market will require a rethinking of regulations, codes, and standards at the state level in  Luxembourg.        
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               388     Quality of Life Indicators   While  economic stagnation may be occurring for many other reasons, a more crucial change is  just beginning to unfold which could account for part of the sluggishness: the slow demise of  the capitalist system and the rise of a Collaborative Commons in which econ omic welfare is  measured less by the accumulation of market capital and more by the aggregation of social  capital. The steady decline of GDP in the coming years and decades is going to be increasingly  attributable to the changeover to a vibrant new economi c paradigm that measures economic  value in totally new ways.   Nowhere is the change more apparent than in the growing global debate about how best to  judge economic success. The conventional GDP metrics for measuring economic performance in  the capitalist marketplace focus exclusively on itemizing the sum total of goods and services  produced each year with no attempt to differentiate between negative and positive economic  growth. An increase in expenditures for cleaning up toxic waste dumps, police protecti on and  the expansion of prison facilities, military appropriations, and the like are all included in gross  domestic product.   Today, the transformation of economic life from finance capital and the exchange of goods and  services in markets to social capita l and the sharing of goods and services in the Collaborative  Commons is reshaping society’s thinking about how to evaluate economic performance. The  European Union, the United Nations, the Organization for Economic Co -operation and  Development (OECD), and a number of industrialized and developing countries have introduced  new metrics for determining economic progress, emphasizing “quality of life” indicators rather  than merely the quantity of economic output.   Social priorities, including educational attain ment of the population, availability of health -care  services, infant mortality and life expectancy, the extent of environmental stewardship and  sustainable development, protection of human rights, the degree of democratic participation in  society, levels o f volunteerism, the amount of leisure time available to the citizenry, the  percentage of the population below the poverty level, and the equitable distribution of wealth,  are among the many new categories used by governments to evaluate the general economi c  welfare of society.   The GDP metric will likely decline in significance as an indicator of economic performance along  with the diminution of the market exchange economy in the coming decades. By midcentury,  quality of life indices on the Collaborative Co mmons are likely to be the litmus test for  measuring the economic wellbeing of every nation.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               389     In the unfolding struggle between the exchange economy and the Sharing Economy,  economists’ last fallback position is that if everything were nearly free, there wo uld be no  incentive to innovate and bring new goods and services to the fore because inventors and  entrepreneurs would have no way to recoup their up -front costs. Yet millions of prosumers are  freely collaborating in social Commons, creating new IT and sof tware, new forms of  entertainment, new learning tools, new media outlets, new green energies, new 3D -printed  manufactured products, new peer -to-peer health -research initiatives, and new nonprofit social  entrepreneurial business ventures, using open -source legal agreements freed up from  intellectual property restraints.   The upshot is a surge in creativity that is at least equal to the great innovative thrusts  experienced by the capitalist market economy in the twentieth century. The democratization of  innov ation and creativity on the emerging Collaborative Commons is spawning a new kind of  incentive, based less on the expectation of financial reward and more on the desire to advance  the social well -being of humanity. And it’s succeeding.   While the capitalis t market is not likely to disappear, it will no longer exclusively define the  economic agenda for civilization. There will still be goods and services whose marginal costs are  high enough to warrant their exchange in markets and sufficient profit to ensure  a return on  investment. But in a world in which more things are potentially nearly free, social capital is  going to play a far more significant role than financial capital, and economic life is increasingly  going to take place on a Collaborative Commons.    Recent surveys underscore the broad economic potential of the Sharing Economy. A  comprehensive study found that 62 percent of Gen Xers and Millennials are attracted to the  notion of sharing goods, services, and experiences in Collaborative Commons. These  two  generations differ significantly from the baby boomers and World War II generation in favoring  access over ownership. When asked to rank the advantages of a Sharing Economy, respondents  to the survey listed saving money at the top of the list, followe d by impact on the environment,  lifestyle flexibility, the practicality of sharing, and easy access to goods and services. As for the  emotional benefits, respondents ranked generosity first, followed by a feeling of being a valued  part of a community, bein g smart, being more responsible, and being a part of a movement.

According to an opinion survey conducted by Latitude  Research, “75% of respondents predicted their sharing of physical objects  and spaces will  increase in the next five years.” Many industry analysts agree with these optimistic forecasts.  Time magazine declared collaborative consumption to be one of its “10 ideas that will change  the world.”336                                                            336 See: http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2059521_2059717_2059710,00.html   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               391     Interestingly enough, Luxembourgers are less engaged in the Sharing Economy than many other  countries, but are likely to increase their participation in the years ahead. According to a 2015  survey of Luxembourgers by ING Luxembourg, 24% of Luxembourg residents know about the  sharing economy,  33% would consider sharing their household appliances for money, 8.9%  would be willing to share their holiday home, and 20% believe their participation in the sharing  economy will increase.337     The Social Dimension   The shift to a prosumer Sharing Economy is as much about the values a society shares as it is  about the technologies it introduces. The future configuration of Luxembourg society and  economic life is not fated, but the result of today’s choices and decisio ns. Technological  changes are not an end in themselves, but tools to ameliorate our society. Public authorities,  businesses, social partners, civil society and citizen movements must work together to jointly  shape the transformation of society. The human d imension must be considered to ensure the  acceptance of the TIR process. The transition to a Third Industrial Revolution  will not be  achieved by technological development and innovation alone. Societal issues must be  considered as well. Technological chang es are inextricably linked to changes in mindset. A  broad approach allows taking all actors towards TIR and helps explain both the opportunities  and concerns related to upcoming changes. In summary, the empowerment of the consumer  and societal aspects set the frame for the working group “Prosumers & Social Model .”  Living together is based on ethical and moral values which are essential and vital elements of   our societ y. For instance, human rights are an integral part of these values, and compliance  with  them  should never be taken for granted, but rather be seen as a process to be continually   monitored. It is, therefore, necessary to assure that the respect of common values frames the  transition to the TIR. In a recent nation branding process, conducted by an inter -ministerial and  inter -institutional coordination committee and involving a wide variety of Luxembourg society  as well as the general public , participants crowd sourced a profile of Luxembourg’s citizenry.  Reliability, dynamism, and openness wer e identified as the country’s most distinguishing  characteristics and core strengths. Reliability refers to the solid foundations on which  Luxembourg performs its activities and to the stability of its economy. Dynamism reflects  Luxembourg’s ability to rei nvent itself and adapt to changing surrounding conditions. The way  in which Luxembourgers  mak e decisions and tak e action is characterized by pragmatism and a  commitment to constant improvement. The country’s openness is a key component of its                                                           337 See: https://www.ing.lu/web/ING/NL/Particuliers/News/NEWS_20150723_SHARECO_NL  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               392     economic deve lopment and model of society.   As the cosmopolitan crossroad in the heart of Europe and a driving force for the Greater  Region, Luxembourg experi ences  cross -border cooperation on a daily basis. Luxembourg, where  economic actors can benefit from an enormous  concentration of international expertise,  displays open -mindedness to new and innovative ideas.   Given these characteristics, the archetype of “the ally” best reflects the country’s identity: that  is, working together to generate common growth by virtue o f solid partnership s and a  commitment to the common good. The ally achieves his objectives thanks to his particular ease  in creating cooperation, alliances and communities. Luxembourg’s qualities, described above,  perfectly match the digi talized Sharing Ec onomy on the Collaborative C ommons where social  capital, lateral power and collaboration are decisive. Brought on by the Third Industrial  Revolution, amplified by the emerging Internet of Things platform and triggered by zero  marginal cost, the Sharing Eco nomy is expected to grow and become a complementary  economic model.   Besides the emergence of the Sharing Economy, the economic transformation spawned by TIR  goes along with socio -cultural mutations. One essential requirement for societal change is  literac y in the broadest sense. People need to understand the impacts of their actions. Raising  awareness and , in particular, biosphere consciousness is necessary to make sure that future  development targets economic, societal and environmental resilience. Develo pment is rarely  straight forward but, rather, characterized by disruptions an d evolution by leaps and bounds .  The participants of the working group pointed to different roles and missions of the state and  public authorities. First of all, the group made a distinction between specific missions in the  context of the TIR, notably to enable and facilitate economic and social development, and the  more general missions of guaranteeing social protection and cohesion, environmental  conservation and a stable quality  of life.   One key mission of the S tate relative to the Third Industrial Revolution  is to provide the  necessary infrastructure to allow economic activity to flourish. The requirements include  material infrastructure such as roads, high -performance telecommunication equipment,  adapted energy transportation and distribution grids  etc.,  as well as an immaterial framework  which includes legislation, regulation and policies. Luxembourg set the course for the transition  into the TIR with the government’s economic diversification policy, where ICT and logistics  upgrades of the energy infrastruct ure were earmarked as critical priorities.   Public health is another sector where Luxembourg has leaped  foreward by digitalizing its health  records.  The recently created national agency on shared information in the domain of health 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               393     (Agence eSanté) provides  individual electronic health record (Dossier de Soins Partagé) to ease   the exchange of information between health professionals and provide  a more coordinated and  efficient form of assistance for the patient. The health and care sectors offer various  oppor tunities  for TIR applications  – for example , the self -tracking of body parameters to  quantify biometrics including  heart  rhythm, insulin , and cortisol levels. The technology can be  used for remote monitoring and medical assistance. ICT and Internet of Netw orks technology  also allow health professionals to track the spread of epidemics and to inform the population in  situations where public health is at risk.   The S tate also needs to guarantee social protection and cohesion, environmental conservation  and a s table quality of life by meeting the needs for autonomy, good health, adequate housing,  healthy alimentation, mobility, sufficient rest, and so on. Public authorities need to defend the  common welfare and the best interests of citizens, including the prote ction of the weak and  vulnerable populations. In general, governmental action should therefore be aimed at  preventing an increase of inequalities and a marginali zation of parts of the population in the  digital era, as this is essential to social cohesion. Also, it is particularly important to leave no one  behind in the TIR process. Considering Luxembourg’s heterogenic resident and working  population, this is an outstan ding challenge for the country.   To support the transition towards a more sustainable socio -economic model, public authorities  should encourage enlightened and interested citizens who are conscious of their  responsibilities, rights and obligations. In addition, public authorities should express their  commitment to sustainable development by exem plary actions  like including social and  environmental  criteria in public procurement.   Digitalization , in general , and the Communication Internet , in particular , changes the profile  and the role of the consumer. The Communication Internet not only offers easier access to  information about commercial offers and product characteristics, but also gives the consumer  new possibilities to get involved in the economic process. Just as digitalization and the  Communication Internet allows pe ople to produce and share virtual goods such as music,  videos, books or knowledge, the emerging Internet of Things platform may extend the  prosumer and the Sharing Economy concept to more and more sectors of the brick -and-mortar  economy of energy and physi cal goods.   As consumers become producers as well, they are confronted with new obligations to be  respected and satisfied. This concerns questions about product safety and consumer rights, as  well as commercial and fiscal issues. Here, one major point is to  sensitize and inform the  (nonprofessional) prosumers about their legal duties and obligations when acting a s producer  or service provider.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               394     The increasing emergence of prosumers is strongly linked to the spread of sharing and a  collaborative economy, chara cterized by a flat hierarchy, lateral power and network  organization. The Sharing Economy covers a multitud e of different business models, all of which  aim to optimize resource use in order to lower utilization costs or reduce environmental  impacts. To eva luate, in the best possible way, the impact the Sharing Economy is having on the  society and the environment, it is essential to know the different specifications and  characteristics of this new economic paradigm as well as the people’s motivation to parti cipate  in sharing activities. These activities can be classified into three different types of Sharing  Economy operating models: 1) peer -to-peer exchanges using internet sites as intermediation  platforms; 2) object sharing implying a (public or private) th ird party owning the goods to be  shared; 3) collaborative models where users manage the resources and means of production  themselves. The impact of digitalization and the use of the Internet  of Things infrastructure  vary  considerably , depending on the resp ectiv e activity and operating model.   Peer -to-peer exchanges, mostly between private persons, include buying, selling, lending and  sharing of new and used goods, as well as services. Whereas the trade of second -hand goods  –  via eBay or similar online interm ediation platforms – presents limited competition to  commerce, the impact is different for selling new goods or providing services via internet  platforms. If such businesses are operated by private persons, i.e. via Uber for mobility  purposes or Airbnb for  accommodation issues, these enter into direct competition with  conventional commerce and require that the state guarantee a level playing field between the  emerging Sharing Economy and existing market economy businesses. The State must ensure,  via legal a ction, that different business models conform to  the same regulations and that  different operators and service providers comply with the same legal obligations.  In the Sharing  Economy however, a distinction should be made between professional actors and pr ivate  persons operating only occasionally. Corresponding criteria should be fixed by regulation; in  doing so, one approach could be to differentiate using thresholds, taking into account the level  of income generated or the regularity with which the servic e is provided. It is important to  make sure that all actors comply with their legal, tax and social obligations. A corresponding  framework should be clarified or specified if necessary. The above distinction also matters in  consumer rights, as warranties, product quality, imposed security and sanitary norms or  qualifications can differ, depending on the status of the provider. Relevant information to the  consumers should be clear and freely accessible.  It is a big challenge to anticipate and  recommend suita ble regulations that remain pertinent in a rapidly and continuously changing  environment. The Communication Internet acts as a stimulant and promoter for new peer -topeer exchange models, and the deployment of an Internet of Things platform will enlarge su ch  Sharing Economy m odels to more economic sectors.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               395     Object sharing implying a (public or private) third party owning the goods to be shared is  currently most common in the mobility sector. Offers like Vel’Oh and Carloh (Luxembourg -City),  Vël’ok (initiated by CIGL Esch/Alzette and supported by eight municipalities in the south of  Luxembourg) or Nordstad -eMovin (in the north of Luxembourg) are mobility services that place  bikes or cars at the disposal of the public. Such initiatives favor access to mobility o ver bike or  car ownership. Internet of Things technology benefits the spread of such initiatives. Sensors  allow tracking the vehicles and evaluating and controlling their use. Employing mobile apps,  users can be informed about the availability of a vehicle , perform reservatio ns or pay the  utilization fees.  A 2016 analysis by Morgan Stanley estimates the  global market for shared  mobility services  by 2030 will exceed  $2.5 trillion per year.338   The estimate is based on shared  mobility comprising one -fourth ( 26% ) of 20 trillion miles driven  worldwide at a cost of 28 euro  cents per kilometer.339  A third type of sharing is the collaborative model where users themselves manage the  resources and means of production. Community supported agriculture and energy coopera tives  are current examples of this type of activity, but so too are  the common creation and sharing of  immaterial goods such as knowledge pools (i.e. Wikipedia), open source software, and open   design,  etc.,  or commodities (open hardware) produced via commu nity owned 3D printers.  Unlike the two other operating models described above, collaborative models require a high  level of confidence between the users and confidence in the community as a whole . Social  capital is vital. While the use of Internet of Thing s technology for all of these initiatives is not  essential, it can help boost productivity and reduce marginal costs for these ac tivities.   Morgan Stanley’s bullish future for shared mobility is based on the current trend of Internet  companies’ investments  – Apple, Google, Alibaba, etc.  – in the mobility sector.  Apple, for  example, now spends more on mobility R&D than is collectively spent by the top 14 auto  manufacturers; or $5 billion compared to $192 million, respectively.340                                                                  338 Hanley, Steve (2016) Shared Mobility Will Be $2 Trillion Market By 2030, Gas2.com , June 5, 2016,  http://gas2.org/2016/06/05/shared -mobility -will-2-trillion -market -2030/ .  339 Elmer -DeWitt, Philip (2016) Morgan Stanley is bullish on the Apple car, Ped.com , May 25, 2016,  http://ped30.com/2016/05/25/apple -car-morgan -stanley/    340 Ray, Tiernan (2016) Apple R&D Way  More Than Detroit, Says Morgan Stanley; Big Cloud Spending?

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               397     correspondent study. Poll results could be helpful to implement pertinent policies. Official  figures and statistics about the public’s acceptance of the Sharing Economy in Luxembourg are  missing. One reason is the method ological difficulty in tracking and measuring peer -to-peer  sharing activities, especially those relying on non -monetary exchanges. Further analysis is   required in this domain to enable the integration of value added generated by activities based  on new eco nomic models into national accounts by the national statistical office (STATEC) and  to consider these activities in the calculation of the economic performance of Luxembourg.  Although peer -to-peer exchanges are not a new phenomenon, digitalization of the e conomy  increases the scale of these transactions and makes related measurement issues an urgent  priority. Underlying activities have been traditionally captured in national statistics using  numerous approaches related to the informal and non -observed econo my. The use of  intermediation websites may provide a solution to measure generated value in a more accurate  way. To this effect, Luxembourg could explore the feasibility of using data collected b y  intermediary service providers to improve the estimates of activities of unincorporated  enterprises. The topic also contains a fiscal issue as precise tracking and measuring is a  prerequisite for subjecting these activities to the tax code and allowing the state to collect  taxes.   Concerning the measurement of GDP , another issue must be broached: free assets produced by  users. While using (free) digital products, vast amounts of data are generated. Th is data  represent s a value asset for the provider as it is collected and commercially exploited (data  mining, Big Data analytics, sale to data brokers , etc. ). The value added by the users is difficult to  evaluate. When the provider is registered in the same country as the user, there should be no  impact on total GDP as the whole value is generated in the same national t erritory and the  provider’s activity is likely to be captured in national accounts. However, when provider and  user are not registered in the same country, there may be an impact on GDP as part of the  value chain – namely the value generated by the user is  not accounted for in the country it was  generated. A related topic is the creation of public goods using labor provided for free. Typical  examples in this domain are open source software (e.g. Linux) and knowledge (e.g. Wikipedia).  Within the current acco unting framework, the services provided by prosumers  and the time  they spend on developing or improving the pub lic good do not enter into GDP.   The creation  – within a public administration  – of a directorate in charge of the Sharing  Economy and all related  issues could help to bundle the efforts and deal with the different   aspects of the Sharing Economy in a target -oriented way .  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               398       Source: ING Luxembourg (2015)     Employment   The values and operational principles of the Sharing Economy place it in a realm betw een the  capitalist market and the nonprofit sector. As mentioned in the Industry Working Group report,  in the short to mid -term – forty years – tens of thousands of semi -skilled, skilled, and  professional workers will be required to build out and scale up the smart Internet of Things  infrastructure of the Third Industrial Revolution in Luxembourg. This will require a significant  retraining in the skillsets necessary to introduce a smart digital technological platform and  accompanying business models. In the  long run, the phase -in of a smart Digital Luxembourg will  ultimately lead to a highly automated capitalist market economy, operated by small  professional and supervisory workforces using advanced analytics, algorithms, and artificial  intelligence. The mat uring of this smart infrastructure will lead to a migration of employment  from an increasingly automated capitalist market to the growing social economy. While fewer  human beings will be required to produce goods and services in the market economy, machine   surrogates will play a smaller role in the nonprofit social economy for the evident reason that  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               399     deep social engagement and the amassing of social capital is an inherently human enterprise.  The social economy is a vast realm that includes education, charit ies, healthcare, child and  senior care, stewardship of the environment, cultural activity and the arts, sports and  entertainment, all of which require human -to-human engagement.   In dollar terms, the world of nonprofits is a powerful force. Nonprofit reven ues grew at a robust  rate of 41 percent —after adjusting for inflation —from 2000 to 2010, more than doubling the  growth of gross domestic product, which increased by 16.4 percent during the same period. In  2012, the nonprofit sector in the United States acc ounted for 5.5 percent of G.D.P.   The nonprofit sphere is already the fastest -growing employment sector in many of the  advanced industrial economies of the world. Aside from the millions of volunteers who freely  give of their time, millions of others are a ctively employed. In the 42 countries surveyed by the  Johns Hopkins University Center for Civil Society Studies, 56 million full -time workers are  currently employed in the nonprofit sector.   In some countries, employment in the nonprofit arena makes up mor e than 10 percent of the  workforce. In the Netherlands, nonprofits account for 15.9 percent of paid employment. In  Belgium, 13.1 percent of the workforce is in the nonprofit sector. In the United Kingdom,  nonprofit employment represents 11 percent of the w orkforce, while in Ireland it’s 10.9  percent. In the United States, nonprofit employment accounts for 9.2 percent of the workforce,  and in Canada it’s 12.3 percent.   These percentages will likely rise steadily in the coming decades as employment switches f rom  a highly automated market economy to a highly labor -intensive social economy. Students will  need to be educated for the new professional skills that come with the job opportunities  opening up in the social economy. Although a massive effort will be req uired, the human race  has shown itself capable of similar efforts in the past —particularly in the rapid shift from an  agricultural to an industrial way of life between 1890 and 1940.   Despite the dramatic growth curve in employment in the social economy, m any economists  look at it askance, with the rejoinder that the nonprofit sector is not an independent economic  force but rather largely dependent on government -procurement contracts and private  philanthropy. One could say the same about the enormous govern ment procurements,  subsidies, and incentives meted out to the private sector. But this aside, the Johns Hopkins  study of 42 countries revealed that contrary to the view of many economists, approximately 50  percent of the aggregate revenue of the nonprofit sector already comes from fees for services,  while government support accounts for only 36 percent of the revenues, and private  philanthropy for only 14 percent.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               400     By mid -Century , if not sooner, a sizeable percentage of people  employed around the world will  be in the nonprofit sector, busily engaged in advancing the social economy, and purchasing at  least some of their goods and services in a highly automated capitalist marketplace.   John Maynard Keynes’s futurist essay, writte n more than 80 years ago for his grandchildren,  envisioned a world where machines have freed up human beings from toil in the marketplace  to engage in deep cultural participation in the social economy in the pursuit of more lofty and  transcendent goals. It  might prove to be his most accurate economic forecast.   Preparing students for the opportunities and challenges that accompany the transition into a  Digital Luxembourg and a Third Industrial Revolution economy requires a fundamental  rethinking of the natu re of education. According to the Pearson survey on Education and Skills  for Life, which ranks the top performing public school systems in the world, Luxembourg is not  included among the top 40 educational systems, suggesting that Luxembourg will have to  undergo a steep transformation in its educational practic es.     Education, Elucidation and Information   The Working Group makes compelling arguments about the need for transforming the  educational experience so that youngsters obtain early experience on what it means to be  enterprising and “digitally savvy .” Transversal skills such as critical thinking and reflection,  systems thinking, networking, empowering and participation are future key factors for bringing  about positive economic and social change. In rel ation to TIR, two topics must be addressed: 1)  the identification and education of future -proof skills to meet labor market needs and 2) the  use of new technologies for knowledge transfer.   To fit the requirements of 21st Century, students should learn in a  social and participatory way.  Input from the business community and civil society should be included in school curricula.  Interdisciplinary projects linking theory and practice could enrich education and widen  student’s horizon. A crucial aspect to ensure  a high quality of education is the training of  teaching staff. Teachers need a high level of digital literacy to impart  digital knowledge and  skills.   This is well recognized by the Ministry of National Education, Child ren and Youth, in its efforts  to prep are schools and students to the challenges of the 21st Century. The aim of Luxembourg’s  schools is to form young people able to adapt to a fast changing environment. Therefore,  learning situations favoring comprehension of society and the world, individual  fulfilment , and  personal well -being must be created. Skills must be developed in four essential domains:  communication, collaboration, creativity and critical thinking.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               401     Digital(4)Education  is a new Luxembourg government ICT initiative launched in 2015. “ The  main objectives of the strategy are firstly a digital education, meaning to prepare students for a  complex and continuously changing work environment as well as for their role as citizen, and  secondly the promotion of new learning strategies and innova tive pedagogic projects using  digital technologies. The strategy is built on the following five dimensions: 1) digital citizen ,  initiating students in essential ICT -based applications like administrative procedures,  communication with authorities, e -bankin g, etc.  2) digital peer , broaching issues on the safe  and responsible use of the internet, 3) digital learner , creating the required learning  environment, 4) digital worker , teaching basic technological tools and 5) digital entrepreneur ,  offering activities to stimulate talents and encourage the students to deal with ICT tools.” (See  visual below)     Source: Digital4education, http://portal.education.lu/digital4education/   With the ubiquitous access to inexpensive smart phones, a profound transformation has been  unleashed.  Each individual with access to a smartphone or tablet  (hand -held device) essentially  has a pocket supercomputer.  This situation increases the degrees of  freedom for an individual  in having access to an essentially limitless amount of information and knowledge, but also  imposes new social responsibilities and obligations.  The responsibilities turn on taking  initiatives in pursuing one’s educational needs and recognizing that literally in their hands is the  largest open source library in the history of humankind for pursuing life -long learning.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               402     As such, the incumbent role of government is to instill in each citizen the responsibility to take  advantage of th ese digital resources, tools, and networking opportunities to pursue self motivated and directed learning that is essential for future proofing themselves in a world  fraught with sudden changes, constant uncertainties and unexpected surprises.  Becoming  digitally savvy means taking the responsibility to enhance one’s personal human capital, while  engaging and networking with peers (both locally and globally) to cultivate social, civic, and  intellectual capital.  By cultivating these new opportunities  daily , each individual ensures skill s  and competences are being cultivated for future proofing their odds of worth and insuring  against becoming a stranded asset.   The First and Second Industrial Revolutions enshrined a model of teaching designed to prepare  stude nts to be skilled industrial workers. The classroom was transformed into a microcosm of  the factory. Students were thought of as analogous to machines. They were conditioned to  follow commands, learn by repetition, and perform efficiently. The teacher was akin to a  factory foreman, handing out standardized assignments that required set answers in a given  time frame. Learning was compartmentalized into isolated silos. Education was supposed to be  useful and pragmatic. The “why” of things was less discussed t han the “how” of things. The goal  was to turn out productive employees.   The Third Industrial Revolution is altering the pedagogy of the classroom. The authoritarian,  top-down model of instruction is beginning to give way to a more collaborative learning  experience. Teachers are shifting from lecturers to facilitators. Imparting knowledge is  becoming less important than creating critical -learning skills. Students are encouraged to think  more holistically. A premium is placed on inquiry over memorization.   In the traditional industrial classroom, questioning the authority of the teacher is strictly  forbidden and sharing information and ideas among students is labeled cheating. Children  quickly learn that knowledge is power, and a valuable resource one acquire s to secure an  advantage over others upon graduation in a fie rcely competitive marketplace.   In the Digital Age, by contrast, students will come to think of knowledge as a shared experience  among a community of peers. Students learn together as a cohort in  a shared knowledge  community. The teacher acts as a guide, setting up inquiries and allowing students to work in  small -group environments. The goal is to stimulate collaborative creativity, the kind young  people experience when engaged in many of the soci al spaces of the Internet. The shift from  hierarchical power, lodged in the hands of the teacher, to lateral power, established across a  learning community, is tantamount to a revolution in pedagogy.   While the conventional classroom treated knowledge as o bjective, isolated facts, in the  collaborative classroom, knowledge is equally regarded as the collective meanings we attach to 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               403     our experiences. Students are encouraged to tear down the walls that separate academic  disciplines and to think in a more integr ated fashion. Interdisciplinary and multicultural studies  prepare students to become comfortable entertaining different perspectives and more adept at  searching out synergies between phenomena.   The idea of learning as an autonomous private experience and the notion of knowledge as an  acquisition to be treated as a form of exclusive property made sense in the First and Second  Industrial Revolution environment. In the Collaborative Age, learning is regarded as a  crowdsourcing process and knowledge is often t reated as a publically shared good, available to  all, mirroring the emerging definition of human behavior as deeply social and interactive in  nature. The shift from a more authoritarian style of learning to a more lateral learning  environment better prepar es today’s students to work, live, and flourish in tomorrow’s  collaborative economy in Luxembourg.   The new collaborative pedagogy is being applied and practiced in schools and communities  around the world. The educational models in the emerging digital er a are designed to free  students from the private space of the traditional enclosed classroom and allow them to learn  in multiple open Commons, in virtual space, the public square, and in the biosphere.   Rethinking primary, secondary, and university educati on in Luxembourg to prepare current and  future generations for employment in both the automated capitalist marketplace and the  emerging Sharing Economy will be an urgent and major priority. The Luxembourg educational  system will want to explore a range of best practices emerging in school systems around the  world, including extending the learning environment into the community with service learning  and clinical engagement, virtual learning via Skype and FaceTime in shared global classrooms,  and online learn ing with Massiv e Open Online Courses (MOOCs).   The Working Group provides a detailed summation of the myriad of challenging issues  pertinent to the emergent prosumers social modes and the Sharing Economy.  The WG outlines   the social, ethical, legal, politi cal, educational and financial questions being raised by business,  government, academia, and consumer organizations. Even a cursory glance at the research  literature already finds a prodigious number of recent publications discussing and analyzing  these ma nifold issues.  The palpable sense of urgency in raising these concerns and elevating  them to the front and center attention of lawmakers goes to the heart of the industry  disruption witnessed over the course of the past half -decade.    The digitization and  Internetization (or IoT) driving forward the TIR is going to eventually impact  every part and process of the 70 trillion euro annual global economy.  While economists  sanguinely forecast 2 to 3 percent average annual growth rates this century, implying a nearly  10 to 20 fold larger global economy, it is highly questionable whether economic growth based 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               404    on the second industrial revolution industries and institutions can be sustained without the  aggregate efficiency productivity gains catalyzed by IoT tools and technologies – especially  given the massive threats of profound economic losses and social dislocation projected to occur  with the continued rise in greenhouse gas emissions and decline of the biosphere’s  irreplaceable natural capital.    The two signif icant findings of “business -as-usual” trends; first, the level of unpriced economic  losses now being incurred worldwide, and second, the projected economic losses from a  several degree Celsius rise in global average temperature in the coming decades.   The  negative  externalities impacting the biosphere by damaging, degrading, and destroying natural capital  and ecosystem services has been calculated at $7.3 trillion  per year (US$2009), or 13% of world  GDP.345 The future cost from a several degree C rise has be en estimated at $1,240 trillion  in net  present value (US$2000).346   The first figure does not include disasters that may occur in business supply chains, and the  latter figure does not include the catastrophic consequences from any of a dozen tipping points  releasing vast levels of GHG emissions (shown in map below). With these advancing and  looming catastrophes being driven, in essence, by the Second Industrial Revolution economy,  the tremendous value associated with the accelerating and scaling of IoT-based  tools and  technologies of the TIR become imperative.    The growth of the prosumer and sharing economy made possible at large scale by IoT tools and  technologies is clearly an integral component of the TIR.  In the foreseeable future, it will  comprise an important, but still relatively modest percentage of the larger IoT -driven growth  projected to occur.  This is partly explained by the exponential growth curve of IoT infusion into  and throughout the economy, which belies the real progress of the prosumer/ sharing economy.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               406     While many or most of the sharing activities are sustainable, some lag behind in this regard.    This is perhaps the crux of concerns around prosumer and sharing economy activities: are they  as or more sustainable in all the ways we expect of the economic activities they are displacing,  as well as fulfilling all of the legal requirements also requir ed of the replaced economic  activities (e.g., safety, insured, taxes).   Given the complexity, it is often difficult to sort out the very different kinds of economic  activities emerging in the collabora tive/sharing/prosumer sphere. Industry trend analyst  Jeremiah Owyang has been categorizing and describing these rapidly expanding domains in  updated versions of what he calls the Collaborative Economy Honeycomb.  Version 3 released  in 2016 is shown on the next page.  The number of categories has nearly tripled since the  release of the first version four years ago.    An indicator of how different these categories are is the increasing number of words and  phrases being used to describe the diverse activities once captured under umbrella terms like  collaborative or  Sharing E conomy. Ride  sharing  services like Uber, for example, are more  accurately referred to as rental services, as are room -booking services offered by Air bnb and  similar “rental economy” businesses.350  Likewise, the “gig economy” is now used to describ e  the labor and wage arrangements for jobs in this “on -demand economy”.351    Sharing E conomy experts like Neal Gorenflo, co -founder of Shareable.net, provide a more blunt  contrast between local wealth creating and circulating cooperative models versus the Uber style wealth -extracting business models.   “We have an epic choice before us between platform coops and Death Star platforms, and the  time to decide is now,” he argues, pointing to Uber’s mega bet on becoming a global monopoly.  As of 2016 Uber had amass ed € 13 billion of VC investments, while soaring to a paper -based  valuation of € 61 billion.  “Uber signifies a new era in tech entrepreneurship. Its leaders express  an explicit ideology of domination and limitless, global ambition. In fact, the global tec h sector  may be one of the most powerful stateless actors on the world stage today.”352                                                                                                                                                                                        uncertain (grey) connections, but note that there are several other interconnected ti pping elements in the  climate system of the Earth that are not considered here.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               408     Cooperatives offer a sharp contrast to the conventional vertically integrated market enterprise,  allowing all individuals engaged in the sharing process to also share the revenue generated by  the activity. Platform cooperatism is more fully fleshed out by peer -to-peer (P2P) theorists,  practitioners and co -Founders of the P2P Foundation , Michel Bauwens and Vasilis Kostakis, who  illuminate important distinctions between different  economic and social forms of the  sharing/collaborative and rental/on -demand/gig economies, in the matrix below.  The two axes  highlight: 1) the tensions between centralized and distributed control of the infrastructure; and,  2) the polarity between capita l buildup or flow and Commons accumulation or circulation.     Four future scenarios for a collaborative economy     Source: Kostakis & Bauwens (2014)354   Netarchical capitalism (NC)  is defined as “centralized control of a distributed infrastructure  with an orien tation towards the accumulation of capital. Netarchical capital is that fraction of  capital which enables and empowers cooperation and P2P dynamics, but through proprietary  platforms that are under central control. While individuals will share through thes e platforms,  they have no control, governance or ownership over the design and the protocol of these  networks/platforms, which are proprietary. Typically under conditions of netarchical capitalism,                                                           354 Kostakis, Vasilis & Michel Bauwens (2014) Network Society and Future Scenarios for a Collaborative Economy ,  Palgrave Macmillan.

In  Bitcoin , for example , all the participating computers can produce the currency, thereby  disintermedi ating large centralized banks. However, the focal point remains on trading and  exchange through a currency designed for scarcity, and thus must be obtained through  competition. As another example , Kickstarter functions as a reverse market with prepaid  inve stment. Under these conditions, any Commons is a byproduct or an afterthought of the  system, and personal motivations are driven by exchange, trade and profit.”356  Resilient Communities  (RC) focus on generating community value via “relocalization and the re creation of local community. It is often based on an expectation for a future marked by severe  shortages of energy and resources, or in any case increased scarcity of energy and resources.  Initiatives like the Transition Towns, a grassroots network of comm unities, can be seen in that  context.”357  Global Commons  (GC) focus on creating sustainable abundance for all of humanity. “Though  production is distributed and therefore facilitated at the local level, the resulting micro factories are considered as essenti ally networked on a global scale, profiting from the  mutualized global cooperation both on the design of the product, and on the improvement of  the common machinery. Any distributed enterprise is seen in the context of transnational  phyles, i.e. alliances of ethical enterprises that operate in solidarity around particular  knowledge Commons. In addition, political and social mobilization, on regional, national and  transnational scale, is seen as part of the struggle for the transformation of institutions.  Participating enterprises are vehicles for the commoners to sustain global Commons as well as  their own livelihoods.”358                                                                   355 Bauwens, Michel and Vasilis Kostakis (2014) Four F uture P2P Scenarios, P2P Foundation Wiki,  http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Four_Future_P2P_Scenarios .    356 Ibid., Bauwens & Kostakis (2014).   357 Araya, Daniel.

Cooperative models are mushrooming in the  emerging Third Industrial Revolution.360 For example, Loconomics in San Francisco is a  cooperative version of TaskRabbit; Fa irmondo in Germany is a cooperative version of  Amazon.com; LaZooz in Israel is a cooperative ride -hailing and blockchain service alternative to   Uber; Swarm is a blockchain alternative to  Kickstarter; Diaspora is part of the Free Software  Support Network a nd represents a federated social media network version of Facebook and  Twitter; FairCoin is the FairCoop’s open global cooperative version of Bitcoin; the open source  platform sharetribe in Finland; the open value networks Enspiral in New Zealand and Senso rica  in Canada; and a burgeoning number of open access libraries of knowledge resources and  publications like Wikipedia, Google Scholar, Researchgate.net, Arxiv.org, Academia.edu,  SSRN.com (the Social Science Research Network), and many others.   Internet pl atform technology is increasingly being used by citizen owned and local  cooperatives. Cooperatives have a rich history of locally created value delivered locally.   Worldwide, some 2.6 million cooperatives are operating, owned by its more than one billion  members, employing a quarter billion people, and creating 2.7 trillion euros in yearly revenue; a  revenue comparable to the 5th largest economy in the world, just after Germany. Open  cooperatism, also referred to as open ethical economy, “seek s an economy w here the core  actors are co -operative entrepreneurs who co -produce commons and advance their goals  through ethical entrepreneurial coalitions or a new type of market sector comprised of  collectively oriented enterprises.

For example, more than 300 energy cooperatives were created in the Netherlands  alone between 2005 and 2013.362    Regulatory, Legal and Policy Issues   As PWC succinctly notes in their 2015 report, The Sharing Economy , “There is no question that  the regulatory, legal and tax framework needs to be fit for a new age. The right balance of  solutions needs to be built from the bottom -up, where local authorities can quickly trial and  experiment with new models. Not surprisingly, this is more easily done whe n both sides work  together. For instance, Airbnb worked with Amsterdam’s local council to pass an “Airbnb friendly law” in February of 2014 which permits residents to rent out their homes for up to 60  days a year, provided that the owner pays the relevant taxes. ”363  As a number of scholars and analysts have noted, peer -to-peer businesses are changing market  dynamics.  This raises the need for regulatory changes, as well as enforcement and policy  changes regarding competition law.  Peer -to-peer businesses simu ltaneously create new  market assets, increase the welfare of citizen consumers, spawn new job creation, add value to  assets, and contribute to economic productivity.  But in doing so, they also present regulatory  and competitive enforcement challenges.  Ho w regulators handle these challenges is tricky, and  a number of observers suggest the pursuit of outcome -focused solutions sensitive to the  diverse business models.364                                                             361 Conaty, Pat and David Bollier (2014) Toward an Open Co -Operativism, A New Social Economy Based on Open  Platforms, Co -operative Models and the Commons, A Report on a Commons Strategies Group Workshop Berlin,  Germany,  August 27 -28, 2014.   362 De Moor, Tine (2013) Homo Cooperans, Institutions for collective action and the compassionate society,  Universiteit Utrecht, August 30, 2013.   363 See: h ttps://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/publications/assets/pwc -consumer -intelligence -series -thesharing -economy.pdf   364 Fingleton, John and David Stallibrass (2015) Peer to peer businesses, regulation and competition , Mercato  Concorrenza Regole , December 3, 2015.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               412         PROPOSAL S    1 Business Model Innovation      1.1 Promote energy sharing cooperatives for each of  Luxembourg’s economic sectors –  residential, commercial, industrial, and the farming community – in pursuit of a  Luxembourg Designed 100% WWS electric powered economy . There are tens of  thousands of cooperatives operating worldwide (millions of members).  Cooperatives are  voluntary groups, open to all citizens who desire access  to a cooperative’s  services.  Cooperatives are democratic institutions overseen by their members, who render  decisions and establish policies. A cooperative's capital is  democratical ly controlled and  contributed equitably by members.   Cooperatives are autonomous, self -help entities  operated by their members. Cooperatives are focused on promoting the sustainable  development of their communities through policies adopted by their members .

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               413     cooperatives have been an important option in recent decades and especially valuable in  promoting distributed power generation. German, Danish , and Swedish shared  cooperatives have been instrumental in the large -scale expansion of wind and solar P V  systems in their nations. Expanding the use of energy cooperatives in Luxembourg is an  update of the traditional sharing economy, while also incorporating the latest in high -tech,  knowledge -driven opportunities for deriving value from the community’s ren ewable  energy resources.     2 Technical     2.1 Blockchain technology should be examined as a useful tool to track prosumer/ Sharing  Economy activities and avoid clandestine employment . The development of a core  platform , through which all transactions relative to the Sharing Economy and prosumer  activities must be included , will facilitate the task of tax authorities. Blockchain technology  could be used for registering purposes, in order to build in security in value chai ns and  record the transactions.     3 Regulatory     3.1 Sensitize and inform prosumers about legal rights and obligation in the Sharing  Economy . When consumers also become producers – prosumers – or service providers at  once, they are confronted with questions regarding product safety, consumer rights, et c.,  as well as commercial and fiscal issues in the Sharing Economy. To raise awareness on  thes e important topics, prosumers must be sensitized and informed. To this end, a  campaign should be launched, for example, in collaboration with the Chamber of  Commerce or consumer protection organizations. The centralized web -based platform  mentioned in prop osal 4.7 below and intermediation websites offering services in  Luxembourg are also appropriate partners to publicize relevant information on legal rights  and responsibilities in the Sharing Economy.     3.2 The State must ensure via legal guidelines and action t hat different business models  underlie the same regulations and different operators and service providers comply with  the same legal obligations . Anticipating and recommending suitable regulations that  remain pertinent in a rapidly and continuously changin g environment will continue to be a  substantial challenge. It is important to recognize that the Sharing Economy operates by a  different set of regulatory aspirations and requirements than the traditional capital  market.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               414       While the capitalist market is b ased on self -interest and driven by material gain, the social  Commons  is motivated by collaborative interests and driven by a deep desire to connect  with others and share. If the former promotes property rights, caveat emptor, and the  search for autonomy, the latter advances open -source innovation, transparency, and the  search for community.       What makes the Commons more relevant today than at any other time in its long history is  that we are now erecting a high -tech global technology platform whose defining  characteristics potentially optimize the very values and operational principles that ani mate  this age -old institution. The IoT is the technological “soul mate” of an emerging Sharing  Economy. The new infrastructure is configured to be distributed in nature in order to  facilitate collaboration and the search for synergies, making it an ideal t echnological  framework for advancing sharing across digitally operated global webs and networks.     The operating logic of the IoT is to optimize lateral peer production, universal access, and  inclusion, the same sensibilities that are critical to the nurtu ring and creation of social  capital in the civil society. As such, there is a need for both the traditional market capital  model and the expanding sharing model to operate together without either being  undermined.     With appropriate legislation , Luxembourg can support both consumers and businesses in  Sharing Economy activities (legal certainty is a prerequisite for sound economic  development ). The European agenda for the collaborative economy presented by the  European Commission on June 2, 2016 provides help ful guidance. The regulations would  need to cover different aspects of the Sharing Economy. The distinction between  professional actors and private persons operating only occasionally should be established  by explicit criteria and thresholds. To ensure fai r competition, professional sharing  economy activities should have to comply with the same legal obligations as market  economy businesses. This concerns , for instance , business permits, safety and security  standards or warranty deeds, as well as fiscal and  social security obligations. In addition,  regulation should be designed, to create formal employment for Sharing Economy  workers , where applicable,  to ensure a maximum of social security. It is important to  prevent the circumvention of labor law s and soci al standards.      
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               415     3.3 Codify a right of disconnection in labor law : Mobile devices have given rise to permanent  accessibility. A guaranteed disconnection right would avoid employees needing to be  available even outside working hours and prevent a communication o verload.     4 Public Policy     4.1 Set up Sharing Economy Commissioner. The Sharing Economy is an integral dimension of  the overall economy. A core aspect of the Sharing Economy is its capacity of extracting  more value from an economy’s myriad assets, resulting in  raising their aggregate efficiency  and productivity and reducing their marginal cost and ecological footprint.  Sharing cities,  regions, and nations require public authorities to play leadership roles.  It is essential to  scale up a public commitment to th e Sharing Economy vision , supported by all levels of  government from city to national, as well as the business community, and the civil society,  and backed up by the appropriate government regulations and sufficient startup capital. A  new Commissioner of P rosumer/Sharing economy will take a leading role in marshaling  locally supported initiatives designed to create sharing activities available for all the  citizenry.  Features of this Ministry include the build -out of the infrastructure essential for  physica l and digital sharing, providing Sharing Economy start -up and scale -up enterprises  with incubation and support centers, and harnessing unused and underused public  resources. The Commissioner will be tasked with the mission of developing appropriate  regulations and indicators  for the development an d expansion of the Sharing Economy in  Luxembourg .  At the same time, issues raised by citizens about the prosumer/ Sharing  Economy need addressing.  Big Data is one major issue and will even become more  important over time, and opportunities and risks must be broached.  These include  property rights on generated data, data protection, privacy and surveillance. Another  concern to monitor is the possible concentration of data in the hands of a few big  operators, and what consequences could result from this sit uation, and which proposed  actions should be developed.     4.2 The new Sharing Economy Commissioner (see 4.1 proposal) should undertake a review  and evaluation of the prospect to systematically provide an individual VAT number or an  entry in the register of commerce and companies to each citizen or resident . With this  measure , everyone would be acknowledged as a potential social entrepreneur and  prosumer. The VAT should be attached to the person, not to a specific activity, to allow  dynamic prosumption, meani ng the social entrepreneur could practice simultaneously or  over time different activities under the same VAT number. A complementary simplification 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               416     of administrative procedures would be to deposit a dossier in advance, which then would  be ready for rapid activation in case of necessity when starting an enterprise.     4.3 Document Luxembourg’s Quality of Life Indicators  Annually : Set up a commission to  determine the cluster of indicators encompassing quality of life measures. Set up a public  platform for sharing and posting these indicators (in real -time or some proximity thereof,  depending on the data gathering timeframes), as w ell as soliciting interaction, feedback  and suggestions from citizens on how to further enhance the quality of life indicators.  While much of the Sharing Economy is not counted in the GDP, sharing activities do  increase the quality of life, a sense of well -being and life satisfaction. As such, quality of  life indicators are as important to inform citizens as historical economic indicators that do  not capture or showcase such critical benefits.     4.4 Release “The Third Industrial Revolution Strategy Study” for Lu xembourg in different  languages, notably English, French, German and Portuguese . It will be crucial to engage  the whole society in the TIR transition by making Luxembourg’s Third Industrial Revolution  Strategy Study available in multiple languages.     4.5 Plan a public information and discussion campaign after the release of “The Third  Industrial Revolution Strategy Study.”  A specific campaign should aim to raise awareness  within the general public of the importance of the Sharing Economy and the involvement  of all stakeholders necessary for a successful transition into the Third Industrial Revolution.  The study on Luxembourg’s TIR strategy should be part of a broad and fundamental public  debate on the nation’s economic and societal future. To support economic tr ansition and  the associated socio -cultural shift, a general communication campaign should be  undertaken to familiarize the population and all socio -economic actors not only with  Luxembourg’s TIR strategy, objectives and motivations, but also with the gener al concept  of TIR and its holistic approach, including underlying principles like collaborative commons,  sustainability and circularity.     4.6 Analyze Sharing Economy activities in Luxembourg.  To be able to develop well -grounded  and pertinent policies, it is necessary to assess the exten t and impact of Sharing Economy  activities. In particular, its contribution to GDP and tax revenues, as well as the number  and quality of jobs generated . These and related issues will need to  be addressed in  corresponding studi es. The establishment of a specific inventory is a first step to providing  an overview of sharing activities in Luxembourg . Additional surveys on people’s  motivations  to participate or not in the S haring Economy will need to  be conducted to help 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               417     evaluate current and projected  economic, soci al and environmental impacts of the new  modes of collaboration.     4.7 Develop a web -based platform to operate Sharing Economy activities.  A digital platform  to operate Sharing Economy activities should be developed. This could be designed as a  national one -stop shop of all the things related to the Sharing Economy. First, the platform  should be used to track and measure Sharing Economy activ ities to facilitate the task of  providing essential economic statistics to the government and assessing taxes. To serve its  purpose, the use of the platform should be mandatory for every participant in the Sharing  Economy (intermediation websites, owners /  workers, sellers / buyers, providers /users,  etc.). Blockchain technology could be used as tool for registering purposes, in order to  build in security in value chains and record the transactions.  Secondly, the platform should  be used to inform all actors  of the Sharing Economy about their legal rights and  obligations. Specific information should be broadcasted for each platform’s operators,  providers and users.  Finally, the platform could be linked to the CoIN platform (see  proposal 5.1).       5 Financial     5.1 The government should take the lead in assembling a COIN platform that enables  citizens to participate in the Sharing Economy :  The Sharing Economy is as much, if not  more, about harnessing and leveraging human, social, civic, and intellectual forms of  capital, as securing sufficient financial capital. The collaborative innovation/collective  intelligence network (COIN) platform performs key edu cational, informational and  motivational services that help build the Sharing Economy.  The platform simultaneously  fosters a one -stop shop of all things related to the Sharing Economy, as well as facilitates  lively interaction among citizens already activ e in or desiring to become active in some  facet of the Sharing Economy. The COIN platform should be jointly administered by  government and a non -profit organization to share insights, activities, new apps, peer -topeer exchanges, collaborative learning spa ces, post queries and retrieve FAQs on  specialized topics. The platform provides a continuously updated inventory of Sharing  Economy activities in Luxembourg.        
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               418     6 Educational     6.1 Coding (programming) should be fully integrated into the educational curriculum from  an early age . Mastering code skills have been shown to be achievable by elementary  school children around the world.  To become adept at creating and producing  applications, as well as how to knowledgeably use apps is a valuable learning exercise. Thi s  measure could stimulate young people’s interest in ICT and related career opportunities.  ICT is identified as a key priority economic sector in the Grand Duchy. Luxembourg has  successfully developed into a global hub for information and communication tec hnologies  (ICT) and aims to position itself as a cent er of excellence in cyber security and data  protection. The sector continuously experiences high rates of economic growth and job  creation. At the same time, many companies struggle to find qualified sta ff.    6.2 Promote Digital savvy learning skills and competences by having students collaborate in  mapping inventories of community resources . One of the most evident dynamics among  digitally savvy persons is the extensive peer -to-peer learning – sharing knowled ge – that  occurs relative to an individual discerning the knowledge by just reading a book. Becoming  digitally savvy happens most rapidly through seeing -and-doing as a result of sharing and  learning. Teams raise their level of digital knowledge and know -how by swiftly circulating  tips, competencies, and numerous insights -on-the-fly.  Teams including a diverse mix of  students with different knowledge strengths or interest predispositions also enhances  peer -to-peer learning experiences; imagine a team with th e following diversities: artist,  strong code programmer, mechanical “gearhead” adept, electrical/electronic adept, math finance adept, policy wonk, communication adept.  The team’s diversity in sharing  strengths is a learning experience in itself, in addit ion to the know -how gains. Now  augment that with the reality that students with smartphones or phablets effectively have  access to pocket supercomputers capable of carrying out scores of applications.  Semester  by semester students can learn while contribu ting to their community’s open source  platform mappings of resource inventories. Detailed examples of what can be done are  freely available on the Internet.  Students can use their schools, neighborhoods, streets,  parks, streams, walkways, bikeways, street  lamps, tree canopies, gardens, food wastes,  discharges into waterways, etc. to gather data, code apps for analyzing the data, and  present insights.  With the availability of low -cost wireless smart sensor networks the  students can set up experiments, test  hypothesizes, gather data for confirming or  disproving their hypotheses, and create a dataset that can be made available open source  for other students to build upon.  These kinds of projects could be integrated with and/or  emerge from student activities at “Makerspaces ,” “Science Centre Differdange ,” and 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               419     “Scienteenslab .”  Such collaborative initiatives help promote sound entrepreneurial traits  by stimulating a proactive spirit, revealing personal talents and ambitions, fostering  creativity and originality , as well as raising consciousness and responsibility on ecologic,  social, political, and economic issues.     6.3 Review the system of performance assessment in school.  By sanctioning errors instead of  rewarding assignments done well, fundamental qualities of en trepreneurship are  marginali zed as students are neither encouraged to take risks nor supported to be creative  or develop individual ideas. To support entrepreneurship, failures must be tolerated  – a  cultural change in performance assessment is desirable, if not necessary.                                        
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               420     EXPLORING THE POTENTIAL ECONOMIC BENEFITS OF   THE THIRD INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION   INNOVATION SCENARIOS     OVERVIEW   On any given day, an office worker in Luxembourg  might “telecommute” from home rather than drive  to the office.  At the same time, a farmer may power  up a tractor to begin the harvesting of crops, while a  truck driver may be on the way to deliver a  replacement part that will allow a manufacturer to resume production. These separate work  events all share three critical elements.   The first element is that someone  undertakes  an activity  to get the job done. This is typically   referred  to as the labor  component of economic activity , or perhaps  skilled  employment.  The  second  is the use of machinery  or some  type  of equipment  that enables  the production  of goods   and services.  This item  is the result  of annual  investments  made  each  and every  year  in that  equipment,  or perhaps  in the supporting  infrastructure  that enables  all other  equipment  to be  used.  Buildings,  roads,  bridges,  pipelines,  power  plants,  and new  installations of renewable  energy technologies  are all examples  of supporting  infrastructure.  The combined  investments  in  all of that equipment  and infrastructure,  as they  accumulate  over  time,  are often  referred  to as  capital.   The third  element  is the high -quality  flow  of energy  that enables work to be done —that is, the  electricity,  natural  gas, gasoline or diesel fuel,  whether they  are provided  by conventional  fossil  fuel supplies or by renewable  energy  resources.  It is energy  in the form  of food  that animates   labor , and energy in the form  of electricity  or natural  gas that enables  capital  to carry  out the  desired  set of tasks.  Depending  on the mix and the productive  uses  of all resources  that are put  to work,  the Luxembourg economy  is able  to deliver  an assortment of  goods  and services  to  meet  the needs  of not only regional businesses  and its local  residents, but also to many other  nations throughout the world.  This so-called  work  is typically  measured  as national  income  or  gross  domestic product  (GDP).   In most  economic  development  assessments,  labor  and capital  are often  thought  to be the main   elements  that drive  economic  activity . Yet,  it is energy —the third,  and the most  often  John “Skip” Laitner (Economic and  Human Dimensions Research Associates),  TIR Consulting Group LLC    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               421     overlooked  component  of the economic  process —that may  prove  to be the more critical  driver   of economic  and social  well-being.  To extend  our example  above,  a software  engineer  cannot   develop  code  without  electricity  to power  the computer.  The truck  driver  cannot  deliver  a  replacement  part without  the diesel  fuel to power  the truck  engine.  When  optimally  sourced   and efficiently  used,  energy  can amplify  local  economic  development and spawn  a more  robust   and resilient  economy.  But equally true , the wrong  mix of those  resources,  and especially the  inefficient use of those resource s, can appreciably constrain  the vitality of a local  or national  economy.   In 201 6, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg will spend an estimated €2 billion to meet its  combined energy needs. The many payments made each day or each month will enable  residents to cool and light their homes, drive to work, listen to music or watch TV, and power  the country’s many commercial enterprises. Electricity purchases, for example, will further  enable access to the Internet, as well as filter and purify the water that is delivered to local  homes,  schools, and businesses every day.   Although the inhabitants of Luxembourg derive many important benefits as they pay their  various energy bills, there is also a significant  opportunity to save money. As we will outline  later , those energy bill savings —perhaps an average of € 250 million per year  over the next  three decades —will reduce the massive amounts of greenhouse gases and other pollutants t hat  are released into the air. According to a recent study by Stanford University, if Luxembourg  were to achie ve 100 percent renewable energy by 2050, the avoided air quality health effects  might be on the order of €3.04 billion per year. Moreover, the avoided 2050 global climate change costs from converting to 100 percent renewable energy is on the order of €3.84  billion  per year .365  There  is little  question  that the production  and use of energy  holds  great  economic  value  for  Luxembourg.  Many renewable  energy  industries  are growing  exponentially.   This is driving a  positive market throughout the global economy. But as the International Energy Agency (IEA)  underscores, there  is also a critical  need  for greater  emphasis  on energy  efficiency  as well as  a  more  diversified  energy  portfolio.  The IEA further noted  that the inefficient  conversion  of  energy  can create  a large  array  of problems  which  can weaken  or constrain  the development  of                                                           365 Mark Z.

In fact , they  suggested  that a greater   level  of energy efficiency  is one of the primary  forces  that support  meaningful  technological   progress,  and that sustained technological  progress  may  come  only  with  extensive  upgrades  in a  nation’s or region’s  overall  energy  and other resource  efficiency.  Finally, a recent study of the  EU-15, with analytical results also specific to Luxembourg, concluded that the transition to a lowcarbon and more robust economy should be done in a way that ensures both the higher  accumulation of capital and th e more productive use of energy.368 Both principles are wholly  consistent with the pillars of the Third Industrial Revolution.   While Luxembourg boasts a more energy efficient economy than the United States and the  global economy mo re generally, it still appears to waste more than 80 percent of its high  quality energy resources.  With that magnitude of ongoing energy losses each day, and also  with an over -reliance on fossil fuel resources, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg may face serio us  economic and competitive challenges should it continue with its current pattern of energy  production and consumption.369  As suggested in this assessment, systematic upgrades in the use of much more energy -efficient  technologies and productive investments in renewable energy systems can provide all of  Luxembourg’s energy needs by 2050. As also indicated, it is both technically and economically                                                           366 Nancy Campbell, Lisa Ryan, et al. (2014).

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               423     feasible to encourage such a transition.370 In short, a significant portion of the billions of euros   already spent ea ch year for energy consumption can be used in other ways to more  productively strengthen the country’s larger economy – provided local business leaders and  local policy makers choose to encourage these smarter and more productive investments.   This contribu tion to the master plan explores future economic development opportunities  available to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. More specifically, the analysis examines the  prospective economic returns  within the Luxembourg economy if households and businesses  were  to shift away from current investment patterns to pursue a more productive and cleaner  energy future. The analysis investigates the benefits that energy efficiency and renewable  energy resources can deliver to the regional economy as the basis for a revit alized economic  development. It also examines the scale of investment that will be necessary to drive those  improvements.  Lastly, the report details how a shift in spending toward clean energy could  strengthen the nation’s ability to support more incomes and jobs.   With this in mind , the next section  of this assessment provides the overall framework that  reinforces the analysis found here . A subsequent section then describes the current patterns of  economic activity and energy consumption, and explores the scale of purposeful effort and  investments that will enable Luxembourg to build up future opportunities. The last major  section  includes an overview of the methodology used to estimate the net job gains and other  economic impacts brought on by the greater diversity in the use of energy resources and, in  particular, the greater level of renewable energy and energy efficiency improvements. It then  summarizes the major economic impacts  of this specific inquiry and highlights the next three  critical steps that can ensure a more robust, resilient, and sustainable economy within the  country. The first step includes an immediate implementation of “first energy efficiency  projects” to document the scale of positive outcomes that will emerge from these first  ventures . The second step is to lay out a set of useful metrics that can assist in the evaluation of  the benefits which follow from these and future projects. The last effort, logically building on  the two previous steps, is to develop a policy -relevant database t hat can both track the major  projects and policy initiatives and inform the nation about all of the net positive outcomes                                                           370 In a very  thoughtful  interview, San Diego  Gas & Electric  Senior Vice -President of Power  Supply,  James Avery   highlighted emerging problems associated with  the rapid adoption of photovoltaic energy systems.  He noted: we  haven’ t begun  “to think of the technologies that  will evolve”  out of the digitalization  of the grid. H e said,  the  “wealth  of opportunities far exceeds the programs  and applications that exist  today.” See,   http://www.utilitydive.com/news/sdge -if-youre -not-prepared -for-the-change -its-too-late/366979/ . For the Grand  Duchy of Luxembourg, these opportunit ies include both domestically -produced resources as well as cost -effective  imported energy services that depend on an array of renewable energy technologies.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               424     beyond an energy -led investment strategy. In addition, a short narrative  offers further details  about the economic model used to compl ete this assessment for the Luxembourg economy.     FRAMEWORK OF THE ECONOMIC ASSESSMENT   Properly assessing the economic impacts of different policy opportunities for the Grand Duchy  of Luxembourg —what we call in this document a Third Industrial Revolution I nnovation  Scenario —is a function of perspective, data, and logic. The perspective is an understanding  of  how an economy can become much more productive and robust in the use of capital, materials,  and especially energy. The data  presented throughout the va rious sections of the master plan  reflect  the economic underpinnings of Luxembourg as well as the specific costs and benefits  associated with the development and deployment of new energy service technologies,  information and communication systems , transpor t and logistics,  Internet of Things  deployment, and other critical infrastructure  improvements .   Rethinking the Underpinnings of the Luxembourg Economy   Luxembourg sits at a moment in history in which doing nothing is not an option. Indeed, the  country finds itself at the crossroads of both challenges and opportunities. On the one hand,  compared to past historical experience, the regional economy shows a lagging growth in  performance. Over the period 1985 -2000, for example, the amount of Gros s Domestic Product  (GDP) supported by each job in the Luxembourg economy —a useful proxy of economy -wide  productivity —grew at a very healthy rate of a 2.6 percent annually. With a solid growth in both  population and jobs, that meant the economy grew, on ave rage, by nearly 6 percent per year  over that 15 -year period. Over the next 15 -year period, however, the economy -wide gain in  prod uctivity was essentially flat and even a bit smaller in 2015 compared to 2000. Yet, a  continuing increase in both population an d jobs enabled the national economy to expand at a  2.8 percent rate per year (STATEC 2016). While significantly lower than earlier trends, this is still  a healthy economic growth rate, especially when compared to the collective performance of  the more than  30 countries of the Organization of Economic Development and Cooperation  (OECD), which , taken as a whole , expanded by only 1.7 percent annually over that same  period.371                                                           371 There is a tendency among many policy analysts to assume a reasonable and smooth projection of recent  historical trends and assume such patterns will continue into the mid - to long -term terms projections. At the same  time, however, there is a worrisome tr end that suggests a significant weakening of future GDP. See, for example,  OECD (2016), GDP long -term forecast (indicator). doi: 10.1787/d927bc18 -en (Accessed on 30 July 2016). This latest  data set suggests less than 2 percent growth over the period 2015 t hrough 2060. Such projections greatly 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               425     At the same time, the key driver of the Luxembourg expansion in the last 15 years appea rs  more to be the influx of inhabitants and workers rather than the significant increase in overall  productivity.372 And whereas standard economic projections suggest a continuing 3.0 percent  annual growth through 2050 (the last year explored in the TIR Innovation Scenario time  horizon), there are other forecasts and indications which suggest the possibility of a weaker and  less robust level of economic activity —perhaps lowering Luxembourg’s GDP to 2.0 percent or  lower. This appears to be the case for the OEC D region as a whole (OECD Long -Term Projections  2014).   Admittedly this last projection is a bit dated, but it is consistent with other indicators all of  which point to a lagging rate in the more productive use of capital, energy and other resources.  This,  in turn, may hamper a more vigorous future economic activity. And if we also fold in the  many steps that need to be taken to address climate change and other environmental  concerns, one can quickly imagine that failure to explore these possible outcomes m ay leave  Luxembourg, the OECD as a whole, and all of the developing nations, at risk. In this context, the  Third Industrial Revolution Master Plan can be thought of in two different ways. First, “TIR -like  thinking” can become an insurance plan which can en able Luxembourg to maintain a healthy  economy; and second, the TIR Innovation Scenario can provide insights into the kind of new  economic platform which can ensure both a resilient and sustainable economy over a longer  period of time.   Notwithstanding some early warning signs of a weaker second industrial revolution economy,  the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg has a number of promising opportunities that can point the  way to the more productive use of its many resources; and to do so in ways that build a more  robu st, resilient, and sustainable economy. As described in the previous sections of the master  plan, the hundreds of different opportunities range from changes in transportation land -use  patterns to large -scale improvements in Luxembourg’s commercial and indu strial enterprises.                                                                                                                                                                                      underscore the need to encourage a greater and more productive investment in TIR -related infrastructure as well  as both social and economic capital.   372 In general, the growth of an economy can be thought of as the growt h in the resident population or an  expansion of the workforce times the productivity of that population or workforce. For example, if the number of  inhabitants grew by 1 percent per year as it did between 2000 and 2015, and if the productivity of the popul ation  similarly grew by 1.8 percent annually, then the economy can be said to have expanded by about 2.8 percent over  those years (which it did).  We can also do a similar calculation comparing the increase of the labor market times  the productivity of tho se workers and it would show a similar result.  But the larger productivity of the  Luxembourg economy is also a function of the quality and quality of the capital invested, the skills of the labor  force, and we also suggest, the efficient use of resources —whether materials, production assets, and especially  energy. In many ways it is this focus on energy and resource productivity that underpins the ideas of the Third  Industrial Revolution Innovation Scenario.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               426     They also include the buildup of information and communication technologies – the shift to 5G  – that enable the many existing and new buildings , as well as other structures , to serve as  interactive nodes that elevate and optimize overall economic performance of the Luxembourg  economy.  How might these options generate a net positive return compared to the standard  business -as-usual assumptions? Table 1  below highlights at least seven key drivers that can  suppor t a more vibrant  economy as a result of any given TIR Innovation Scenario and resulting  Master Plan.   The Catalysts to a More Robust Luxembourg Economy   The first key driver is referred to as the intensity shift. Just as some energy resources are more  carbo n-intensive than others —for example natural gas produces less carbon  dioxide per  megajoule of energy than does coal while renewable energy resources produce no such  emissions compared to any form of fossil fuels —different sectors of the Luxembourg economy  have different income and employment intensities.  More to the point, a ny activity or  investment that fosters the development of a more productive infrastructure, that upgrades  existing buildings, or that leads to the erect ion of new facilities —all of this  done in a way that  also reduces both energy consumption and energy costs —must necessarily create a shift in  spending from capital -intensive energy sectors  to other sectors that are generally more labor intensive. The scale of that shift depends on a numbe r of economic factors such as the level of  imported goods and services which enables that buildout. It also depends on the magnitude of  net savings. Moreover, to the extent those investments encourage larger energy savings and  other productivity benefits, they will facilitate a greater level of capital deepening that  facilitates a more dynamic use of capital  (see Figure 1 on the following page).   Table 1. The Seven Major Drivers of Employment and Economic Benefits     Source:  As described and discussed in the text of the manuscript.   Figure 1 – based on 2013 data from STATEC – shows that energy services supported 4.0 jobs per  million euros of value -added, compared to 4.9 in information and communication services, 13. 7  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               427     in manufa cturing, 18.3 in construction and 9.8 on average throughout the economy.373 Hence,  for every one million euros of value -added services generated through greater cost -effective  energy efficiency improvements across the economy, Luxembourg will gain a net incr ease of 5.8  new jobs. That is, instead of supporting 4 jobs for energy purchases, the economy will be  supporting an average of 9.8 jobs as the energy bill savings are re -spent for other goods and  services in Luxembourg. This is a net gain of 5.8 jobs econo my-wide for each million euros of a  cost-effective transition away from conventional energy purchases.   Figure 1. Luxembourg Job Intensities for Key Economic Sectors     Source:  STATEC Economic Accounts 2013 (Accessed March 2016).   A second category of prospective benefits results from the build -up of regional production of  goods and service.  While Luxembourg boasts  a large export activity, it also now imports an  estimated €81.5 billion in 2014 to feed its supply chain of goods and services. This is up nearly  three times the level of imports recorded in the year 2000. Moreover, while Luxembourg  extracts 32 percent of value -added from its total economic output, the United Stat es by  comparison pulls about 58 percent value from its total output. To the extent that a TIR master  plan increases the cost -effective local production capacity for goods and services , Luxembourg                                                            373 This information has been provided by STATEC over the past 10 months. While STATEC has released later data  since the beginning of this exercise, the changes are relatively minor in scope, and to maintain consistency with the  efforts in other sections of t he master plan, we continue to reference the initial data for 2013, 2014, and 2015 as  originally reported.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               428     will increase both the resilience and vitality of the nation al economy.   As a specific example,  Luxembourg now imports an estimated 97 percent of its total energy requirements. In the  different energy scenarios characterized in the Energy section of the master plan, the most  cost-effective future energy scenario is  the one that increases the local production of electricity  energy to 70 percent within Luxembourg.   Using a thought experiment , we can imagine how building up greater local capacity and energy  supply from 3 percent to 70 percent can increase the robustnes s of the Luxembourg economy.   For example, we can use a multiplier formula of [1 / (1 – 0.03)] to suggest a base economic  multiplier of 1. 03 for each euro spent by businesses and consumers  for their overall energy  needs . But if the TIR master plan moves th e local purchase coefficient from 3  percent  to a s  much as 7 0 percent, as suggested , then the base multiplier for energy increases to 3.33 .  In  other words, instead of a €100 consumer purchase for average energy needs that initially might  support €1 03 in re gional activity, under the TIR master plan it would support more like € 333,  without incurring other additional costs to the economy.  This is clearly a  cost-effective  improvement in well -being without any significant  shift in the level of imports.374  A third  area of opportunity is the likely positive impacts of greater resource and energy  efficiencies on both energy and non -energy unit costs .  Hence, even while Luxembourg can  benefit from cost -effective reductions in energy and other resources, the remaining resource  requirements consumption will benefit from lower total cost.  For example, as suggested in  Table 4, rather than an anticipated cost of €1,330 per kilowatt of a rooftop photovoltaic system  in 2015, an expanded market with economies of scales and scope is anticipated to drive the  costs down to as low as €660 per kilowatt. In this scenario, a greatly expanded market can drive  further material and design innovations that can lower other costs as well. A related fourth area  of benefit is the prospective of greater productivity which can expand economic opportunity  even given the same level of resource consumption.  As an example here , Luxembourg’ s GDP in  2014 was an estimated €49.4 billion. Had the larger productivity of the nation’s economy been  just 0.5 percent higher over the period 2000 through 2014, Luxembourg’s GDP would have  been €3.6 billion larger. Again , checking Figure 1 on the jobs per  million Euro, a €3.6 billion gain  in that higher productivity would have led to higher employment of about 35,000 jobs (all else                                                           374 This example is intended to show only the relative impacts of increasing the local production of Luxembourg’s  energy needs. There are other intera ctions that will affect, either up or down, the actual net impacts of these  change d purchase patterns. Among these other drivers are the actual mix of energy resources that are produced  locally, the amount of capital borrowed from Luxembourg versus Europea n or other investors, the scale of home grown ancillary services necessary to support local production, and the magnitude of local wages versus outside  employment or contractor support services.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               429     being equal). In effect, € 3.6 billion is 3,600 million times 9.8 jobs per million Euro which equals  35,000 more jobs.   A fourth  and fifth set of impacts include managing the disruption in the availability of energy  and other resources while also minimizing the unexpected effects of price volatilities.  As the  demand for goods and services is reduced in Luxembourg, the EU -28 and th e global market  more generally, compared to the desired or necessary levels of jobs and incomes, and  especially the need for imported resources is reduced, the Luxembourg markets will enjoy  reduced exposure and therefore a greater certainty in the availabi lity of resources. Finally, the  seventh major driver of greater employment and economic benefits that are likely to follow  from the TIR Innovation Scenarios is the continuous learning and encouragement which will  catalyze greater innovations, whether the d evelopment and deployment of new general  purpose technologies, or the innovative changes in business models that can satisfy social,  economic, and environmental needs within the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.   Figure 2, immediately below, provides a conceptual framework that helps pull the TIR Master  Plan and Innovation Scenario into a useful perspective. While we cannot know at this time  either the scale of the stimulus, the productive impact of the many positive collaborations that  will be necessary, or the pr ecise outcomes that might result from such innovations, we can  offer a positive general explanation of how multiple benefits are likely to emerge through the  TIR Master Planning Process.   Figure 2. Conceptual Framework for Evaluating TIR Innovation Scenario s    Source:  John A. “Skip” Laitner (May 2016).   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               430     Given their very hectic and busy work and travel schedules, many business and political leaders  understandably do not have the time to think through how the economy is operating across the  larger dimensions of climate and energy policy.  And the assumption might typically be made  that Luxembourg is on what is called a production frontier at point “a” in the Figure 2 diagram  above. Given the current market structures, te chnologies and social needs, any change to  satisfy a demand for greater efficiencies, or for the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions,  must likely result in a downward shift to the right on this graphic illustration.  Basically ,  Luxembourg might achieve so me mix of isolated productivity improvements, and there might  be some reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, but it must surely come at the cost of a  reduction in incomes and GDP.  Yet the TIR Innovation Scenario envision s a revitalized thinking,  together with a set of programs, policies and incentives that may initially drive the economy  down to point “b”. Yet, such a shift may also create a productive transition that can lift the  economy to point “c.” The result might be an improvement in energy efficienc ies (as well as the  more productive use of resources more generally) even as the economy remains at a relatively  stable level of GDP.   At some point, however, the various energy and non -energy benefits that result from an array  of incentives and policy init iatives can boost the performance of the economy to a higher than  expected level of performance. Although not drawn to scale in Figure 2, the migration from  point “a” to the eventual point “d” might represent a 30 percent reduction in energy  requirements p er unit of GDP together. The net energy savings  together with a transition to a  renewable energy system  might, in turn, stimulate net gains in jobs and GDP (as we shall see  when we turn our attention to Tables 6 and 7 later in this section of the master pl an). Equally  critical, the TIR Innovation Scenario can become a way to catalyze the seventh benefit of such  master plans —an enhanced push of the production frontier so that future technologies and  markets are encouraged, developed and implemented to the lo ng-term benefit of the  economy.375                                                           375 It is true that a one or two percent absolute improvement o ver any long -term forecast may seem a very small  benefit. In that regard, the roughly €2 billion net gain in GDP suggested in this assessment, compared to a  reference case projection of more than €100 billion, may seem less than appealing. Yet, equally imp ortant is  understanding that the “movement to” and the “outward movement of” the production frontier can provide a  sustainable basis to ensure a 3 percent growth in GDP rather than the prospect of a lagging growth rate of 2  percent growth rate. Indeed, tha t may be among the more important outcomes of the TIR master plan.  For  instance, the mere subtraction of a 1 percent from a 3 percent growth rate can mean an economy that is 30  percent smaller by 2050. The OECD is sufficiently concerned about lagging prod uctivity worldwide, including both  Luxembourg and the United States, that it released a special study on this topic. See, The Future of Productivity ,  OECD Publishing, Paris, 2015. http://dx.doi.org /10.1787/9789264248533 -en.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               431     Because this idea is central to the advancements envisioned by the TIR master plans, Figure 3  that follows provides yet another glimpse of the potential economy -wide benefits which are  likely to result from a lower cost of energy services.  As we look forward to information  provided in Table 2, Luxembourg appears to have an aggregate annual energy bill of about   €2,100 million (reflecting data from the annual accounts for the year 2015). Looking even  further ahead at Table 6,  we find that the TIR Innovation Scenario (described more fully below),  over the period 2016 through 2050, might generate lower annual energy costs of €1,68 0  million. This results in an initial energy bill savings of about €420 million.    At the same time, to enable the savings requires that Luxembourg create a series of programs,  policies, and incentives which might average about €25 million per year.376 It is these initiatives  that, in turn, will drive the requisite large -scale of investmen ts which are amortized over time  as one might pay for a new home or building. Since the renewable energy technology costs are  part of the average annual energy supply expenditures, it is only the annualized energy  efficiency investments that further bump u p the cost to an estimated €145 million (also  reflecting average annual payments for those relevant investments over time). All of this means  that, although gross savings might be €420 million each year on average, paying for the  additional energy efficien cy investments over time, as well as for the annual cost of programs  and policies, reduces the gross savings of €420 million to a net savings of €250 million. The first  result in exploring the costs of energy services is a lower €1,850 million total cost p er year.                                                               376 This figure reflects expenditures within the public, private, and non -profit sectors to educate, train, market,  promote and evaluate the relevant programs and policies which will be necessary to elevate the performance of  the Luxembourg economy.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               432     Figure 3. The Average Annual Payments for  Energy Services, 20 16 through 2050     Source:  John A. “Skip” Laitner ( September 2016).   As beneficial as this outcome appears to be, it is merely the result of a lower total cost of  energy -related resources. We can also account for other social, economic, health, and  environmental costs that will also impact Luxembourg. Again recalling the country -specific  impacts from the Stanford University study noted earlier,377 if Luxembourg were to achi eve a  100 percent renewable energy economy, the combined avoided air quality health effects and  global climate -change impacts might approach €7 billion in further savings by 2050. This does not  include further GDP and employment benefits that are likely to  accrue from the more productive  pattern of infrastructure investments, energy efficiency upgrades, as well as the deployment of  large -scale renewable energy systems.    Here we might imagine changes like the transportation land -use patterns , the buildup of   information and communication technologies  and a multitude of other infrastructure changes   which underpin the Communication Internet, the Renewable E nergy Internet, and the  Transportation and L ogistics Internet , as well as  the various buildings and other structures that  will be transformed into IoT  nodes  to optimize overall economic performance of the                                                           377 Referencing Jacobson, Delucchi et al. (2016) .   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               433     Luxembourg economy.  Such an outcome then becomes an opportunity for a mix of more  productive investments to reduce the total cost of energy services so that  any remaining net  costs are substantially smaller than a business -as-usual assumption.  The important element in  all of this is that , if Luxembourg is to mainta in a robust economy, there must be  some  combination of greater connectivity and interoperabilit y coupled with new resource and  material efficiencies to reduce the real cost of energy services in each successive year, from  today through the year 2050. The scale of the opportunity is significantly greater than  traditional economic models might otherwi se indicate.   For example, there have been five major published studies in the past few years by  the  American Council for an Energy -Efficient Economy (ACEEE), Cisco , General Electric, McKinsey,  and AT Kearney, all speaking to the enormous potential in terms of increased efficiencies  productivity, new business models, and employment opportunities brought on by the shift to  an Internet of Things smart economy. The 2014  assessment by ACEEE concluded that  accelerated investments in ICT -enabled networks could lead to productivity benefits that would  create a $79 billion energy bill savings in the United States, even as the economy expanded by  as much as $600 billion.378 Cisco systems forecasts that by 2022, the Internet of Everything will  generate $14.4 trillion in cost savings and revenue.379  A 2015 McKinsey report entitled, "The  Internet of Things: Mapping the Value Beyond the Hype," suggests that the build out and scale  up of an Internet of Things infrastructure will have a 'value potential' of between $3.9 trillion to  $11.1 trillion per year by 2025.380 A General Electric study concludes that the efficiency gains  and productivity advances made possible by a smart industrial I nternet could resound across  virtually every economic sector by 2025, impacting “approximately one half of the global  economy.”381 A 2016 AT Kearney study entitled, "The Internet of Things: A New Path to  European Prosperity," says that "over the next 10 year s, the market for IoT solutions will be  worth EUR 80 billion, and the potential value for the EU28 economy could reach EUR 1 trillion."  The report goes on to say that the increase in productivity alone could exceed EUR 430 billion in                                                           378 John A. “Skip” Laitner Matthew T.

However, AT Kearney is quick to add that the increased capabilities brought on by  the digitalization of the infrastructure will "increase exponentially when connected objects are  coordinated."   What is common to all of these reports, as well as our own study for Luxem bourg, is that these  "potential  scenarios ” become quantifiable when applying a new set of metrics tailored to the  build out and scale up of the interoperable Third Ind ustrial Revolution general purpose  technology platform. As the ACEEE study commented, “t he data now generally collected do not  track either energy efficiency or productivity  improvements driven specifically by the Internet  or by smart appliances and ICT -enabled  networks. ” Hence , the importance of developing new  metrics and new analytical techniques to evaluate and highlight future opportunities.   The moment the digital infrastructure evolves, real -time data, based on the metrics employed,  will begin to prov ide a valuable dataset on the gain in aggregate efficiencies and productivity  and the reduction in ecological footprint and marginal cost that can guide future investment  decisions. A s the infrastructure becomes increasingly interoperative, creating a mult itude of  cross -sector synergies —just as was the case during the First an d Second Industrial Revolution — the dataset will become increasingly robust and provide increasingly accurate information from  which to make future decisions on the continued build out and scale up of the digital  ecosystem .     COMPARING THE REFERENCE CASE   AND THE TIR INNOVATION SCENARIOS   Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Royal Dutch/Shell  developed a technique known as  ‘‘scenario planning.’’ Rather than attempting to forecast a precise estimate of the global  business environment, the intent was to create a series of narratives —the so -called Rivers of Oil   scenarios —to help Shell’s management anticipate the eventuality  (if not the timing ) of future  oil cris es. The scenario building proved to be an effective tool. Armed with foresight, and with                                                           382 Thomas Kratzert, Michael Broquist, Hervé Collignon, and Julian Vincent. 2016.

To  begin that comparison, Table 2 summarizes key reference case energy and economic variables  over the period 2015 through 2050 for the benchmark years 2015, 2017, 2020, 2030, 2040 and  2050.   Table  2. Luxembourg  Reference Case Projection for Key Energy and Economic Variables     Source:  STATEC data /projections with results from the Fraunhofer Institute KomMod Model (July 2016).   The base year, or starting point, of this analytical exercise is 2015. The analysis assumes the  year 2017 is the first active investment in TIR -related investments. The four decadal years of  2020, 2030, 2040 and 2050 provide further data and key results. According to 2015 statistics  available from STATEC, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg had an estimated 576,192 inhabitants  within its borders. Current projections show a population growth rate of 1.73 percent per year.  This means that the population will nearly  double to 1,050,315 persons by 2050.  That large  increase in the number of inhabitants is expected to drive GDP further, from just under €40  billion in 2015 to a significantly larger economy of €113 billion by 2050, an annual growth rate  of 3.04 percent o ver that time horizon (with both values expressed in re al 2000 Euros rather  than nominal terms).384 At the same time, building on energy consumption patterns reported                                                           383 The development of the Shell scenarios was led by Pierre Wack, an economist, who was then the head of the  business environment division of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group planning department from 1971 to 1981. For a  deeper review of these early successful eff orts in scenario planning, see: Wack, Pierre. 1985. Scenarios: Uncharted  Waters Ahead. Harvard Business Review . No. 85516. September -October, pages 72 -89.  384 Since the results from the TIR Innovation Scenarios were first developed, STATEC updated key projec tions  highlighted in Table 2. Population in 2050 was projected to be 1,057,798 —a 0.71% increase shown Table 2.  GDP  was reported to be 0.07% higher. These changes are so very small that, rather than spend further time and effort  to update all such results,  the decision was made to continue with the July 2016 outcomes. Consistent with the  philosophy of Stanford University’s Energy Modeling Forum, we are modeling for insights rather than precision —or  in this case, evaluating reasonable differences between ref erence case assumptions as we explore prospective  benefits of the TIR Innovation Scenario for Luxembourg.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               436     by the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE (located in Freiburg, Germany), to tal  energy consumption is estimated to be 25,419 Gigawatt -hours (GWh) in 2015. Because of  various energy policies and programs now in place, together with expected market trends,385  the overall energy efficiency of the Luxembourg economy in the reference cas e is expected to  approach 3 percent per year which will offset any significant growth in total energy  consumption. This is a significant rate of improvement, compared to, for example, the one  percent rate of improvement seen globally over the last decade o r so. The end result is that  Luxembourg’s total reference case energy demands in 2050 are anticipated to be nearly  identical to those in 2015, at about 25,545 GWh.386  As prices increase slightly (in real 2015  Euros ) through 2050, the reference case projecti on suggests that total energy expenditures will  increase from just under €2 billion in 2015 to just short of €2.2 billion by 2050.   At this point there are several questions that can be asked, including: (1) how much more  energy efficiency improvements are possible; (2) how much of the remaining energy demands  can be met by an array of renewable energy technologies (whether wind, solar photovoltaics,  solar heating, and biomass resources); and 3) how much might all of this cost?  In such a case it  is often he lpful to begin with a thought experiment to provide a working estimate of  magnitudes.  Table 3 below highlights this first approximation to begin to answer these three  questions.   In collaboration with the Ministry of the Economy and others within STATEC, t he Fraunhofer  Institute laid out what is called the Ambitious Energy Efficiency (AEE) scenario, or what we call  here the “TIR Innovation Scenarios.”387 That assessment determined that it would make                                                                                                                                                                                      Sweeney. 1982. Modeling for Insights, Not Numbers: The Experiences of the Energy Modeling Fo rum. Omega: The  International Journal of Management Science  10(5): 449 -462.   385 For example, see the discussion of Energy Efficiency Trends and Policies in Luxembourg (January 2016), at  http://www.odyssee -mure.eu/publications/national -reports/energy -efficiency -luxembourg.pdf   386 There are several items that might be worth commenting on.  First, a GWh is generally a unit of measure for  electricity consumptio n. Nonetheless, all forms of energy —whether natural gas, coal, oil, conventional electricity,  or even renewable energy technologies —can be expressed in terms of their equivalent heat value, and then  converted to an equivalent GWh total.  For example, 1 GWh  is the equivalent to 86.04 tons of oil (toe). For this  exercise, the Fraunhofer Institute has provided the GWh as the metric of use in this discussion.  The 25,419 GWH  of total energy demand in 2015 is a sum of total electricity demand in Luxembourg of 5, 895 GWh, various demands  for heat at 13,322 GWh, and local personal transportation energy requirements of 6,202 GWh equivalent. These  totals do not consider the need for fuel tourism, transit, and aviation.   387 See, for example, the discussion and Table 2 re sults in the Energy section of the master plan which summarizes  the final energy demand for 2015 and the projections for 2050. The discussion that follows here integrates the  findings of Fraunhofer ISE presented to the Luxembourg Working Group on 5 July 20 16, entitled ‘Results of Energy  System Modelling of Luxembourg’ and the energy sub -report, ‘Results of Modelling the Energy System of  Luxembourg.’ Fraunhofer ISE, 27 July 2016.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               437     economic sense to reduce overall energy demand from 25,545 G Wh in 2050 down to 16,977  GWh at that time —a one -third reduction compared to the reference case forecast.  As shown in  Table 3 that follows, this implies an energy efficiency savings of 8,568 GWh, with the remaining  energy needs provided through a mix of r enewable energy technologies. Equally important,  Fraunhofer included a number of sensitivity cases to determine an optimal level of renewables  that might be provided within Luxembourg. The analysis indicated that Luxembourg  did have  the technical potential  for an energy system in which 100 percent of the country’s demand is  generated within the nation ’s borders.  At the same time, however, the more cost -effective  scenario is one in which only 70  percent  is locally generated and 30  percent  is imported from  neighboring countries. The results are summarized in Figures 4 and 5  in the Energy section of  the Strategy Study.     Table 3. Suggested Investment Scale for the TIR Innovation Scenario in Luxembourg     Source:   A thought experiment drawn from various sources as described in the text.  The assumption is that only 70  percent of renewable energy generation will be deployed in Luxembourg.     But the question remains, how much investment might we imagine will be requir ed to achieve  the energy efficiency and the renewable energy targets of the overall TIR Innovation Scenario?  Again turning to Table 3, there are two working estimates of investment per GWh that can  provide an initial calculation. The first suggests an aver age energy efficiency cost of  €600,000/GWh over the 35 -year time horizon. If, for example, we assume a 3 percent interest  payment over a 20 -year period, that would suggest an average annual cost of 4 € cents (€ct) per  kilowatt -hour (kWh). By comparison, in dustry now pays about 8 €ct/kWh  for the electricity that  it uses, while households pay about twice that much.  On the other hand, the cost of  photovoltaic energy systems —used here as a proxy for the full array of potentially available  renewable energy technologies —might be about twice t hat magnitude, or €1,300,000/GWh.  Following the previous logic for energy efficiency, the amortized cost might run about 9  €ct/kWh . These investment estimates are in general agreement with the published literature,  and in consultation with members on the T IR Core Consulting Team.    GWh DemandAssumed  Investment  €/GWhTotal Investment Billion € Starting Energy Demand 2050 25,545 Suggested Efficiency Gains by 2050 8,568 600,000 5.1 Renewable Energy Technologies by 2050 16,977 1,300,000 15.4 Total Energy-Related Capital Costs - - 20.6
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               438     Multiplying the two cost estimates by the Fraunhofer benchmark energy savings or production  by 2050 indicates a preliminary investment requirement on the order of €20.6 billion over the  35-year period of analysis.  At this point we can now begin to compare the working example in  Table 3 with published statistics made available through the Fraunhofer Institute’s KomMod  modelling system as shown in Table 4 that follows.388 In sum, Table 4 highlights 15 different  technologies that can be used to provide a secure and reliable energy source for a variety of  home and business needs.  By way of explaining the table, rooftop solar suggests a 2015  investment cost of €1,330 per kilowatt of rooftop photovoltaic capacity in 2015. As previously  mentioned in the Table 1 discussion, with anticipated improvements in materials and design,  Fraunhofer suggests costs will decline to about €660/kilowatt. This change over time may be  sufficient to reduce delivered costs of electricity from about €ct 10/kWh  in 2015 to perhaps €ct  5/kWh by 2050. These costs also include annual operating and maintenance systems necessary  to maintain a reliable and safe operation.389    Table 4. Technology Cost Assumptions for TIR Innovation Scenario     Source:  Fraunhofer Institute  ISE (2016). Note: items with asterisks are costs per kWh.                                                            388 See also the extended discussion of energy resource costs in the Energy secti on of this master plan and the  investment costs and returns from the Luxembourg Sustainable Energy Finance Program, also found in this master  plan.   389 It is worth noting that the costs of photovoltaics, as suggested elsewhere in this master plan, may alread y be  approaching 55 US cents per watt by 2017, or about €492 per kilowatt (at current rates of currency conversion).  Hence, the results reported here are likely conservative. That is, the costs are higher than what we might expect  from the future market. Net economic benefits reported here may be understated.   2015 2030 2050 wood boilder 20 510 533 565 solid biomass chp plant 30 1,428 1,493 1,583 biogas chp plant 12.5 421 440 466 liquid biofuels chp plant 12.5 421 440 467 rooftop photovoltaics 25 1,330 921 660 free field photovoltaics 25 1,209 837 600 solar heat 25 1,286 777 396 wind power plant 20 999 1,044 1,107 heat pump air-water 20 1,243 1,243 1,243 heat pump brine-water 20 1,492 1,492 1,492 heatpump geothermal probe 20 1,467 1,467 1,467 hydro station 60 3,300 3,452 3,505 power to heat 20 238 238 238 Li-Ion battery* 15 1,558 1,006 666 thermal storage* 20 102 106 113Investment Cost (€2015/kW) TechnologyLifetime  (Years)
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               439     How all of the changes in demand and supply add up over time, together with their associated  costs to deliver the necessary energy services are summarized in Table 5, which shows three  key variable s for two different scenarios. First, it highlights key cost variables for what is labeled  as REFERENCE 2050, or the main Reference Case assumptions out to the year 2050.  The four  primary indicator variables are: (1) the life cycle cost of heat energy (LC OE) in €ct per kWh; (2)  the LCOE for electricity (also in €ct per kWh); (3) the LCOE for transport fuels (again in €ct per  kWh); and finally (4) the total energy costs in the year 2050 expressed in € Million per year. All  costs reflect constant € 2015 value s. The same results are then shown for the TIR Innovation  Scenario, also for the year 2050.   Table 5. Unit and Annual Cost Assumptions for TIR Innovation Scenario     Source:  Adapted from Fraunhofer Institute ISE (2016).   Three things stand out from the information provided in Table 5.  First, the unit energy costs for  heat, electricity and transportation fuels are somewhat more expensive in the TIR 2050  Innovation Scenario compared to the 2050 Reference Case Scenario. Seco nd, from the  standpoint of the larger demand for energy services, however, this is still a positive result. The  reason is that total energy costs in TIR 2050 are significantly lower compared to the Reference  Case projections. The positive result is made po ssible by the savings from the other investments  in generating a more energy -efficient economy. The Reference Case 2050 total energy costs are  listed as €2,190 million in Table 5, so that even with the higher unit supply costs (that is, the  higher €ct per kWh), the total energy costs of the TIR Innovation Scenario are significantly less  at €1,369 million.390  Finally, and although not shown in Table 5, the optimal TIR Innovation  Scenario, in which 70 percent of renewable resources are produced within Luxembou rg,  provide unit energy costs that are about 20 percent less expensive than if 100 percent of the  renewables are generated within the region.  The Table 5 results then show the reduced total  cost from less expensive energy efficiency improvements as well a s an optimal level of in -region  production of renewable energy generation.                                                            390 A minor note: The Reference Case 2050 results for the total energy costs, listed here at €2,190 million, differ  from Fraunhofer’s original cost of €2,007 million (all in 2015 real Euros). The reason is a small price increase that  increases slowly over time compared to the prior assumption of a steady price from 2015 through 2050.  However,  neither assumption changes the overall outcome of this analysis.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               440     Table 6 that follows provides a more complete “scenario context .” The Reference Case  assumptions include a current combination of fossil fuel energies alongside a small amount of  renewable energies. By contrast, the TIR Innovation Scenario includes a vast increase in energy  efficiencies alongside an ambitious shift to renewable energies to allow Luxembourg to achieve  100 percent renewable energy capacity, again, 70 percent of which w ill be generated  domestically, and the other 30 percent transmitted into the country from surrounding nations  by 2050.   Table  6. Illustrative Outcomes for Luxembourg’s TIR Innovation Scenario     Source:  STATEC , OECD data/  projections  and DEEPER model simulations .  To better  orient the reader, first note the row that is labeled TIR Innovation Energy Demand,  and then note the initial energy demand of 25,419 GWh listed in the year 2015. This is also  referenced two rows down under the list ing of Existing Energy Supply .  As the energy efficiency  investments kick in, beginning in 2017, and the Increments of New Renewable Energy   (effectively, the array of renewable energy technologies listed in Table 4) begin to penetrate  the market, the need for the Existing Energy Supply slowly drops to near 0 GWh by 2050.

Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               441         A Side Note on the Job Creation Potential in Luxembourg   Table 1 in this section offered a useful context to understand the seven different economic and  employment drivers that underpin the transition to the Third Industrial Revolution. At this  point, however, it is useful to draw on estimates from other segment s in the master plan to  offer concrete examples of how TIR -related investments might positively impact future  employment gains. For example, Germany’s vast experience in retrofitting buildings provides a  useful insight for the job creating potential in Lux embourg as it embarks on its own nationwide  retrofitting project. To date, as reported in the Buildings section of the master plan, 342,000  apartments have been retrofitted, creating or saving more than 141,000 jobs in Germany.   Looking across more of the European economy, a 2011 analysis by the Buildings Performance  Institute Europe (BPIE) suggested a potential energy savings in EU buildings ranging from 32 to  68 percent by 2050, depending on the scope and scale of upgrade investments. The investment  cost might range from €343 to €937 billion, with a net consumer bill savings from €160 to €381  billion over the period 2012 through 2050.  The combination of investments and net energy bill  savings might drive a net annual employment gain of 500,000 to 1.1 mill ion jobs (see, Table 1 in  the Buildings section of the master plan).   The Stanford/UC Berkeley study noted that with a combination of energy efficiency  improvements and the deployment of solar and wind renewable energy resources, by 2050  Luxembourg could me et nearly 100 percent of its energy needs by renewable energies alone.  For example, of that total renewable energy supply, 67 percent of Luxembourg’s energy needs  could be met by utility -scale Solar PV systems, again by 2050.  That would require an upfront   capital cost of 20.5 billion Euros (in 2016€) with a levelized cost of electricity estimated at only  €cents 9 per kilowatt -hour.  That would lead to roughly 7,500 construction jobs to build  capacity, and 11,100 permanent operations jobs to operate and mai ntain the system in  Luxembourg. This highlights an additional advantage of producing renewable energy locally  compared to the current situation where Luxembourg imports fossil fuels.   As noted in the Smart Economy portion of the master plan, an increase in product usage means  extracting higher value from the resources. This leads to an increase in aggregate efficiency and  productivity. A recent assessment by Accenture projected that savings in materials, recycling,  and restoration, will likely exceed $4.5 tr illion by 2030 in the global economy while increasing  productivity, reducing fixed and marginal costs, creating net new jobs, and lowering ecological  footprint.  An estimated €1 billion of circular economy activities already occur in Luxembourg,  employing upwards of 15,000 citizens, mainly in industry, as well as in buildings and  construction, and retailing. The potential value in advancing Luxembourg’s circularity practices  by yet another €1 billion in net -material cost savings per year would generate seve ral thousand  more jobs within 36 months. This would require scaling circular activities throughout the  automotive, construction, financial, logistics, manufacturing, and RDI sectors.    
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               442     The drop to near zero GWh of the existing energy resources leads to t he positive outcome of  zero energy -related carbon emissions by 2050.391 This result is driven by the scaled -up set of  investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies. Looking ahead to Table 7,  the overall energy -related annual investments in the TIR Innovation scenario are made up of  energy efficiency improvements, on the one hand, and renewable energy options, on the other  hand. The volume of these investments is just under 100 million euros in 2017, growing slowly  to an estimated 500 mill ion by 2030. From there the investments decline somewhat to 377  million by 2050, with an average annual investment of 420 million in energy -related  technologies.392  The reason for that very small reduction in annual investments in later years is  because the  less costly energy efficiency improvements begin to pick up more market share and  penetration in 2030. This requires, in turn, a smaller contribution from the slightly more expensive investments in the renewable energy resources —even as those fixed costs also  decline as described below.   Over the full period 2017 through 2050, the cumulative mix of annual energy efficiency and  renewable energy investments will add up to just over €14 billion (in 2015 constant euros). This  is substantially less than the €20.6 billion reflected in the Table 3 thought experiment. Part of  the reason is that, according to Fraunhofer’s KomMod model, and as reviewed in the paragraph  following Table 3, the renewable energy costs are expected to decline over time compared to  the example characterized in Table 3. At the same time, however, there will be other  information and infrastructure upgrades which might roughly triple the magnitude of  investments suggested for the energy -related improvements alone. While the information does   not exist in sufficient detail to provide a precise estimate of necessary investments for the non energy infrastructure improvements, drawing from a variety of sources suggests a cumulative  TIR-related investment that is on the order of €46 billion. This is the equivalent of about one  year’s GDP invested to upgrade the infrastructure, equipment and appliances in Luxembourg  over the next several decades. Still, the lack of better data on these related costs, as they might  be estimated for the Grand Duchy, i s why we continue to emphasize the need for new metrics  applicable to the build out of the Third Industrial Revolution digital infrastructure in order to  facilitate future assessments.                                                             391 Although not emphasized as part of this assessment, by focusing on the economic perspective to generate  significant cost -effective investments in both energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies, the economy  clearly benefits from lower overall cos ts. At the same time, as that mix of clean energy technologies penetrates the  market, the need for fossil -fuel resources slowly (and cost -effectively) declines to zero. This means that the  Luxembourg economy will have zero energy -related carbon emissions b y 2050. Hence, the more productive  pattern of energy efficiency and other clean energy investments produces a significant benefit for global climate  change that should exceed the anticipated target of the December 2015 Paris accord.   392 For added clarity, th e energy efficiency improvements average €105 million per year while the renewable  energy deployments average €305 million per year.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               443     Also embedded in Table 6 are data that show two key highlights. The fi rst is a small net cost in  the initial year of the TIR innovation scenario. Assuming the initiatives begin in the year 2017,  initial policy costs and capital outlays create activity for which there are no immediate net  savings. Hence, the TIR Innovation Ne t Energy Savings are a negative €14  million in that year.  But the second key highlight reveals a significant reduction in Luxembourg’s overall cost of  energy services in subsequent years. Rather than a suggested annual cost of €2,190 million in  the Referen ce Case, for example, the TIR Innovation Scenario shows a much smaller energy bill  of €1,369 million —an annual savings of €821 million by 2050.  There is one minor caution that  was previously -discussed and that needs to be raised once again. The €821 milli on cost  reduction represents what might be termed gross energy savings. A more useful metric is the  net energy bill savings in that same year. This mirrors the costs of related programs and  policies, as well as the amortized payments made for the energy ef ficiency upgrades which  equals €336 million. Therefore, the net savings in 2050 is €485 million. This point is very similar  to the discussion surrounding Figure 3 which tracks the range of average annual expenditures  over the period 2016 through 2050.  In that period, the average annual energy savings of €420  million is actually closer to €250 million when the added program costs together with the  amortized energy efficiency upgrades are also included.   At the same time, however, there are large reductions in the cost of externalities highlighted by  the Stanford University report, which if included in the assessment here, would further extend  the benefits of the TIR Innovation Scenario. In addition, there are the larger productivity returns  that come with th e evolving interoperability of the Internet of Things TIR infrastructure, as  noted by the ACEEE, Cisco , General Electric, McKinsey, and AT Kearney  studies. The productivity  benefits would also increase the robustness and vigor of the Luxembourg economy.  A lthough  these gains are generally referenced among the last four economic drivers identified in Table 1,  they are not included in this particular assessment because of the paucity of impact -specific  data that are collected and maintained to evaluate these outcomes. This point further  underscores the importance of generating new metrics and building new analytical techniques  that can enable policy makers and businesses to more effectively evaluate future decision making as suggested in the discussion that fo llows.      
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               444     REVIEWING THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF   THE TIR INNOVATION SCENARIO   The foundation for the overall economic assessment that has been completed as part of the  Luxembourg Third Industrial Revolution master planning process is the proprietary modeling  system known as the Dynamic Energy Efficiency Policy Evaluation Routine (DEEPER). The model,  developed by John A. “Skip” Laitner, is a compa ct 15 -sector dynamic input -output model of a  given regional or national economy.393  The model is essentially a recipe that shows how  different sectors of the economy are expected to buy and sell to each other , and how they  might, in turn, be affected by cha nged investment and spending patterns . Setting up that recipe  is a first step in exploring the future job creation opportunities and other macroeconomic  impacts as the Luxembourg economy shift s from the Second Industrial Revolution to the higher  level of p erformance that is likely to be associated with the Third Industrial Revolution  (TIR) .  Although it has only recently been updated to reflect the economic dynamics specific to  Luxembourg, the DEEPER model has a 26 -year history of development and application. The  model has been utilized, for example, to assess the net employment impacts of proposed  automobile fuel economy standards within the United States.394 More often, it is typically  employed to evaluate the macroeconomic impacts of a variety of energy efficiency, renewable  energy, and climate policies at the regional, state, and national level. As a recent  illustration , it  was used in 2013 to assess the potential outcomes and economic benefits of the Third  Industrial in Nord -Pas de Calais, an ind ustrial region of four million people in northern  France.395   The timeframe of the model for evaluating energy efficiency and renewable energy technology  policies and investments is 1990 through 2050.  The period 1990 (or earlier as needed) through  2015 prov ides a useful historical perspective. The period 2016 through 2050 provides an                                                           393 There is nothing particularly special about this number of sectors.  The problem is to provide sufficient detail to  show key negative and positive impacts while maintaining a model of manageable size.  Expanding or reducing the  number of sectors will requ ire some minor programming changes and adjustments to handle the larger matrix.   394 Gearing Up: Smart Standards Create Good Jobs Building Cleaner Cars , by Chris Busch, John Laitner, Rob  McCulloch, and Ivana Stosic, Washington, DC: BlueGreen Alliance, 2012.

It then compare s that  changed spending pattern to the employment and value -added impacts assumed within the  standard reference case. Figure 4, immediately below, provides a diagrammatic v iew of the  DEEPER Modeling System as it was reflect ed within  the dynamics of the Luxembourg economy.   Figure 4. The DEEPER Modeling System     Although DEEPER includes a representation of both energy consumption and production as well  energy -related carbon di oxide (CO 2) emissions, the analysis for Luxembourg focus ed on the  changes in larger resource productivity as well as improvements in infrastructure, information  and communication technologies, and especially greater circularity within the economy of the  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. These prospective changes in infrastructure and technologies are  characterized elsewhere in the Strategy Study. The economic assessment described here is a  high level summary of these changes.396 The model outcomes are driven by the demands for  energy services, economic goods and alternative investment patterns as they are shaped by  changes in policies and prices.  As noted in the previous section, the model built on an assumed  reference case over the period 201 5 through 2050 as reflected in a variety of data published by  the Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques (STATEC), the European  Commission, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and the  International  Energy Agency, among other organizations and universities.                                                              396 See, for example, both the assumptions and scenarios described in the section on Energy that follows this  Exploration of t he Economic Benefits. Of particular note is the data found in Table 2 in the Energy section which  informs the set of changes referenced in Table 6 of this section. While Table 6 highlights total energy consumption  for the respective scenarios, Table 2 in t he Energy Section highlights each of the building, industry, and  transportation subtotals which are reflected here.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               446     Trends that Shape the Reference Case   Using a number of these national economic projections, and with preliminary inputs from  STATEC, as well as key high -level reference case data, Table s 2 and 6  (shown previously)  provide  a useful starting point in the assessment through the year 2050. As highlighted in the results  reported in Table 7 that follows, we can compare these reference case assumptions with  expected results that might emerge from one or  more TIR Innovation Scenarios .  There are  two key trends that have not been highlighted in the table s above but underscore the  emerging positive impact of the TIR Innovation Scenario. The first is the growth in economy wide productivity as measured by GDP value per job (in million real 2005 Euros).  Compared to  a historical 1.4 percent annual growth rate over the years 1985 to 2010 (not shown here),  recent projections for per capita GDP suggest a growth that is less than half that historical pace.  In the 10 -year period 2010 to 2020, reflecting the economic volatility of the previous 10 -year  period, the rate of productivity of the Luxembourg economy is projected to fall to 0.58 percent  per year. The good news is that the trend increases slightly to 1.28 perce nt annually over the  30-year period 2020 through 2050. It is this trend, among other metrics, the prompted the  OECD to release its 2015 report on the Future of Productivity  (see footnote 11 for a further  discussion and citation).   At the same time, there is  a second trend that hints  at a less resilient future economy  – in this  case because of a declining rate of investment . Recent projections indicate that the rate of  Gross Fixed Capital Formation —in effect the growth of annual investments in Luxembourg’s  total fixed assets —is also decreasing compared to historical performance.397  Data from the  OECD show that over the same 25 -year period 1985 to 2010, it averaged 20.4 percent of GDP  (not shown here).                                                                    397 Fixed assets include land improvements (fences, ditches, drains, and so on); plant, machinery, and equipment  purchases; and the construct ion of roads, railways, and the like, including schools, offices, hospitals, private  residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings. Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to  meet temporary or unexpected fluctuations in production or  sales, and "work in progress."

At the same time, OECD data are not usefully and immediately available for this long -term historical  and future comparison. Yet, the larger trends continue to provide critical insights.   
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               448     Figure 6. Luxembourg’s Rate of Gross Capital Formation     Source:  OECD Historical and Long -term Baseline Projections (May 2016).   As suggested in the OECD data , the annual rate is projected to actually decrease each year,  dropping to a low of 14.6 percent by 2050.  Both Figures 5 and 6 above provide a more detailed  look at these key trends.   Given this backdrop, as well as the discussion around Figures 5 and 6, a n important question to  be explored within the Third Industrial Revolution planning process is whether Luxembourg’s  economy can remain both vigorous and sustainable as per capita GDP and the rate of Gross  Capital Formation are shown to possibly decrease. T he question that might be helpful to pose is  what mix of purposeful effort and more productive investments might ensure the development  of a more robust economy.   Part of the answer has already been addressed in the discussion  surrounding Table 6. But it a lso lies in the short comment that opened this narrative, and that  builds on an extended set of comments about the lagging rate of big energy efficiency and  productivity improvements. We will now return to that discussion in greater detail.      
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               449     Understandin g the TIR Innovation Scenario   A working analysis based on data published by the International Energy Agency (IEA) suggest s  that Luxembourg may convert less than 20 percent of the available energy into useful work.399   This is a better rate of conversion than  for the United States (14.4 percent), OECD nations (16.2  percent) and for the world as a whole (13.5 percent). Yet that still means the Luxembourg  economy wastes more than 80 percent of the energy consumed in the economic process.  However, the  Table 2 data previously referenced  suggests that  Luxembourg’s energy intensity is  projected to decline at about 3 percent per year through 2050. This is close to twice Europe’s  1.7 percent rate of improvement over the last decade or so.400 The TIR Innovation Scenario  explores the mix of investments that will accelerate the rate of energy efficiency improvements   to about 4 percent per year.   The TIR Innovation Scenario also advances the movement toward an energy production system  that is anchored by an array of profitable  renewable energy technologies.401 If evaluated  properly, a higher level of energy efficiency  investments , together with the development of  cost-effective renewable energy systems, is likely to result in a downward pressure on the total  cost of ene rgy services which , in turn,  provide s a further net gain for the larger economy.    Table 7 integrates the innovation scenario cost data found in Table 6 and elsewhere. It then lays  out the larger economic benefits that might be expected to emerge with the TIR Innovation  Scenario , especially as business and policy leaders think through which  initiatives most usefully  provide the und erpinnings of a TIR Master Plan.                                                               399 Here useful work refers to the consumption  of energy as it enable s the transformation of materials and other  resources into the desired mix of goods and services within the Luxembourg economy.   400 With the global agreement to contend with climate change now taking effect on 4 November 2016 after  support from the European Union, the EU is likely to at least double its rate of energy efficiency improvement  closer to where Luxembourg is already going as a reference case. See http://www.reuters.com/article/us climatechange -paris -idUSKCN12523G.   401 Given the scant data about the macroeconomic impacts of reducing the cost burden of externalities, as well as  the scant data on the prospective benefits of an increased interoperability among Luxembourg sectors and  structures, the TIR Innovation Scenario necessarily provides only a working assessment of these benefits.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               450     Table 7. Energy Costs and Impacts from the TIR Innovation Scenario     Source:  Output from the DEEPER Modeling Systems as described in text manuscript that follows.   Three things might be noticed immediately in Table 7. First, the very first row of the table  stresses the importance of supplemental  gains in the overall energy efficien cy of the  Luxembourg economy. In effect, the total energy demands in an already energy -efficient  reference case are cost -effectively reduced by yet another 33 percent  in the period 2017 to  2050. Second, there is a coincidence between the rounded average an nual energy bill savings of  419.7 million euros and the annual average investments of 421.4 million euros. Both figures are  rounded off to €420 million as they are reported in Figure 3, Table 6, and Table 7 above.   Finally, a lthough not shown in this  table  or Table 6 , the presumed investment and the more  productive TIR build -out of the Luxembourg economy will clearly increase the scale of gross  capital fixed formation. Because of the greater level of cost savings, this will stimulate both a  more vigorous le vel of GDP per job  as well as a slight increase in the total number of jobs .    The end result of the TIR Innovation Scenario is an economy that, by 2050, expands  employment by abou t five percent more than otherwise anticipated. There is a net gain of  energ y-driven employment —an annual average of 4,300 net jobs over the 33 -year period  ending in 2050. In effect, these jobs are made possible by the extensive upgrade of  Luxembourg’s energy -related infrastructure. Such jobs are further complemented by an  additio nal 5,300 net jobs made possible annually by the non -energy productivity benefits that  will be stimulated by an energy -led productivity improvement. Finally, there is a working  estimate of about 13,800 average annual net jobs from other TIR Infrastructure investments  and transitions, whether in blockchain technologies, transportation/logistics, or greater  circularity and waste reduction within the production process.  Total national employment,  then, is estimated to escalate to just under 24,000 net average  jobs per year. If the resulting net  gain of 24,000 net jobs seems like an overly small benefit, it is because Luxembourg —despite  its open and dynamic economy —is a rather small nation. Another way to look at these job  Economic Impact Metric 2017 2020 2030 2040 2050Annual  Average 2016-2050 Efficiency Gain Savings from RefCase 1% 5% 15% 25% 33% n/a Policy, Program, Transaction Costs Million Euros 2015 8 16 33 24 19 25 Energy-Related Technology Investments Million Euros 2015 97 221 500 432 377 420 Net Energy Bill Savings Million Euros 2015 -14 52 197 350 485 250 Energy Bill Savings Employment  Net Jobs 1,100 2,500 5,200 4,400 3,700 4,300 Productivity Employment Net Jobs 200 800 3,200 7,100 13,700 5,300 Other TIR Infrastructure Employment Net Jobs 1,800 4,700 12,000 16,500 25,100 13,800 Total TIR Innovation Employment Benefits Net Jobs 3,100 8,000 20,400 28,000 42,500 23,400 Net GDP Impacts Million Real Euros 100 300 1,000 1,700 2,900 1,300
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               451     estimates is to imagine what might hap pen if the leadership of Luxembourg scaled to an  equivalent success within the entirety of the European population. In that case, a three percent  increase in current employment would imply a net gain of about 5 million jobs within the EU.   Immediate Next St eps  Although Table 7 provides useful insights into the benefits of the TIR -related investment  scenario , we have already highlighted three additional elements which should be brought  forward into any future discussion of possible outcomes. The initial element is an immediate  large -scale investment in cost -effective upgrades of the nation’s building stock. The  intent here  is two -fold. The first is to send a signal about the imperative of a more energy -efficient and a  more productive economy. Building upgrades are among the best understood of those near term opportunities. The review of investment opportunities in the Finance section of the  master plan provides a variety of self-funding options for Luxembourg buildings, including both  rooftop solar energy and energy efficiency upgrades . See, for example , the background  discussion of Table 1 in the Finance section  of the master plan which implies  a reasonably  profitable €5.8 billion investment in the Luxembourg building stock over the next ten years or  so.   The immediate lessons and insights from the first wave of infrastructure upgrades will help  shape a second wa ve of activity around developing a more circular economy and a digitally driven transportation and logistics infrastructure. The second intent of this initiative is to  provide the means for collecting project data to underpin a new set of metrics. Both the  data  and the resulting metrics can guide next steps and aid in the assessment of how such projects  might contribute to the larger social, economic, and environmental well -being of Luxembourg — beyond the initial energy -related investments and returns.    It is critical, then, to develop a policy database and new analytical techniques that can inform  the nation about the potential for more positive outcomes beyond an energy -led investment  strategy. While standard economic models and policy assessment tools hav e generally been  able to track and evaluate many of the Second Industrial Revolution economic trends, they are  not equipped to fully explore the potential outcomes of TIR -like innovation scenarios.   The working groups and TIR Consulting Group agreed that i t was essential to establish a new set  of metrics to allow Luxembourg to begin tracking real -time data at the onset of deployment of  the Third Industrial Revolution infrastructure.  The data would provide the necessary  information for documenting immediate project returns and for assessing future aggregate  efficiencies, productivity gains, reduction s in material and carbon footprints  and marginal costs 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               452     brought on by the interconnectivity of the digital platform.402  These metrics are in addition to  documenting  the more traditional metrics, including reductions in energy consumption and  greenhouse gas emissions as well as positive changes in jobs, investments, total factor  productivity and GDP. As Luxembourg tracks this data in real -time, it will be able to make   critical projections on future social, economic and environmental well -being, based on the  experience and insights gained at each step of the deployment. A particular focus might be  documenting the full costs and benefits of an interoperational digital infrastructure.    When businesses can plug into an increasingly matured digital infrastructure comprised of the  digitalized Communication Internet,  digitalized Renewable Energy Internet, and digitalized  Transportation and Logistics Internet, atop an Interne t of Things platform, they will be able to  develop and use near -zero marginal cost renewable energy in every single conversion at each  stage of their value chains. This will facilitate the smart managing, powering, and moving of  economic activity. The leap  in aggregate efficiency and productivity , and reduction in material  and carbon footprints  and marginal cost brought on by the increasing integration and  interoperab ility of the digital Third Industrial Revolution infrastructure , marks both a qualitative  and quantitative leap in the economic performance of industries across Luxembourg.    The active tracking of Third Industrial Revolution metrics – again, including aggregate efficiency,  productivity, reduction s in material and carbon footprints , and marginal cost – will enable the  Grand Duchy of Luxembourg to make appropriate adjustments so that the goals are more likely  achieved over the successive years. The value of this second step can be seen by again  reviewing the macroeconomic returns highlighted in Tab le 7. The benefits are clearly positive  but they yield on only a first indication of the larger potential gains that might accrue to  Luxembourg. Among prospective changes that are not fully captured in this assessment are the  very real emergence of new mar kets catalyzed by new fintech models, new digital technologies,  new smart industries, and greater circularity.403 Other effects include the buildup of greater  local capacity to supply more of Luxembourg’s goods and services. A more informative  assessment can  be provided by continually updating the collected Big Data as the Third                                                           402 The current national accounts for Luxembourg now enable the development of what is called here the “material  and carbon footprints. ” At the same time, however, as new metrics are developed , and with new data that can be  tracked and maintained, a complementary “ecological footprint” can be eventually developed to fit within what  economists call factor production or economic analysis.  This may become a useful metric to better document the  full range of social, economic, and environmental outcomes that are made possible by different TIR Innovation  Scenarios.   403 The reader is encouraged to review the appropriate sections of the master plan to better understand how these  new industries and new mar kets are likely to drive major changes in the structure and the productivity of the  Luxembourg economy.  
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               453     Industrial Revolution infrastructure is deployed and made increasingly interoperable in  subsequent years.     A SHORT NARRATIVE ON THE DEEPER MODELING SYSTEM AS A  POLICY ASSESSMENT TOOL   Although the DEEPER Model is not a general equilibrium model as the LuxGEM model now  being developed by STATEC, it does provide sufficient accounting detail to match import adjusted changes in investments and expenditures within one sector of the economy and  balance them against changes in other sectors.404 More to the point of this exercise , it can  specifically explore the energy and related non-energy productivity benefits from what is now  characterized as a TIR Innovation Scenario —especially as it is transformed into a pro -active  Third Industrial Revolution Master Plan .   One critical assumption that underpins the core result of the DEEPER analysis is that any  productive investment  or spending —whether in energy efficiency, renewable energy, and/or a  more dynamic  infrastructure that pays for itself over a reasonably short period of time —will  generate a net reduction in the cost of energy services (as well as a lower cost of other resources  which are needed to maintain the material well -being of the Luxemb ourg economy). That net  reduction of energy and resource expenditures can then be spent for the purchase of other  goods and services.  In other words, as we noted in the discussion surrounding Figure 1, the  redirecting of €1 million in value -added spending away from energy suggests there may be  roughly a net gain of about 5.8 jobs. Depending on the many sectoral interactions, as well as  the complete assessment of the many effects summarized and discussed in Table 1 of this  assessment, the net gain in jobs  may widen or close as the changed pattern of spending works  its way through the model, and as changes in labor productivity changes the number of jobs  needed in each sector over a period of time.405                                                           404 When both equilibrium and dynamic input -output models use the same technology, investment, and cost  assumptions, both sets of models should generate r easonably comparable set of outcomes. For a diagnostic  assessment of this conclusion, see, “Tripling the Nation’s Clean Energy Technologies: A Case Study in Evaluating the  Performance of Energy Policy Models,” Donald A. Hanson and John A. “Skip” Laitner,  Proceedings of the 2005  ACEEE Summer Study on Energy Efficiency in Industry , American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy,  Washington, DC, July 2005.   405 Note that unlike many policy models, DEEPER also captures trends in labor productivity. That means the  number of jobs needed per million dollars of revenue will decline over time. For example, if we assume a 1.5  percent labor productivity improvement over  the 36 -year period from 2014 through 2050, 16 jobs supported by 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               454     Once the mix of positive and negative changes in spending and  investments has been  established for the Third Industrial Revolution Innovation Scenarios, the net spending changes  in each year of the model are converted into sector -specific changes in final demand. Then ,  following the pattern highlighted in the diagra m of the DEEPER Modeling System, the full array  of changes will drive a dynamic input -output analysis according to the following predictive  model:   X = (I -A)-1 * Y  where:   X = total industry output by a given sector of the economy   I = an identity matrix consisting of a series of 0’s and 1’s in a row and column format for each  sector (with the 1’s organized along the diagonal of the matrix)   A = the matrix of production coefficients for each row and column within the matrix (in effect,  how each column buys products from other sectors and how each row sells products to all  other sectors)   Y = final demand, which is a column of net changes in spending by each sector as that spending  pattern is affected by the policy case assumptions (changes in energy prices, e nergy  consumption, investments, etc.)   This set of relationships can also be interpreted as   ∆X = (I -A)-1 * ∆Y.   This reads, a change in total sector output equals the expression (I -A)-1 times a change in final  demand for each sector.406  Employment quantities are adjusted annually according to  exogenous assumptions about labor productivity.  From a more operational standpoint, the  macroeconomic module of the DEEPER Model traces how each set of changes in spending will  work or ripple its way through the regional  economy in each year of the assessment period.   The end result is a net change in jobs, income, and GDP (or value -added).   For a review of how an Input --Output framework might be integrated into other kinds of  modeling activities, see Hanson and Laitner (2 009). While the DEEPER Model is not an                                                                                                                                                                                      spending of 1 million Euros today may support only 9.4 jobs by the year 2050. The calculation is 16 /1.015(2050 -2014)  = 9.4 jobs (in rounded terms).   406 Perhaps one way to understand the notati on (I -A)-1 is to think of this as the positive or negative impact  multiplier depending on whether the change in spending is positive or negative for a given sector within a given  year.

In 1998 Skip was awarded EPA's Gold Medal for his work with a team of economists to evaluate  the impact of different strategies that might assist in the implementation of smart and more  productive climate policies.  In 2003 the US Combined Heat and Power As sociation gave him an  award to acknowledge his contributions to the policy development of that industry.  In 2004 his  paper, “How Far Energy Efficiency?” catalyzed new research into the proper characterization of  efficiency as a long -term economic developm ent resource.      Author of more than 320 reports,  journal articles, and book chapters, Skip has 45 years of involvement in the environmental,  energy and economic policy arenas.    His expertise includes benefit -cost assessments, behavioral assessments, re source costs and  constraints, and the net employment and macroeconomic impacts of energy and climate policy  scenarios. His most immediate research focuses on two areas. The first area builds on the work  of Robert U. Ayres and examines the links between ene rgy inefficiency and a productive  economy.  In a book chapter published in 2014, Skip provides a time series dataset that  suggests the United States may be only 14 percent energy -efficient, and that it is this level of  inefficiency which may constrain the future development of a more robust economy. The  second area explores the ways that nations, communities and the energy industry can maximize  the economic opportunity of productivity -led investments while minimizing the risk of rising  energy prices and dis ruptive energy supplies.

Michael TOTTEN   Since the 1973 Arab oil embargo and price shocks, and after graduating with Honors from Yale  University as a cross -disciplinary scholar, Michael P. Totten has dedicated his professional life to  promoting innovative market strategies and governance policies  that catalyze a solar powered  economy comprised of highly energy and resource efficient buildings, industries and  transportation sectors.    In the 1980s he pioneered comprehensive federal legislation, the Global Warming prevention  Act (popularly known as the U.S. Productivity Enhancement and Export Competitiveness Act)  which focused on accruing multi -trillion dollar savings opportunities through end -use efficiency  gains.  He also spearheaded the first Internet collaboration innovation network connecting  state regulatory utility commissioners, for sharing methodologies focused on delivering utility  services at the lowest lifecycle cost and risk via end -use efficiency gains and distributed  generation.   In the 1990s Totten founded and headed the Center for Rene wable Energy and Sustainable  Technology (CREST), set up to harness the emerging global Internet communication and multi media software tools for spurring best -in-play market practices and governance policies  fostering zero -emission economic growth while ac cruing mega -scale monetary savings and  biosphere benefits. CREST pioneered production and distribution of CD -based multimedia  learning and decision -making software, migrated to the Internet when web tools emerged.  By  the late 1990s it was one of the large st Internet sites in traffic and accessible resources on  energy efficiency and renewable energy. These several decades of innovative advocacy  garnered Totten the Lewis Mumford Prize in 1999, given by Architects, Designers and Planners  for Social Responsibi lity.  For the past dozen years Totten served as the Chief Advisor on Climate and Clean Tech at the  global non -profit group, Conservation International.  His cross -disciplinary initiatives focused on  engaging scores of global corporations and national gover nments in getting them to adopt  leadership practices and positions for achieving zero -net emissions.  This was practically  achieved by implementing portfolios of risk -minimizing, benefits -generating actions in 
Third Industrial Revolution Consulting Group               470     operations and supply networks.  Among his acc omplishments included catalyzing Walmart’s  Sustainability initiative in 2004, beginning with assessing the ecological impacts, or “biosphere  footprint”, of their operations and supply chain.   Totten’s more than 1500 presentations, articles, workshops and se minars over the past 40  years have illustrated and emphasized how Internet -based collaboration innovation networks  (COINs) can leverage valuable insights from actual achievements worldwide, at far less cost and  much faster speeds. In 2012 he launched the C OIN initiative, ASSETs (Apps for Spurring Solar  and Efficiency Tech -knowledge), to catalyze zero -net emission cities largely achieved by self motivated citizens in their cities, companies, and campuses.
