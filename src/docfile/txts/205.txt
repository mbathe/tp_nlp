   1 Artificial Intelligence: the global landscape of ethics guidelines    Anna Jobin a, Marcello Ienca a, Effy Vayena a*    a Health Ethics & Policy Lab, ETH Zurich, 8092 Zurich, Switzerland  * Corresponding author: effy.vayena@hest.ethz.ch    Preprint version  © The authors 2019       ABSTRACT In the last five years, private companies, research institutions as well as public sector organisations have issued principles and guidelines for ethical AI, yet there is debate about both what constitutes “ethical AI” and which ethical requirements, technical standards and best practices are needed for its realization. To investigate whether a global agreement on these questions is emerging, we mapped and analyzed the current corpus of principles and guidelines on ethical AI. Our results reveal a global convergence emerging around five ethical principles (transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy), with substantive divergence in relation to how these principles are interpreted; why they are deemed important; what issue, domain or actors they pertain to; and how they should be implemented. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating guideline-development efforts with substantive ethical analysis and adequate implementation strategies.
    2 MAIN ARTICLE Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI), or the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks normally requiring human intelligence, is widely heralded as an ongoing “revolution” transforming science and society altogether1,2. While approaches to AI such as machine learning, deep learning and artificial neural networks are reshaping data processing and analysis3, autonomous and semi-autonomous systems are being increasingly used in a variety of sectors including healthcare, transportation and the production chain4. In light of its powerful transformative force and profound impact across various societal domains, AI has sparked ample debate about the principles and values that should guide its development and use5,6. Fears that AI might jeopardize jobs for human workers7, be misused by malevolent actors8, elude accountability or inadvertently disseminate bias and thereby undermine fairness9 have been at the forefront of the recent scientific literature and media coverage. Several studies have discussed the topic of ethical AI10–13, notably in meta-assessments14–16 or in relation to systemic risks17,18 and unintended negative consequences like algorithmic bias or discrimination19–21.  National and international organisations have responded to these societal fears by developing ad hoc expert committees on AI, often commissioned with the drafting of policy documents. These include the High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence appointed by the European Commission, the expert group on AI in Society of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Advisory Council on the Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data in Singapore, and the select committee on Artificial Intelligence of the United Kingdom (UK) House of Lords. As part of their institutional appointments, these committees have produced or are reportedly producing reports and guidance documents on AI. Similar efforts are taking place in the private sector, especially among corporations who rely on AI for their business. In 2018 alone, companies such as Google and SAP have publicly released AI guidelines and principles. Declarations and recommendations have also been issued by professional associations and non-profit organisations such as the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM), Access Now and Amnesty International. The intense efforts of such a diverse set of stakeholders in issuing AI principles and policies demonstrate not only the need for ethical guidance, but also the 
    3 strong interest of these stakeholders to shape the ethics of AI in ways that meet their respective priorities16. Notably, the private sector’s involvement in the AI-ethics arena has been called into question for potentially using such high-level soft-policy as a portmanteau to either render a social problem technical16 or to eschew regulation altogether22. Beyond the composition of the groups that have produced ethical guidance on AI, the content of this guidance itself is of interest. Are these various groups converging on what ethical AI should be, and the ethical principles that will determine the development of AI? If they diverge, what are these differences and can they be reconciled?  To answer these questions, we conducted a scoping review of the existing corpus of guidelines on ethical AI. Our analysis aims at mapping the global landscape of existing principles and guidelines for ethical AI and thereby determining whether a global convergence is emerging regarding both the principles for ethical AI and the requirements for its realization. This analysis will inform scientists, research institutions, funding agencies, governmental and inter-governmental organisations and other relevant stakeholders involved in the advancement of ethically responsible innovation in AI.   Results Our search identified 84 documents containing ethical principles or guidelines for AI (cf. Table 1). Data reveal a significant increase over time in the number of publications, with 88% having been released after 2016 (cf. SI Table S1). Data breakdown by type and geographic location of issuing organisation (cf. SI Table S1) shows that most documents were produced by private companies (n=19; 22.6%) and governmental agencies respectively (n=18; 21.4%), followed by academic and research institutions (n=9; 10.7%), inter-governmental or supra-national organisations (n=8; 9.5%), non-profit organisations and professional associations/scientific societies (n=7 each; 8.3% each), private sector alliances (n=4; 4.8%), research alliances (n=1; 1.2%), science foundations (n=1; 1.2%), federations of worker unions (n=1; 1.2%) and political parties (n=1; 1.2%). Four documents were issued by initiatives belonging to more than one of the above categories and four more could not be classified at all (4.8% each).

In terms of geographic distribution, data show a significant representation of more economically developed countries (MEDC), with the USA (n=20; 23.8%) and the UK (n=14; 16.7%) together accounting for more than a third of all ethical AI principles, followed by Japan (n=4; 4.8%), Germany, France, and Finland (each n=3; 3.6% each). The cumulative number of sources from the European Union, comprising both documents issued by EU institutions (n=6) and documents issued within each member state (13 in total), accounts for 19 documents overall. African and South-American countries are not represented independently from international or supra-national organisations (cf. Figure 1).  
    6 Figure 1- Geographic distribution of issuers of ethical AI guidelines by number of documents released   Figure 1: Geographic distribution of issuers of ethical AI guidelines by number of documents released. Most ethics guidelines are released in the United States (n=20) and within the European Union (19), followed by the United Kingdom (14) and Japan (4). Canada, Iceland, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, India, Singapore, South Korea, Australia are represented with 1 document each. Having endorsed a distinct G7 statement, member states of the G7 countries are highlighted separately. Map created using mapchart.net.  Data breakdown by target audience indicates that most principles and guidelines are addressed to multiple stakeholder groups (n=27; 32.1%). Another significant portion of the documents is self-directed, as they are addressed to a category of stakeholders within the sphere of activity of the issuer such as the members of the issuing organisation or the issuing company’s employees (n=24; 28.6%). Finally, some documents target the public sector (n=10; 11.9%), the private sector (n=5; 6.0%), or other specific stakeholders beyond members of the issuing organisation, namely developers or designers (n=3; 3.6%), ‘organisations’ (n=1; 1.2%) and researchers (n=1; 1.2%). 13 sources (15.5%) do not specify their target audience (cf. SI Table S1).   Eleven overarching ethical values and principles have emerged from our content analysis. These are, by frequency of the number of sources in which they were featured: transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility, privacy, beneficence, freedom and autonomy, trust, dignity, sustainability, and solidarity (cf. Table 2).   
    7 Table 2 – Ethical principles identified in existing AI guidelines Ethical principle Number of documents Included codes Transparency 73/84 Transparency, explainability, explicability, understandability, interpretability, communication, disclosure, showing Justice & fairness 68/84 Justice, fairness, consistency, inclusion, equality, equity, (non-)bias, (non-)discrimination, diversity, plurality, accessibility, reversibility, remedy, redress, challenge, access and distribution Non-maleficence 60/84 Non-maleficence, security, safety, harm, protection, precaution, prevention, integrity (bodily or mental), non-subversion Responsibility 60/84 Responsibility, accountability, liability, acting with integrity Privacy 47/84 Privacy, personal or private information Beneficence 41/84 Benefits, beneficence, well-being, peace, social good, common good Freedom & autonomy 34/84 Freedom, autonomy, consent, choice, self-determination, liberty, empowerment Trust 28/84 Trust Sustainability 14/84 Sustainability, environment (nature), energy, resources (energy) Dignity 13/84 Dignity Solidarity 6/84 Solidarity, social security, cohesion  No single ethical principle appeared to be common to the entire corpus of documents, although there is an emerging convergence around the following principles: transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility, and privacy. These principles are referenced in more than half of all the sources. Nonetheless, further thematic analysis reveals significant semantic and conceptual divergences in both how the eleven ethical principles are interpreted and the specific recommendations or areas of concern derived from each. A detailed thematic evaluation is presented in the following.  Transparency Featured in 73/84 sources, transparency is the most prevalent principle in the current literature. Thematic analysis reveals significant variation in relation to the interpretation, 
    8 justification, domain of application, and mode of achievement. References to transparency comprise efforts to increase explainability, interpretability or other acts of communication and disclosure (cf. Table 2). Principal domains of application include data use23–26, human-AI interaction23,27–35, automated decisions26,36–46, and the purpose of data use or application of AI systems24,27,47–51. Primarily, transparency is presented as a way to minimize harm and improve AI36–38,44,45,49,52–55, though some sources underline its benefit for legal reasons37,45,46,49,50,52 or to foster trust23,24,29,33,36,37,48,51,52,56–58. A few sources also link transparency to dialogue, participation, and the principles of democracy30,41,49,50,52,59.  To achieve greater transparency, many sources suggest increased disclosure of information by those developing or deploying AI systems36,51,60,61, although specifications regarding what should be communicated vary greatly: use of AI45, source code31,52,62, data use35,47,50,58, evidence base for AI use57, limitations25,33,47,51,58,60,63, laws62,64, responsibility for AI40, investments in AI44,65 and possible impact66. The provision of explanations ‘in non-technical terms’26 or auditable by humans37,60 is encouraged. Whereas audits and auditability28,39,44,45,50,59,61,62,67,68 are mainly proposed by data protection offices and NPOs, it is mostly the private sector that suggests technical solutions27,30,52,59,69,70. Alternative measures focus on oversight45,47,48,55,62, interaction and mediation with stakeholders and the public24,32,36,51,61,71 and the facilitation of whistleblowing36,60.  Justice, fairness, and equity Justice is mainly expressed in terms of fairness23,25,27–29,48,50,58,60,66,72–77, and of prevention, monitoring or mitigation of unwanted bias23,28,33,40,47,52,54,58,64,69,73,74,78–80 and discrimination28,33,36,38,44,45,50,55,56,60,68,81–84, the latter being significantly less referenced than the first two by the private sector. Whereas some sources focus on justice as respect for diversity31,38,56,59,65,66,70,72,78,80,85,86, inclusion31,45,47,51,72,80 and equality41,45,51,59,60,72,78, others call for a possibility to appeal or challenge decisions28,35–37,74,79, or the right to redress33,42,45,46,50,68,85 and remedy45,48. Sources also emphasize the importance of fair access to AI59,70,87, to data33,37,44,67,83,88–90, and to the benefits of AI37,38,80,91. Issuers from the public sector place particular emphasis on AI’s impact on the labor market37,38,55,84,92, and the need to address democratic33,38,59,73 or societal31,48,55,65 issues. Sources focusing on the risk of biases within datasets underline the importance of acquiring and processing accurate, complete and diverse data23,28,52,70,93, especially training data27,33,35,38,52,58. 
    9  If specified, the preservation and promotion of justice are proposed to be pursued through: (a) technical solutions such as standards50,68,89 or explicit normative encoding28,37,43,67; (b) transparency54,62, notably by providing information36,38,79 and raising public awareness of existing rights and regulation28,59; (c) testing52,58,67,69, monitoring54,56 and auditing39,46,50,67, the preferred solution of notably data protection offices; (d) developing or strengthening the rule of law and the right to appeal, recourse, redress, or remedy37,38,42,45,46,48,68,74,79; (e) via systemic changes and processes such as governmental action42,45,87,92 and oversight94, a more interdisciplinary47,65,85,93 or otherwise diverse58,59,70,85,87,95 workforce, as well as better inclusion of civil society or other relevant stakeholders in an interactive manner28,33,41,46,55,57,58,65,68,69,79,80,86 and increased attention to the distribution of benefits25,33,38,48,63,76.  Non-maleficence References to non-maleficence outweigh those to beneficence by a factor of 1.5 and encompass general calls for safety and security80,90,96,97 or state that AI should never cause foreseeable or unintentional harm23,30,33,56,60,79. More granular considerations entail the avoidance of specific risks or potential harms, e.g. intentional misuse via cyberwarfare and malicious hacking51,53,54,78,81,89, and suggest risk-management strategies. Harm is primarily interpreted as discrimination38,44,47,48,50,95,98, violation of privacy23,35,44,64,78,98,99, or bodily harm25,30,31,33,56,92,96,100. Less frequent characterizations include loss of trust30 or skills44, ‘radical individualism’38, the risk that technological progress might outpace regulatory measures57, negative impacts on long-term social well-being44, on infrastructure44, or on psychological35,56, emotional56 or economic aspects44,56.  Harm-prevention guidelines focus primarily on technical measures and governance strategies, ranging from interventions at the level of AI research27,47,64,79,85,101, design23,25,27,32,39,56,58, technology development and/or deployment54 to lateral and continuous approaches33,55,63. Technical solutions include in-built data quality evaluations25 or security23 and privacy by design23,27,39, though notable exceptions also advocate for establishing industry standards30,64,102. Proposed governance strategies include active cooperation across disciplines and stakeholders33,47,53,62, compliance with existing or new legislation27,31,35,81,95,99, and the need to establish oversight processes and practices, notably 
    10 tests36,38,47,74,79, monitoring36,58, audits and assessments by internal units, customers, users, independent third parties, or governmental entities40,48,51,58,81,94,95,98, often geared towards standards for AI implementation and outcome assessment. Most sources explicitly mention potential ‘dual-use’8,32,33,38,60,79 or imply that damages may be unavoidable, in which case risks should be assessed40,48,51, reduced40,69,72–74, and mitigated34,35,38,53,63,68, and the attribution of liability should be clearly defined31,37,38,44,82.  Responsibility and accountability Despite widespread references to ‘responsible AI’43,51,78,83, responsibility and accountability are rarely defined. Nonetheless, specific recommendations include acting with ‘integrity’47,52,60 and clarifying the attribution of responsibility and legal liability23,58,78,103, if possible upfront36, in contracts52 or, alternatively, by centering on remedy26. In contrast, other sources suggest focusing on the underlying reasons and processes that may lead to potential harm74,83. Yet others underline the responsibility of whistleblowing in case of potential harm36,55,60, and aim at promoting diversity49,92 or introducing ethics into STEM education59. Very different actors are named as being responsible and accountable for AI’s actions and decisions: AI developers58,60,73,96, designers36,44, ‘institutions’40,42 or ‘industry’69. Further disagreement emerged on whether AI should be held accountable in a human-like manner70 or whether humans should always be the only actors who are ultimately responsible for technological artifacts31,32,35,37,52,92.  Privacy Ethical AI sees privacy both as a value to uphold44,64,75,99 and as a right to be protected27,28,37,38,53. While often undefined, privacy is often presented in relation to data protection23,27,36,53,58,66,71,79,83,98 and data security27,35,64,66,88,98. A few sources link privacy to freedom38,53 or trust74,92. Suggested modes of achievement fall into three categories: technical solutions64,80 such as differential privacy74,89, privacy by design25,27,28,79,98, data minimization36,58, and access control36,58, calls for more research47,64,74,98 and awareness64,74, and regulatory approaches25,52,71, with sources referring to legal compliance more broadly27,32,36,58,60,81, or suggesting certificates104 or the creation or adaptation of laws and regulations to accommodate the specificities of AI64,74,88,105.    
    11 Beneficence While promoting good (beneficence in ethical terms) is often mentioned, it is rarely defined, though notable exceptions mention the augmentation of human senses86, the promotion of human well-being and flourishing34,90, peace and happiness60, the creation of socio-economic opportunities36, and economic prosperity37,53. Similar uncertainty concerns the actors that should benefit from AI: private sector issuers tend to highlight the benefit of AI for customers23,48, though many sources require AI to be shared49,52,76 and to benefit ‘everyone’36,59,65,84, ‘humanity’27,37,44,60,100,102, both of the above48,66, ‘society’34,87, ‘as many people as possible’37,53,99, ‘all sentient creatures’83, the ‘planet’37,72 and the environment38,90. Strategies for the promotion of good include aligning AI with human values34,44, advancing ‘scientific understanding of the world’100, minimizing power concentration102 or, conversely, using power ‘for the benefit of human rights’82; working more closely with ‘affected’ people65, minimizing conflicts of interests102; proving beneficence through customer demand48 and feedback58, and developing new metrics and measurements for human well-being44,90.  Freedom and autonomy Whereas some sources specifically refer to the freedom of expression28,73,82,105 or informational self-determination28,90 and ‘privacy-protecting user controls’58, others generally promote freedom31,69,72, empowerment28,52,99 or autonomy31,33,62,77,81,96. Some documents refer to autonomy as a positive freedom, specifically the freedom to flourish36, to self-determination through democratic means38, the right to establish and develop relationships with other human beings38,92, the freedom to withdraw consent67, or the freedom to use a preferred platform or technology73,80. Other documents focus on negative freedom, for example freedom from technological experimentation82, manipulation33 or surveillance38. Freedom and autonomy are believed to be promoted through transparency and predictable AI38, by not ‘reducing options for and knowledge of citizens’38, by actively increasing people’s knowledge about AI36,52,62, giving notice and consent79 or, conversely, by actively refraining from collecting and spreading data in absence of informed consent30,38,44,55,74.    
    12 Trust References to trust include calls for trustworthy AI research and technology50,97,99, trustworthy AI developers and organisations51,60,66, trustworthy ‘design principles’91, or underline the importance of customers’ trust23,52,58,66,74,80. Calls for trust are proposed because a culture of trust among scientists and engineers is believed to support the achievement of other organisational goals99, or because overall trust in the recommendations, judgments and uses of AI is indispensable for AI to ‘fulfill its world changing potential’24. This last point is contradicted by one guideline explicitly warning against excessive trust in AI81. Suggestions for building or sustaining trust include education33, reliability50,51, accountability56, processes to monitor and evaluate the integrity of AI systems over time51 and tools and techniques ensuring compliance with norms and standards43,63. Whereas some guidelines require AI to be transparent37,43,57,58, understandable36,37, or explainable52 in order to build trust, another one explicitly suggests that, instead of demanding understandability, it should be ensured that AI fulfills public expectations50. Other reported facilitators of trust include ‘a Certificate of Fairness’104, multi-stakeholder dialogue64, awareness about the value of using personal data74, and avoiding harm30,56.  Sustainability To the extent that is referenced, sustainability calls for development and deployment of AI to consider protecting the environment33,38,46, improving the planet’s ecosystem and biodiversity37, contributing to fairer and more equal societies65 and promoting peace66. Ideally, AI creates sustainable systems44,76,90 that process data sustainably43 and whose insights remain valid over time48. To achieve this aim, AI should be designed, deployed and managed with care38 to increase its energy efficiency and minimize its ecological footprint31. To make future developments sustainable, corporations are asked to create policies ensuring accountability in the domain of potential job losses37 and to use challenges as an opportunity for innovation38.  Dignity While dignity remains undefined in existing guidelines, safe the specification that it is a prerogative of humans but not robots92, there is frequent reference to what it entails: dignity is intertwined with human rights101 or otherwise means avoiding harm31, forced 
    13 acceptance31, automated classification38, and unknown human-AI interaction38. It is argued that AI should not diminish33 or destroy80 but respect82, preserve69 or even increase human dignity36,37. Dignity is believed to be preserved if it is respected by AI developers in the first place96 and promoted through new legislation38, through governance initiatives36, or through government-issued technical and methodological guidelines82.  Solidarity Solidarity is mostly referenced in relation to the implications of AI for the labor market104. Sources call for a strong social safety net37,84. They underline the need for redistributing the benefits of AI in order not to threaten social cohesion49 and respecting potentially vulnerable persons and groups33. Lastly, there is a warning of data collection and practices focused on individuals which may undermine solidarity in favour of ‘radical individualism’38.  Discussion We found a rapid increase in the number and variety of guidance documents for ethical AI, demonstrating the increasing active involvement of the international community. Organisations publishing AI guidelines come from a wide range of sectors. In particular the nearly equivalent proportion of documents issued by the public sector (i.e. governmental and inter-governmental organisations) and the private sector (companies and private sector alliances) indicate that the ethical challenges of AI concern both public entities and private enterprises. However, there is significant divergence in the solutions proposed to meet the ethical challenges of AI. Further, the relative underrepresentation of geographic areas such as Africa, South and Central America and Central Asia indicates that the international debate over ethical AI may not be happening globally in equal measures. MEDC countries are shaping this debate more than others, which raises concerns about neglecting local knowledge, cultural pluralism and global fairness.  The proliferation of soft-law efforts can be interpreted as a governance response to advanced research into AI, whose research output and market size have drastically increased106 in recent years. Our analysis shows the emergence of an apparent cross-stakeholder convergence on promoting the ethical principles of transparency, justice, non-maleficence, responsibility, and privacy. Nonetheless, our thematic analysis reveals substantive divergences in relation to four major factors: (i) how ethical principles are interpreted, (ii) 
    14 why they are deemed important, (iii) what issue, domain or actors they pertain to, and (iv) how they should be implemented. Furthermore, unclarity remains as to which ethical principles should be prioritized, how conflicts between ethical principles should be resolved, who should enforce ethical oversight on AI and how researchers and institutions can comply with the resulting guidelines. These findings suggest the existence of a gap at the cross-section of principles formulation and their implementation into practice which can hardly be solved through technical expertise or top-down approaches.  Although no single ethical principle is explicitly endorsed by all existing guidelines, transparency, justice and fairness, non-maleficence, responsibility and privacy are each referenced in more than half of all guidelines. This focus could be indicating a developing convergence on ethical AI around these principles in the global policy landscape. In particular, the prevalence of calls for transparency, justice and fairness points to an emerging moral priority to require transparent processes throughout the entire AI continuum (from transparency in the development and design of algorithms to transparent practices for AI use), and to caution the global community against the risk that AI might increase inequality if justice and fairness considerations are not adequately addressed. Both these themes appear to be intertwined with the theme of responsibility, as the promotion of both transparency and justice seems to postulate increased responsibility and accountability on the side of AI makers and deployers.  It has been argued that transparency is not an ethical principle per se, but rather “a proethical condition for enabling or impairing other ethical practices or principles”107. The proethical nature of transparency might partly explain its higher prevalence compared to other ethical principles. It is notable that current guidelines place significant value in the promotion of responsibility and accountability, yet few of them emphasize the duty of all stakeholders involved in the development and deployment of AI to act with integrity. This mismatch is probably associated with the observation that existing guidelines fail to establish a full correspondence between principles and actionable requirements, with several principles remaining uncharacterized or disconnected from the requirements necessary for their realization.   
    15 As codes related to non-maleficence outnumber those related to beneficence, it appears that, for the current AI community, the moral obligation to preventing harm takes precedence over the promotion of good. This fact can be partly interpreted as an instance of the so-called negativity bias, i.e. a general cognitive bias to give greater weight to negative entities108,109. This negative characterization of ethical values is further emphasized by the fact that existing guidelines focus primarily on how to preserve privacy, dignity, autonomy and individual freedom in spite of advances in AI, while largely neglecting whether these principles could be promoted through responsible innovation in AI110.  The issue of trust in AI, while being addressed by less than one third of all sources, tackles a critical ethical dilemma in AI governance: determining whether it is morally desirable to foster public trust in AI. While several sources, especially those produced within the private sector, highlight the importance of fostering trust in AI through educational and awareness-raising activities, a smaller number of sources contend that trust in AI may actually diminish scrutiny and undermine some societal obligations of AI producers111. This possibility would challenge the dominant view in AI ethics that building public trust in AI is a fundamental requirement for ethical governance112.   The relative thematic underrepresentation of sustainability and solidarity suggests that these topics might be currently flying under the radar of the mainstream ethical discourse on AI. The underrepresentation of sustainability-related principles is particularly problematic in light of the fact that the deployment of AI requires massive computational resources which, in turn, require high energy consumption. The environmental impact of AI, however, does not only involve the negative effects of high-footprint digital infrastructures, but also the possibility of harnessing AI for the benefit of ecosystems and the entire biosphere. This latter point, highlighted in a report by the World Economic Forum113 though not in the AI guidelines by the same institution, requires wider endorsement to become entrenched in the ethical AI narrative. The ethical principle of solidarity is sparsely referenced, typically in association with the development of inclusive strategies for the prevention of job losses and unfair sharing of burdens. Little attention is devoted to promoting solidarity through the emerging possibility of using AI expertise for solving humanitarian challenges, a mission that is currently being pursued, among others, by intergovernmental organisations such as the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS)114 or the World Health 
    16 Organization (WHO) and private companies such as Microsoft115. As the humanitarian cost of anthropogenic climate change is rapidly increasing116, the principles of sustainability and solidarity appear strictly intertwined though poorly represented compared to other principles.  While numerical data indicate an emerging convergence around the promotion of some ethical principles, in-depth thematic analysis paints a more complicated picture, as there are critical differences in how these principles are interpreted as well as what requirements are considered to be necessary for their realization. Results show that different and often conflicting measures are proposed for the practical achievement of ethical AI. For example, the need for ever larger, more diverse datasets to “unbias” AI appears difficult to conciliate with the requirement to give individuals increased control over their data and its use in order to respect their privacy and autonomy. Similar contrasts emerge between the requirement of avoiding harm at all costs and that of balancing risks and benefits. Furthermore, it should be noted that risk-benefit evaluations will lead to different results depending on whose well-being it will be optimized for by which actors. If not resolved, such divergences and tensions may undermine attempts to develop a global agenda for ethical AI.   Despite a general agreement that AI should be ethical, significant divergences emerge within and between guidelines for ethical AI. Furthermore, uncertainty remains regarding how ethical principles and guidelines should be implemented. These challenges have implications for science policy, technology governance and research ethics. At the policy level, they urge increased cooperative efforts among governmental organisations to harmonize and prioritize their AI agendas, an effort that can be mediated and facilitated by inter-governmental organisations. While harmonization is desirable, however, it should not come at the costs of obliterating cultural and moral pluralism over AI. Therefore, a fundamental challenge for developing a global agenda for AI is balancing the need for cross-national harmonization over the respect for cultural diversity and moral pluralism. This challenge will require the development of deliberative mechanisms to adjudicate disagreement concerning the values and implications of AI advances among different stakeholders from different global regions. At the level of technology governance, harmonization is typically implemented in terms of standardizations. Efforts in this direction have been made, among others, by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers 
    17 (IEEE) through the “Ethically Aligned Designed” initiative117. Finally, soft governance mechanisms such as Independent Review Boards (IRBs) will be increasingly required to assess the ethical validity of AI applications in scientific research, especially those in the academic domain. However, AI applications by governments or private corporations will unlikely fall under their oversight, unless significant expansions to the IRBs’ purview are made.  The international community seems to converge on the importance of transparency, non-maleficence, responsibility, and privacy for the development and deployment of ethical AI. However, enriching the current ethical AI discourse through a better appraisal of critical yet underrepresented ethical principles such as human dignity, solidarity and sustainability is likely to result into a better articulated ethical landscape for artificial intelligence. Furthermore, shifting the focus from principle-formulation to translation into practice must be the next step. A global agenda for ethical AI should balance the need for cross-national and cross-domain harmonization over the respect for cultural diversity and moral pluralism. Overall, our review provides a useful starting point for understanding the inherent diversity of current principles and guidelines for ethical AI and outlines the challenges ahead for the global community.  Limitations This study has several limitations. First, guidelines and soft-law documents are an instance of gray literature, hence not indexed in conventional scholarly databases. Therefore, their retrieval is inevitably less replicable and unbiased compared to systematic database search of peer-reviewed literature. Following best practices for gray literature review, this limitation has been mitigated by developing a discovery and eligibility protocol which was pilot-tested prior to data collection. Although search results from search engines are personalized, the risk of personalization influencing discovery has been mitigated through the broadness of both the keyword search and the inclusion of results. A language bias may have skewed our corpus towards English results. Our content analysis presents the typical limitations of qualitative analytic methods. Following best practices for content analysis, this limitation has been mitigated by developing an inductive coding strategy which was conducted independently by two reviewers to minimize subjective bias. Finally, given the rapid pace of publication of AI guidance documents, there is a possibility that new policy 
    18 documents were published after our search was completed. To minimize this risk, continuous monitoring of the literature was conducted in parallel with the data analysis and until April 23, 2019.   Methods We conducted a scoping review of the gray literature reporting principles and guidelines for ethical AI. A scoping review is a method aimed at synthesizing and mapping the existing literature118, which is considered particularly suitable for complex or heterogeneous areas of research118,119. Given the absence of a unified database for AI-specific ethics guidelines, we developed a protocol for discovery and eligibility, adapted from the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) framework120. The protocol was pilot-tested and calibrated prior to data collection. Following best practices for gray literature retrieval, a multi-stage screening strategy involving both inductive screening via search engine and deductive identification of relevant entities with associated websites and online collections was conducted. To achieve comprehensiveness and systematicity, relevant documents were retrieved by relying on three sequential search strategies (cf. Figure 2): First, a manual search of four link hub webpages (“linkhubs”)121–124 was performed. 68 sources were retrieved, out of which 30 were eligible (27 after removing duplicates). Second, a keyword-based web search of the Google.com search engine was performed in private browsing modus, after log-out from personal accounts and erasure of all web cookies and history.125,126 Search was performed using the following keywords: [AI principles], [artificial intelligence principles], [AI guidelines], [artificial intelligence guidelines], [ethical AI] and [ethical artificial intelligence]. Every link in the first thirty search results was followed and screened (i) for AI principles, resulting in 10 more sources after removing duplicates, and (ii) for articles mentioning AI principles, leading to the identification of 3 additional non-duplicate sources. The remaining Google results up to the 200th listings for each Google search were followed and screened for AI principles only. Within these additional 1020 link listings we identified 15 non-duplicate documents. After identifying relevant documents through the two processes above, we used citation-chaining to manually screen the full-texts and, if applicable, reference lists of all eligible sources in order to identify other relevant documents. 17 additional sources were identified. We continued to monitor the literature in parallel with the data analysis and until April 23, 2019, to retrieve eligible documents that were released after our search was completed. Twelve 
    19 new sources were included within this extended time frame. To ensure theoretical saturation, we exhausted the citation chaining within all identified sources until no additional relevant document could be identified.  Figure 2- PRISMA-based flowchart of retrieval process   Flowchart of our retrieval process based on the PRISMA template for systematic reviews127. We relied on three search strategies (linkhubs, web search and citation chaining) and added the most recent records manually, identifying a total of 84 eligible, non-duplicate documents containing ethical principles for AI.  Based on our inclusion/exclusion criteria, policy documents (including principles, guidelines and institutional reports) included in the final synthesis were (i) written in  
    20 English, German, French, Italian, Greek; (ii) issued by institutional entities from both the public and the public sectors; (iii) referred explicitly in their title/description to AI or ancillary notions, (iv) expressed a normative ethical stance defined as a moral preference for a defined course of action (cf. SI Table S2). Following full-text screening, 84 sources or parts thereof were included in the final synthesis (cf. SI Table S1).  Content analysis of the 84 sources was independently conducted by two researchers in two cycles of manual coding and one cycle of code mapping within the qualitative data analysis software Nvivo for Mac v.11.4. During the first cycle of coding, one researcher exhaustively tagged all relevant text through inductive coding128 attributing a total of 3457 codes, out of which 1180 were subsequently discovered to pertain to ethical principles. Subsequently, two researchers conducted the code mapping process in order to reduce subjective bias. The process of code mapping, a method for qualitative metasynthesis129, consisted of two iterations of themeing128, whereby categories were first attributed to each code, then categorized in turn (cf. SI Table S3). For the theming of ethical principles, we relied deductively on normative ethical literature. Ethical categories were inspected and assessed for consistency by two researchers with primary expertise in ethics. Thirteen ethical categories emerging from code mapping, two of which were merged with others due to independently assessed semantic and thematic proximity. Finally, we extracted significance and frequency by applying focused coding, a second cycle coding methodology used for interpretive analysis128, to the data categorized in ethical categories. Consistency check was performed both by reference to the relevant ethical literature and a process of deliberative mutual adjustment among the general principles and the particular judgments contained in the policy documents, an analytic strategy known as ‘reflective equilibrium’130.
