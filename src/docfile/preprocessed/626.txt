around potential harms arise widespread use technology ana brandusescu artificial intelligence gove rnance expert poitras also cautioned trivializing risks frt poses popularity convenient concerns facial recognition technology misidentification algorithmic bias biggest concern use frt potentia misidentification example cynthia khoo research fellow center privacy technology georgetown law school washington citizen lab university toronto said researchers found frt times likely misidentify black asian individuals misidentifies one three darker skinned women acc urate white men however wang noted although models developed asia also lots biases hey different set bia ses models developed canadians americans brandusescu presented statistics similar provided khoo frt better distinguishing white male faces black brown indigenous trans faces know groundbreaking work scholars like joy buolamwini timnit gebru study found darker skinned females misclassified group error rates maximum error

rates highest asians african americans compared caucasians domestic law enforcement images highest false positive rates wer indigenous peoples report also found false positive rates higher women men higher elderly children piovesan also raised concerns accuracy bias system outputs unlawful indiscriminate surveillance black box technology inaccessible lawmakers restricting freedom putting risk fundamental values enshrined canadian charter rights freedoms alex laplante senior director product business development borealis made similar comments tating take care adequately assess application development governance adverse effects end perpetuate even amplify discrimination bias towards racialized communities women lead unet hical usage data breaches privacy rights watkins said technologies machine learning algorithmic technologies bas data gathered years decades reflect human biases like institutional racism sexism processes conservative old fashioned perpetuating biases society ought
