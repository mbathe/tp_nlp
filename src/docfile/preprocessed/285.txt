meeting april japan host nation introduced principles development relevant minister held discussions result countries agreed continue lead discussions principles guidelines explains principles cooperation international organizations oecd proactive development utiliz ation japan solve various problems arising challenges confronted declining birthrate aging population moreover findings obtained japan make significant contribut ions international community sharing matters expected taken account development draft prepared basis international discussions oecd regarding matters expected considered activities promoting benefits reducing risks considering technolog ies middle development appropriate treat international principles guideline explains principles aimed introduction regulations rather draft drawn proposal guidelines internationally shared regulatory binding soft law expected deliberations guidelines accelerate participation multistakeholders involved utilization developers service providers users including civil society governments international organizations national international levels discussions towards establishing guidelines utilization guidelines promote international sharing best practices utilization help gain trust users society facilitate utilization draft purpose utilization expected progress rapidly years come process evolution networking formation networks systems connected internet information networks types systems called networks hereafter enormous benefits expected humans well society economy manners making significant contributi ons solving various problems individuals local communities countries international confronted utilization accelerated direction part viewpoint promot ing benefits systems society economy well mitigat ing risks lack transparency loss control becomes necessary address relevant social economic ethical legal issues particular services utiliz ing systems like ones provided beyond national borders via networks therefore essential share guidelines serve regulatory binding soft law best practices among stakeholders developers service providers users including civil society governments international organizations open discussions foster international consensus benefits systems increased risks controlled view awareness guideline aim protect ing interest users deterring spread risks thus achieving centered wisdom network society way increasing benefits mitigating risks draft prepared used international discussions establishment internationally shared guidelines details challenges faced international community refer united nations sustainable development goals sdgs wisdom network society society result progress networking humans live harmony networks freely systems sound progress networks achiev mentioned purpose guideline compile principles expected consider development future along comments guidelines systems covers various fields utilization benefits risks systems might differ field field guidelines set matters common fields utilization matters expected considered regard collaborations fields hand matters expected considered according circumstances field hoped discussions guidelines field including whether guidelines established held concerned stakeholders including relevant international organizations fields separately guidelines moreover systems outputs programs might continuously change result learning methods process utilization therefore matters developers expected mind matters users expected mind reason international discussions whether formulate utilization guidelines expected addition guid eline basic philosophies recognizing purpose guideline shall based upon five basic philosophies follows achieve centered society human beings across board enjoy benefits life harmony networks human dignity individual autonomy respected safely created distributed linked form wisdom network encouraging collaborations beyond space among people things events various fields consequently enabling creative vibrant developments share guidelines binding soft law best practices internationally among stakeholders rapid development utilization networked systems expected broad significant impact human beings society beyond national borders ensure appropriate balance benefits risks networks promote benefits networks innovative open activities fair competition mitigate risk systems might infringe rights interests fully respecting value democratic society academic freedom freedom expression make sure activities based specific technologies techniques hindered light ensuring technological neutrality mindful developers imposed excessive burden rapid progress technologies anticipated continue constantly view guideline flexibly revise necessary international discussions considering extent progress networking technologies utilization expected continue advance dramatically also strive broad flexible discussions including involvement
