informing publicising participation opportunities even offline powerful tool people often know participatory experiences therefore become engaged regarding participatory processes experience shown one important roles technology play helping raise awareness opportunity participate people first decide whether participate means online offline paper electronically effect means selected relatively small signifying adding technology participatory processes preliminary goal experience reveals initiating citizen participation less difficult sustaining engagement good international practice use chatbots mechanism foster citizen engagement time example participatory budgeting frequently technology seems mysterious people overcome obsta cle projects provide something simple citizens use practice allowing step role passive users example brazilian project used logic enabled people develop active behaviour regarding identifying bots twitter instead passively telling democracy digitalisation hey bot careful determine twitter profile bot users need copy paste link twitter profile verification brazilian case shown potential active behaviour bursting institutional societal bubbles enabling people challenge information receive inside bubble pegabot allows assess credibility perspective may increase probability bursting information bubble letting different points view instance brazilian case twitter account continually spread misinformation popular people found bot posting misinformation looked different perspectives others connected fake account another good international practice underestimate value democratic deliberation process whereby people exchange points view publicise preferences deliberation citizens encounter points view may come understand integrate opinion instance asked many times want garbage collected people probably reply every day however deliberation understand happen school would defunded would probably alter opinion regard particular extreme opinions heard get much attention otherwise belief project may lost moderation online offline critical decide handle extreme opinions include extent public sector state actors legislative houses judicial bodies policymakers executive agencies ministries secretaries considered key would also beneficial twitter flagged removed accounts bots make malicious use automation described subsection also see good international practices digitalisation create meaningful change partners institutional support regarding digitalisation democratic projects projects typically one actor needs changed improved state promote changes digitalisation projects necessary state actors find project interesting open proverbial institutional doors support project inside projects come outside institutions institutional support hard ensure adoption enable sustainability strengthening institutions project starts projects helpful one key practice mentioned numerous times obtaining support project bureaucratic levels state politicians one hand levels resist project even though politicians give support hand bureaucrats carry project independently government office experience participatory budgeting brazil continued beyond electoral cycle due bureaucrats embracing project projects governments particularly challenging issues corruption fact governments may interested money funding project assets buy project lead low project success rate proven effective cases framework transparency keeping government completely informed times understanding partners internal politics regard communication understanding differing interests stakeholders crucial design design critical ensuring use success project assume know end users want spoken extensively human aspect must centre design implementation digitalisation projects therefore democracy digitalisation holistic approach project design exclusively consider technical issues strongly recommended participants end users key stakeholders csos human rights defenders say development project foundation increases democratic aspects project final usability therefore good international practice work prototypes perform needs assessment ultimately makes project sustainable important lesson regard underestimate users experiences prior project design important conduct deep user research testing example uganda user research showed local people knew reply short message service sms texts mobile phones know initiate sms message however project designers know relevant information advance designers developing project assumption people knew write sms messages redesign project additionally design enables engagement especially online spaces social media localising project conceptualising logo creating brand story customising aesthetics internet social media pages specific local culture proved helpful engagement srp project sri lanka see subsection includes sensitivities differing local languages possible animosity user groups social media gender differences need considered women tend hide social media due recurring harassment project designs need sensitive experiences different user groups good international practices digitalisation create meaningful change cybersecurity data protection cybersecurity data protection important aspects dem ocratic successful digitalisation project cybersecurity refers measures taken safeguard systems hardware devices data centres software unauthorised access data protection refers protection personal data name address number health status among others subject associated data actual person data controller holds personal data identified directly indirectly reference personal data understanding rights personal information collected used stored shared digitalisation projects worldwide shown data protection crucial issue good practice consider project design taking privacy design approach oecd important international standards frameworks reference oecd privacy framework oecd united nations guidelines regulation computerised personal data files general data protection regulation gdpr european parliament council europe moreover taking national regional data protection laws frameworks consideration fundamental developing digitalisation projects approach regarding cybersecurity important cases technical capacity lacking rely external technical support ensure security data stored processed furthermore ongoing maintenance security databases needs guaranteed regard crucial avoid vendor problem concerning external technology providers means becoming dependent single provider able switch different vendor without substantial costs legal constraints technical incompatibilities democracy digitalisation good international practice prioritise systems technologies used independently afterwards seek agreements local staff trained use applicable development technologies systems partners project members know technology well tailor purposes project key successful project implementation developing supportive local ecosystems crucial sustainability digital development projects solutions cloud storage especially civil registration projects ideal might create problems data sovereignty case servers outside country data collected also essential ensure use storage services complies national laws including data protection privacy regime considers security controls offered using cloud technologies making decisions rely private cloud storage data controller processor perform specific risk assessment remain liable data subjects breaches data protection cloud provider performs project designers need aware happens personal data gather job ensure respect human digital rights ensure data protection digital security data managed within project finally transparency oversight civil society actors csos human rights defenders independent societal actors helpful control mechanism prevent misuse data lack security data protection lead interference external interests misuse political reasons diverse team partners broad design implementation team includes social scientists legal experts crucial successful projects making good international practices digitalisation create meaningful change different silos knowledge work together challenging extremely important team diversity emphasised participants important guard project becoming politically speaking translators important well administrators innovators understand asking technical assistance needed encouraged diversity considered regarding knowledge areas also team members building teams achieve diversity across race gender sexual orientation age economic conditions among others good international practice diverse team important develop inclusive digitalisation projects less biased technologies exam ple digitalisation social media practices gender dimension schoemaker diverse set key partners developing project also highlighted best practice different stakeholders support project important incorporate different perspectives exchange experiences share information insights resources also increases adherence project overall reach sustainability time important partners include state level csos networks organisations private sector companies already programmes democratic norms become partners international organisations good practice consult experts civil society companies want work responsibly human rights experts important project partners international legal standards frameworks solid understanding key legal aspects privacy data protection digital rights human rights elections freedom expression cybersecurity essential successful project design implementation democracy digitalisation support approach well compliance national laws regulations legal framework around project mandatory moreover crucial understand rules online platforms used otherwise might deny access services project suspended abruptly respecting local standards laws best practice good international practice use international standards frameworks concern key aspects mentioned additional ones project might related guide national laws cover topic cover loosely lack data protection laws human rights standards regulations important follow international standards take approach instance gdpr european parliament council europe mentioned several project coordinators high standard used especially civil registration projects principles digital development waugaman named key resource well human rights standards framed international regional local frameworks laws african union convention cyber security personal data protection african union also mentioned example cybersecurity sustainability according principles digital development waugaman building sustainable programmes platforms digital tools essential maintain user stakeholder support well maximise impact promoting local capacity building including csos also crucial sustainability digitalisation project however practical experience shown need carefully consider different meanings sustainability digital technologies good international practices digitalisation create meaningful change argue digital technologies designed sustainable rather innovation innovation idea behind technology sustainable sustainability practices created culture innovation generated best practice cases exchange learn failures successes projects based knowledge develop innovation projects initiated technology might change project remains sustainable multiple experts suggest resources implementation digital projects handbook guideline central database lessons learned would helpful successful project design implementation sustainability also sufficient funds realise project keep running time use technology frequently mentioned best practice regard however always possible institutionalisation project ngo private company local government also mentioned way achieve positive impact therefore good international practice develop definition sustainability initiative sustainability must built start successful understanding technology geopolitics choice technologies used neutral rather involves concrete political decisions particularly important context appreciate geo political context technological systems developed ongoing global struggle dominance technological infrastructure big impact human rights example many countries europe north america currently refusing install networking infrastructure equipment large chinese manufacturers concerned national security implications china russia also attempting set new democracy digitalisation international standards new digital technologies shaping way technologies developed individuals implementing technology initiatives particular infrastructure projects aware geopolitical considerations ensure feel comfortable starting project choice technologies vendors maintenance options even purchased europe always means buying specific technological ecosystem strengths limitations politics technological ecosystem well aligned politics planned project question greatly increases chances successful sustainable project pitfalls avoid chapter number many emerging technologies surrounded hype leads solutionism notion specific technology technology general solve every problem digital technologies solve many problems accomplish great things sense digital default great however focusing much digital tools neglects necessity needs assessment might cause harm increasing digital divides technology dependency overwhelming public administration citizens focusing much technology common pitfall identified several initiatives worldwide overemphasise technology would used problem trying approach solve projects successful focus needs stay problem technology one possible means achieve effective results otherwise risk developing elaborate digital solutions little applicability daily lives increases significantly additionally projects technology technology alone never sufficient necessary engage people capacity building research user testing among things therefore regular strategies project planning design implementation need place knowing balance use technology addressing solving democracy digitalisation problems tool extend reach project positive impacts challenge following technology trends suitable local context frequent pressure implement digital technologies development projects linked belief digital technologies solve almost anything usually policymakers project coordinators want shine introduction digital technologies something makes projects shine reason countries select projects use technology buzzwords lot money spent quickly especially surrounding hyped topics leading mania feasibility contribute sustainable project implementation however aside hype administrations often experience certain unwillingness introduce new technologies innovative solutions usually depends experience responsible people digital technologies often sold miracle cures solve problems country instead often produce poor results implemented transparently various companies try sell product local governments might end bill technology understood local people produce positive impacts furthermore local governments might become dependent companies pay considerable amounts money extra services especially case heavily promoted technologies blockchain bring many positive results used solution kind problem extra care warranted expensive solutions respect minimum procurement standards data protection local law international standards overall technologies blockchain artificial intelligence trends simply exported developing countries without ensuring necessary infrastructure capacities place knowledge typical pitfalls avoid transfer requires much broader ecosystem approach rather using technologies provision solutions lack usable technology maintenance technology meet needs citizens therefore useful necessary approach invest user research testing additionally establishing digital project example developing app takes longer usually estimated app developed needs maintained remain usable time frequently however difficult convince public administrators properly test users create design way strongly focused political interests agendas sometimes important projects may developed best interest citizens led creation technology graveyards overall taking time develop project complete user testing possibly randomised control trials determine technological tool meets needs users common furthermore good contingency strategy necessary project sustainable example lack maintenance user testing usability project africa websites local towns created share information nationally internationally however nobody administration felt responsible websites neither maintained used social media platforms instance massively used locals could useful tool reach citizens maintaining entire website proven effort ultimately pay sustainable time democracy digitalisation underestimating risks human rights risk state surveillance often underestimated approaches take risk consideration sometimes supported development projects however possibility certain technologies developed implemented specific purposes project later misused detriment citizens excluded instance digital civil registration systems used persecute exclude religious ethnic minorities technological systems powerful tools control among reasons enable collection storage incredible amount data citizens personal sensitive data easily misused government becomes authoritarian use technological systems inclusive ways may lead violence persecution minorities undermining freedom opinion expression online platforms discrimination automated systems increased risks electoral rights surveillance human rights defenders identified threats regime well risks human rights democracy risks always considered necessary safeguards must implemented ensure approach remains possible even changing political environment examples relevant safeguards centralisation data strong data governance procedures put place local civil society ecosystems respond challenges risks early transparency design significant changes automatically evident typical pitfalls avoid lack neutral institutional ownership broad institutional support digitalisation projects relying single person particular area institution important lesson learned different experiences worldwide lack institutional ownership common pitfall broad institutional support allows projects continue regardless started providing sustainability time essential embed project existing institutions processes plugging institutional governments carry projects crucial institutional backing perceived neutral polarised political environments critical support different sides political spectrum otherwise citizens might attribute project one side spectrum might become toxic particularly online spaces willing participate another significant risk promoting project people voted certain politician disregarding citizens thus instead exercise enfranchisement digital democracy becomes disenfranchisement important work level perceived neutral able hear voices beyond already heard understand expectations opinions different groups society provides project legitimacy reaching constituents generally voice project needs perceived institutional project initiative related one specific party ideological preference example brazilian state rio grande sul governor cabinet led initiative called governor asks crowdsourcing process allowed citizens make proposals state online platform developed great citizen engagement proposals recorded millions people participated democracy digitalisation live session governor around million people participated discussed proposals project good practices digital democracy however institutional anchoring governor term office ended project also finished even though considered good initiative next governor different party want continue perceived initiative specific party lack flexibility designing sustainability might cause project ultimately fail technology needs flexible adapt innovation avoid becoming irrelevant furthermore new technological innovation might come along could simplify certain processes project remaining flexible open include innovations beneficial approach sometimes discussed agile approach technology development however agile approach also struggle set clear boundaries red lines involves constantly adapting development process although flexibility agile approach technology important ensuring clear boundaries technological development equally important participants emphasised digitalisation projects especially project planning become outdated point thus trial error important well able visualise process learning curve instead rigid plan failing essential step process necessary persistent therefore important think carefully sustainability digital technologies adapt specific project thoughts digitalisation technology chapter number digitalisation frequently misunderstood silicon chips computers cables governance relationships political power misunderstanding leads frequent failure focus critical aspects digitalisation could digitalisation opportunity improve governance build stronger institu tions promote human rights digitalisation seen quick fix existing societal problems organisational failures corruption rife institution new blockchain unlikely fix elections struggle lack legitimacy technology silver bullet creating free fair elections however mean technology useless anything hardly development projects world function effectively without technological component digital technologies important role showing possible leading way developing creative projects make difference critical acknowledge technologies political component ensure politics consistent european fundamental rights principles standards potential makes digital development projects interesting
