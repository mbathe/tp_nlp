bringing new opportunities scien tific research education providing individuals personalized services taking account significant progress certain areas artificial intelligence particular regarding processing large amount information analysis prediction human behavior charact eristics related fields robotics computer vision autonomous systems likely make significant progress near fut ure highlighting rapid advancement big data artificial intelligence notably machine learning particular development deep learning technologies allow ing algorithms solve complex operations leading potential decisions making however process opaque affirming respect rights privacy data protection increasingly challenged development artificial intelligence development complemented ethical human rights considerations considering machine learning technologies particular artificial intelligence system general may rely processing large sets personal data development potentially impacting data protection privacy also taking account potential risks induced current trend market concentration field artificial intelligence recognizing link collections uses disclosures personal information traditional sphere privacy data protection one hand direct impacts human rights broadly notably regarding discrimination freedom expression information thus acknowledging need data protection privacy authorities think human rights broadly data protection privacy authorities work authorities addressing human rights pointing data sets used train machine learning artificial intelligence systems found contain inherent bias resulting decisions unfairly discriminate certain individuals groups potentially restrict ing availability certain services content thus interfering individuals rights freedom

promoting accountabilit relevant stakeholders individuals supervisory authorities third parties appropriate including realization audit continuous monitoring impact assessm ent artificial intelligence systems periodic review oversight mechanisms foster ing collective joint responsibility involving whole chain actors stakeholders example development llaborative standards sharing best practices invest ing awareness raising education research training order ensure good level information understanding artificial intelligence potential effects society establishing demonstrable governance processes relevant actors relying trusted third parties setting independent ethics committees artificial intelligence systems transparency intelligibility improved objective effective implementation particular investing public private scientific research explainable artificial intelligence promoting transparency intelligibility reachability instance development innovative ways communication taking account different levels transparency information required relevant audience making organizations practices transparent notably promoting algorithmic transparency auditability systems ensuring meaningfulness information provided guaranteeing right informational determination notably ensuring individual always informed appropriately interacting directly artificial intelligence system provide personal data processed systems providing adequate information purpose effects artificial intelligence systems order verify continu ous alignment expectation individuals enable overall human control systems part overall ethics design approach artificial intelligence systems designed developed responsibly applying principles privacy default privacy design particular implementing technical organizational measures procedures proportional type system developed ensure data subjects privacy personal data respected determining means processing moment data processing assessing documenting
