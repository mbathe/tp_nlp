euron roboethics roadmap gianmarco veruggio scuola robotica genova italy gianmarco abstract paper deals results euron roboethics atelier genoa italy comprising roboethics roadmap offers short overview ethical problems involved development next generation humanoid robots index terms roboethics robotics ethics introduction importance urgency roboethics demonstrated recent history three front rank fields science technology nuclear physics bioengineering computer science already forced face consequences ethics research applications pressure caused dramatic troubling events concern general public many countries public opinion shocked effects urged either halt whole strictly control robotics rapidly becoming one leading fields science technology forecast xxi century humanity coexist first alien intelligence ever come contact robots event rich ethical social economic problems public already asking questions could robot good evil could robots dangerous humankind like nuclear physics chemistry bioengineering years robotics could also placed scrutiny ethical standpoint public public institutions governments ethics committees supranational institutions feeling responsibilities involved practices increasing number roboticists world collaboration scholars humanities started deep discussions aimed lay roboethics ethics inspire design manufacturing use robots obotics ethics robotics new science branch field application engineering actually robotics discipline born mechanics automation control electronics computer science cybernetics artificial intelligence shows robotics unique combination many scientific disciplines whose fields applications broadening according scientific technological achievements specificity robotics first time history humanity approaching challenge replicate intelligent autonomous entity compels scientific community examine closely concept intelligence humans animals mechanical cybernetic standpoint fact complex concepts like autonomy learning consciousness evaluation free decision making freedom emotions many others shall analysed taking account concept shall humans animals machines semantic meaning standpoint seen natural necessary robotics drew several disciplines like logic linguistics neuroscience psychology biology physiology philosophy literature natural history anthropology art design robotics facto unifies called two cultures science humanities effort design roboethics take care specificity means experts shall view robotics whole spite current early stage recalls melting pot achieve vision robotics future three laws robotics novelist isaac asimov formulated novel runaround three laws robotics robot may injure human inaction allow human come harm robot must obey orders given human beings except orders would conflict first law robot must protect existence long protection conflict law later added law known law zero robot may harm humanity inaction allow humanity come harm theme relationship humankind autonomous machines automata appeared early world literature developed firstly legends myths recently scientific moral essays topic rebellions automata recurs classic european literature well misuse evil use product ingenuity world cultures instance mythology japanese cultures include paradigm contrary machines humanoids ieee general human products always beneficial friendly humanity difference seeing machines subject take account analyse questions far embodying ethics robot kind ethics robotics one contradictory one side need implement robots ethics development robot autonomy although forewarning could asimov three laws become really ethics robots right robots exhibit personality right robot express emotion robot robotics scientists researchers general public robots different evaluations taken account roboethics roadmap robots nothing machines many consider robots mere machines sophisticated helpful ones always machines according view robots hierarchically higher characteristics provided consciousness free level autonomy superior embodied designer frame roboethics compared engineering applied ethics robots ethical dimensions view ethical dimension intrinsic within robots derives conception according technology addition man fact one ways mankind distinguishes animals language computers even humanoids robots symbolic devices designed humanity improve capacity reproducing act charity good galvan robots moral agents artificial agents particularly cyberspace extend class entities involved moral situations conceived moral patients entities acted upon good evil also moral agents necessarily exhibiting free mental states responsibility entities perform actions good evil complements traditional approach common least since montaigne descartes considers whether artificial agents mental states feelings emotions focusing directly morality able avoid question also many concerns artificial intelligence floridi robots evolution new specie according point view robotics machines autonomy consciences humanity create machines exceed moral well intellectual dimensions robots rational mind unshaken morality new species machines better better
