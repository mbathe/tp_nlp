affected applications businesses governments practice highest ethical standards designing developing implementing apply principles principles entirely voluntary designed prompt organisations consider impact using enabled systems intend aspirational complement substitute existing regulations practices every principle relevant use every business uses every use requires comprehensive analysis principles example many businesses use systems may incorporate email accounting software use unlikely sufficient impact require use principles use involve affect human beings may need consider principles consider questions help decide whether apply ethical principles consider following threshold questions answer yes applying principles could help plan better outcomes system developing implementing used make decisions ways significant impact positive negative people including marginalised groups environment society unsure system may impact organisation principles glance human societal environmental wellbeing systems benefit individuals society environment values systems respect human rights diversity autonomy individuals fairness systems inclusive accessible involve result unfair discrimination individuals communities groups privacy protection security systems respect uphold privacy rights data protection ensure security data reliability safety systems reliably operate accordance intended purpose transparency explainability transparency responsible disclosure people understand significantly impacted find system engaging contestability system significantly impacts person community group environment timely process allow people challenge use outcomes system accountability people responsible different phases system lifecycle identifiable accountable outcomes systems human oversight systems enabled principles detail human social environmental wellbeing throughout lifecycle systems benefit individuals society environment principle aims clearly indicate outset systems used beneficial outcomes individuals society environment system objectives clearly identified justified systems help address areas global concern encouraged like united nation sustainable development goals ideally systems used benefit human beings including future generations systems designed legitimate internal business purposes like increasing efficiency broader impacts

accordance intended purpose principle aims ensure systems reliably operate accordance intended purpose throughout lifecycle includes ensuring systems reliable accurate reproducible appropriate systems pose unreasonable safety risks adopt safety measures proportionate magnitude potential risks systems monitored tested ensure continue meet intended purpose identified problems addressed ongoing risk management appropriate responsibility clearly appropriately identified ensuring system robust safe transparency explainability transparency responsible disclosure people understand significantly impacted find system engaging achieving transparency systems responsible disclosure important stakeholder group following reasons users system creators including undertaking validation certification systems processes input data deploying operating system understand processes input data accident investigator accidents occur regulators context investigations legal process inform evidence public
