intelligence particular bring extraordinary promises risks whereas development made big leap forward recent years making one strategic technologies century potential generate substantial benefits efficiency accuracy convenience thus bringing positive change european economy society also great risks fundamental rights democracies based rule law whereas seen end tool serving people ultimate aim increasing human human capabilities safety whereas despite continuing advances computer processing speed memory capacity yet programs match human flexibility wider domains tasks requiring understanding context critical analysis whereas applications attained performance levels human experts professionals performing certain specific tasks legal tech provide results drastically higher speed wider scale whereas countries including several member states make use applications embedded systems law enforcement judiciary others partly due lack regulation regulatory differences enable prohibit use certain purposes whereas increasing use criminal law field based particular promises would reduce certain types crime lead objective decisions whereas promises however always hold true whereas fundamental rights freedoms enshrined charter guaranteed throughout life cycle related technologies notably design development deployment use apply enforcement law circumstances whereas technology developed way put people centre worthy public trust always work service humans whereas systems ultimate guarantee designed always shut human operator whereas systems need designed protection benefit members society including consideration vulnerable marginalised populations design safe decisions explainable transparent respect human autonomy fundamental rights order trustworthy described ethics guidelines expert group artificial intelligence whereas union together member states bears critical responsibility ensuring decisions surrounding life cycle use applications field judiciary law enforcement made transparent manner fully safeguard fundamental rights particular perpetuate discrimination biases prejudices exist whereas relevant policy choices respect principles necessity proportionality order guarantee constitutionality fair humane justice system whereas applications may offer great opportunities field law enforcement particular improving working methods law enforcement agencies judicial authorities combating certain types crime efficiently particular financial crime money laundering terrorist financing online sexual abuse exploitation children well certain types cybercrime thereby contributing safety security citizens time may entail significant risks fundamental rights people whereas blanket application purpose mass surveillance would disproportionate whereas development operation systems police judicial authorities involves contribution multiple individuals organisations machine components software algorithms human users often complex challenging environments whereas applications law enforcement judiciary different stages development ranging conceptualisation prototyping evaluation use whereas new possibilities use may arise future technologies become mature owing ongoing scientific research worldwide whereas clear model assigning legal responsibility potential harmful effects systems field criminal law imperative whereas regulatory provisions field always maintain human accountability must aim first foremost avoid causing harmful effects begin whereas ultimately responsibility member states guarantee full respect fundamental rights systems used field law enforcement judiciary whereas relationship protecting fundamental rights effective policing must always essential element discussions whether used law enforcement sector decisions may consequences life freedom individuals whereas particularly important potential permanent part criminal justice ecosystem providing investigative analysis assistance whereas use law enforcement applications facial recognition technologies search suspect databases identify victims human trafficking child sexual exploitation abuse automated number plate recognition speaker identification speech identification technologies aural surveillance gunshot detection algorithms autonomous research analysis identified databases forecasting predictive policing crime hotspot analytics behaviour detection tools advanced virtual autopsy tools help determine cause death autonomous tools identify financial fraud terrorist financing social media monitoring scraping

potential future applications technology law enforcement vastly varying degrees reliability accuracy impact protection fundamental rights dynamics criminal justice systems whereas many tools used countries would illegal union data protection aquis case law whereas routine deployment algorithms even small false positive rate result false alerts outnumbering correct alerts far whereas tools applications also used judiciary several countries worldwide including support decisions detention sentencing calculating probabilities reoffending determining probation online dispute resolution case law management provision facilitated access law whereas led distorted diminished chances people colour minorities whereas present exception member states use limited mainly civil matters whereas use law enforcement entails number potentially high cases unacceptable risks protection fundamental rights individuals opaque different types discrimination errors inherent underlying algorithm reinforced feedback loops well risks protection privacy personal data protection freedom expression information presumption innocence right effective remedy fair trial well risks freedom security individuals whereas systems used law enforcement judiciary also vulnerable attacks information systems data poisoning whereby wrong data set included purpose order produce biased results whereas situations resulting damage potentially even significant result exponentially greater levels harm individuals groups whereas deployment field law enforcement judiciary seen mere technical feasibility rather political decision concerning design objectives law enforcement criminal justice systems whereas modern criminal law based idea authorities react offence committed without assuming people dangerous need constantly monitored order prevent potential wrongdoing whereas surveillance techniques deeply challenge approach render urgent legislators worldwide thoroughly assess consequences allowing deployment technologies diminish role human beings law enforcement adjudication reiterates processing large quantities personal data heart right protection private life right protection personal data
