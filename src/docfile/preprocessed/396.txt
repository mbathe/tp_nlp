géographique des universités dans autour des grandes ville reflète pas nécessairement dans intensité des activités liées ensemble ces éléments nouveaux éclairent débat sur les dernières avancées transformati numérique identifying artifici intelligence acto using online data oecd kurzfassung dieser arbeit werden die von glassai gesammelten und zur verfügung gestellten informationen verwendet die merkmale und aktivitäten von unternehmen und universitäten kanada deutschland dem vereinigte königreich und den vereinigte staaten analysieren die auf ihren webseiten schlüsselwörter zusammenhang mit künstliche intelligenz erwähnen die studie zeigt dass diese unternehmen der regel jung und klein sind hauptsächlich informatio und kommunikations sektor tätig sind zum kern ihres geschäfts gehört und sie auf die bereitstellung von kundenlösungen ausgerichtet sind bemerkenswert ist dass die art der von ihnen erwähnten aktivitäten nach sektor variiert obwohl universitäten und große städte konzentriert sind spiegelt sich dies nicht unbedingt der intensität der aktivitäten wider zusammengenommen liefern diese neuen und zeitgemäßen erkenntnisse informationen für die debatte über die

des universités qui mentionnent des mots liés sur leurs sites web sont analysées pour première fois dans quatre pays canada allemagne royaume états sur les informations collectées fournies par glassai une société privée qui lit interprète les textes ouverts web grande échelle agissant des caractéristiques entreprises identifiées par lecture web souligne que celles seraient plutôt jeunes petites grande majorité ces entreprises interviennent dans secteur information communication ces entreprises ont tendance placer cœur leur activité sont souvent tournées vers commerce visent fournir des

web des entreprises automatique apparaît comme sujet central souvent associé techniques par exemple les réseaux neuronaux artificiels traitement langage naturel prédictive les applications telles que les robots vision par ordinateur font également partie des termes qui apparaissent souvent sur les sites web ces entreprises les types liées indiquées par les entreprises varient selon les secteurs alors que les thèmes principaux apprentissage automatique réseau neuronal artificiel traitement langage naturel vision par ordinateur dominent secteur information communication des différences plus significatives sont observées dans secteurs activité matière dépôt brevets marques montre faible proportion moins des entreprises affichant des activités liées sur leur site internet détient également

celles sont massivement dans autour des grandes villes cependant cette polarisation reflète pas nécessairement dans des activités liées évaluée par nombre maximum sujets liés par localisation travail nature exploratoire sur une série récentes axées sur diffusion utilisation basées sur des données micro fines les complète identifying artifici intelligence actors using online data oecd zusammenfassung künstliche intelligenz hat das potenzial das wirtschaftswachstum erheblich beeinflussen und die wirtschaftslandschaft sowie die branchen umfassend verändern allerdings ist immer noch wenig über die art und weise der einführung von sowohl unternehmen selbst also auch länder vergleich bekannt die vorliegende arbeit liefert eine umfassende analyse die sich auf organisationen mit bezogener online konzentriert zum ersten mal werden die merkmale von unternehmen und universitäten die schlüsselwörter auf ihren webs eiten erwähnen vier ländern analysiert kanada deutschland vereinigtes königreich und vereinigte staaten die analyse stützt sich auf neuartige informationen die von glassai gesammelt und bereitgestell wurden einem privaten unternehmen das offene webtexte großem umfang liest und interpretiert die analyse konzentriert sich auf die merkmale der durch das lesen von webtexten identifizierten und zeigt dass diese eher jung und klein ind die große mehrheit dieser unternehmen ist sektor information und kommunikation tätig bei diesen unternehmen steht die mittelpunkt ihres geschäfts sie sind häufig geschäftsorientiert und bieten ihren kunden lösungen viele dieser lös ungen scheinen mit der datenanalyse oder der bereitstellung spezialisierter dienstleistungen wie cloud zusammenzuhängen neben allgemeinen begriff der künstliche intelligenz die auf webseiten der unternehmen gennant erden erweist sich das maschinelle lernen als zentrales thema das häufig zusammen mit anderen auftritt künstliche neuronale netze verarbeitung natürlicher sprache und prädiktive analyse auch anwendungen wie roboter oder computer vision gehören den begriffen die häufig auf den webs eiten dieser unternehmen auftauchen die von den unternehmen gemeldeten arten von aktivitäten variieren nach sektor während die führenden themen maschinelles lernen künstliche neuronale netze verarbeitung natürlicher sprache und bildverarbeitung sektor information und kommunikation dominieren sind anderen sektoren größere unterschiede beobachten die untersuchung der frage inwieweit das vorhandensein von onli neschlüsselwörtern mit der patent oder markentätigkeit von unternehmen zusammenhängt zeigt dass ein geringer anteil weniger als der unternehmen mit online auch rechte diesem geistigem eigentum besitz die meisten patenti erenden unternehmen entwickeln technologien
