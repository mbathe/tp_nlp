nuanced picture reached page older survey data please see survey results pages adoption doubled since though proportion organizations using survey defined ability machine perform cognitive functions associate human minds example understanding generation perform physical tasks using cognitive functions example physical robotics autonomous driving manufacturing work plateaued percent past years set companies seeing highest financial returns continue pull ahead competitors results show leaders making larger investments engaging increasingly advanced practices known enable scale faster development showing signs faring better tight market talent talent first time looked closely hiring upskilling data show significant room improve diversity teams consistent studies diverse teams correlate outstanding performance table contents five years review adoption impact spend mind gap leaders pulling ahead talent tales new hot roles continued diversity woes research five years review adoption impact spend marks fifth consecutive year conducted research globally role business seen shifts period first adoption definition adoption using core part organization business scale definition embedding least one capability business processes products definition organization adopted least one function percent respondents reported adopting least one business area whereas today figure stands percent though peaked higher average number capabilities organizations use generation computer vision also among capabilities robotic process automation computer vision remained commonly deployed year text understanding advanced middle pack front list behind computer top use cases however remained relatively stable optimization service operations taken top spot past four level investment increased alongside rising adoption example five years ago percent respondents organizations using reported percent digital budgets went whereas half respondents report level investment going forward percent respondents say expect organizations investment increase next three specific areas companies see value evolved manufacturing risk two functions largest shares respondents reported seeing value use today biggest reported revenue effects found marketing sales product service development strategy corporate finance respondents report highest cost benefits supply chain management value realized remains strong largely consistent quarter respondents report year least percent organizations ebit attributable line findings previous two years also tracked one thing remained concerningly consistent level risk mitigation organizations engage bolster digital trust use increased substantial increases reported mitigation risks first began capturing mind gap leaders pulling ahead past five years tracked leaders refer high examined differently see indications leaders expanding competitive advantage find evidence others catching first seen expansion size leader group past three years defined high performers organizations respondents say seeing biggest impact percent ebit use proportion respondents falling group remained steady percent findings indicate group achieving superior results mainly boosting gains likely report driving revenues rather reducing costs though report decreasing costs well next high performers likely others follow core practices unlock value linking strategy business outcomes exhibit questions strengths practices asked respondents said organizations adopted least one function also important engaging often frontier practices enable development deployment scale call industrialization example leaders likely data architecture modular enough accommodate new applications rapidly also often automate processes improve efficiency development expand number applications develop providing data feed algorithms high performers times likely organizations engage nontechnical employees creating applications using emerging programs allow companies speed creation applications past year high performers become even likely organizations follow certain advanced scaling practices using standardized tool sets create data pipelines using platform data science data engineering application development developed high performers might also head start managing potential risks personal privacy equity fairness organizations addressed yet overall seen little change organizations reporting recognition mitigation risks since began asking four years ago respondents high performers likely others report engage practices known help mitigate risk include ensuring data governance standardizing processes protocols automating processes data quality control remove errors introduced manual work testing validity models monitoring time potential issues use sustainability effortsthe survey findings suggest many organizations adopted integrating capabilities sustainability efforts also actively seeking ways reduce environmental impact use exhibit respondents organizations adopted percent say organizations using assist sustainability efforts percent say organizations working reduce environmental impact use minimizing energy used train run models companies invested mature efforts others high performers times likely others report sustainability efforts well say organizations working decrease emissions efforts commonly seen organizations based greater china developing markets respondents north america least likely report asked types sustainability efforts using respondents often mention initiatives improve environmental impact optimization energy efficiency waste reduction use least common efforts improve organizations social impact example sourcing ethically made products though respondents working north american organizations likely peers report use investment yet another area could contribute widening gap high performers poised continue outspending organizations efforts even though respondents leading organizations likely others say increase investments future spending others meaning increasing base higher percentage revenues respondents high performers nearly eight times likely peers say organizations spend least percent budgets technologies digital budgets make much larger proportion enterprise spend respondents high performers five times likely respondents report organizations spend percent revenue digital technologies finally may giving high performers leg attracting talent indications organizations less difficulty hiring roles data scientist data engineer respondents organizations high performers say filling roles difficult much often respondents high performers bottom line high performers already well positioned sustained success improved efficiency new development resultingly attractive environment talent good news organizations outside leader group clear blueprint best practices success talent tales new hot roles continued diversity woes first detailed look talent picture signals maturation surfaces common strategies organizations employ talent sourcing upskilling shines light diversity showing yet link diversity success hiring challenge less high performers organizations report hiring talent particularly data scientists remains difficult high performers report slightly less difficulty hired roles like machine learning engineers often organizations software engineers emerged role survey responses show organizations hired often past year often data engineers data scientists another clear sign many organizations largely shifted experimenting actively embedding enterprise tech talent shortage shows sign easing threatening slow shift companies majority respondents report difficulty hiring role past year say either easier difficult acquire talent years past data scientists remain particularly scarce largest share respondents rating data scientist role difficult fill roles asked mentioned earlier see signs high performers slightly easier time hiring organizations still report difficulty often evident survey findings focus hiring industrialization business value optimization example twice likely hired machine learning engineer past role focused optimizing models built data scientists performance scalability well automating pipeline data ingestion prediction generation respondents high performers also nearly twice likely others say hired product manager oversee application development adoption three times likely hired analytics translator two roles ensure applications deliver business value reskilling upskilling common alternatives hiring comes sourcing talent popular strategy among respondents reskilling existing employees nearly half recruiting universities well technology companies top tier regional leaders also common strategies look strategies high performers suggests organizations might best served tapping many recruiting channels possible exhibit companies others recruit talent various sources findings show likely recruit technical universities tech companies also likely source talent universities training academies programs professional organizations responses suggest high performers organizations upskilling technical nontechnical employees nearly half respondents high performers organizations saying reskilling way gaining talent however high performers taking steps organizations build employees skills respondents high performers nearly three times likely respondents say organizations programs develop technology personnel skills common approaches use experiential learning online courses certification programs whereas organizations often lean online courses high performers also much likely organizations beyond providing access online course work upskill nontechnical employees respondents high performers nearly twice likely others report offering learning certification programs nontechnical personnel increasing diversity teams work progress also explored level diversity within organizations teams see significant room improvement organizations average share employees teams respondents organizations identify women percent exhibit share similar looking average proportion racial ethnic minorities developing solutions percent percent respondents say organizations minority employees working solutions companies working improve diversity talent though done improve gender diversity ethnic diversity percent respondents say organizations active programs increase gender diversity within teams developing solutions steps partnering professional associations recruit candidates say organizations programs increase racial ethnic diversity also see organizations women minorities working solutions often programs place address employees experiences line previous mckinsey studies research shows correlation diversity outperformance organizations respondents say least percent development employees identify women times likely others high performers least development employees racial ethnic minorities twice likely high performers research online survey field may may august august garnered responses participants representing
