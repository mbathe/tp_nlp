reviewed identified disparate human rights may disproportionately impacted methodology positively negatively importantly technology affects adults secondary impacts children sake space focused applications designed specifically children summary spotlight three case studies particularly illustrative emerging issues examples please see full memorandum artificial intelligence recent rise attention given deep learning technologies terms artificial intelligence machine learning deep learning used somewhat interchangeably general public reflect concept replicating intelligent behavior machines purposes memo use artificial intelligence mean subfield computer science focused building machines software mimic behavior machine learning subfield artificial intelligence focuses giving
