allen untersuchten berufen gestiegen insgesamt scheint keinen eindeutigen zusammenhang zwischen dem grad des und dem beschäftigungszuwachs nach beruf geben bei berufen mit starkem compute reinsatz ist ein größeres allerdings mit einem stärkeren beschäftigungszuwachs verbunden gleichzeitig scheint bei berufen mit geringem computereinsatz hinweise auf eine negative korrelation zwischen und dem wachstum durchschnittlich geleisteter arbeitsstunden geben die genauen mechanismen die diesen ergebnissen zugrunde liegen müssen zwar noch weiter erforscht werden eine mögliche erklärung könnte aber sein dass eine teilweise automatisierung durch eine direkten produktivitätssteigerung führt zusätzlich könnte dazu führen dass die aufgabenzusammensetzung eines berufs sich hin aufgaben mit höherer wertschöpfung verändert diese steigerung bei der arbeitsproduktivität wirkt der direkten substituti von arbeit durch bei beschäftigten mit guten digitalen kompetenzen die möglicherweise leichter finden die wirksam einzusetzen und innerhalb ihres berufs nicht automatisierbaren aufgaben mit höherer wertschöpfung wechseln entgegen bei beschäftigten mit geringen digitalen kompetenzen die möglicherweise nicht der lage sind effizient einzusetzen und dadurch alle potenziellen vorteile der technologie nutzen könnte sich hingegen das gegenteil erweisen artificial intellige nce employment
