important sure pause research learn deliberate impact bot people lives doubt seek guidance assess whether bot intended purpose performed respon sibly purposes may inherently require human judgment empathy expertise high degree reliability accuracy healthcare diagnosis financial planning sure consider nature type errors performance bot cost users consider access relevant expertise domain bot would operate develop metrics assess user satisfaction metrics bot cover whether user feels bot served intended purpose also user sense well comfort using bot transparent fact use bots part product service users likely trust company transparent forthcoming use bot technology bot likely trusted users understand bot working serve needs clear limitations apparent user ving interaction another

accomplish degrade user experience establish bot help limitations associated use users likely find bot trustworthy bot sets reasonable expectations well users able easily find information limitations bot including possibility rrors consequences flow errors users wish learn offer detailed explanation purpose operation bot ensure seamless hand human human exchange lea interactions exceed bot competence bot engage people interactions may require human judgment provide means ready access human moderator respect individual engagement preferences particularly bot deals consequential matters bots designed use consequential matters incorporate ability transfer engagement human moderator soon user asks otherwise indicates bot recognizes sentime analysis user dissatisfied users feel trapped

users built safeguards protocols handle misuse abuse limit surface area norms violations ssible every bot designed follow specific set values cultural norms reduce possibility conflicting values cultural norms limit surface area norms violations example bot designed take pizza orders limit purpose engage topics ace gender religion politics like appropriate point relevant code conduct users consider whether bot subject user code conduct organization entity deploying bot example includes prohibitions hate speech bullying threatening others provide appropriate notice user code conduct apply machine learning techniques keyword filtering mechanisms enable bot detect critically respond appropriately sensitive offensive input users deploy two filtering mechanism customizable threshold

otherwise reflect poorly organization ensure bot reliable ensure bot sufficiently reliable function aims perform always take account ince systems probabilistic always provide correct answer establish reliability metrics review periodically consider questions bot needs answer rigorously test performance ongoing effectiveness performance bot systems may vary development implementation time bot rolled new users new contexts important continually monitor reliability reliability signals developed help drive decisions pass baton human bot announce perf orm requested function reliably bot system determine made mistake fact communicated user transparent bot reliability particularly bots operating sensitive domains make available information concerning reliability bot summaries general statistical performance performance particular circumstances context specific examples build traceability capabilities bot something goes wrong bot high interaction important traceability monitoring auditing example microsoft azure application insights order troubleshoot issue information app lication insights refer provide feedback mechanism users feel ore comfortable bots provide feedback operation feedback essential event product development work bots actively ask feedback set expectations whether user get response feedback provided sensitive uses obtain domain expertise building bot deliver services areas health employment finance law enforcement ensure obtain take account input experts areas design deploy bot ensure bot treats people fairly possibility systems perpetuate existing societal biases troduce new biases one top concerns identified community relating rapid deployment development teams must committed ensuring bots treat people fairly systematically assess data used training bot systematically assess data used training bot ensure appropriate representativeness quality take steps understand lineage relevant attributes training data bias detection tools become broad available adopt additional means ensure fairness bot make tools available customer use adoption strive diversity amongst development team employing diverse team focused design development testing bot technology help ensure bot operates fairly ensure bot respects user privacy privacy considerations especially important bots microsoft bot framework store session state may desig ning deploying authenticated bots personal settings like hospitals bots learn great deal users people may also share information would thought interacting person course bots remember everything plus legal requirements makes especially important design bots ground view toward respecting user privacy includes giving users sufficient transparency data collection use including bot functions types controls bot offers users personal data inform users front data collected used obtain consent beforehand provide asy access valid privacy statement applicable service agreement include profile page users
