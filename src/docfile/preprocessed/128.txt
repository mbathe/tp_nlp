recommendations area promote value oriented inclusive human public sector relation recommendation develop regulations promote fair transparent enabled public services citizens group highlighted following points risk many areas potenti ally affected impacts public sector privacy fairness digital divide already numerous pieces legislation guidelines regulations national level gdpr adding additional regulat ions top existing ones without clear uniform view risk deployment public sector potentially negative outcomes twofold one hand unnecessary complexity regulation would make hard stakeholders lawfully navigate path successfully implementing public sector hand excessive regulation would discourage innovation slowness regulation creating new regulatory frameworks would imply engagin potentially lengthy cycle slowness taken account regulating avoiding stark contrast speed field public services evolving making additional regulation counterproductive excessive focus regulation presentation recommendation first one document may counterproductive may unintentionally give impression undue focus regulation approach public sector expense efforts aimed stimulating facilitating uptake based main points group provided following suggestions improve recommendation leverage existing regulation numerous efforts level put providing detailed guidelines adoption public sector document provide reflection leverage rather producing new regulation scratch example recent proposal regulation european parliament council laying harmonised rules artificial intellige nce act provides detailed guidelines public sector particularly insightful provision establishing evaluation throughout deployment initiatives public sector focus technology recommendations exclusive focus technical features assuming technical features automatically translate impacts part wider long trend digital transform ation public sector includes technologies characteristics shares trend need taken account document needs espouse deterministic view technology instead needs consider phenomenon socio perspective technology determine outcomes instead shapes shaped complex features public sector including organi sational cultural behavioural elements relevant metapho would focusing technological features instead looking complex interplay factors constitutes phenomenon public sector would equivalent trying solve issue drunk driving focusing technical features cars move recommendations area later document would avoid giving readers impression regulating important stimulating innovation allow experimentation within bounda ries gdpr regulation allow consenting let data handlers experiment solutions mitigate importance explainability regulation focusing requirements explainability solutions impor tant regulators keep mind complete explainability might excessively high bar key argument take account putting context fact even complete explainability human decisions impossible yet considered pressing issue relation recommendation promote adoption ethical principles development guidelines mitigati measures minimis risks deploying government group highlighted following points unpredictability developments field developing quick pace hard predict developments represent challenge considering guidelines mitigating measures difficulty impact assessments areas healthcare impacts assessed deployment solutions could represent challenge establishing principles guidelines emerging applications based main points group provided following suggestions improve recommendation focus sandboxing challenges related wait full deployment solutions order understand real impacts tackled setting limite regulatory spaces sandboxes experimenting solutions monitoring impacts full rollout sandboxing also used contextualise regulations might inspired contexts europeanising regul ation monitor time monitoring activities need put place understand impacts compare impacts expected rollout share best worst practices best practices shared among public authorities europe learn success stories however equally important share less successful experiences worst practices avoid duplication errors managing transparency fairness enable creation better validation tools processes relation recommendation develop promote dedicated initiatives based approaches increase citizens businesses confidence use solutions public sector group highlighted following points definition indeed important development public sector term needs carefully defined fact umbrella term includes different forms engagement consultation etc different types stakeholde individual citizens organis ations businesses unintended consequences involving diverse stakeholders unintended consequences example decisions biased sample participating citizens representative moreover becomes impossible citizens unwilling participate example developing system fraud recognition one expect fraudsters willingly participate system geared towards targeting based main points group provided following suggestions improve recommendation consider involving citizens early stages citizen involvement considered early stages design services order reap benefits also evaluate whether desirable stage context desirable may lead unintended consequences fact taken account carefully evaluate participating samples outcomes good participants involved confirmed practices one citizen science implies special attention needs dedicated involved ensure representativeness decisions taken avoid biases use tackle big societal questions key tool formulate airelated solutions large complex socie tal questions good example united nations sustainable development goals achievement public services support order design implement manage solutions technical expertise coupled social science approaches stem input wide array stakeholders outside government feedback recommendations area enhance coordinated governance convergence regulations capacity building relation recommendation create network governance bodies public sector group highlighted network governance bodies needed clearly formally stated document moreover network governance bodies public sector could act support mechanism formalised regulation relation recommendation design national european capacity programs public sector innovators public officials willing adopt support digital transformation public services group suggested following points establish common content across training programmes training programmes harmonised include common content instance standardisation interoperability risks ethics etc develop contextualised dedicated training modules besides common content training programmes also include dedicated modules different contexts including regulations national local regulations etc relation recommendation build upon promote use regulatory sandboxes public administrations allowing experimentation solutions controlled environment group highlighted since hard regulate technology quickly evolving right conditions need created ensure adopted appropriately one possibility adopt mash approach combining existing new regulatory inputs combining international local ones relation recommendation optimise funding support government promote spreading scaling reusable solutions group provided following suggestions grant dedicated funding quota public sector programmes way ensure steady stream funding area public sector would include dedicated funding quotas existing upcoming initiatives related public sector quota considered new programme established funding support provided already early phases development solutions order enable necessary conditions scaling spreading solution components use international national funds complementary manner funding different levels used complementary manner create synergies relation recomme ndation promote development multilingual guidelines tools public procurement solutions public administrations throughout europe group highlighted need align principles member states laws regulations possible approach would devise common procurement baseline guidelines provide criteria building member states guidelines compliance regulations feedback recommendations area build shared interactive digital ecosystem relation recommendation support research knowledge creation around public sector setting research knowledge alliance amongst european universities institutions group highlighted following points europe needs leader research given global race leadership europe needs seek leadership producing world research general public sector particular europe universities focus specific applications academic research option need support research produced european academia complemented types research able reach broader practitioner audience based main points group provided following suggestions improve recommendation strengthen multi research research public sector needs cut across discipl inary boundaries technical sciences social sciences humanities purpose less emphasis disciplinary belonging particular types schools assigning research funding developing research programmes establish clear funding channels access funding linked research simplified clear channels established supporting research centres phd positions etc specific funding public services clearly signalled relatio recommendation build common european data space public sector bodies operators building compilation relevant datasets throughout europe group highlighted european data space would provide valuable data sets however data space considered centralised repository instead means opening data stakeholders member states effort important keep mind anonymising data requirement creating european data space costly endeavour based main points group provided following suggestions improve recommendation include reference data trusts data cooperatives new developments civil society recommendation acknowledge make reference experiences data sharing similar data space include data trust data cooperatives recommendation also reference possible emerging initiatives aimed data sharing stem nongovernmental stakeholders civil society include diverse array data sources spaces include government government data also data generated owned actors businesse civil society example data would ones generated participants sharing economy platform could pooled build data assets facilitate operations uber drivers creating shared knowledge build data assets taxi drivers focus privacy technologies building european data space particular care put preserving privacy rights participating stakeholders end focus put adoption use privacy enhancing technologies also subject increased research effort relation recommendation reinforce advance existing initiatives open data interoperability group highlighted following points costs opening datasets opening government data often seen costly endeavour public sector bodies addition advantages opening datasets always clear public managers moreover data use data analytics seen governments areas budget priority sensitive nature certain types datasets given data sensitive governments hesitant open datasets result costs related opening datasets important datasets might remain inaccessible based main points group provided following suggestions improve recommendation find incentives support production sharing quality data given costs perceived risks associated opening datasets public sector bodies provided incentives engage producing sharing high quality data need close loop added value open data public sector organisations receive benefit data provide would incentivised educate public managers value open data perception value opening datasets depends aware decision potential advantages open data increase awareness need educate train public managers better understand investing data infrastructures sharing open data provide organisational societal value contribute overcome narrative seeing open data exclusively administrative burden relation recommendation share reusable interoperable components levels european public administrations group highlighted sharing reusable interoperable components potentially help public administrations move pace hard find relevant components shared based main points group provided suggestion align compo nents problems sharing reusable interoperable components organised around policy problems contribute solve example public manager looking solutions related health housing able browse easily accessible directory find helpful components members states directory also include access experts standards performance metrics methodologies help less experienced public managers draw shared components order run project beginning end relation recommendation create european marketplace govtech solutions support public sector group highlighted issue current procurement framework discriminates european small medium enterprises smes compete large multi national players based main points group provided suggestion establish problem procurement processes give european start smes advantage order public sector exploit innovative potential private sector full problem procurement vehicle needed would give innovative agile advantage respect bigger companies multi players context consideration given identification development measures stimulate supply demand side european govtech ecosystem suggested explore ways use specific procurement framework conditions dedicated support european smes example use art directive feedback recommendations area applying value impact assessment frameworks relation recommendation promote setting network observatory gather share collectively manage best practices experiences learned different stakeholders public sector throughout europe group highlighted following points risk duplicating existing monitoring efforts establishment network observatories public sector runs risk unnecessarily duplicat ing work already carried bodies particular monitoring activity carried observatory mentioned document taken account establishing observatories time consuming resources time required gather data necessary establish effective observatory substantial need carefully considered risk evidence gaps due lack overview member states resulting datasets monitoring activit ies might feature false gaps clear overview activities ongoing member states based main points group provided following suggestions improve recommendation coordinate actions existing observatories would avoid duplication existing monitoring effort done instance oecd unesco extend scope monitoring monitoring observatories track offering use solutions also emergence new technologies new standards monitor barriers needs associated adoption public sector member states provide member states methodologies incentives establish observatories public authorities member states provided guidance establish observatories form methodological tools monitor uptake moreover since monitoring efforts resource intensive tangible incentives public managers embark moni toring activities provide interactive interfaces data collected observator ies presented interactive features instance allow comparison solutions tools users relation recommendation develop apply umbrella impact assessment frameworks based key influencing factors measure impact related use public sector group highlighted fact umbrella assessment framework could used across different member states across policy area greatly needed however framework successful would euwide legislation place ensure compliance technology standard something still missing act still finalised based main points group provided following suggestion improve recommendation expand array areas included assessing impacts impact assessment include multitude areas beyond economic performance citizen satisfaction impacts distinguished technical functional impacts technical impacts include elements technical standards robustness interoperability data governance life expectanc cost service level agreements external sourcing functional impacts include elements trust towards solutions risk people job wrong developers etc outcome reach solutions relation recommendation support green public sector environmental sustainability assessments civic engagement group highlighted fact important reconcile environmental impacts hard find accountabili many projects since infrastructure provided public sector private sector based main point order improve recommendation group suggested
