defining target variable involves creation new classes suppose company wants system sort job applications find good employees good employee define words class labels good employee one sells products one never late work barocas selbst barocas selbs barocas selbst internal citations omitted barocas selbst target variables class labels explain barocas selbst may greater lesser adverse impact protected classes suppose instance poorer people rarely live city centre must travel work employees therefore poorer people late work often others traffic jams problems public transport company could
