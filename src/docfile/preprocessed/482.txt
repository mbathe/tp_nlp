recognize faces average according study university york need know facial recognition facial recognition facial recognition technology designed automatically identify person using face previously known system system reference image available individual technology capable identifying individual first steps date back made considerable headway recent years thanks increasing computer processing power machine learning development artificial intelligence facial recognition biometric technology uses different scientific methods identify verify individuals analysis specific physical characteristics common biometric modalities include fingerprints palm geometry voice iris dna computer recognize face facial recognition solutions compare person face actual photo rely extracting key features called vectors photo specific data points face spacing eyes bridge nose base ears space chin mouth create unique template face encrypted encrypted template data obtained enrolment individual stored digitally reference file database person live face presented enrolment facial recognition system able match live face one previously provided scoring match high probability person initial facial images must certain quality resolution enrolled facial images obtained enrolled one one gallery faces templates stored reference database used recreate face essentially mathematical interpretation original facial image several steps required making facial match first reference digital facial template created incorporating key facial characteristics photo image individual biometric data acquisition phase enrolment attempting verify identify individual photo video captured obtained facial recognition system uses mechanism new facial image create new template compare reference template database cases individual submitting facial image remotely selfie image submitted via mobile app capture photo video include liveness detection prevent spoofing presenting photo time remote capture facial recognition system compares newly collected facial image reference template sufficiently high comparison score obtained face presented reference template individual determined recognized situations one match may obtained comparing gallery templates facial recognition system present matching candidates authorized person adjudicate actual match authentication also called verification seeks prove someone identity really say authentication consists performing comparison newly presented image individual reference template one claim requires prior enrolment consent person verified aim confirm live face presented one previously enrolled authentication quite notably used many unlock smartphones daily basis identification process finding someone identity seeking identify individual captured
