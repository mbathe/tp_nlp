need formulated near term key recommendations standardization work preface research background concept artificial intelligence born course half century development technology applications experienced many ups downs due influence intelligent algorithms computing speeds data storage levels factors since tremendous success achieved fields like machine vision speech recognition using machine learning algorithms represented deep learning great improvements recognition accuracy made object widespread attention across academia industry time technologies like cloud computing big data boosting calculation speeds lowering computing costs also providing rich data resources development helping train intelligentized 智能化 algorithm models development model also undergone gradual transformation seeking use computers simulate artificial intelligence enhanced hybrid intelligent systems combining machines humans use combinations machines humans networks form collective intelligence systems use combinations machines humans networks things form complex intelligent systems core driving force behind new round industrial transformation spawning new technologies new products time also playing powerful empowering role traditional industries potential induce major changes industrial structure bring overall leap social productive forces free humans monotonous labor simple repetitive dangerous tasks completed systems reducing labor inputs increasing work efficiency systems also things faster accurately humans find broad applications fields education medical treatment eldercare environmental protection city operation justice services able greatly improve precision level public services increase quality people lives across board also help humanity accurately perceive predict warn major situations operation infrastructure public security promptly grasp changes collective consciousness psychology take initiative make decisions reaction events significantly improve social governance capabilities safeguarding public security since strategic technology world developed nations striving dominance new round international competition issuing plans policies centered around making deployments core technologies top talents standards norms accelerating development technologies industries major technology companies constantly enlarging investments money manpower seize high ground development china released new generation artificial intelligence development plan guo three year action plan promote development new generation artificial intelligence industry ministry industry information technology policy documents promote industrialized development technology currently certain technological industrial foundation development china array companies concentrated microchip data platform applications fields achieved good initial results directions moved towards commercialized development example applications achieved fields financial security service industries specific tasks degree accuracy effectiveness semantic recognition speech recognition facial recognition image recognition technologies already far exceed humans standardization work plays fundamental supportive guiding roles industrial development represents key lever promoting development industry innovation well commanding heights industry competition present products services china growing increasingly abundant problems inadequate degrees standardization also surfacing involves numerous fields although fields already certain foundation standardization scattered standardization efforts insufficient fully support entire field addition emerging field beginning take global scale standardization work still infancy complete system standards yet take shape china rest world basically starting line window opportunity exists breakthroughs long take aim opportunity deploy rapidly entirely possible seize commanding heights standards innovation otherwise good opportunity may lost consequently urgent need take advantage opportunity hand accelerate research technology industry development systematically sort develop systems standards various fields clarify relationships dependency constraint standards establish unified complete systems standards use standards means promote booming development technologies industries china research objectives significance prior white paper guidance industrial department standardization administration china sac science technology department ministry industry information technology miit sorting evolving circumstances technologies applications industries analyzing technology hot spots industry dynamics future trends standards systems researched formulated capable adapting guiding development industry starting perspective supporting overall development industry fundamental key standards projects urgently needed short term proposed white paper intended comprehensive review technologies industries fields extensive detail merely analyzes current technology hot spots industry circumstances covered within fields investigate propose systems standards standardization still infancy white paper serves initial link connecting technologies industries standardization revised constantly future based developing requirements technologies industries standardization white paper gives moderate amount statements strives use relatively simple language methods exposition purposes significance white paper lies sharing research results practical experiences field involved industry well calling different segments society jointly strengthen technology research industry investment service applications building standards joint promotion industrial development source cesi website originally published january translated
