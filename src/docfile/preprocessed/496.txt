creation computers sometimes collaboratively working computer networks various sizes programs less complex sets operations called algorithms work ondata sets interpret something sufficiently complex set algorithms produce recent prominent examples rather based huge data sets big data appliances analyse data using statistical algorithms analysing virtual environment using databases previous

whether robotics artificial intelligence positive negative impact environment still discussed several indications positive gains might found one example agriculture robotics already helping create efficient sustainable systems internet things making agricultural processes precise adapting current climate making efficient even helping exchange use pesticides controlled farming practices helps feed growing population reliably healthily robotics artificial intelligence also benefit environment efficient management diseases factory production lines public transportation including individual transport cars therefore underline possible positive gains robotics could environment dismissed rather taken seriously fight climate change legal complexity technology sometimes portrayed overwhelming even point case malfunction engineers operators might want deny responsibility machine program acted however artificial intelligence systems equivalent animal actions predetermined fully controlled machine program designed humans acts deterministically actions reactions depend data sets programming user sensory input even though given involvement many factors may understood real time certain action transpired therefore unintended nature possible damages automatically exonerate manufacturers programmers operators liability responsibility failure keep track action occurred may well constitute act negligence order reduce possible repercussions failure malfunctioning sufficiently complex systems think strict liability concepts evaluated including compulsory insurance policies approaches need balanced try place heavy burden enthusiasts academia ecosystem security standards security classical systems already much discussed relatively area however comes application fields individual mobility health implants even something mundane baby phone find level scrutiny pales comparison usage banking communication sectors regards depth public conversation around issues moreover actual legislation administration therefore propose robots artificial intelligence developed produced based impact assessment best available technical standards regarding security possibility intervene requirements applied reasonable development use algorithms robotics smaller companies research private use impeded impact assessment could required certain threshold persons affected reached mass heavy industrial production furthermore scope impact assessment needs developed different scopes including different levels stringency different actors different projects even teenager assembling
