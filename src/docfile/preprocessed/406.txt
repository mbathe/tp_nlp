darunter softwareingenieure und statistiker die unterscheiden sich von der gesamtbevölkerung den oecd über der haben durchschnitt mindestens einen hochschulabschluss und diese zahl nähert sich wenn man die berufe mit den höchsten anforderungen näher betrachtet weniger als der sind frauen verglichen mit weit über der erwerbstätigen bevölke rung mit hochschulabschluss den oecd außerdem verdienen fast der beschäftigten über dem perzentil der einkommensverteilung gegensatz dazu ist die wahrscheinlichkeit dass die jung oder ausland geboren sind genauso hoch wie bei der erwerbstätigen bevölkerung
