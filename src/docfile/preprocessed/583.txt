productsdávid pásztorone thing learn latest fatal tesla accident machine learning products need careful designing article seven basic principles products arrival products enter new era machines start behave differently perform orders things change people react behave expect designers aim create useful products order bring clarity shady new world machine learning importantly want use power make people lives easier let see achieve good design follow seven principles principle content visuallyin many cases use machine learning dig deep data generate new useful content come form movie recommendations netflix translations google translate sales predictions crm generated content prove extremely useful people cases recommendations predictions need greater accuracy algorithms flaws especially enough data feedback learn let people know algorithm generated piece content decide whether trust thus reads first principle image see zendesk prediction support tickets clearly identifies prediction people know expect tool mobile developers labels predicted data magic wand icon also provide information accuracy prediction users also set risk tolerance course tool serves engineers know machine learning everyday people would necessarily understand high risk tolerance magic wand still handily highlights principle machines thinkartificial intelligence often looks like magic sometimes even engineers difficulty explaining algorithm comes something see job company helping people understand machines work use mean explain convolutional neural network functions simple photo search give users hints algorithm data good old example comes explain recommend certain products recommendation engines first many people encountered many years cars provide another good example build trust passengers suggest putting screen cars everyone check car sees around check example design lab least let take look drip email marketing tool product per scoring function shows newsletter subscriber engagement clicking score get detailed list actions explains people got principle right expectationsin deadly tesla accident mentioned driver probably trusted autopilot system technologies like google cars tesla autopilot enough sophistication navigate complex situations drivers must keep hands wheel even using autopilot driver follow instructions regardless getting multiple visual voice notifications probably thought car could handle driving must set right expectations especially world full sensational superficial news new chatbots use messages clarify level advancement case try lower expectations nice copy kind character principle handle weird edge casesai generate content take actions one thought unpredictable cases spend time testing products finding weird funny even disturbing unpleasant edge funny rude chatbot examples abound bot understand context people gave simple unexpected stories amazon alexa coming ordered dollhouse heard conversation radio another example passport checker bot accept photos asian people eyes closed testing field help minimize errors clear communication products capabilities help humans understand unexpected provide developers information user expectations algorithms prevent bad responses many cases play precision recall means product use right answers finds even displays wrong answers let say build identify picasso paintings optimize recall algorithm list picasso paintings van goghs appear results precision means machine learning algorithm use clearly correct answers miss borderline positive cases show picasso paintings van goghs miss picassos find correct answers clear work help developers decide optimize providing meaningful insights human reactions human priorities prove important job designer principle engineers right training datacreating product engineering side usually takes three steps finding best algorithm training data learns data creates model use live product example training data would include lot paintings name painter product use model trained certain things users might also collect new data later use model improving really need training data people help collect training data define expected outcome people want see defining expected outcomes comes easy things start get difficult outcomes subjective users netflix film recommendations really prove useful team aims understand people define need training data specifically outcomes different inputs feed machine learning algorithm google reportedly hires content specialists experts domain product help build training data collecting initial data set engineers train algorithm start user tests early prototypes tests double check first trained models see perform real project need even closer collaboration developers product manager wants learn achieve read free product managers principle testing products default methods work testing products prove much difficult regular apps apps mainly promise provide personalized content hardly emulate dummy stuff wireframe two great methods work though wizard testing personal wizard studies someone emulates product response background often tests chatbots human answering message pretending bot also use test participant personal content test situations ask favorite musicians songs use testing music recommendation engine tests people assumptions react good bad recommendations principle opportunity give feedbackthe user experience products gets better better feed data machine learning movie recommendation system designed movie displayed set like collects vast amounts training data provide users opportunity give feedback every screen app made recommendation prediction give users chance give feedback easily right away usually means feedback options displayed next zendesk button next prediction report bad google feed could see questions card provide feedback card usefulness time time see also found great way communicate algorithm works displayed phrase user shown interest explain recommend certain seven principles uxto sum seven things designing distinguish content normal content visually people know information coming machines think people understand expectations people know achieve handle edge cases weird unpleasant things happen engineers insights people expectations right training datatest methods like wizard testing use test participant data emulating content opportunity users give feedback add new training data products poses exciting new challenge keep seven principles mind probably thoughts relationship keep let know
