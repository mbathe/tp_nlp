possibility building intelligent machines often androids human features whereas humankind stands threshold era ever sophisticated robots bots androids manifestations artificial intelligence seem poised unleash new industrial revolution likely leave stratum society untouched vitally important legislature consider legal ethical implications effects without stifling innovation whereas need create generally accepted definition robot flexible hindering innovation whereas average increase sales robots stood per year sales rose highest increase ever automotive parts suppliers industry main drivers growth whereas annual patent filings robotics technology tripled last decade whereas past years employment figures persistently increased due technological development whereas development robotics may potential transform lives work practices raise efficiency savings safety levels provide enhanced level services whereas short medium term robotics promise bring benefits efficiency savings production commerce also areas transport medical care rescue education farming making possible avoid exposing humans dangerous conditions faced cleaning toxically polluted sites whereas ageing result increased life expectancy due progress living conditions modern medicine one greatest political social economic challenges century european societies whereas europeans older particularly rapid increase numbers people older lead fundamentally different balance generations within societies whereas interest society older people remain healthy active long possible whereas current trend leans towards developing smart autonomous machines capacity trained make decisions independently holds economic advantages also variety concerns regarding direct indirect effects society whole whereas machine learning offers enormous economic innovative benefits society vastly improving ability analyse data also raising challenges ensure due process transparency understandability processes whereas similarly assessments economic shifts impact employment result robotics machine learning need assessed whereas despite undeniable advantages afforded robotics implementation may entail transformation labour market need reflect future education employment social policies accordingly whereas widespread use robots might automatically lead job replacement lower skilled jobs sectors likely vulnerable automation whereas trend could bring production processes back whereas research demonstrated employment grows significantly faster occupations use computers whereas automation jobs potential liberate people manual monotone labour allowing shift direction towards creative meaningful tasks whereas automation requires governments invest education reforms order improve reallocation types skills workers tomorrow need whereas face increasing divisions society shrinking middle class important bear mind developing robotics may lead high concentration wealth influence hands minority whereas development robotics definitely influence landscape workplace may create new liability concerns eliminate others whereas legal responsibility need clarified business sight model well workers design pattern case emergencies problems occur whereas trend towards automation requires involved development commercialisation applications build security ethics outset thereby recognizing must prepared accept legal liability quality technology produce whereas regulation european parliament council general data protection regulation sets legal framework protect personal data whereas aspects data access protection personal data privacy might still need addressed given privacy concerns might still arise applications appliances communicating databases without human intervention whereas developments robotics designed way preserve dignity autonomy individual especially fields human care companionship context medical appliances enhancing human beings whereas ultimately possibility could surpass human intellectual capacity whereas development increased use automated algorithmic undoubtedly impact choices private person business internet user administrative judicial public authority take rendering final decision consumer business authoritative nature whereas safeguards possibility human control verification need built process automated algorithmic whereas several foreign jurisdictions japan china south korea considering certain extent already taken regulatory action respect robotics whereas member states also started reflect possibly drawing legal standards carrying legislative changes order take account emerging applications technologies whereas european industry could benefit efficient coherent transparent approach regulation union level providing predictable sufficiently clear conditions enterprises could develop applications plan business models european scale ensuring union member states maintain control regulatory standards set forced adopt live standards set others say third countries also forefront development robotics general principles whereas asimov laws must regarded directed designers producers operators robots including robots assigned autonomy since laws converted machine code whereas series rules governing particular liability transparency accountability useful reflecting intrinsically european universal humanistic values characterise europe contribution society necessary whereas rules must affect process research innovation development robotics whereas union could play essential role establishing basic ethical principles respected development programming use robots incorporation principles union regulations codes conduct aim shaping technological revolution serves humanity benefits advanced robotics broadly shared far possible avoiding potential pitfalls whereas charter robotics annexed resolution drawn assistance scientific foresight unit stoa european parliamentary research service proposes code ethical conduct robotics engineers code research ethics committees designers users whereas gradualist pragmatic cautious approach type advocated jean monnet adopted union regard future initiatives robotics ensure stifle innovation whereas appropriate view stage reached development robotics start civil liability issues liability whereas thanks impressive technological advances last decade today robots able perform activities used typically exclusively human development certain autonomous cognitive features ability learn experience take decisions made similar agents interact environment able alter significantly whereas context legal responsibility arising robot harmful action becomes crucial issue whereas robot autonomy defined ability take decisions implement outside world independently external control influence whereas autonomy purely technological nature degree depends sophisticated robot interaction environment designed whereas autonomous robots less considered simple tools hands actors manufacturer operator owner user etc whereas turn questions whether ordinary rules liability sufficient whether calls new principles rules provide clarity legal liability various actors concerning responsibility acts omissions robots cause traced back specific human actor whether acts omissions robots caused harm could avoided whereas ultimately autonomy robots raises question nature light existing legal categories whether new category created specific features implications whereas current legal framework robots held liable per acts omissions cause damage third parties whereas existing rules liability cover cases cause robot act omission traced back specific human agent manufacturer operator owner user agent could foreseen avoided robot harmful behaviour whereas addition manufacturers operators owners users could held strictly liable acts omissions robot whereas according current legal framework product liability producer product liable rules governing liability harmful actions user product liable behaviour leads apply damages caused robots whereas scenario robot take autonomous decisions traditional rules suffice give rise legal liability damage caused robot since would make possible identify party responsible providing compensation require party make good damage caused whereas shortcomings current legal framework also apparent area contractual liability insofar machines designed choose counterparts negotiate contractual terms conclude contracts decide whether implement make traditional rules inapplicable whereas highlights need new efficient ones comply technological developments innovations recently arisen used market whereas regards liability directive cover damage caused robot manufacturing defects condition injured person able prove actual damage defect product causal relationship damage defect therefore strict liability liability without fault framework may sufficient whereas notwithstanding scope directive current legal framework would sufficient cover damage caused new generation robots insofar equipped adaptive learning abilities entailing certain degree unpredictability behaviour since robots would autonomously learn
