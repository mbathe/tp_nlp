project team diverse multidisciplinary extensive expert input get right expertise beyond data scientists relevant policy experts practitioners team disciplines subject matter experts need involved steps taken involve roles defined project ask team experts right data research questions get help matching dataset problem ensure diversity within team fairness ensured diversity team diverse team helps prevent biases encourages creativity diversity thought avoid forming homogenous teams embrace diversity lived experiences people different backgrounds find homogenous team challenge involve
