    4   Foreword   This report is produced in the context of AI Watch, the European Commission knowledge  service to monitor the development, uptake and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for  Europe, launched in December 2018. AI has become an area of strategic importance  with  potential to be a key driver of economic development. AI also has a wide range of potential  social implications. As part of its Digital Single Market Strategy, the European Commission put  forward in April 2018 a European strategy on AI in its Communi cation "Artificial Intelligence  for Europe" COM(2018)237.     The aims of the European AI strategy announced in the communication are:   • To boost the EU's technological and industrial capacity and AI uptake across the  economy, both by the private and public sec tors.   • To prepare for socio -economic changes brought about by AI   • To ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework.   Subsequently, in December 2018, the European Commission and the Member States  published a “Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence”, C OM(2018)795, on the development  of AI in the EU.     In April 2021, the European Commission adopted an AI Package. This package includes  proposal for  the first ever legal framework on AI, which addresses the risks of AI and positions  Europe to play a leading  role globally  (European Commission, 2021)  and 2021 review  of the   the Coordinated Plan  (European Commission, 2021) .   The 2021 Review of the Coordinated Plan on AI  puts forward a concrete set of jo int actions for  the European Commission and Member States on how to create EU global leadership on  trustworthy AI. The proposed key actions reflect the vision that to succeed, the European  Commission together with Member States and private actors need to:   • accelerate investments in AI technologies to drive resilient economic and social  recovery facilitated by the uptake of new digital solutions;   • act on AI strategies and programmes by implementing them fully and in a timely  manner to ensure that the EU reaps the full benefits of first -mover adopter  advantages; and   • align AI policy to remove fragmentation and address global challenges .    Standardis ation activities are one of the action areas identified in the 2021 Coordinated Plan  as an area for joint action betwee n European Commission and Member States.     This report is one of the deliverables of AI watch specifically focusing on the mapping of the  AI standards onto the requirements introduced by the European Commission AI Act.     This is the 3nd version  of the stud y reflecting updated input from stakeholders and the  requirements, as present in the Commission’s official proposal for a horizontal regulatory  framework for AI.

    6   Abstract   The present stud y surveys the ongoing standardis ation activities on AI carried out by ESOs  (European Standards Organizations) and international Standards Development  Organizations (SDOs) . In the present study we investigate the alignment between AI  related standards  published or in development  and the req uirements proposed in the  proposal for Artificial Intelligence Act.. The aim is to identify possible gaps and  underdeveloped areas  in the current standardisation activities . The main goal is to provide  a contribution to the def inition of a European standar disation roadmap for implementing  the A rtificial Intelligence  Act (AIA)  (European Commission, 2021) .  The document is organized as follows: Section 1 provides an overview of the different  dimensions of standards and introduces the adopted  landscaping methodology. Then,  Sections 2 and 3 discuss the applied methodology to identify the standards relevant to the  AIA and the considered standard population , respectively. Then, Section 4 delves into the  proposed  regulatory framework for AI  (i.e. the AIA) , introducing its scope and  requirements. Section 5 provides a high -level analysis to map the identified standard   populations  onto the AIA requirements. Section 6 provides an in -depth analysis of the  mapping, intr oducing an innovative methodology. Applying  the proposed methodology ,  Section 7 discusses an executive version of the AIA requirements, according to a semi structured model. Section 8 discusses  the obtained  results of the in -depth analysis and   provides ini tial reflections on the  possible gaps . Finally, Section 9 summariz es findings ,  outlin e possible recommendations , and introduce potential future work .     
    7   1 Introduction     1.1 Aim of the study   AI technologies may present new safety risks for users when they are embedded in  products or used in services – addressing individuals, legal entities, and enforcement  authorities  (European Commission, 2021) .   Therefore, the White Paper on AI, published in February 2020 by the European Commission  (European Commission, 2020) recognized the need to provide an improved regulatory  framework, including a possible new Regulation dealing with AI risks for safety and  fundamental rights  (European Commission, 2020) .   A proposal for the new AI Regulation was adopted by the Commission on 21 April  (European  Commission, 2021) . This Regulation follows the New -Legislative Fr amework  approach.   According to this legislative technique, the legal provisions are typically high -level and  framed as essential requirements. These set a technical objective that providers of AI  systems are expected to fulfil; the s o-called h armonised st andards provide the detailed  technical specifications through which economic operators can achieve compliance with the  relevant legal requirements. If they so wish, however, economic operators can use any  other technical solutions other than harmonised sta ndards to demonstrate compliance.   Harmonised standards  are produced by European standardisation organisations (notably  CEN/CENELEC and ETSI) based on a formal standardisation request  issued by the  European Commission. Those standards are to be evaluated by the Commission services  and, where they are deemed to satisfy the standardisation request, published in the Official  Journal. Only standards published in the Official Journal can pr ovide operators with a  relevant legal presumption of conformity with the legal requirements of the EU  harmonisation legislation in question. Regulation (EU) 1025/2012 sets the general rules  regarding the functioning of the standardisation system, including  the procedure for issuing  standardisation mandates (Article 10).   Appropriate agreements in place between European Standardisation Organisations (ESO s)  and International Standardisation Organisations ( such as  ISO or IEC) ensure that  international standard s can be taken over by ESOs and proposed as European harmonised  standards in response to a standardisation request.   Harmonised standards are thus a key tool for the implementation of the legislation and  contribute to the specific objective to ensure that that AI systems are safe and trustworthy.  Harmonised standards allow for technological evolution and the take -up of the latest state of-the-art.  In April 2021, the European Commission published a p roposal for a Regulation laying down  harmonised rules on ar tificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act)  (European  Commission, 2021) . This act aims at defining AI systems, and puts forward requirements  for high -risk AI systems.     In this context, the objective of this document is multi-fold:   1. to provide a survey  of the international standardis ation initiatives and  specifications dealing with AI , which are relevant  to high -risk applications  and systems ; and   2. to analyse their relation  to the  requirements of the proposed  EU Artificial  Intelligence Act ;  3. to assess their present suitability and operationalisation  level to implement  these requirements  and recognize possible gaps . 
    8   This study considers ISO/IEC, ETSI, ITU -T, and IEEE standards dealing with AI;  furthermore, ISO/IEC JTC1 -SC42 and ETSI SAI standards were analysed in -depth. In the  next future IEEE and ITU -T relevant standards will be also processed in-depth and such  analy sis will be included in a updated version of this report.   This study  does not consider biometrics : an important topic for the future EU  regulation .  There already are many ISO standards deal ing with such a  topic and dedicated working  items are likely to be launched to address specific needs stemming from the AIA .   This study does not consider the types of IPR that characteriz e the usage  of the analysed  standards  and, thus, does not consider their possible impact .    1.2 The role of s tandards   According to the European Commission, a standard is defined as:  “a technical specification  approved by a recognised standardisation body for repeated or continuous application, with  which compliance is not compulsory and which is one of the following (European  Commission, 1998) :  • international standard: a standard adopted by an international standardisation  organisation a nd made available to the public;   • European standard: a standard adopted by a European standardisation body a nd  made available to the  public;   • national standard: a standard adopted by a national standardisation body and  made available to the public”.   Furthermore, as stated in its Regulation n o. 1025/2012 on standardisation:   “the primary objective of standardisation is the definition of voluntary technical or quality  specifications with which current or future products, production processes or services may  comply. Standardisation can cover various issues, such as standardisation  of different  grades or sizes of a particular product or technical specifications in product or services  markets where compatibility and interoperability with other products or systems are  essential” (European Union, 2012) .  EU lawm akers put standardis ation at the centre of EU digital and industrial strategy   (Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 , European Commission, 2015 ). While sustainability and  safety standards help protect people and environment,  in Europe  standards play a special  function by helping to make the single market a reality. Finally, standards empower digital  transformation for the whole society, boosting market development, increasing the   international competiti veness , and supporting regulations.   An International Standard ca n take many forms. Apart from product standards, other  examples include: test methods, codes of practice, guideline standards and management  systems standards  (ISO, 2021) .    1.3 European Standards   The European regional standards org anization s, known as ESOs (European Standards  Organizations), are officially recognised by the European Commission  (Regulation (EU) No  1025/2012 ) and act as a European platform through which European Standards are  developed. ESOs include:  the European Committee for Electrotechnica l Standardis ation  (CENELEC ), the E uropean Committee for Standardis ation (CEN)  and the European  Telecommunications Standa rds Institute  (ETSI) .   In the European Union, only standards developed by CEN, CENELEC and ETSI are  recognised as 'European Standards'  (Regulation (EU) No 1025/2012 ). These ESOs  work 
    9   jointly in the interest of European harmonization, creating both standard s requested by  the market and harmonized standards in support of European legislation.    Moreover, these organizations are also the regional mirror bodies to their intern ational  counterparts, i.e. the International O rganization for Standardis ation (ISO), the  International Electrotechnical Commission  (IEC) and the International Telecommunication  Union, telecommuni cation standardis ation sector (ITU -T), respectively.      For the scope of this document, we consider ESOs and the relevant SDOs having a formal  recogn ition by international treaties and  regulation  or SDO s participating  to the bi-annual  Global Standards Collaboration , which involves  all major SDOs . Therefore, we investigate:  ETSI, CEN -CENELEC, ISO/IEC, ITU -T, and the Institute of Electrical and Electroni cs  Engineers (IEEE)     European standards play a very important role within the internal market, for instance  through the use of harmonised standards .   1.4 Standardis ation domain  and process es  Standard specifications may cover a wide range of applications (from products to services),  systems, and processes, with different purposes (from informative to normative), dealing  with different phases of the subject lifecycle (from design to implementation and  management).  Therefore, s tandardis ation pro cesses and related stakeholders can be  different considering (at least) three possible dimensionalities or concerns  (explained  below)  that, thus, may be used to characterize the standards domain:   • Business and legal concerns : can give rise to either de-jure or de-facto/industrial  standards.   • Conceptual and process concerns : lead generally to the development of either  foundational/ basic standards or technical/implementation standards.   • Application and context -specific concerns : are behind the distinction betwee n  standar ds covering a broad spectrum of sectors  (commonly called horizontal  standards)  and standards  intended for more application  domain  (or context specific  use), generally indicated as vertical standards .    1.4.1 De-jure versus de -facto standards   A de-facto standard is one which has been widely accepted (e.g. by customers/users or by  the market), becoming a well -regarded  (or popular) standard for its purpose – even though  it has no official status. Acceptance is often based on a proven track record  for efficiency  and reliability  (de Vries, 1998) .   De-facto standards which become accepted by an industry are also known as industry or  professional standards.   On the other hand , de-jure describes a practice that is formally  recognised, regardless of  whether the practice exists in reality. Therefore, de -jure standards (or standards according  to law) are th ose which have been approved by official organizations such as  ISO and IEEE.  These standards are critically assessed before being approved – examples of de-jure  hardware standards include USB, FireWire and HDMI, while a significant example of  software related standard is ASCII character set  (deVries,1998, Carpenter, 2012).   De-facto standards can become de -jure standards over time (i.e. by receiving an offi cial  status  from a SDO ) – e.g. HTML and PDF format s. HTML first became a de -jure standard  in 1995 because of the standardisation  effort led by the Internet Engineering Task Force  (IETF) (Vaughan -Nichols, 2010)  and PDF became in 2008 an ISO standard (ISO 32 000-1)  (Carpenter, 2012).   
    10   1.4.2 Foundational versus implementation standards   Foundational  or basic  standards are commonly the basis for a series of standa rd  specifications, defined by a  SDO. This work focuses on those aspects that necessitate a  common vocabulary, as well as agreed taxonomies and definitions (Bartram, 2018) .  Eventually, these standards will mean that a practitioner can talk the same language as a  regulator and both can talk the same language as a technical expert.  For example, ISO/IEC  work on AI covers a number of key areas spanning technology, societal, and ethical  considerations. Since many different stakeholders are addressed, there is the need to  define a basic starting point by introducing a set of foundational standards.     Example  ISO/IEC DIS 22989 - Information technology — Artificial intelligence — Artificial   intelligence concepts and terminology   The document establishes terminology for Artificia l Intelligence (AI) and describes concepts  in the field of AI. The document can be used in the development of other standards and in  support of communications among diverse, interested parties/stakeholders.     According to the Open Geospatial Consortium, imp lementation standards are different from   the abstract specification  of foundational standards, since  they are written for a more  technical audience and detail  technical aspects such as  the interface structure between  software components (OGC, 2020) :     Example  IEEE 802.3 -2018 - IEEE Standard for Ethernet   Ethernet local area network operation is specified for selected speeds of operation from 1  Mb/s to 400 Gb/s using a common media access control (MAC) specification and  management inf ormation base (MIB).     1.4.3 Horizontal versus vertical specifications   As in many other standardisation  domains, there may be two levels of standardisation   activities : one dealing with general issues that apply in a cross -cutting way to several areas  (horizontal) and another dealing with more specific issues relevant to a given sector  of  activity or application area (vertical).   A horizontal specification  contains fundamental principles, concept s, definitions and similar  general information that aims to be applicable over a broad set of subject area s.    Example :  ISO/IEC AWI TR 24372 Information technology — Artificial intelligence (AI)  — Overview of computational approaches for AI systems   The specification aims to provide an overview of the state of the art of computational  approaches for AI systems, by describing: a) main computational characteristics of AI  systems; b) main algorithms and approaches used in AI systems, referencing use cases  contained in ISO/IEC TR 24030.     On the other hand, vertical specifications aim to address application - or sector -specific  areas  and therefore  only focus on the necessary information specific to that product  application or  sector . Such specifications, however, may be re -used in other sectors,  possibly needing adapt ation.   
    11   Example :  ETSI DES/eHEALTH -008 - eHEALTH Data recording requirements for eHealth   The aim of this work is to identify the requirements for recording eHealth events, i.e.  those  from ICT based eHealth devices and from health practitioners. On the understanding, as  illustrated in the use case document and in the White Paper, that health records are subject  to security and privacy constraints, but at the same time need to be available to many  different stakeholders across time and space without pre -cognition of who those  stakeholders are.     1.4.4 Standards dependencies   Standard specifications usually build on other already -existing standards to be cohesive,  and avoid conflicts and du plications of work. Thus, to implement a standard commonly  requires the implementation of some other, underpinning, standards; the latter,  called  second -level standards , in turn  may be connected to other foundational ones, and so on.     Commonly, a developme nt of a new standards builds on one or more underpinning  standards. The underpinning standards, in turn, may be connected to one or more  foundational standards.  This interconnectedness and layers in the development of  standards aim to ensure consistency a nd avoid duplication of work. Therefore, generally  when an AI system developer selects a first -level implementation standard, he/she  discovers one or more propaedeutic standards to comply with —the second -level  standards.     Therefore, we can define:   • First-level standard:  The standard that an organization is asked to  implement –and that commonly  build on other existing ( second  level) standard  specifications.   • Second -level standard:   The standard that an organization may be asked to  implement because it is fo undational for the implementation of another standard — e.g. a first -level standard.   Starting from  a set of first -level standards, it is possible to recognize a multi -level network  of associated/connected standards  —as showed in Figure 1, for example .     Example :    
    12   Figure 1. Example of first -level standard and its connected/referenced second -level ones   To address this challenge and support the developers in using the standards underlining  the AI Act, it would be useful to investigate the network dimension of standards —see  Recommendation 6 in Section 9.  1.5 Standard s specific to AI   According to the AI Act (AIA)  (European Commission, 2021) , ‘artificial intelligence system’  (AI system) means software that is developed with one or more of the te chniques and  approaches listed in the Annex I of the AIA and can, for a given set of human -defined  objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or decisions  influencing the environments they interact with .    
    13   2 Overall Methodology adopted   The ICT and quality management domains related to  AI systems and processes are quite  vast. Therefore, the standardisation  domain  for AI  is similarly large .  However , as stated in Section 1.1, this  study is required to identify an executa ble, effective ,  and preliminary  list of standards ( existing or under development) relevant for high -risk AI  applications t hat can be utilized to implement the European Regulatory framework on AI.    To this end , we adopted the following investigation methodo logy:  Step 1.  AI standards c ollection.  Collect existing survey studies  on AI  standardisation , directly access the ESO and international SDO portals and  documents and  gather  input from  standardisation  experts.   Step 2.  High-level analysis and mapping  to the AIA requirements  (standard  population refinement) . Analyse the collected set of AI standards and  categorize the different types of standard s into de-jure versus de -facto,  foundational versus implementation  and horizontal versus vertical specifications  (see Sections 1.4.1 -1.4.3 ).   Further r efine the list of collected standards according to three  criteria:   • consider standards dealing with AI -related risks.   • privilege horizontal implementation standards  from internatio nal SDOs  over  foundational and vertical ones ;  • consider first -level standards  (see Section 1.4.4) .  The resulting set of selected standards is mapped onto the requirements of the  AIA (see Section 4 and Section 5).   Step 3.  In depth analysis and mapping to the AIA requirements (estimation   of operationalisation  and suitability indexes of a smaller group of  standards ).  Systematically a nalyse the full text of  a smaller group of relevant  standards  (i.e. those recognized through the high -level mapping)  and estimate how  suitable they are  (presently)  to operationalise the techn ological  objectives  underpinning the AIA requirements .   Step 4.  Suitability and operationalisation  results analysis (gap recognition) .  Based on  the operationalisation  and suitability level previously estimated per  each in depth analysed standard , possible gaps (and underrepresented  AIA  requirements ) are recognized . This would originate  the formulation of preliminary  recommendations.     The outcome of Step 1  of the methodology is a general set of potentially relevant AI  standards  (i.e. the AI standard population) to be analysed  by using their metadata  information, including the abstract.  Step 2  generate s a specific  subset of the standards  population  (i.e. a selected subset of the AI standard population), which are relevant for  the AIA scope and, hence, can be mapped onto the regulatory framework requirements ;  this sub -population was assessed by the SDOs community . Step 3  evaluates in depth a  smaller group  of standards (part of the subset), calculating their suitability and  operationalisation  values. This group of standards was selected on the basis of the high level mapping results (i.e. the most promisin g ones to operationalize the AIA requirements)  and because their textual content was accessible, While the high -level analysis is based on  the standards metadata, the in -depth analysis requires the access to the standards’ text.  Finally, building on the re sults of the in -depth analysis, Step 4 recognizes essential and  core standards , some preliminary gaps , and first recommendations .  These different sub-sets will be charact erized in Section s 3-8; while  Figure 1 depicts the  entire  funnel  process.

    15   3 AI Standard s population s  3.1 Sources  for the collection of existing standards   To recognize the general  populat ion of AI -related standards, we considered several sources  and interacted with experts in the domain . In particular:   • We considered the outcomes of existing survey s on AI standardisation , e.g. the  white paper of CEN/CELEC Focus Group on AI, the final report of the H2020  StandICT .eu project  (ended in 2020) , the technical report on “Standards for AI  Governance” by the University of Oxford, the study of the AI Ethics Impact Group  on “An interdisciplinary framework to  operationalise AI ethics”, the new  StandICT.eu European Obser vatory on ICT Standards (EUOS).   • We considered e xisting scientific publications e.g. manuscripts on the Journal of ICT  Standardisation .  • We accessed the public , and sometimes restricted , websites and document sharing  tools of ESOs and SDOs. We considered ETSI, IEEE, CEN/CENELEC, ISO/IEC JTC1,  ITU-T.  • We analysed the existing roadmaps  on AI standardisation : ETSI roadmap,  CEN/CENELEC Roadmap, ISO /IEC JTC1 Roadmap, the German Standardisation   Roadmap  on Artificial Intelligence and the ITU -T AI roadmap.   • We engaged with a focus group, committees, and projects working on AI  standardisation :  ISO/IEC JTC1-SC2, EC - CEN CENELEC Focus Group on Artificial  Intelligence ; the Expert Advisory Group (EAG) of the new StandICT .eu project  (started in 2020 and funded by H2020 ), the EU-Japan AI Joint Committee , etc.  • We participated and contributed to specific event s dealing  with ICT and AI  standardisation  - e.g. the webinar on AI Standardisation  organized by DG CNECT  (Sep 2020), the JRC Workshop on Standardisation  (Dec 2020), the JRC PolicyLab  on standards (Dec 2020), the DGs GROW -CNECT -JRC meeting on Standard s (Jan  2021), etc.     3.2 Outcome of AI standards collection : the g eneral  population of AI standards   The Step 1  of the  methodology  allowed us to recognize nearly 140 specification s dealing  with AI.  These initiatives encompass both standards that directly address AI -specific issues  and standards that are more tangentially related to AI, such as standards on enabling  techno logies for AI , like for instance the standards on Big Data.   The general standardisation  population thus collected was analysed, as described in the  Step 2 of the methodology. We first categorized along the dimensions horizontal/vertical  and foundational/implementation  (as defined  in Sections 1.4.1 -1.4.3 ). We represent the  obtained categories in a bi -dimensional space in Figure 3.   
    16     Figure 3. AI-related general standards population,  obtained as the outcome of Step 1 and categorized  according th e two dimensions horizontal/vertical and foundational/implementation .    3.3 Significant subset of AI standards : the sub -population   As stated  in the  Section 1.1. of the  Introduction, the aim of the present study  is to focus  on the operationalisation  and suitability values of  ongoing  standardisation  effort s in respect   to the future EU legislation  for AI  (i.e. the proposed AIA) .  Therefore, we focused  our analysis on AI-centred standards  that deal with AI risk  characterization and mana gement , with the final aim of mapping them  to the requirements  of the proposed EU AIA.   In Step 2 of our methodology, w e identified a subset of AI standards  (about 90), adopt ing  the following criteria :  • AI-centred and deal ing with AI -related  risks;   • horizont al and  implementation standards  from international SDOs ;  • first-level standards.     In addition , only standards managed by ESOs and international SDOs were considered,  focusing on those horizontal domains  that cover the topics of the requirements proposed  for the future regulation  (see Section 4) .   This allowed us to recognize the most relevant standards for our aim, reducing the number  of specifications to be mapped on to the future  requirements of the proposed AIA .  3.4 Significant standards description   This sub-population of standards is presented  in the Annexes A -D and mapped against  the  AIA requirements , in Section 5. This high-level mapping considered also the feedbacks  provided by the international standardisation  community.      
    17   4 Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) Requirements  and applicable  Standards   4.1 AIA scope   In April 2021, the Europ ean Commission issued the proposal for a Regulation laying down  harmonised horizontal rules on artificial intelligence ( i.e. the Artificial Intelligence Act : AIA)  (European Commission, 2021) .   “By improving prediction, optimising operations and resource allocation, and personalising  service delivery, the use of artificial intelligence can support socially and environmentally  beneficial outcomes and provide key competitive advantages to companies and the  Europ ean economy  …. However, the same elements and techniques that power the socio economic benefits of AI can also bring about new risks or negative consequences for  individuals or the society ” (European Commission, 2021) .  For thes e reasons, t he proposed regulatory framework is based on a risk -based approach  and aims to strike a balance between ensuring the rights and safety of consumers whilst  avoiding being excessively prescriptive, in order to promote innovation and, especially, to  support SMEs.   This proposal delivers on the political commitment by President von der Leyen, who  announced in her political guidelines for the 2019 -2024 Commission “A Union that strives  for more”  (von der Leyen, 2019) , that t he Commission would put forward legislation for a  coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of AI.  The proposal  also responds to explicit requests from the European Parliament and the European Council,  which have repeatedly expres sed calls for legislative action to ensure a well -functioning  internal market for artificial intelligence systems (‘AI systems’) where both benefits and  risks of AI are adequately addressed at Union level.   The AIA is based on the new legislative framework.  It defines a set of objective -based  requirements that AI systems should comply with. In particular, the AIA  introduces  requirements for high -risk AI systems and obligations for operators of such systems, as  well as harmonised transparency rules for AI sys tems intended to interact with natural  persons, emotion recognition systems and biometric categorisation systems, and AI  systems used to generate or manipulate image, audio or video content.  The proposal also  lays down obligation s for providers and users of high -risk AI systems.   According to the AIA, “ Standardisation should play a key role to provide technical solutions  to providers to ensure compliance with this Regulation ” (European Commission, 2021) .   4.2 Useful definitions   A set of applicable  definitions , relevant for the purpose of this study,  are provided in Annex  H.  4.3 The requirements  for high -risk AI systems   High-risk AI systems shall comply with a set of specific requirements , established  by the  AIA (European Commission, 2021) .  Each key requirement for high -risk AI system included in the AIA is operationalised for this  study (see below)  by a streamlined explanation introducing the executive version of the  main elements of the requirement :    # Icon Requirement  theme  Executive description  
    18   1   Data and data  governance  High-risk AI systems which make use of  techniques involving the training of models with  data shall be developed on the basis of training,  validation, and testing datasets that meet a set of  quality criteria   2   Technical  documentation  The technical documentation of a high -risk AI  system shall be drawn up before that system is  placed on the market or put into service and shall  be kept up -to date.   The technical documentation shall be drawn up in  such a way to demonstrate that the high -risk AI  system complies with the AI A requirements .  3   Record -keeping  High-risk AI systems shall be designed and  developed with capabilities enabling the  automatic recording of events (‘logs’) while the  high-risk AI systems is operating. Those logging  capabilities shall conform to recognised standards  or common specifications.   4   Transparency and  provision of  information to  users  High-risk AI systems shall be designed and  developed in such a way to ensure that their  operation is sufficiently transparent to enable  users to interpret the system’s output and use it  appropriately. An app ropriate type and degree of  transparency shall be ensured, with a view to  achieving compliance with the relevant  obligations of the user and of the provider set out  in Chapter 3 of (European Commission, 2021)   5   Human oversight  High-risk AI systems shall be designed and  developed in such a way, including with  appropriate human -machine interface tools, that  they can be effectively overseen by natural  persons during the period in which the AI system  is in use   6   Accurac y,  robustness , and  cybersecurity  High-risk AI systems shall be designed and  developed in such a way that they achieve, in the  light of their intended purpose, an appropriate  level of accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity,  and perform consistently in those  respects  throughout their lifecycle   7   Risk management  system  An assessment through internal checks for ‘stand alone’ high -risk AI systems would require a full,  effective and properly documented ex ante  compliance with all requirements of the regulation   and compliance with robust quality and risk  management systems and post -market  monitoring . A risk management system shall be  established, implemented, documented, and  maintained in relation to high -risk AI systems   
    19   8   Quality  management  system  Providers of high -risk AI systems shall put a  quality management system in place that ensures  compliance with this Regulation.  The provider  should establish a sound quality management  system, ensure the accomplishment of the  required conformity assessment procedure, draw  up the relevant documentation and establish a  robust post -market monitoring system .       In the next section, the existing standardisation work, considered relevant to the AIA   scope , is mapped onto the diverse requirements. A full descriptio n of the mapped standards  is provided in Annexes A -D, each annex focusing on a n SDO.    
    20   5 High -level mapping of the significant AI standards onto the AIA  requirements   5.1 Mapping Overview   In this section, the introduced  AI standards (i.e.  the sub-population introduced  in Section  3.3 and described in the Annexes A -D) are mapped onto the AIA requirements.  The highlevel mapping is overviewed  in Table 1.  In Annex E, the standards mapped for each requirement are reported (i.e. a requirement based view). While, in Annex F, a SDO -based view repor ts the mapping characterizing each  SDO.    Table 1.

Moreover, the  publication of new AI standards will remain significant at least until 2024.     Figure 4: Yearly distribution of standard publication or expected publication. The numbers for years  2021-2024 are provisional, based on the specifications’ metadata.      5.3 Mapping limitations and detailed analysis   The high -level mapping summarized in Table 1 represents a first analysis  of the standards  that are relevant for the application of the AIA requirements . However, this high -level  mapping  does not provide information about which part(s) of the requirement(s) each  standard addresses nor to what extent.   The mapping mainly builds on the abstracts of the analysed standard and on the general  description of the AIA requirements. Finally, the map ping by category (as represented in  Table 1) includes all the experts’ evaluations, not making any attempt at resolving possible  divergences  between expert’s opinions .  
    22   The next section analyses in detail the  specific relevance of the identified  standards in  respect to the AIA requirements . This analysis considers:   (a) the full text of the standards;   (b) a structured version of the legal description of the AIA requirements;   (c) a less “subjective” procedure.     This development is described in the next section.       
    23   6 In-depth analysis  and mapping   6.1 Methodology   6.1.1  Standards operationalisation  and s uitability calculation   This section deals with a s ystematic analys is of relevant standards to estimate how suitable  they are for operationaliz ing the AI A requirements.  Interestingly, for a given standard, the  generated suitability index  can vary over time, reflecting content modification —as is the  case of working items that s till can evolve and include new topics .  The methodology applied to estimate the suitability indexes of identified  AI standards and  understand possible gaps (and then propose recommendations) consists of several steps,  as also depicted in Figure 5:  • Step 1. From unstructured to semi -structured requirements  From the  unstructured (legal -oriented) text of the AIA, we generated  semi-structured clauses  in order to allow for the identification of core concepts and clauses, as well as the   establishing of a hierarchy  of clauses (and sub -clauses) .   • Step 2. Relevant keyword identification  From Step 1, we isolate relevant  keywords char acterizing each requirement. Furthermore, we also extend the list  including technical words pertinent to the given requirement.   • Step 3. Automatic text mining  The keyword lists, curated at Step 2, are the  input for a code that searches for occurrences and, where relevant, co -occurrences  of the keywords in the specification’s text. The code also checks for a «positional»  score, i.e. assessing the relevance of a keyword also depending on its position in  the text. The code returns the keywords that were retriev ed as well as their context  for a better understanding of their significance.   • Step 4. Expert control  The results of Step 3 provide a guidance to experts in  the manual review of the recognized specifications:  in the review, the specifications  are read and the matching keywords are assessed in their context to evaluate their  relevance with respect to the requirements.   • Step 5. Operationalisation  index calculation  The operationalisation  index is  calculated according to Equation s (2), (3), and (4).  These indexes provide a  quantitative estimation of how relevant a standard is in turning the abstract AIA  requirements  into observables  rules and features.   • Step 6. Suitability  index calculation  The suitability index is calculated  according to Equation (1). These indexes provide a  numeric  estimation  of the  analysed suitability , based on a set of standard traits . In particular, the suitability  index combines the previous calculated operationalisation  index with few maturity  and domain characteristics of the standard.   • Step 7. Possible gap recognition and recommendations  An overall a nalysis  of the standard suitability indexes, along with the analysis of the operationalisation   indexes, for each of the eigh t AIA requirements, allows to recognize possible gaps  and draw some recommendations.     The algorithms  to calculate the operationalisation  and suitability indexes are discussed in  the next paragraphs.  
    24     Figure 5. Methodology to analyse the operationalisation  and then the suitability indexes  characterizing the AI standards recognized in the high -level mapping     6.1.2 Suitability index   For each analysed standard , a suitability index (Si)  is achieved by applying the followi ng  formula:     𝑆𝑖 =𝑤1∗𝑂𝑖+𝑤2∗𝐷𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑖𝑛  𝑔𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦 +𝑤3∗𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒  𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 +𝑤4∗𝑇𝑦𝑝𝑜𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑦 +𝑤5∗𝑀𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑚 [0 ≤𝑤𝑛≤1] ;     𝑚=𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑚𝑎𝑙𝑖𝑧𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟 ;; } (1)    Where wn are weighting factors use d to give more importance to some aspects in relation  to others. This is the case of the Operationalisation  aspect  -which is evaluated by means  of a total Operationalisation  index (Oi) .    The final goal is to develop a proximity diagram acknowledging which current specifications  are presently closer to the AI act needs -as represented in  Figure s 16 and 17 .      All the parameters composin g the suitability index (see formula (1)) are described in the  following paragraphs.   
    25   6.1.2.1  Compliance management  (characterizing a standard )  For the scope of this study, compliance means conforming to a specification  or standard .  Compliance management is the pro cess, utilized by relevant stakeholders and third parties,  to ensure the compliance with a given specification or standard.   Given a t echnical specification  or a standard , to measure how extensively a system or a  product implements that, it is necessary to define a compliance management process including activities such  as: audits, reports and supporting documentation, compliance  procedures, and compliance tests.   The importance of this parameter depends  on the future development  (and adequacy)  of  standalone conformity assessment standards , specifically targeting  the AI Act -for example  under possible future CEN -CENELEC JTC21 activity.   The existence of a formal compliance management process (or not) will characterize this  dimension. Where a compliance management process exists but is not complete or fully  formalized, intermediate values are possible.   According to ISO we can recognize three main instruments  addressing providers a nd third  parties (e.g. conformity assessment b odies), respectively.   For Providers :  • Testing : the determination of one or more of an object or product’s characteristics  and is usually performed by a laboratory. For example, many people have their  blood tested which involves analysing the blood against a  number of characteristics  such as whether it shows the presence of a disease, or genetic disorder. ISO CASCO  has developed a number of standards that laboratories can follow to help ensure  that their results can be trusted.   • Inspection : describes the regul ar checking of a product to make sure it meets  specified criteria. Fire extinguishers, for example, need regular inspections to  ensure they are safe for use. ISO CASCO has developed a number of standards that  inspection bodies can follow to help ensure tha t we can trust their work.   For Third parties  (example, conformity assessment body) :  • Certification : the provision by an independent body of written assurance (a  certificate) that the product, service or system in question meets specific  requirements. Certif ication is also known as third party conformity assessment .  Many companies and organizations decide to get certified to one of existing  management system standards, such as ISO 9001. This is a way of showing  outsiders that the organisation has an effective  quality management system in  place.   6.1.2.2  Standard Typology   There exist several different types of deliverables (e.g. documents) written, approved, and  published by SDOs. In this context, a document is a standardisation  draft or publication ,  produced  by an SDO . For the scope of this study, in order of relevance, we acknowledge  the following  types of documents :  • Harmonized standard : are European standards produce d (by an ESO)  in response  to an EC standardisation  request  (ETSI, 2021) . They provide the technical detail  necessary to achieve the ‘essential requirements’ of an EC legislation . They are thus  key enablers of the European Single Market.   • International standard : a standard that is adopted  by an international  standardizing/standards organization and made available to the public  (IEC, 2021) .  A standard is document  (containing technical requirements)  (ETSI, 2021) ,  established by consensus and approved by a recognized body, that provides, for 
    26   common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their  results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context   (IEC, 2021)                                                              .  An International Standard can take many forms. Apart from product standards,  other examples include: test methods, codes of practice, guideline standards and  management systems standards  (ISO, 2021) .  • Technical specification : a specification address ing work still under technical  development, or where it is believed that there will be a future, but not immediate,  possibility of agreement on an International Standard. A Technical Specification is  published for immediate use, but it also provides a means t o obtain feedback. The  aim is that it will eventually be transformed and republished as an International  Standard  (ISO, 2021)                             .   A Technical Specification is a document containing technical requiremen ts (ETSI,  2021) , for which there is the future possibility of agreement on an International  Standard, but for which at present (IEC, 2021) :   o the required support for approval as an International Standar d cannot be  obtained;   o there is doubt on whether consensus has been achieved;   o the subject matter is still under technical development, or   o there is another reason precluding immediate publication as an International  Standard.   For some SDOs, a technical speci fication is produced  when it is important that it is  available for use quickly  (ETSI, 2021) . Commonly, a  technical specification  is  approved by the Technical Committee that drafted it , only (ETSI, 2021) .  • Publicly Available Specification : as with Technical Specifications, Publicly  Available Specifications  (PAS)  are published for immediate use and also serve as a  means to obtain feedback for an eventual transformation into an International  Standard  (ISO, 2021) . PAS is a document to respond to an urgent market need,  representing either (IEC, 2021) :  o a consensus in an organization external to the SDOs that publishes the  specification, or   o a consensus of the experts within a working group.   In the case of ISO, PAS  has a maximum life of six years, after which they can be  transformed into an International Standard or withdrawn  (ISO, 2021) .  • Guide : a document giving rules, orientation, advice or recommendations relating  to international standar disation  (IEC, 2021) . A Guide helps readers understand  more about the main areas where standards add value. Some Guides talk about  how, and why, standards can make it work better, safer, and more efficiently  (ISO,  2021) . Commonly, it is submitted to the whole SDO membership for approval  (ETSI,  2021) .  • Technical report : a document containing collected data of a different kind from  that normally published as an International Sta ndard or Technical Specification   (IEC, 2021) . It may include data obtained from a survey, for example, or from an  informative report, or information of the perceived “state of the art”  (ISO, 2021) .  Commonly, it is u sed when the document contains explanatory material  and i s  approved by the Technical Committee that drafted it  (ETSI, 2021) .  6.1.2.3  Domain  generality  (of a Standard )  As in many  other standardisation  domains, there may be two levels of AI standardisation   activities: one dealing with general issues that apply in a cross -cutting way to several areas 
    27   (horizontal ) and another dealing with more specific issues relevant to a given sect or of  activity , application , or technology  area ( vertical ).   A horizontal specification  contains fundamental principles, concepts, definitions and similar  general information that aims to be applicable over a broad set of subject area s and/or  technological  frameworks .  On the other hand, vertical specifications aim to address application  or sector -specific areas   and, therefore , only concern the necessary information specific to that product application  or sector  -including technological sectors . Naturally, it is possible to have mixed situation:  a standard  that introduces some horizontal recommendations or rules, as well as some   other vertical ones.    Generally , the distinction between horizontal and vertical scopes can be done ( in a different   mode) for both  the application and technological domain s. While for the application domain  the distinction is immediate ( e.g. two verticals  healthcare or transport domains), in the  case of technology domain, the discriminant deals with the generality level of the  technological solution and/or reference framework considered in the analysed standard  (e.g. Machine -Learning versus v  Deep-Learning  technologies, Narrow AI versus logic  approaches for AI AI).   Therefore, it is possible to distinguish four topical situations, as described in Table 2.     Table 2.

This track determines the timeframe of the specification project (e.g.  18, 24, or 36 months) as it passes through the various stages to publication (ISO, 2020) .  For example, the main stages of ISO life cycle are, in order:   1. PRELIMINARY   2. PROPOSAL   3. PREPARATORY   4. COMMITTEE   5. ENQUIRY   6. APPROVAL   7. PUBLICATION   6.1.2.5  Operationalisation  index  (characterizing a standard )  For the scope of this study, operationalisation  means turning  abstract concepts into  measurable observations .   Given a textual requirement (e.g. one of the AIA  design principle or policy  requirements ),  the operationalisation  process defines its extension s by describing what is and is not an  instance of that requirement . Standards should specify  how to operationalize and measure 
    28   design principles and policies expressed via textual requirements  -as in the case of the  AIA.   Figure 5 describes the methodology applied to evaluate the operationalisation  level of a  set of acknowledged specifications.     6.1.2.6  Methodology  for the operationalisation  index a nalysis   The analysis of the  standards and their alignment  to the AIA requirements is performed  both manually and automatically  (as depicted in  Figure 5) and is expressed by a total  Operationalisation  index (Oi)  calculated for each standard as the result of the combination   of its operationalisation  level for the eight different requirements (see Equation s (2), (3),  and (4)). The total operationalisation  index  considers  only those requ irements which the  standard operationalizes —i.e. the operationalisation  indicators that are different from zero   (𝑂𝑖𝑘≠0):    ∀ standard  𝑠,𝑂𝑖(𝑠)= ∑ 𝑂𝑖(𝑠)𝑘8 𝑘=1 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 (𝑠) ;  where 𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟 (𝑠)= |𝑂𝑖(𝑠)𝑘 ≠0| ;   } (2)    ∀ standard  𝑠 and ∀ AIA requirement  𝑘,𝑂𝑖(𝑠,𝑘)𝑙= ∑ 𝜃(𝑠,𝑘)𝑙𝑛 𝑙=1 𝑛;     𝑤ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑒     𝑙(𝑘)= subrequirements  of requirement  𝐾;1≤𝑙(𝑘)≤𝑛;} (3)    𝜃(𝑠,𝑘)𝑙 = set of acknowledged  textual  statements  (of 𝑠)that  matches  subrequirement  𝑙(𝑘);   𝜃(𝑠,𝑘)𝑙 ={0 𝑖𝑓 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 𝑙= ∅ 1 𝑖𝑓 𝑡𝑒𝑥𝑡 𝑙≠ ∅} ; } (4)      The objective of operationalisation  index estimation is to provide, per each AIA  requirement, a radar diagram showing the analy sed standards  that are “closer ” to the  different requirement aims -see for example  Figure 7.  It is important to observe that, in Equation (2), the operationalisation  index for a given  standard is normalized by the number of requirements the standard is relevant for, instead  of normal izing by the total number of requirements. This choice avoids the penalization of  standards that are relevant just for a subset of requirements by avoiding to dilute their  weight with a uniform normalization across all standards.       
    29   7 Semi-structured AIA req uirements   7.1 Executive version of the AIA requirements  and the related k eyword list s  The AIA defines a set of requirements, which  are presented  as a (unstructured ) text  formulated for being discussed and approved by legal experts . Therefore, in the scope of  the detailed analysis, to facilitate the mapping of standards content onto the different  requirement prescriptive parts, it was necessary to further structure the requirements  content, creating an executive version of that.   Executive version of requirement consists of a set of hierarchically structured sub requirements -abbreviated as SR.#.#  (for example: SR.1  or SR.1.1 ). They are 24 and are  formally structured according to the model  showed in Figure 6:       Figure 6. Semi -structured model applied to generate the executive version of the AIA requirements     The executive version of the requirements was instrumental  to generate a list of  representative keywords to ingest the data mining procedure  and extract the relevant  content of the analysed standards.     7.1.1 R1.

    35   8 Results of the in -depth mapping and gap identification   8.1 Artificial Intelligence concepts and terminology   Defying artificial intelligence discipline and concepts is still an ongoing effort for the  international scientific community1. The AIA provides  (for the first time)  a legal definition  of AI system , which guide d our work and analysis :   “ ‘artificial intelligence system’ (AI system) means software that is developed with  one or  more of the techniques and approaches listed in Annex I and can, for a given set of human defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or  decisions influencing the environments they interact with “.   The in -depth analys is largely focuses on ISO/IEC standards managed by the JRC1/SC42  (Artificial Intelligence). This sub -committee has developed a specific standard (in the  enquire phase) dealing with “Artificial intelligence concepts and terminology ” (i.e. ISO/IEC  DIS 22989 ). This standard defines AI from both an engineering and a disciplinary point of  view. It is a foundational standard to be refenced by the other ISO standards dealing with  AI. According to the present draft of ISO/IEC DIS 22989 , AI is a “ set of met hods or  automated entities that together build, optimize and apply a model so that the system can,  for a given set of predefined tasks, compute predictions, recommendations, or decisions.  AI systems are designed to operate with varying levels of automation ”.  Both ISO/IEC engineering definition of AI and the AIA definition of AI system build on the  concept of software modeling and introduce the aim of computing predictions and  generating recommendations or decisions to influence the external environment .  8.2 Operationalisation  and suitability analysis results   For each analy sed standard, a fiche was generated reporting the respective  operationalisation  and suitability values. All the generated fiches are reported in Annex es  G1 and G2 .   A fiche of a given standard consists of:   (a) A text table summarizing the standard values for all the parameters composing the  suitability index.   (b) A spider  map depicting the operationalisation  values against each of the eight AIA  requirements and the other suitability parameter values.   (c) A text table containing  the summary of the AIA sub -requirements affected by the  standard context (as acknowledged by the supervised data mining p rocedure) .      1 The European Commission, in its AI strategy communication (European Commission,  2020),  considered the following definition: “Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to systems that display   intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions – with some degree  of  autonomy – to achieve specific goals. AI -based systems can be purely software -based,  acting in the  virtual world (e.g. voice assistants, imag e analysis software, search engines,  speech and face  recognition systems) or AI can be embedded in hardware devices (e.g.  advanced robots, autonomous  cars, drones or Internet of Things applications).”  Subsequently, this definition was refined by the  European High Level Expert Group on AI:  “Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are software (and  possibly also hardware) systems  designed by humans that, given a complex goal, act in the physical  or digital dimension by  perceiving their environment through data acquisition, interpreting the  collected structured  or unstructured data, reasoning on the knowledge, or processing the  information, derived  from this data and deciding the best action(s) to take to achieve the given goal.  AI systems  can either use sym bolic rules or learn a numeric model, and they can also adapt their   behaviour by analysing how the environment is affected by their previous actions.” (Highlevel  Expert  Group on Artificial Intelligence, 2019)    
    36   (d) A text table fully mapping the relevant content  of the standard  (as acknowledged  by the supervised data mining procedure ) and the AIA sub -requirements -in their  semi-structured form.   Due to IPR reasons, in Annex es G1 and G2  only the first three results  are included in this  public report .    Analysing the operationalisation  and suitability indexes , their distribution  in respect to the  AIA requirements , and (in general ) the fiche mapping tables, it is possible to recognize  some gaps.   8.3 Operationalisation  gaps   While the total operationalisation  index of a standard (i.e Oi) contribute s to form the  suitability index, t he operationalisation  indexes calculated against each AIA requirement   (i.e. 𝑂𝑖𝑘), are useful  to understand the most promising standards and  the existing gaps at the level of specific requirements and sub -requirements. To visualize the result of such  an analysis , a set of radar diagrams shows the “distance” distribution of the processed  standards , in the respect of each AIA requirement  objectives  -see Figures  Figure 7-Figure  14.  To appreciate the possible gaps at the sub -requirement level ( see the executive version of  the AIA requirements, in Section 7), the mapping among the processed  standards and the  sub-requirements is reported in Table 19.

Fourteen  stand ards performed well resulting with a high or very high operationalisation  level for one  AIA requirement, at least.   For five out of eight AIA requirements , the radar diagrams  “detect ” standards with a very  high level of  operationalisation  (more or equal to  0.7). The se requirements  are:  “Transparency and information to users” , “Human Oversight”, “Accuracy, robustness and  cybersecurity”,  “Risk Management System”, and  “Quality Management System” .  For the remaining  three requirements (i.e. “Data and Dat a Governance”, “Technical  Documentation” , and “Record Keeping”) the diagrams detect  standards with a high level  of operationalisation  (from 0.5 to 0.7).   All the standards with a very high operationalisation  index are ISO/IEC specifications. The  ETSI standa rds, characterized by  a good value of operationalisation , interest  principally a  couple of requirements: “Data and Data Governance” and “Accuracy, robustness and  cybersecurity”.  This is consistent with the three key areas on which the ETSI SAI ( Securing  Artificial Intelligence ) focus: using AI to enhance security, mitigating against attacks that  leverage AI, and securing AI itself from attack.   Noteworthy, although for the standar d ISO/IEC 24372 many relevant paragraphs  were  recognized , their content was not considered effective for operationalizing the AIA  requirements. This is consistent with the typology and maturity of the document , which is   a draft technical report.   Four stand ards are characterized by a very high operationalisation  levels (ISO/IEC 5 338;  ISO/IEC 5469; ISO/IEC 4213; ISO/IEC 24029 -1). In particular, ISO/IEC 5469 results  extremely close to the objectives of two requirements: “Accuracy, Robustness, and  
    44   Cybersecurity ” and “Risk Management System”.  Interestingly, ISO/IEC 24029 -1 has a very  high operationalisation  value for the Requirement 6 “Accuracy, robustness and  cybersecurity” but the total operationalisation  index value is low because of its very low  impact on all  the other requirements.    Naturally, we do not expect to find a standard that covers all the requirements; therefore,  standards with a high operationalisation  for one requirement result extremely relevant for  the AIA regulation. This consideration guided t o the definition of the group of  “operationalisation  essential standards” .  8.3.1.2  The group of operationalisation  essential standards   Looking at  the standard fiches (see Annexes G1 and G2), it is possible to recognize which  standards have a very high operationalisation  value for the single AIA requirements.  It is  useful to recognizing a set of essential  standards that provide a very high  operation alisation  value  for at least one AIA requirement  (i.e. score  ≥ 5.5 ):  • ISO/IEC 4213   • ISO/IEC 5259 -3  • SO/IEC 5338   • ISO/IEC 5469   • ISO/IEC 23894 -2  • ISO/IEC 24027   • ISO IEC 24029 -1  • ISO/IEC 38507   • ISO/IEC 42001   This set of standards (referred in the rest of the document as the group of  operationalisation  essential standards ) provides the best baseline to operationalize  the AIA requirements.    The group  of operationalisation  essential standards does not cover the f irst three  AIA requirements (i.e. i.e. “Data and Data Governance”, “Technical Documentation” , and  “Record Keeping” ), as already discussed. This can be recognized as a gap in the view  of identifying future standardisation  needs .    Table 20.

However, at the sub -requirement  level  (see Table 19), the investigation outl ined that this is true  only for some of their   sub-requirements (clear gaps) :   • (Req 1) Data and data governance:   o SR.2: High-risk AI systems not using techniques involving models training   ▪ Management practices   ▪ Data governance practices   • (Req 2) Technical documentation:   o SR.2: High-risk AI system   ▪ The existence of only one technical documentation file   • (Req 7) Risk management system   o S.4: User’s age   ▪ accessibility to children  
    46       A further discussion  dealing with  the single AIA requirements is the subject of  the next  paragraphs.     8.3.1.3  “Technical documentation ”  and “Record keeping” requirements   “Technical documentation” and “Record keeping” requirements have a low  operationalisation , being operationalized by, respectively, three standards and two  standards; furthermore, the sub-requirement 2  (SR.2)  concerning the uniqueness of the  technical documentation is not mentioned in any of the recognized specifications. However,  as the AIA itself prescribes in detail the necessary elements of the technical docu mentation  (by virtue of a dedicated annex)  a specific standard capturing this requirement may not be  necessary.  This is in fact not a domain traditionally covered by standardisation  in product  legislation.   8.3.1.4  “Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity” and “Data and data governance” requirements   These requirements are characterized by the highest number of standards within the High  and Medium operationalisation  categories : indeed “Accuracy, robustness and  cybersecurity” and “Data and data governance” are, for AI systems, pivotal concepts and,  therefore, a lot of standardisation  work addresses them, directly or indirectly.   However, for “Data and data governance”, Table 19 shows how the sub-requirement 2   (SR.2) , dealing with AI systems not requiring model training, is not mentioned in the  analysed specifications. This is the reason for not having very high operation standards for  this requirement. On the ot her hand, “Accuracy, robustness and cybersecurity” is very well  operationalized, by four standards with operationalisation  larger than 0.7.   8.3.1.5  “Quality Management System” and “Risk management system” requirements   Both “Risk Management Systems” (RMS) and “Qual ity management systems” (QMS) are  very well covered, with respectively five and seven standards in the zone with  operationalisation  larger than 0.5.   This is not surprising as they build on the extensive pre -existing standardisation  literature  addressing R MS and QMS in the software and big data context, hence many of the analysed  standards are a natural extension of them in the context of AI. It is, however, noteworthy  that the sub-requirement 4 (SR.4)  of RMS, dealing with children’s accessibility to AI  products and services is absent from the analysed specifications.   Finally , in the case of QMS, while the sub -requirements SR.1.1 is well covered (12  standards), the more general and holistic requirement (SR.1) is covered partially only.   8.3.1.6  “Human Oversight” req uirement   The “Human Oversight” is operationalized by three standards with operationalisation  larger  than 0.7. However, the recognized standards give mostly a broad guidance in carrying out  such oversight, in line with the horizontality of the considered st andards.   A higher degree of operationalisation  for human oversight of an AI system may imply  taking into account the specificities of the AI application, therefore involving more vertical  considerations which could partially explain its relative limited coverage in our analysis,  where we focused on ho rizontal standards.  To address the operationalisation  level required  by the AI system developers, a set of vertical standards (addressing specific application  domain and technological frameworks) might be required to be follow —see also one of the  final recommendations.  
    47   8.3.2 Total Operationalisation  index (southe rn hemisphere)   To calculate a unique and holistic operationalisation  value that characterizes each standard,  the eight operationalisation  indicators are combined according to  Equation  (2) (see Section  8.3) determin ing the Total Operationalisation  index (i.e. Oi). According to our  methodology, t his parameter contribute s to calculate the Suitability index of a given  standard. The Oi values  (representing each standard)  are reported in the last column of   Table 20. According to this parameter, i t is possible to distinguish three groups of  standards:   • Standards with a High total operationalisation  (≥ 0.7)   • Standards with a Medium total operationalisation  (0.5≤O<0.7)   • Standards with a Low total operationalisation  (<0.5)     It is worth noticing that our choice of normalization for the Total Operationalisation  index  avoids penalising sta ndards with a high operationalisation  score in just a subset of  requirements: as it is possible to observe in Table 20, the Medium and High total  operationalisation  score correlates with having one or more requirements with a high  operationalisation , with the sole exception of ISO/IEC 5259 -3, which stands as an outlier.   Two standards are characterized by a high total operationalisation  value (i.e. ISO/IEC  42001 and ISO/IEC 38507) . Nine standards have a medium total operationalisation  value,  five from ISO/IE C and four from ETSI.  Only three standards have a total operationalisation   value equal to zero.       
    48   8.4 Suitability gaps   As discussed in section 6.1.2 (Suitability index methodology), the suitability index is the  result of the (weighted ) contribution of some traits characterizing the analy sed standard ;  traits that  are considered important for implement ing the AIA . The total operational index  is only one of th ese traits,  although extremely important.   For each analy sed standard, a spider  diagram (introduced  in Annexes G1 and G2 ) shows  the value of the parameters  contributing to the suitability  index. For example, the spider  diagram of the standard ISO/IEC 24668 is depicted in Figure 15.     Figure 15. The spider diagram of standard ISO/IEC 24668, showing the values of the suitability index  factors.   The northern hemisphere deals with the standard maturity , typology,  and domain  application aspects (see Section 6.1.2 ), while the southern hemisphere contains the  operationalisation  levels of the standard in respect to the eight AIA requirements  —the  combination of which generates the total operational index . The weigh ted combination of  the values of the two hemisphere quantifies  the suitability index.   The calculated suitability indicators  can be plotted  in a radar diagram , which  shows  the  “proximity”  (i.e. relevance)  of each standard  to the AIA objectives  —see Figure 16 and  Figure 17. The depicted radar diagrams  distinguish among four “proximity” range  categories, defining four corresponding groups of standards:   • Standards characterized by a High suitability  level (𝑆𝑖 ≥ 0.5)  • Standards characterized by a Medium  suitability  level (0.5< 𝑆𝑖≤0.4)  • Standards characterized by a Low suitability  level (0.4<𝑆𝑖≤0.3)  • Standards characterized by a Very Low suitability  level (0.3<𝑆𝑖≤0.1)  8.4.1 Southern hemisphere contribution to the suitability index  (the total operationalisation   index)   The contribution of the southern hemisphere to the Suitability index is equal to  the total  operationalisation  index. This complex indicator is calculated from the operationalisation   indicators computed  against the eight AIA requirements —see Equation s (2), (3), (4).   To make the total operationalisation  index meaningful  and consistent with the  requirements operationalisation  indicators,  it is important to note that:   
    49   (a) The eight requirements are not independent each other, covering (in different  combinations) common subjects. Therefore, it is common that a standard results  relevant for more than one requirement.   (b) If a given standard is associated to a high operationalisation  indicator for one  requirement, this value is effectively weighted in the calculation of the total  operational index  —by a specific normalization strategy .   (c) Consistently, for the total operational index cal culation,  operationalisation  indicator s  equal to zero are not considered —see Equation (2).  As a result, the total operationalisation  index es provide holistic values that are consistent  with the operationalisation  indicators discussed in the previous section.   The total operationalisation  index is  a key parameter for calculating the suitability index,  thus, its (normalized) weighing factor is always assumed to be 1.  In addition, w here the  total operationalisation  index is equal to zero, also the suitability index must be considered  equal to zero.   8.4.2 Northern hemisphere contribution to the suitability index   It is reasonable  to think of (and create)  different  suitability indexes considering  the diverse   concerns  that distinguish the different  stakeholders to ensure the development of a well functioning internal market for AI systems , where both benefits and risks of AI  are  adequately addressed at Union level .   This is achieved by assigning different weight to the parameters belonging to the northern  hemisphere  —as anticipated the operational index weight is always taken equal to 1 . In  this document, w e adopted the viewp oint of a couple of important (and broad) stakeholder   categories  and generated two different  suitability indexes  showed in the radar plots of  Figure 16 and Figure 17.   8.4.3 Viewpoint #1: EU regulatory framework implementers   These stakeholders are mainly concerned about the European and International  standardisation  process to u nderpin the regulatory framework and implement the AIA.   Considering that the AIA was released in April 2021,  and the regulatory framework will  likely not be adopted before 2023, it is reasonable  to decide that the maturity level of the  present standards ( along with the existence of compliance tools) are not essential  — according to ISO, “f rom first proposal to final publication, developing a standard usually  takes about 3 years ”.   This leads to assign the following values for calculating a suitability index  that is much  more concerned about the operationalisation  level:     w1 =1; w2=0.7 /4; w3=0.5 /4; w4=1 /4; w5=0.3 /4;    In a nutshell, the sum of all the (weighted) contributions belonging to the northern  hemisphere would, at most, equal the total operationalisation  contribution (i.e. the  southern hemisphere part). The radar diagram showing the resulting suitability indexes is  depicted in  Figure 16. 
    50     Figure 16. Radar diagram of the suitability levels characterizing the analysed standards, from the  point of view of regulatory framework implementation stakeholders  (ETSI standards are represented  as pink boxes, while ISO/IEC standards have a white background)       8.4.4 Viewpoint #2: AI s ystem d evelopers   The viewpoint of an AI system developer is concerned about finding an actual standard  that is already mature and provides a good level of operationalisation  of the AIA  requirements, with which she/he wants to comply . Naturally, the existence of compliance  instruments would be an important element to be considered, too.   To reflect these needs, t he weighting values giv e more importance to the present maturity  level, as long as the operationalisation  value is acceptable :    w1 =1; w2=0.7/0.25; w3=0.5/0.25; w4=1/0.25; w5=0.3/0.25;     In a nutshell , in the respect of the previous configuration, the contribution of the northern  hemisphere is amplified  (by a factor 4)  compared  to the southern one (i.e. the total  operationalisati on value). The radar diagram showing the resulting suitability indexes is  depicted in Figure 17.  
    51     Figure 17. Radar diagram of the suitability levels characterizing the analysed standards, from the  point of view of AI system developers  (ETSI standards are represe nted as pink boxes, while ISO/IEC  standards have a white background)     8.4.5 Discussion   A couple of standards suitability maps were calculated by reflecting two important and  different viewpoints. In both cases 19 (out of 22) standards are mapped.   In the perspec tive of who must implement the AIA reference framework , the 19 standards  are in general more suitable  (e.g. more standards with a high and medium suitability level  and no standard with a very low suitability value) than in the view of AI system developers.   In other words, in the radar map the standards are “closer” to the AI act gravitational point   —this is due to the good values calculated for the total operationalisation  index. While in  the second radar map, the standards are more dispersed because of the  diverse maturity  levels associated to the standards.   It is worthy to note that in both cases  (i.e. adopting two quite different point of views) , the  high suitab ility standards remain  the same (with the only exception of ISO/IEC TS4313).  A similar remark  can be done for the medium  suitab ility standards (with two exceptions,  this time). This invariance suggests the opportunity to recognizing  a group  of essential  standards that result  suitable, despite the viewp oint considered :  • ISO/IEC 23894 -2  • ISO/IEC 5338   • ISO/IEC 42001   • ISO/IEC 38507   • ISO/IEC 4213   • ISO/IEC 5259 -2  • ISO/IEC 5259 -4  • ISO/IEC 24668   • ISO/IEC 24027     This set of standards  (referred  in the rest of the document as the group of suitability  essential standards ) provides  the best compromise between operationalisation  and  
    52   maturity levels . The requirements and sub -requirements operationalisation  provided by  this group of important standards is represented in Table s 19 and 20 .   With reference to Figure 18, both the groups of operationalisation  and suitability essential  standards consist of nine elements . The intersection of the two sets contains six common  elements :  • ISO/IEC 4213   • SO/IEC 5338   • ISO/IEC 23894 -2  • ISO/IEC 24027   • ISO/IEC 38507   • ISO/IEC 42001   This group of standards may be indicated as the group of core standards       Figure 18. The relationship between the groups of operational/suitability essential standards and the  core ones.     According to our study, these are the three groups of standards recognized as the most  relevant ones, pres ently. Immediately after these standards , it is useful to also consider   the standards (eight ones) that showed a medium operationalisation  index —as  documented in Table 20.  9 Conclusion s and Recommendations   In this technical report an overview of the present AI standard s landscape  was briefly  provided. A high-level analysis was carried out to map the introduced st andards  
    53   onto the eight requirements defined by the AIA2. For this version of the report, only  ISO/IEC JTC1 -SC42 standards and ETSI SAI standards were analysed by the study.   To refine th e mapping and understand possible gaps, an in-depth analysis was carried  out using  a supervised analytical methodology to calculate the operationalisation   and suitability level of a set of international standards to implement the requirements  introduced by the AIA .  The supervised analytical procedure allowed to recognize the significant paragraphs  connecting each analy sed standard to the eight AIA requirements .   Our analysis found that many relevant standards exist (already published or in the  pipeline).  Therefore,  the AIA requirement operationalisation  can build on existing  efforts .  Table 21. Summary of the relevant standards for the AIA key requirements (in bold, standards  already  published or in final draft status )  Requirement  Very high/high operationalisation  standards   Data and data  governance  ISO/IEC TS 4213, ISO/IEC 5259 -2, ISO/IEC 5259 -3, ISO/IEC 5259 4, ISO/IEC 5338, ISO/IEC 5469, ISO/IEC 23894.2, ISO/IEC 24027,  ISO/IEC 24029 -1, ISO/IEC 24668, ISO/IEC 38507, ISO/IEC 42001,  ETSI SAI 002, ETSI SAI 005   Technical  documentation  ISO/IEC 23894.2, ISO/IEC 24027, ISO/IEC 42001   Record  keeping  ISO/IEC 23894.2   Transparency  and  information to  users  ISO/IEC 23894.2, ISO/IEC 24027, ISO/IEC 24028 , ISO/IEC 38507,  ISO/IEC 42001   Human  oversight  ISO/IEC 23894.2, ISO/IEC 38507, ISO/IEC 42001   Accuracy  robustness  and  cybersecurity  ISO/IEC TS 4213, ISO/IEC 5338, ISO/IEC 5469, ISO/IEC 23894.2,  ISO/IEC 24029 -1, ISO/IEC 24668, ISO/IEC 42001, ETSI SAI 002,  ETSI SAI 003, ETSI SAI 005 , ETSI SAI 006   Risk  management  system  ISO/IEC 5338, ISO/IEC 5469, ISO/IEC 23894.2, ISO/IEC 38507,  ISO/IEC 42001   Quality  management  system  ISO/IEC 5259 -3, ISO/IEC 5259 -4, ISO/IEC 5338, ISO/IEC 23894.2,  ISO/IEC 24029 -1, ISO/IEC 38507, ISO/IEC 42001       2 i.e. “Data and data governance”, “Technical Documentation”, “Record keeping”,  “Transparency and provision of information to users”, “Human oversight”, “Accuracy,  robustness, and cybersecurity”, “Risk management system”, “Quality management  system ” (European Commission, 2021)  
    54     However, t he calculation of operationalisation  indicators allowed to  recognize  significant gaps at the l evel of certain  AIA sub-requirements , notably for the  following requirements: “Data and data governance”, “ Technical documentation ”, and  “Risk system management”. Three sub -requirements gaps were recognized:   • Req 1: Data and data governance → SR.2: High -risk AI systems not using  techniques involving models training ( i.e. m anagement practices and data  governance practices )  • Req 2: Technical documentation → SR.2: High -risk AI system ( i.e. the existence of  only one technical documentation file )  • Req 7: Risk management system → S.4: User’s age ( i.e. accessibility to children )  The analysis further identified a group of twelve  operationalisation /suitability  essential standards relevant to  the eight requirements const ituting the AIA  reference framework . For the present purposes, a n essential standard can be defined as  a standard that contributes in a significant way the implementation of one or more AIA  requirement s, as currently expressed in the Commission’s proposal .   A core group of standards , which includes six ISO/IEC standards , was then identified .  It correspond s to the intersection of the sets constituting the suitability and  operationalisation  groups of essential standards . Presently, these standards emerged  as the most relevant working items to focus on , for implementing the AIA act and  addressing the concerns of the different stakeholders .  It should be noted that, f or specific requirements or sub -requirements, standards  (other  than the essential ones ) may also have a high /good  operationalisation  score; these latter  standards stand in a non -trivial relationship with the set of recognized essential standards,  since different specifications are usually developed independently. Thus, as they are not  designed coherently, the essential standards may be locally overlapping with the less  relevant ones but, also, they may present different facets of the same concept, being to  some extent complementary.   In the next iterations of this report , the group of essential standards will likely  be complemented by others  (there are about 50 AI standards to be published by  the end of 2023 ) which might  contribute to cover some of the existing gaps. As already  done with the high -level analysis and mapping, in  the ne ar future IEEE and ITU -T standards  will be analysed in -depth.   Drawing from our analysis, the following broad recommendations  may thus be formulated  to the Commission in order to support  the development of usable standards for AI :  • Continuously monit or the development of relevant  standard isation   working items , as identified in this study.   • Engage and work together with the relevant standardisation organisations  (noticeably  the ESOs) and standard committees  identified in  this study ,  especially  for the purpose of improving the suitability of standards and address  identified gaps, on the basis of the methodology and conclusions outlined in this  report.  In that context , specific attention should be paid to the following aspects:   o the deve lopments related to ongoing standardisation  work on AI definition  and terminology3;      3 In particular, it is r ecommended to follow the development of the work managed by OECD  on AI concepts and systems definition and of ISO/IEC DIS 22989  “Artificial intelligence  concepts and terminology” . 
    55   o the need for vertical standards (possibly selecting priority areas)4;   o the consideration of  compliance management instruments. In doing that, it  is recommended to introduce specific risk and management system  requirements ;  o the actual need and extent of standardisation  activities with regard to  technical documentation , taking into account  the lev el of detail of the related  provisions in the AIA and the experience in product legislation ;  o the need for survey s and  pre-standardisation  activities , where existing sub requirements gaps are recognized.   • Update  the present study regularly  to reflect ongoing  AI standardisation   developments  and the evolution of the European AIA  framework . It is recommended  to apply the introduced in -depth methodology (noticeably, the developed  supervised  analytical procedure) to analys e the future development of the  recognized  standards — and assess the expected improvement, in terms of AIA act  operationalisation .    Moreover, i n order to support AI system developers, as well as other stakeholders dealing  with the AIA , analyse the network created by the multi -level connections of  the  first level standards  (i.e. the recognized core and essential standards) and create a  digital tool/framework . This would help stakeholders to understand the connectiv ity and  complexity of first -level standards implementation and the complementarity of different  standards. If the framework cover s different SDOs, it would also support stakeholders in  recognizing consistency and/or overlaps characterizing standards managed b y different  SDOs, for implementing the AIA.              4 In particular, it is expected that this investigation might play an import ant role in relation  with the “Human oversight” requirement for two reasons: a) the small number of horizontal  standards recognized to be relevant; b) the nature of the human supervision and  intervention is mainly domain specific.

    61     Domain level   General   Type of initiative   Standard   Main Objectives and Expected content   Data is a critical component in the development of AI systems. This includes raw data  as well as information and feedback from other systems and humans in the loop, all of  which can be used to change the function of the system by training and retraining the  AI.  However, access to suitable data is often limited causing a need to resort to less  suitable sources of data. Compromising the i ntegrity of training data has been  demonstrated to be a viable attack vector against an AI system. This means that  securing the supply chain of the data is an important step in securing the AI.   The report will summarise the methods currently used to source  data for training AI  along with the regulations, standards and protocols that can control the handling and  sharing of that data. It will then provide gap analysis on this information to scope  possible requirements for standards for ensuring traceability a nd integrity in the data,  associated attributes, information and feedback, as well as the confidentiality of these.

Domain level   General   Type of initiative   Standard   Main Objectives and Expected content   The purpose of this work item is to identify objectives, methods and techniques that  are appropriate for security testing of AI -based components. The overall goal is to  have guidelines for security testing of AI and AI -based components considering of the  different algorithms of symbolic and subsymbolic AI and addressing relevant threats  from the work item “AI threat ontology”.   Security testing of AI has some commonalities with security testing of traditional  systems but provides new challenges and requires  different approaches, due to (a)  significant differences between symbolic and subsymbolic AI and traditional systems  that have strong implications on their security and on how to test their security  properties, (b) non -determinism since AI -based systems m ay evolve over time (self learning systems) and security properties may degrade, (c) test oracle problem,  assigning a test verdict is different and more difficult for AI -based systems since not all  expected results are known a priori, and (d) data -driven a lgorithms: in contrast to  traditional systems, (training) data forms the behaviour of subsymbolic AI.

ISO 9000 standard family for Quality Management Systems   Although it does not concern AI per se, a fundamental set of standards for Quality  Management Systems (QMS) is the ISO 9000 series.   The standards in the ISO 9000 series provide organizations with a number of quality  management principles , including a stron g customer focus, the motivation and  implication of top management, the process approach and continual improvement .   In particular, ISO 9000 outlines the seven quality management principles underlying  the family of standards, while ISO 9001 details the req uirements to be fulfilled by  organizations in order to comply with the standard.   ISO 9001 is the only standard in the family that can be certified to. It can be used   independently from the organization size and its field of activity. Thus, it is a widely  used tool for management, with  over one million companies and organizations in over  170 countries certified  to ISO 9001 (ISO, 2014).  
    99   Annex F . Standards mapping per SDO     CEN/CENELEC Focus Group on AI and future JTC   CEN and CENELEC aim to work as the interface between international standardisation  and  the European market needs (business, policy, and regulatory contexts).   In 2020, CEN/CENELEC established a Focus Group on AI to recognize the European needs  for AI standardisation  and support future EU (horizontal and vertical) regulations on AI.  The Focus Group worked out a road map analysis, building on a strong consensus of over  80 experts (CEN/CENELEC, 2020) .  Implementing one of the  Focus Group recommendations, in June 2021, CEN -CENELEC  established the JTC21 on “Artificial Intelligence”. The scope of this committee is:   To “ … produce standardisation  deliverables in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and  related use of data, as  well as provide guidance to other technical committees concerned  with Artificial Intelligence.  The JTC shall also consider the adoption of relevant international  standards and standards from other relevant organisations, like ISO/IEC JTC 1 and its   subcomm ittees, such as SC 42 (Artificial Intelligence ). The JTC shall produce  standardisation  deliverables to address European market and societal needs and to  underpin primarily EU legislation, policies, principles, and values  (CEN-CENELE C, 2021) .    ETSI standards and initiatives   In this section, we review the standards and initiatives by ETSI that are relevant with  respect to the recognized AI requirements. In Table 30 Error!
