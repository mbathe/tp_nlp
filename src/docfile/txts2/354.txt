Technological innovation is a pivotal force that has led to groundbreaking shifts  in economic and social paradigms as well as social transformations throughout  the processes of mechanization, industrialization, informatization, and the rest of human history since the invention of the steam engine. Today, the world stands before another massive wave of change, often referred to as the “Fourth Industrial  Revolution.” Futurologists unanimously agree that the new world that will be ushered  in by this revolution will be an intelligent information society in which cutting-edge technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data analysis, and mobile platforms, will be integrated into every aspect of society—from welfare and employment to education and national defense, among  many others—thereby adding intelligence to all industrial activities. The society brought about by the Fourth Industrial Revolution will be radically different  from any society that has ever existed before. According to a recent McKinsey study,  the economic value of this intelligent information society will amount to KRW 460  trillion by 2030. By then, the vast majority of simple and repetitive tasks will have been automated, eliminating a large number of jobs as a result. At the same time, however, new jobs, such as those in software engineering and data analysis, will be created in  other growing industries.  The Fourth Industrial Revolution is an inevitable, irreversible movement that is currently  underway. However, even the most advanced economies are still in only the very first  stage of transformation, making it impossible for us to determine which countries will  emerge as leaders of this remarkable change. The South Korean government has been taking crucial steps to thoroughly prepare for the coming Fourth Industrial Revolution, such as fostering entrepreneurial spirit and boldness in Korean society, identifying and proactively supporting promising technologies, and developing creative workforces. In  an attempt to secure a leadership position in the unfolding revolution and expedite the  realization of an intelligent information society in Korea, the government announced the “Mid- to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society” in December 2016. For the successful implementation of this Master Plan, I hope that the current publicprivate partnership will continue to flourish, as it will make it possible to achieve the massive transformation and innovation required in all economic, social, and other  related systems of the Korean nation. Only through such concerted efforts will we be  able to pave the way for the next generation to fully realize an intelligent information society.

An intelligent information society  is a society in which new value is generated and  progress is achieved through the application of intelligent information technology (Intelligent  IT)—backed by the generation, collection, and analysis of massive volumes of data by cutting-edge information and communications technologies—to every aspect of the economy, society and human life. As data and knowledge come to take precedence over the conventional production factors (labor  and capital), industrial barriers are broken down with the increasing convergence of products and services, and intelligent machines and automated systems make their way into even the areas of work that require complex human cognitive capabilities, the entire economy and society will undergo sweeping, innovative transformations.
⊙ The MSIP launched the Public-Private Advisory Board on Intelligent IT (which met three times from October  to December of 2015) to organize and hold in-depth discussions on the potential, prospects, and innovation of  Intelligent IT and its application to industries.  The board submitted its National Intelligent IT Strategy report at the interdepartmental meeting in January 2016. ⊙ The Plan for the Advancement of the Intelligent IT Industries, which details urgent Intelligent IT and industrial  issues that require concerted efforts to address and resolve, was released in March 2016. ⊙ The steering plan for the Mid- to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society,  encompassing the technological, industrial, and social implications of Intelligent IT, was reported at the Cabinet  meeting in April 2016. ⊙ The Joint Steering Committee for the Intelligent Information Society, comprised of ten government ministries and  private-sector experts, was launched in May 2016. ※ The committee has held three meetings to date, in May, June, and November of 2016. ⊙ The Open Public Seminars were held six times, from June to September of 2016, to prompt and disseminate  public discourses. ※ The seminars were held under the theme “Future, Humanity, and Machinery Concerts.” ⊙ A government-wide steering group was launched on September 1, 2016, to draft a master plan for the intelligent information society.

BackgroundⅠMid- to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society Managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution
2 제4차 산업혁명에 대응한  지능정보사회 중장기 종합대책 222ⅠBackground The Fourth Industrial Revolution, which is driving significant change in  intelligent information technology (Intelligent IT), is expected to transform the basic structure of industries by increasing productivity and efficiency to  unprecedented levels based on the enhanced intelligence of machines. Intelligent IT will enhance productivity to the extent that returns to scale increase and trigger  fundamental reforms of the conventional production factors, such as labor and capital,* as well as the  industrial structure. * Here, technological innovation is more important than massive capital investments or minimization of labor cost.       ● Google (60,000 employees, earning USD 23.4 billion) vs. GM (210,000 employees, earning USD 9.7 billion), in 2015 Information and communications technology (ICT) platform developers are breaking down barriers and expanding their presence into all industries, threatening the existing manufacturing and service sectors. * The market value of Uber, a car sharing company, is estimated to be KRW 80 trillion, surpassing GM and Ford (2015). Uber intends to launch a trial run of its new self-driving taxis in Pittsburg in September 2016 and subsequently expand its  business portfolio to include logistics and delivery.  Leading governments and corporations are seizing upon the disruptive impact*  of Intelligent IT, and have long researched and invested in it accordingly. * McKinsey has already predicted that the economic ripple effects of the automation of intelligent labor, made possible by  artificial intelligence, will amount to between USD 5.2 and 6.7 trillion a year by 2025 (Disruptive Technologies, 2013). Leading players in this regard have been increasing the competitiveness* of their Intelligent IT projects  by accelerating development and commercialization. * E.g., The United States’ SmartAmerica Challenge and BRAIN Initiative, Germany’s Industry 4.0 Strategy, Japan’s Japanese  Reconstruction Strategy and New Robot Strategy, and China’s Made in China 2025 and Internet Plus Strategy. Having realized just how much is at stake in pioneering Intelligent IT, major corporations worldwide  have begun making massive investments in Intelligent IT development and related merger and  acquisition (M&A) deals.* * E.g., IBM’s investment in the development of Watson (USD 1 billion), Toyota’s Center for AI Research (USD 1 billion), Google’s  investment in M&A deals (USD 28 billion over 14 years), and Baidu Research’s Institute of Deep Learning (USD 300 million).

As machines increasingly replace human workers in all sectors of society, productivity will rise, working  hours will decrease, and health spans will increase, among other society-wide social and economic benefits. Such automation, on the other hand, will also replace simple and repetitive human labor and increase  the demand for highly specialized and skilled personnel. Under its national informatization plan and programs, South Korea has established  world-class ICT infrastructure* and successfully enhanced the competitiveness of its national economy through the convergence of industries and ICT.  * South Korea has topped the ICT Development Index for two years in a row (2015-2016). Intelligent IT, however, is expected to transform the economic and social structures of the country  profoundly. It is therefore critical for the Korean government to prepare policy measures in response to such changes, encompassing not only technology and industry but also education, employment, and  welfare. * South Korea is ranked 25th, below the Czech Republic and Malaysia, in terms of its adaptability to the Fourth Industrial  Revolution, measured in terms of labor flexibility, technological innovation, quality of its education system, social overhead  capital (SOC), and legal protection.  It is important for Korean policymakers to make forecasts regarding the innovations  that will be made in the next generation, and tailor the country’s mid- to long-term  strategic responses accordingly, before it is too late.< Recent Economic Growth Rates (Bank of Korea, 2016) >< Adaptability to the Fourth Industrial Revolution (UBS, 2016) >Mid-to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society:  Managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution In order to generate new value and ensure the competitiveness of its intelligent information society,  Korea needs to secure innovative technologies in advance, foster related industries, and upgrade  services. It is critical to observe social changes carefully and build a social consensus on new policy measures. The  roles of humans and ethics need to be redefined and the downsides of the new industrial revolution minimized while adjusting the social structure so as to support the peaceful coexistence of humankind and robots.Ⅷ Implementation Framework

Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution: Intelligent ITⅡMid- to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society Managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution
Engine of the Fourth Industrial Revolution:  Intelligent IT 666< Intelligent IT: Concept and Characteristics > Concept Characteristics● Automatic decision-making: Machines become capable of performing the highly complex and    intelligent tasks involved in decision-making independently, thereby accelerating automation. ● Real-time responses: ICBM (IoT, cloud computing, big data, and mobile) technologies carry out  a series of related tasks (e.g., data gathering/analysis and deduction) instantly to provide real-time  responses and actions. ● Automatic evolution: Machines utilize their deep-learning experiences to evolve independently,  achieving astronomical improvements in performance. ● Storage of all kinds of data: Even data that were impossible to store and use in the past (e.g., biological and behavioral information, amorphous data, etc.) can now be made useful through the machine-learning process. Ⅱ 1.  Concept of Intelligent IT Intelligent IT refers to technology that is capable of performing the highly complex  functions of human intelligence by combining the “intelligence” of artificial intelligence (AI) with the “information” provided by data-processing and network  technologies, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, big data  analysis, and mobile technologies (referred to collectively as “ICBM technologies”). AI technology encompasses intelligent software and hardware technologies, basic sciences (brain  science and industrial mathematics), and other such technologies that are capable of performing human cognitive functions (language, voice recognition, visual perception, emotional support, etc.). * At present, Intelligent IT is understood mainly as a weak form of AI that merely simulates human cognitive functions  in limited areas of human activity. It is not yet a strong form of AI that is capable of replacing all human tasks requiring intelligence based on creative learning and decision-making. Data-processing and network (ICBM) technologies  are essential ICTs that generate, collect, transmit,  store, and analyze data that are crucial to the development, enhancement, and dissemination of AI technology. IoT and mobile technologies continuously gather and transmit various types of data through networks in real time, while cloud and big data technologies store and analyze the data thus gathered/transmitted.

The fields of application for Intelligent IT continue to multiply thanks to the modification and expansion  of algorithms and diverse forms of deep learning. In combination with diverse industrial technologies, Intelligent IT is expected to play a pivotal role in  enhancing productivity and efficiency in all industries.  < Examples of the Convergence of Intelligent IT with Other Industrial Technologies > < Comparison of Electricity and Intelligent IT as GPTs > Electricity Intelligent IT Role Replaces humans’ physical labor Replaces humans’ mental labor Scope of  applicationAll areas of industrial and living  activities in need of powerAll areas of industrial and living activities in need  of decision-making (except for creative and  emotional activities, for now) Intelligent IT is expected to revolutionize the modern economy and society by  enabling the mechanization of formerly unmechanizable aspects of industries,  thereby maximizing productivity and completely transforming the industrial structure. This is what has come to be called the “Fourth Industrial Revolution.”Mid-to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society:  Managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution ⅠBackground  ⅢForecasts of Possible Changes  Brought about by Intelligent ITⅣFuture Prospects  and Core Factors of SuccessⅤVision and Strategy Ⅶ Tasks ⅥMid- to Long-Term Policy Aims  for Intelligent Information Society Ⅱ Engine of the Fourth  Industrial Revolution: Intelligent IT Ⅷ Implementation Framework

10101010 Rise of data and knowledge as new sources of competitiveness Intelligent IT is capable of improving its own algorithms based on machine learning made possible  through the accumulation of data, thus making data and knowledge new sources of industrial  competitiveness. Companies capable of developing systems that amass data independently and possess algorithms that  allow them to make use of such systems will emerge as industry leaders. * As of August 2016, seven of the ten most highly valued corporations in the world (i.e., Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon,     Facebook, GE, and China Mobile) were leading ICT developers that were also investing aggressively in Intelligent IT. Scales of operating facilities and sizes of workforces will decline in relative importance as it becomes  critical for businesses to make timely responses to changes in market demand. Manufacturers will thus increasingly reshore* their operations back to their home countries. * E.g., Adidas, with its robotic production system, was able to reshore its manufacturing facilities from Asia back to     Germany and the United States while also reducing its production period from one week to five hours. Shifting center of competition to platforms and ecosystems In order to benefit from Intelligent IT, industries need to establish ecosystems and platforms that  encourage as many users as possible to participate, so that they can generate data to use and share. Intelligent information platforms that link multiple products and services have overwhelming  advantages over stand-alone products and services.Ⅲ E.g., Integrating driving, maintenance, car insurance, and parts replacement into a single customer service system ⇒ The overall efficiency of this integrated service system is more important than the performance of       each individual product and service.

11"**P5 .PCJMF $MPVE#JH %BUB 1111"**P5 .PCJMF $MPVE#JH %BUB 11Leading ICT companies, such as Google and Apple, are expanding their platforms to include other  products and services, including vehicles and driving. As these major ICT platform providers play leading roles in shaping industrial ecosystems, based on  their productivity and popularity, they induce other companies to become platform providers as well,* intensifying the competition among platforms as a result. * E.g., In September 2015, General Electric (GE) unveiled the industrial cloud-based platform Predix, which provides    preventive maintenance and operational efficiency maximization services for industrial machinery. Emergence of winner-takes-all platforms and new opportunities for growth Intelligent IT improves its performance and precision independently through continuous learning. Therefore, the earlier a company expands into the platform market, the better its chances of monopolizing the market. Over the years, major platform providers have amassed immense amounts of data from countless users, enabling them to provide quality services at affordable costs. This, in turn, attracts even more users by virtue of the network effect, thus allowing platform providers to achieve economies of scale based on their numbers of users and volumes of data. In the meantime, the rise and spread of global mobile platforms for applied services have opened up  new opportunities for startups and other small companies to achieve rapid growth. Using these platforms, small businesses can distribute their products and services to consumers  worldwide with speed and ease, increasing their chances of becoming “micro-multinationals.” < Monopolization of the Platform Market > ● Since launching the first iPhone in 2007, Apple has successfully established an expanding Apple      ecosystem based on its mobile platform.    - The ecosystem boasts a virtuous cycle in which the growth in the number of users leads to greater         participation by mobile application developers and greater utility of the overall ecosystem. ● With its unique mobile platform and ecosystem, Apple has emerged as the undisputed leader of the      global smartphone market.    ※  Apple’s share of the global smartphone market: 62% in 2013, 78% in 2014, and 88% in 2015Apple’s dominance of the mobile marketMid-to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society:  Managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution ⅠBackground  Ⅱ Engine of the Fourth  Industrial Revolution: Intelligent ITⅣFuture Prospects  and Core Factors of SuccessⅤVision and Strategy Ⅶ Tasks ⅥMid- to Long-Term Policy Aims  for Intelligent Information Society ⅢForecasts of Possible Changes  Brought about by Intelligent IT ▶ After being adapted and applied to all industries, Intelligent IT is expected to revolutionize  the current industrial structure. Businesses therefore need to ensure their continued  competitiveness by adopting and disseminating innovative technologies proactively. ▶ The lapse of time between early pioneers and latecomers will lead to widening technology  gaps in the global platform market over time. As the fast-follower strategy has only limited effectiveness in this market, businesses need to develop first-mover strategies. ▶ As Intelligent IT depends on the analysis of massive amounts of data, it is critical for  policymakers to ensure and foster the quantitative and qualitative growth of the data market   by supporting the generation and collection of large amounts of data, preventing the  monopolization of data by a single company, and improving privacy protection regulations.ImplicationsⅧ Implementation Framework
1212Automation to eliminate some jobs while creating other jobs in new industries Intelligent IT will likely intensify the polarization of the employment structure by not only taking over  unskilled and repetitive tasks but also automating complex intellectual tasks, office tasks of intermediate levels of difficulty, and precision manual labor. On the other hand, Intelligent-IT-related industries will see increases in demand for personnel, leading to  the creation of jobs in new industries, as has been the case in all previous industrial revolutions. Human work to become concentrated in creative activities with high value added Human workers will become increasingly concentrated in creative and emotional activities, which machines cannot replace so easily. Workers in these fields will enjoy better treatment as well. Machines can easily take over intellectual and physical labor that is characterized by fixed forms or  patterns. Therefore, human-machine competition over such work will intensify, leading to increasingly  worse treatment and job quality for human workers in these areas. Reduced job security vs. greater job flexibility ICT platforms will bring down the traditional barriers among industries, as employers increasingly seek  out employees with functional expertise rather than industry or trade expertise. The terms of labor contracts will become shorter, with even skilled office personnel working on  temporary and contract-based terms in greater numbers, providing their services and knowledge for only specific projects. The growth of the sharing economy, online-to-offline (O2O) services, crowd work, and online service  platforms will increase demand for non-regular workers, such as platform-dependent workers.* * Growing numbers of platform-dependent workers will become self-employed freelancers rather than full-time workers     employed by companies. ▶ It will become increasingly important for companies to recruit and hire specialized and  skilled personnel with core capabilities related to the application of Intelligent IT to diverse industries. ▶ Policymakers will need to devise measures, such as re-training, for people who lose  their jobs due to automation. ▶ The unemployment security net should be strengthened, particularly for wage workers,  with social security for platform-dependent workers expanded as well.Implications2.

1313Reduced cost, enhanced quality, and increased convenience of services Intelligent IT will enhance the precision of medical diagnostics and treatments and contribute to  decreasing the cost and improving the quality and accessibility of healthcare services. Advanced language cognition and machine translation technologies will enhance the accessibility and  convenience of services available inside and outside Korea, lowering language and cultural barriers. Safer living environments Patrolling, surveillance, and other dangerous tasks will become increasingly automated. Big data  analyses will assist in the development and improvement of crime-forecasting models, with the goal of reinforcing national and public security. Real-time updates on traffic information and the intelligent control of traffic flows will help minimize  traffic congestion and car accidents. Personalized and customized services for individuals Students will have more opportunities to learn at their own pace. The facilitation of self-directed learning will reduce the demand for, and financial burden of, private education, while enabling teachers to focus more on character-building and creativity-enhancing education. Intelligent IT will enhance the precision of welfare demand forecasts and contribute to maximizing the  efficiency and effectiveness of welfare services for diverse groups, including seniors, children, people  with disabilities, the underprivileged, and unskilled workers. Negative impacts: polarization, social conflicts, threats to privacy, and alienation The tendency of Intelligent IT to strengthen the “winner-takes-all” trend will lead to increased  socioeconomic polarization, while the inability of the legal system and social institutions to keep abreast of the latest ICTs will likely result in various social conflicts. The data-centered society will pose increasing threats to not only privacy but also national security by  increasing the risk of cyber attacks against the national infrastructure and systems governing energy, transportation, etc. ▶ Intelligent IT should be applied to the public sector first to solve social problems, realize  public interests, and foster market-level demand for the growth of new industries and improvement of related services. ▶ Policymakers should seek out balanced approaches toward utilizing and protecting  personal information and develop effective counterstrategies against possible cyber attacks."**P5 .PCJMF $MPVE#JH %BUB ⅠBackground  Ⅱ Engine of the Fourth  Industrial Revolution: Intelligent ITⅣFuture Prospects  and Core Factors of SuccessⅤVision and Strategy Ⅶ Tasks ⅥMid- to Long-Term Policy Aims  for Intelligent Information Society ⅢForecasts of Possible Changes  Brought about by Intelligent IT Implications3.

1414Economic impact Intelligent IT will pave new ground for new growth. The aggregate economic effects* (including new  revenue generated, costs saved, and increased consumer welfare) are expected to amount to KRW 460 trillion by 2030 (McKinsey, 2016). * The gross domestic product (GDP) includes the market value of products only, failing to reflect other forms of value, such as    decreases in the cost of production and increases in consumer welfare.  Intelligent IT is likely to generate KRW 41.9 to 85.4 trillion in new revenue, reduce costs by KRW 109 to 199 trillion, and increase consumer welfare by KRW 76.4 to 174.6 trillion. Healthcare is likely to benefit the most from Intelligent IT in terms of new revenue generated and costs  saved (up to KRW 109.6 trillion), followed by manufacturing (up to KRW 95 trillion) and finance (up to  KRW 47.7 trillion). Consumer welfare is most likely to be enhanced in transportation (up to KRW 36.5 trillion), urban  management (up to KRW 36.2 trillion), and wellness (up to KRW 17.2 trillion).■ New sources of revenue:  data-based marketing (up to KRW 10 trillion), robotics (up to KRW 30 trillion), etc. ■ New means of reducing costs:  increased precision of medical diagnostics (up to KRW 55 trillion), optimization                                                                 of manufacturing processes (up to KRW 15 trillion), etc. ■ New sources of consumer welfare:  reduced car accidents (up to KRW 10 trillion), improved air quality (up to                                                                         KRW 7.6 trillion), reduced traffic congestion (up to KRW 30 trillion), reduced                                                                        housework (up to KRW 10 trillion), improved public health (up to KRW 10                                                                        trillion), etc.  < Aggregated Economic Effects of Intelligent IT in South Korea by 2030 (McKinsey, 2016) > 4.

1616Impact on employment < Changes in the nature and quality of work > An analysis of 25 million working people across 414 occupations in Korea showed that about 49.7  percent* of all work hours put in by people in these jobs nationwide could be automated by 2030  (McKinsey, 2016). * This forecast is based on the assumption that all automation technologies currently being researched are fully realized. Forecasts of the extent to which the automated tasks will give rise to new human tasks, such as  planning and communication, are limited, because such forecasts are subject to a number of  unpredictable changes in the economic environment and business strategies.   Almost 86 percent of all workers in Korea today spend over 20 percent of their working hours on tasks  that will one day be automated. Intelligent IT will thus have a profound impact on these people’s lives. However, only 0.3 percent of jobs today can be fully automated. < New jobs created > Intelligent IT is also expected to create up to 800,000 new jobs by 2030, especially positions for software engineers and data scientists. < Cumulative Ratios of People Working in Automatable Occupations >  < Job-Creating Effects of Intelligent IT > Model Description Estimates Other countries’  estimates of AI-created jobsUsing estimates of future AI-created jobs in the United States, Canada, Australia, etc., to estimate job-creating effects.100,000 to 450,000 jobs Forecasts from outside sourcesAdding up new AI- and big-data-related jobs included in the by-industry and by-trade workforce estimates of outside agencies, such as the Korea Employment Information Service.600,000 to 800,000 jobs Mid-to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society:  Managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution
Analysis method A total of 414 occupational categories were analyzed in terms of the respective composition of the  different types of tasks involved and the types and levels of technical skills required for each task. Findings How amenable a given occupation is to automation varies significantly with the characteristics of the tasks involved. The majority of occupations amenable to automation involve simple and standardizable tasks, such as  operating machinery (e.g., dental technician, washing machine operator, plasterer, etc.). Occupations less amenable to automation tend to require creativity, the ability to empathize, and a  high degree of manual dexterity (e.g., nurse, product designer, actor/model, etc.). 1717  < Analysis of the Composition of Tasks and Levels of Technical Skills Required (Sample) >"**P5 .PCJMF $MPVE#JH %BUB ⅠBackground  Ⅱ Engine of the Fourth  Industrial Revolution: Intelligent ITⅣFuture Prospects  and Core Factors of SuccessⅤVision and Strategy Ⅶ Tasks ⅥMid- to Long-Term Policy Aims  for Intelligent Information Society ⅢForecasts of Possible Changes  Brought about by Intelligent ITJob-Creating Effect of Intelligent IT by Occupation in Korea (McKinsey, 2016)Note 2 Mid-to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society:  Managing the Fourth Industrial RevolutionⅧ Implementation Framework

South Korea’s current status: A SWOT analysis Enhancing Korea’s Intelligent IT capabilities and strengthening its data infrastructure As technology, data, and networks are the stepping-stones to the intelligent information society, it is  critical to foster and develop innovative technologies, establish super-connected networks, and ensure the active use of data. Investment in R&D should be increased in order to bring Korean technology to a level on par with the  world standard, ensure the sustained advancement of the nation’s network infrastructure, and increase the amounts of quality data being collected and used. * Korea is lagging behind the United States by 2.4 years in terms of Intelligent IT, owing to the lack of long-term investment in    the development of original and applied Intelligent IT (IITP , 2016). ● The Korean government’s R&D budget for Intelligent IT in 2016, which includes investment in intelligent software, basic  technologies, and human resources development, accounts for only 0.7 percent of the overall national R&D budget (KRW 134.8 billion out of KRW 19 trillion). * Although Korea possesses first-rate ICT infrastructure, the data utilization rate across Korean industries is a meager 4.3    percent (NIA, 2016).3.  Core factors of successⅧ Implementation Framework
2222Achieving greater convergence between Intelligent IT and existing industries Applying Intelligent IT to existing industries proactively is essential to managing the inevitable changes  in the existing industrial structure. It is equally important to identify and foster new industries through convergence with Intelligent IT. In particular, Intelligent IT should be applied first and foremost to public services. Policymakers should  also devise a more flexible regulatory regime in order to deal with technologies that are not addressed  by the existing legal system and institutions. * Of the 33 member states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), South Korea is ranked     fourth in terms of the indicators of product market regulation (2013). Reforming the labor market and increasing education for creative personnel The labor market should be made more flexible (with increasing emphasis on meritocracy and the  flexibility of working hours and arrangements), employment services enhanced, and the social security net strengthened in anticipation of the likely changes in the employment structure. * Korea’s rigid employment practices and customs continue to prevent the country’s labor market from becoming more     efficient (ranked 53rd on the IMD’s survey of labor market efficiency in 2016). Education should be designed to foster creativity and the technological capacity of the public, through  software- and convergence-based learning, so as to increase the number of globally competent and capable workers. * Only two or three dozen skilled specialists with doctorates in AI are produced each year in Korea. * Korea ranked 31st among 133 countries on the Global Creativity Index (Martin Prosperity Institute, 2013). * Elementary school students in Korea are expected to receive at least 17 hours of software education each by 2019 (compared     to 70 hours in China, 180 hours in the United Kingdom, and 240 hours in India).  < Structure of Intelligent Information Society and Core Factors of Success > Mid-to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society:  Managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution

3030 Background: The rapid advancement of Intelligent IT has the potential  to transform not only ICT-related industries but also all future industries, profoundly reshaping the sources of national competitiveness. Promptly securing the rights and access to advanced Intelligent IT will enable Korean businesses to  establish leading positions in the high-value-added industrial ecosystem, based upon which they will be able to easily expand their global presence and grow into world-class corporations. Failure to secure the rights and access to innovative technologies will allow the established multinational  ICT corporations to maintain their current monopolies in the global Intelligent IT ecosystem, limiting the extent to which Korean businesses can play leading roles in innovation. ※ There already exists a sizable technology gap between Korea and other advanced countries, raising fears of the       technological subjugation of Korean businesses to multinational corporations. Policy objective: Develop and foster data and network infrastructure with  which Korean businesses can develop their own innovative technologies, thereby enabling them to secure leading positions in the global market. As economic actors increasingly share, deal in, and utilize data, the quality of their products and services  will improve, generating greater value added. Original technologies rivaling those of advanced countries should be developed, along with a platform  for the application of Intelligent IT to public services in Korea. All objects should be designed to generate and transmit data through a nationwide connected network  so that data can be gathered, stored, and utilized effectively.Ⅵ Because all these technologies involve high risks  and require long-term research  and investment, an effective public-private partnership needs to be established to  create the data and network infrastructure necessary for the development of these  technologies.Mid- to Long-Term Policy Aims for Intelligent  Information Society 1.

31"**P5 .PCJMF $MPVE#JH %BUB 31 Background: In an intelligent information society, knowledge and data serve as  the central sources of competitiveness. It thus becomes crucial for all industries to make active use of Intelligent IT. Making active use of Intelligent IT is essential to achieving convergence, maximizing productivity,  fostering new industries, and overcoming the low-growth trap. Failure to make use of Intelligent IT would lead Korean industries to fall behind in terms of global  competitiveness and become permanently caught in the low-growth trap, as well as intensify the problems associated with population aging and cause unemployment to run rampant, thereby compromising overall national competitiveness. ※ The growth rates of all 10 major Korean industries, including automobile manufacturing, shipbuilding, and steel, are       expected to fall. Policy objective: Apply Intelligent IT to public services and the entire private  sector to enhance productivity, efficiency, and national competitiveness. Allow existing industries, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and finance, to generate greater value  added through convergence with Intelligent IT and data. Foster an industrial ecosystem that encourages new enterprises, possessing innovative ideas and  technologies, to emerge and pioneer new growth engines. Provide safe, intelligent, and quality public services for citizens. As a partner in private-sector innovation, the government should encourage greater  private-sector investment by first setting an example for the application of Intelligent  IT to public services, reforming regulations, and providing related test beds and  ecosystems.Mid-to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society:  Managing the Fourth Industrial Revolution ⅠBackground  Ⅱ Engine of the Fourth  Industrial Revolution: Intelligent ITⅤVision and Strategy Ⅶ Tasks ⅢForecasts of Possible Changes  Brought about by Intelligent ITⅣFuture Prospects  and Core Factors of Success ⅥMid- to Long-Term Policy Aims  for Intelligent Information Society2.

3232Foster creative personnel, prepare for changes in the social structure and possible  negative impacts, and strengthen welfare policy and the social security net   accordingly. 3.  Proactive steps toward reforming and strengthening the      social support system Background:  Automation has the potential to significantly increase the  convenience and safety of people’s everyday lives; however, it could also  threaten job security, intensify socioeconomic polarization, and increase the risk of hacking and cyber crimes. Effective management of these socioeconomic changes, however, will lead to greater benefits, such as  reduced working hours, more jobs with value added, and simple and mechanical solutions to various  social problems. Failure to manage these changes, on the other hand, will lead income levels to drop, socioeconomic  polarization to intensify, and privacy to face increasing threats. ※ Rote education, the rigid structure of the labor market, and other such factors are obstacles to the effective management of        Intelligent IT. Policy objective: Reform and tailor education, employment, and welfare services  in response to changes in order to ensure that all citizens are able to enjoy the  benefits of the intelligent information society. Foster and educate active workers capable of leading the intelligent information society based on their  creativity and emotional intelligence. Ensure opportunities for a decent and humane standard of living by supporting the re-training of  personnel and improving the employment and welfare environments.

Establish a government agency tasked with fostering a better culture of work-life balance at workplaces (e.g., provisionally named the Work-Life Balance Promotion Agency) and develop criteria for assessing workplace cultures and share relevant examples (by 2018). Start by fostering meritocratic hiring and performance-based wage systems in the public sector so as to  encourage the private sector to recruit more creative personnel and improve productivity (2017 onward). Expand the employment security net in anticipation of employment diversification. Develop standard labor contract and employment policy templates for major occupations in anticipation of the increasing number of non-regular types of workers (including platform-dependent workers*) and the diversification of work arrangements (such as working from multiple locations) (by 2017). * Workers who are active in online-platform-based shared economies, O2O services, and crowd work. Redefine the concept of “worker” to encompass and account for the increasingly diverse types of employment (including workers of specific types) and update labor standard laws accordingly in the intermediate to long term. Expand the scope of unemployment and workers’ compensation insurances incrementally to increase the number of beneficiaries (including workers of specific types) regardless of employment type (by 2017). Expand the scope of the Earned Income Tax Credits (EITCs), and the tax benefit amounts it provides, so as to guarantee baseline income for working individuals and households (by 2018). Improve employment support services to better support inter-sector job transitions. Analyze big data from WORKNET and unemployment insurance files* in order to customize employment support services (including job-seeking information, training information, and financial aid) to individual workers (by 2017). * Conduct comprehensive analyses of jobseekers’ lifecycles, characteristics, service-use patterns, and education, training, and    job-seeking histories.◆ Technological innovation is expected to increase the number of high-value-added jobs,  increase labor market flexibility, and lead to a transition of workers from traditional  industries to new industries. ◆ It is important to free workers from the fear of losing their jobs and transitioning into new  fields by enhancing the employment security net for non-regular workers and providing jobseekers with customized information and training.

5454 10 Reinforcement of the social security net for the intelligent  information society Guarantee security and safety for all citizens by reinforcing the social  security net. Expand the reach of social security services and improve their quality to ensure that the public is  better able to manage the rapid changes that will accompany the rise of Intelligent IT and minimize socioeconomic polarization. Increase the amounts of unemployment and social insurance benefits and extend the periods for which they are provided. Increase the scopes and amounts of the NBLSP and basic pension benefits incrementally (starting in 2017). Enhance the guarantees of the National Health Insurance scheme and lower the costs of essential  services (birthing, dementia care, etc.) ※ Introduce a five-year plan for citizens’ post-retirement lives (2017-2021) as a means of providing systemic and       substantial support for the aging population. Continue to identify and discuss new welfare issues related to the intelligent information society via the Social Security Commission. Enhance the efficiency of welfare administration and maintain the soundness of  welfare finance. Apply Intelligent IT to the entire range of welfare administration services and enhance the fiscal  soundness and sustainability of welfare. Apply Intelligent IT to the social security net information system (by 2020) in order to analyze income and wealth information and verify the eligibility of welfare claimants, thereby minimizing budget waste. Find measures to improve the fiscal administration of welfare services based on mid- to longterm forecasts of the National Health Insurance and National Pension schemes, reflecting future  demographic changes.◆ Apply Intelligent IT to people’s daily lives to achieve an open, discrimination-free society in  which everyone is able to enjoy the benefits of technological innovation and maintain  stable livelihoods despite job losses or transitions and the rising cost of healthcare.

Channel technological innovation toward supporting and assisting human activities (eating, using the  bathroom, moving about, etc.) so as to solve many of the daily problems and difficulties faced by the elderly and people with disabilities. Set up an interdepartmental council, with the participation of the MSIP (technology), Ministry of Health  and Welfare (policy), and local governments (execution), to establish a phase-by-phase roadmap for the  development and implementation of welfare technologies (2017). ※ E.g., machine-learning-based mobility aids and systems for people with disabilities. Connect welfare facilities and homes in need of such new devices with technologies under development so that real-world needs and concerns can be reflected in the resulting products. Subsidize purchases of these products to help generate market demand.Mid-to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society:  Managing the Fourth Industrial RevolutionⅧ Implementation Framework
5656 11 Legal and ethical reforms for the intelligent information  society Enact framework legislation to present a vision and aims for the intelligent  information society.   Amend the Framework Act on National Informatization, a foundational law, and rename it the “Framework Act on National Intelligent Information” (provisional title) to present a national vision and aims for the intelligent information society.  Reform and improve the entire legal system to grant rights and responsibilities to “electronic persons” in preparation for the dissemination of AI and self-learning machines. Establish an Intelligent Information Society Strategy Committee (provisional title), tasked with  identifying issues related to legal reform and improvement and drafting new legislation for different government departments. Establish human-centered ethics to govern data-collection processes and AI algorithms. Establish a charter of ethics for Intelligent IT to minimize any potential abuse or misuse of advanced technology by presenting a clear ethical guide for developers and users alike (2018). ※ Given the nature of new Intelligent IT systems, featuring advanced algorithms for data-based self-learning, they may  cause or exacerbate a wide range of issues and social problems if left without an ethical guide or means of intervention (e.g.,  socioeconomic polarization, biases and discrimination against minorities, etc.). Research and develop protocols* with which developers must comply when collecting data and  developing algorithms to ensure that the resulting algorithms do not reflect or perpetuate social prejudices. * As the massive quantities of data involved and high complexity of AI algorithms will make it nearly impossible for  humans to rid these systems of biases once they begin operating and evolving, policymakers may well need to develop and establish refined methods for applying and testing ethical standards for their development at every stage (e.g., requirements for testing the fairness and reliability of data, enforcing the fiduciary duty of developers, preventing reverse choices, etc.). Establish a public-private partnership council tasked with monitoring, researching, and preventing technological trends and risks that may perpetuate the negative impacts of new technologies. It may be necessary to establish a systemic process through which people may raise formal objections to the evaluations made by AI systems and have AI-based decisions reviewed and tested. Provide education for the underprivileged with the goal of minimizing the information gap and foster and spread a human-centered technological culture that accords due respect to technology and the humanities alike.◆ A normative substructure is needed to prepare the public for the revolutionary changes  that will accompany the emergence of the intelligent information society. It will therefore be necessary to reform existing laws and institutions in order to enable individuals and businesses alike to use Intelligent IT freely and safely.

Recognize the value and ownership of data collected by private-sector entities as equivalent to the  ownership of movable and real estate assets, and devise legal measures to prevent unauthorized third  parties from gaining access to and using such data (including claims for damages). Amend the Software Industry Promotion Act and update other legal provisions to ensure better  reliability and security tests for Intelligent IT applied to various industries, such as automotive parts and  medical devices. Update the legal system to expedite and facilitate the application of Intelligent  IT to industries. Clarify manufacturers’ liabilities for accidents resulting from AI-related errors involving their products. Consider introducing specialized insurance products to ensure consumer protection. ※ The current law on product liability limits liabilities to natural and legal persons only, making it difficult for victims to file        claims against software or hardware developers for AI-related accidents. ※ Lengthy debates will likely be held between manufacturers and users regarding whose responsibility is greater, such as in        the case of the death of the driver of a self-driving Tesla car in May 2016. Amend legal provisions to recognize the rights involved in creative AI products, including products in  the areas of literature, music, semiconductor design, etc.  Update the current provisional licensing program* to prevent any possible delays in the materialization  of Intelligent IT due to legal or institutional obstacles and introduce a regulatory sandbox.** *  E.g., By requiring government agencies to prepare proper and formal licensing requirements while the provisional licenses      are still in effect (period of up to two years). ** A policy program that allows the testing of new technologies and services for fixed targets and fixed periods of time       without being restrained by current regulations (suitable for the testing of universal Intelligent IT). Introduce proactive legal reforms and changes to better prepare for social changes in the future. Increase the availability of software education and reform the legal basis for adaptive, creative, and convergence-oriented learning to accommodate future changes in the industrial structure (automation, etc.). Through amendments to the Labor Standards Act, etc., redefine the concept of “worker” to encompass  and account for increasingly diverse forms of employment and incrementally expand the reach of the unemployment and workers’ compensation insurances to increase the numbers of workers.  Expand flexible working hours programs and introduce a working-hour account system in order to foster a work environment in which workers can work more flexibly and thereby better adapt to the increasingly automated and platform-dependent industrial structure. Prepare the legal basis for improving social security in consideration of the increasing job losses and transitions, income polarization, and aging of the population.Mid-to Long-Term Master Plan in Preparation for the Intelligent Information Society:  Managing the Fourth Industrial RevolutionⅧ Implementation Framework
5858 12 Prevention and management of negative impacts Establish an intelligent, automatic national defense system with reinforced  capability to counter cyber threats. Expand the range of data to be collected in the event of a cyber threat (including data from AI-based devices such as surveillance cameras, cars, and robots as well as amorphous and irregular data), and use the data thus collected to establish a big-data-based cyber security center (2017 onward). Develop AI-based cyber immunity and automated defense systems. A cyber immunity system would routinely collect a wide range of information on diverse types of  malicious code and cyber vulnerabilities to prepare for possible cyber attacks (2018 onward). An automated defense system would conceal and cipher core data, change transmission routes, and  independently reinforce the defense capability of national systems in the event of an attack (2020 onward). * Real-time threat transmission and blocking system: international networks by 2020, connected networks by 2025, and    corporate networks by 2030. Develop the Personal AI Shield, which automatically identifies and troubleshoots security threats* to personal AI devices and services connected via networks (by 2025). * Small IoT devices can be used to launch DDoS attacks, possibly even causing the Internet across a region as large as the East     Coast of the United States to collapse (October 2016). The system should be developed in the form of security chips that can be inserted into devices, thereby  ensuring its wide applicability, and may be modified and tailored to different user environments, such as homes and offices. Establish an intelligent and integrated security certification system encompassing humans and objects. Develop a compact certification system* for objects so that AI technology can be expanded to more devices and systems that currently permit electronic certification for humans only (by 2020). * The new certification system should be lightweight and super-compact so that it can fit into various wearable devices,    sensors, etc. Support the development of quantum-code-based electronic certification technologies, even by establishing a support center if necessary.◆ Effectively predict, prevent, and manage all possible negative impacts of Intelligent IT,  such as cyber threats and AI errors, to mitigate peoples’ fears and sense of insecurity over the rise of the intelligent information society.
