IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.908  6  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   Background   The aim of the i n-depth analysis is to provide an analysis of the potential of adopting an open -source  software (OSS)  approach to deploying artificial intelligence (A I), with the aim of facilitating evidence based decisions and synthesize current state of knowledge to tackle challenges and limitations related  to such combined approach . The analysis discusses the role that open- source could play in accelerating  the use and exploitation of AI , in particular in the public sector, providing  a critical assessment of the  key research and data pu blished on the subject.   Methodology   The analysis is based on existing available data, studies and analysis from various sources,  complemented by own independent analysis  and expertise as well as a targeted stakeholder  consultation performed in the period of March and April 2021. The analysis includes  a literature review   and desk research of academic and non -academic sources including market reports, legal and policy  documents and online sources such as expert blogs.  Seven semi -structured expert interviews  with  representatives from regulatory authorities, academia, and the private sector to enrich the findings  from the review of available secondary sources with stakeholder opinions and exclusive insights on the  subject matter. Lastly, a n online survey  disse minated via expert networks and other channels  targeting key stakeholders to enrich and validate results .   Findings   The convergence of OSS and artificial intelligence (AI)  is driving rapid  advancements in a number of  different sectors. This  open source AI  (OSS AI) approach comes with high  innovation potential , in both  the public and private sector , thanks to the capacity and uptake of individuals and organisations to  freely reuse the software under open source licences. In  the EU, AI has a high opportunity  to bring  digital transformation in sectors such as commerce: currently, only 1 out of 5 companies in the EU are  highly digitalised, while 60% of large industries and more than 90% of Small and Medium Enterprises  (SMEs) lag behind in digital innovation. OSS AI can support companies to leverage the best innovations  in models and platforms that have already been created, and hence focus on innovating their domainspecific expertise.  In the public sector , OSS has the benefits of  enhanc ing transparency , by open ing the  “black box”, and ultimately, citizen trust in public administration and decision -making . Furthermore ,  governments can stimulate economic activities by providing open government software to national  and local companies.  Across the public sector in European MS,  OSS policies and legislation are most  commonly embedded in the broader digitalisation initiatives within the policy and legal framework of  these countries. However, a clear link to the AI policies and strategies are missing for most countries  (Czech Republic and Finland being the only countries with overlapping policy documents).   Furthermore, despite the advances and power of OSS AI, many governments are still tethered to  traditional ways of providing services due to  a number of challenges, such as their current, legacy IT  systems, shrinking public budget dedicated to digital innovation, or lack of AI expertise  in their  workforce. A particular aspect to consider is also linked to the public procurement processes for  acquiring IT systems, which are often not inducive to enabling digital innovation and partnership  models typical of the OSS community, and the emerging Gov Tech and Civic Tech ecosystems. This is  not the least due to the fact that the current policy environment does not invest enough into the  increased uptake of OSS AI solutions, which will be necessary in order to reach the goal of digital  sovereignty of the EU.  
Challenges and limits of an open source approach to A rtificial Intelligence      7 PE 662.908  Conclusions and policy recommendations   Open source holds vast potential to contribute towards di gital sovereignty of Europe. However, more  has to be done to boost uptake of open source in order to tap into the vast potential it can bring. Based  on the results of this analysis, the following policy recommendations  can be drawn:   • Defining an OSS AI asse ssment policy / methodology to determine which public services  are appropriate for the (experimental) use of OSS AI systems.  A clear lack of economic  research has been conducted so far to clearly distil the costs and benefits of using open source  AI in pub lic administration across the EU.   • Promot ing Government Technology ( GovTech ) and  Civic Technology  (CivicTech)   ecosystems . It is crucial  to engage experts such as  local entrepreneurs, social innovators and  SMEs . Special attention should be made to align strategies for the deployment and scale- up of  AI-powered Local Digital Twins and the creation of AI algorithm registries .  • Facilitating good quality data access for public institutions. European data spaces should  consider the promotion of OSS AI. This coul d be done by supporting voluntary data sharing by  individuals and communities of developers , and setting up structures to enable key public and  private sector organisations to share data .  • Supporting public organisations as potential open source AI producers. Third -party  intermediaries could be used to identify and manage open source AI projects across the EU  in  align ment with the digital transformation goals of the EU. Close collaborations with universities  could be a way to introduce, maintain, and monitor  open source AI solutions in government in  a sustainable way and promote technology transfer.    • Using public procurement to encourage OSS AI digital solutions in the public and private  sector. As part of the Adopt AI programme to support public procurement of AI systems and  transforming procurement processes themselves, a special effort should be dedicated to  developing OS approaches to AI, also within the context of the new public procurement data  space proposed in the AI Coordinated Plan.   • Stimulating the OSS innovation ecosystems to accelerate AI development and use. This  could be done through incentives to O SS collaborators, especially SMEs, and increasing the  transparency of the source of software underpinning the digital infrastructure and  functionaliti es deployed along the entire value chain.   • Creating opportunities for strengthening the sharing of OS data and analytical tools  across communities of research and practice, promoting the creation of repositories to  support developing AI applications, and th e transfer of specific AI components to be used “on  demand”, following the approach the European Commission  (EC)  initiated with the “AI4EU  platform”1, to develop an AI resources catalogue, which includes reusable AI datasets,  models,  libraries and other re sources.                                                                    1  See the AI4EU Platform available at: https://www.ai4eu.eu/ai4eu -platform . 
IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.908  8    INTRODUCTION   Open -source software (OSS) is a sub -set of free software that is made available under specific type  of copyright licenses.  Coupled with the numerous opportunities emerging from the use of artificial  intelligence (AI) , advancements could be unprecedented in breadth and depth, in a number of  different sectors , to automate processes, build transparency, and innovate services. An open source  approach comes with much potential for innovation capacity and uptake, in both the public and  private sector  thanks to the ability of individuals and organisations to freely reuse the software  under open source licences. The capability to deploy existing technology facilitates innovation by  leveraging on innovative service and organisa tional models and digital platforms, while the  evolution of OSS communities that support software developments increase the diversity of  potential AI expert sources  and help to create a level playing field against “technological giants”  that so far played a key role in software development and usage.   However, despite an abundance of opportunities that are made readily available to individuals and  companies to exploit, open source AI (OSS AI) can also bring about new risks  or negative  consequences for indiv iduals or the society. Particularly, in the public sector, there are costs and  benefits that must be taken into consideration when deploying OSS AI.  Digitising  administrative  procedures can be regarded as inevitable for the government amid rapid digital technological  changes , in particular those building on vast datasets that need the support of AI technologies. The  importance of open source  in the public sector  across Europe is affirmed by governments  increasingly incorporating open source  as part of their country’s political and legal framework.  OSS  AI is currently  used in the public sector in a few Member States (MS) to automate government  services and enhance the transparency of administrative procedures between governments and  citizens. In general, digitalising services, and in particular adopting advanced AI solutions,  has the  potential to deliver cost savings in public sector organizations, as well as other  downstream  political, economic, social and technical benefits for the country  by leveraging on the enormous  quantities of data that are being generated on a daily basis, as well as the capacity to deliver  proactive and personalised services.   In particula r, OSS AI has the potential to enhance transparency  by opening “black boxes” , and  ultimately, citizen trust in public administration and decisi on-making, while the government c an  stimulate economic activities by providing open government software to national and local  companies.  Despite the advances and power of  an open source approach to  AI, many governments  are still tethered to traditional ways of providing services due to a number of challenges, such as  their current, legacy IT  systems, shrinking public budget dedicated to digital innovation, or lack of  AI experts in their workforce. A particular aspect to consider is  also linked to the public procurement  processes for acquiring IT systems, which are often not inducive to enabling digital  innovation and  partnership models typical of the OSS community, and the emerging Gov Tech and Civic Tech  ecosystems.   This is not the least due to the fact that the current policy environment does not invest enough into  the increased uptake of OSS AI solu tions, which will be necessary in order to reach the goal of digital  sovereignty of the EU in the future.    
Challenges and limits of an open source approach to A rtificial Intelligence      9 PE 662.908    EXISTING TYPES OF OPEN -SOURCE SOFTWARE   2.1. Origins   In this age of increasing digitalisation, more and more software is made available to the public with the  purpose of open collaboration and peer production.  This “open” and collaboratively built software is  present in our every -day lives and is used for a diverse range of applications, including from  power  popular Internet browsers and mobile operating systems  to blockchain  and digital infrastructures.   Open source is a widely -used term describing software that comes with all necessary  permissions granted in advance to facilitate  its use, improvement, and redistribution (modified  or unmodified) by anyone and for any purpose2. These permissions are often called "the four  freedoms3"of software users :   • The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.   • The freedom to study how the program works and  change it so it does your computing as you  wish . Access to the source code is a precondition for this.   • The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others .  • The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others .  It stands in contrast to proprietary software, where only the original authors of proprietary software  can legally copy, inspect and alter that software4. According to the Open Source Initiative  (OSI), a global  non -profit that advances the use and awareness of o pen -source software (OSS)  is characterised by5:  (1) free redistribution ; (2) s ource code  distribution; (3) derived works permission; (4) integrity of the  authors source code; (5) no discrimination against persons or groups; (6) n o discrimination against  fields of endeavour ; (7) d istribution of license ; (8) l icense must not be specified to a product; (9) l icense  must not restrict other software; and (10) l icense must be technology neutral . The origins of open  source can be traced back to t he GNU (GNU’s Not Unix ) Operating System in 19 836. The operating  system Linux was quietly  released in 1991,  incorporating m any of the GNU project elements and   primarily  used as an alternative to MacOS and Windows.  This system is often credited with kick -starting  momentum of open source  use and by the early 2000s  large companies were taking advantage of  OSS.  Today, Linux boasts impressive hosting statistics ; it runs 100% of the world’s top 500 super  computers ,  operates  90% of all cloud infrastructure , and with Android phones based on Linux, 85% of all  smartphones run on this system7.   2.2. Licensing   Licensing in OSS is crucial because it allows project originators to adjust the copyrights so the software  can be freely used, modified, and shared, while at the same time  establishing guidelines and  maintaining copyright. It  does not necessarily mean that executable software is given away for free,  but rather that the source code is available for free; converting that source code into runnable code  requires expertise, time, and capacity8. Licenses  vary in restrictiveness and distribution terms and for                                                                  2  European Commission (2020) Managing licence compatibility issues in free and open -source software .

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.908  10  those that are considered open source license types, they are approved by a Board of Directors of the  OSI, through a License Review Process . To this day, this board has a list9 comprising of  more than  80  open source licenses that are available and approved for use. These categories differ in how the  software can be used, how it protects the users, originators, and defines other limitations around the  software. While the Copyleft  license  used to be the most common open source license in use, over the  past few years there has been a decline in the use of this type of  license and a rise in  Permissive   licenses, which in 2020 accounted or 76% of all open source licenses worldwide10. The OSI also  classifies the licenses by popularity and use, such as the “ Special  purpose licenses”  category which  are licenses used by institutions, that have speciali sed concerns or rules, such as government  copyrights11.  2.3. Open source components   Open source comprises a diverse range of software components. Operating systems tie hardware  resources together and manage them from a machine level  with examples of this including  Linux and  FreeBSD.  Web servers  are computer systems that deliver data from web pages to end users over the  Internet using a method called  Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  Data systems are databases   (structured and not structured) , storing key data or information, that are distributed and shared with  the source code included.  Development models  are programming languages that are not prop rietary  and fall within the parameters of open- source protocols.  These software components can be layered  or “stacked” together to create platforms that run on different operating systems.  The most popular of  these is defined as  LAMP, a model of service stacks that undergird much of the web12. The LAMP   acronym stands for:   • Linux:  an open source operating system (OS) and the largest open source project in the world;   • Apache : an open source cross -platform web server that played a key role in the early web;   • MySQL:  an open source relational database management system used by many databasedriven web apps;  and   • PHP:  a general purpose scripting language used in software development (Perl or Python  languages are sometimes substituted).   This open source development model has resulted in some of the most important open source web   applications today such as WordPress and Drupal .   2.4. Existing types of Open Source Artificial Intelligence  The convergence of OSS and artificial intelligence (AI) is driving rapid advancements in a number of  different sectors. Following the European Commission  (EC) proposal for laying down harmonised rules  on AI13, an artificial intelligence system  (AI system) means software that is developed with machine  learning  (ML) , logic - and knowledge- based, and or stati stical approaches . It can, for a given set of  human- defined objectives, generate outputs such as content, predictions, recommendations, or  decisions influencing the environments they interact with.  Generally speaking , the term “AI”, has been  mainly associated with  ML algorithms or rather software containing one or several ML algorithms14. ML                                                                  9  Open Source Initiative (2021) Licenses and standards.   10  Johnson, P.

Challenges and limits of an open source approach to A rtificial Intelligence      11 PE 662.908  is an approach to data analysis that involves building and adapting models, which allow programs to  "learn" through experience by typically using  huge amounts of data to train and improve their results.   The main difference between a ML and AI is that the former is created by a process of automated  iterative improvements which can be supervised or unsupervised. As part of the convergence of OSS  and AI , AI-based systems  have emerged  to provide tools to assist developers in designing algorithms  or creating intelligent applications15. The most prominent examples  include TensorFlow  and Apache  SystemDS . ML based libraries comprise a set of predefined, reusable functions typically written in  Python or R readily available for use16. Libraries save developers from writing redundant lines of code  since typically they  comprise a compilation of functions and routines readily avai lable for use.                                                                      15  Predictive Analytics (2021) Top 18 Artificial Intelligence Platforms .

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.908  12    CHALLENGES OF OPEN SOURCE ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE    While  OSS AI  offers a unique opportunity to make a high impact for most business es, challenges need  to be properly identified and addressed. The following subsections will describe general challenges ,  with some written specifically in the context of  public sector . It is important to note that, due to its  slower adoption as compared to the private sector, there is less knowledge concerning AI challenges  specifically associated with th e public sector17. Furthermore,  AI practices and digital transformation  strategies from the private sector cannot directly be transferred  to the public sector because of the  government’s  need to maximise public value18.  3.1. Legal challenges   Selecting the legal model for licensing software is a pivotal decision in the context of OSS AI  and when  chosen correctly, it has the potential to encourage innovation while providing a safeguard to  intellectual property rights. As a copyright holder, the owner of a piece of s oftware has broad latitude  in determining how that software can be licensed. With dual licensing , a software component is  released under two licenses simultaneously: a proprietary license and an open source license, typically  the General Public License  (GPL). This licensing method has become a popular means by which  licensors gain the economic benefits associated with commercial licensing while leveraging the  community benefits associated with open source licensing. The d ual license approach, however, comes   with its own challenges. Open source community members have pointed out that dual licensing might  not benefit the community, but rather result in less contributions to an open source project, because  contributors are reluctant to contribute to projects wi th severe licensing limitations, like the GPL that  requires they re -assign their copyrights19. With both OSS and open source data, there is a risk that the  information will be accessed by organizations or individuals who will misappropriate or perform  another violation within the field for which the licence has been granted for. Additional measures  should be sought to prevent these risks from occurring. For example, most licenses do not include any  indemnification for third -party infringement claims, wh ich is customary in commercial software  licenses20. Purpose -limitations  constitute another challenge. Entities  must be clear with why they are  collecting personal data or code and what they intend to do with it. There is always a risk, if the  copyright laws  are not written properly, that data or code is used for something different than its  original intent. The impacts  of EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  in the EU  are only finding  their concrete form, and, as yet there is no joint concept or interoperable open ecosystem for the  exchange of personal data based on consumer consent21. Entities must clarify  where responsibility  for AI implementation rests  with regard to  consequences of the decisions made by an automated  decision -making system  or any ot her consequence of the implementation of an AI solution. In the case  of algorithmic  decision -making for the allocation of benefits, no specific cohort of the population  should feel discriminated by these decisions while they should also be able to check the basis of the  decision. The principle of technology neutrality implies that governments cannot unfairly favour one                                                                  17  Desouza, K.; Dawson, G.; & Chenok, D.

EU promotion of OSS in the public sector is currently based on non- legally  binding recommendatory initiatives23 which might not be regarded as sufficient to promote the  development of the software  industry.   3.2. Technical challenges   Legacy or traditional database systems used in the public or private sector  are not always well  equipped to manage and store data from unstructured sources. G overnments and other organisations   need to adopt the appropriate technical infrastructure  to manage B ig Data and this comes with the  challenge of investing and modernising IT infrastructures of public administrations . Since there are  man y technical solutions available, deciding on the individual systems as well as the combinations to  adopt is becoming increasingly complex24. The compatibility of the OSS  system to the current system  must be considered, as well as the availability for suppor t of the technology once it is deployed. The  integration of the vast amount of data and the interoperability between different IT systems is  important for a successful digital transformation25. In fact, a recent report by the World Bank stressed  the fact that the lack of interoperability could lead to disruptions in the network, poor data exchange,  and suboptimal performance. Hence, interoperability is a top priority today as governments try to  integrate services across departments to improve effectiveness a nd efficiency26. The p ublic sector’s  management including IT management may not be familiar with open source solutions, its  deployment, features, and availability. OSS AI , particularly the code, is often not polished to facilitate  engagement and a large amount of effort and expertise is required to learn how the software works. A  combination of public technical challenges can be evidenced in the case of the municipality of  Munich  which switched  all public administration computers to open software in 2006, then switch ed back to  Windows in 2020, and now  is currently in negotiations to implement Linux again27.   3.3. Data  challenges   Open source embeds particular challenges in terms o f data quality and quantity. Open source systems  do not directly translate into transparent and high- quality datasets.  To grasp the concept of  transparency , the entire open- source system must be considered. OSS AI  software can also be used  on “closed data” , in this sense there is still no complete transparency and how the assessment of AI  quality can be done. This, in turn, hinders the potential benefits of having open source as not all of the  elements that are related to AI are open source. In this context, the adoption of open standards is crucial  to obtain an effective transparency. Due to the amount of data that is required for AI, having access to  high-quality big data  sets is also a challenge. Furthermore, OSS projects rely on continuous  engagement of developers for quality and productivity; if these developers are volunteers, they are  free to leave the project at any time, potentially jeopardizing the advancement of the project.  Open   data can offset some of these challenges since it can drive transpare ncy and accountability in                                                                  22  Lee, J.

On  the other hand , to tackle concerns on data privacy and vulnerability while keeping open sources, a  potential solution is also exemplified by the Decentralized AI28 strategic program which aims to transfer  information instead of raw data in an efficient and secure way.   3.4. Risk management challenges   AI open source should consider  a well -defined risk -based approach  in line with the proposal of AI  regulation advanced by the EC . The accuracy of AI systems  is also domain -sensitive in which  security  vulnerabilities arise when training data is not representative of the given environment29. Risk  challenges are addressed in  the recently published  2021 Proposal  for the Artificial Intelligence Act30.  The proposal  sets harmonised rules for the development, placement on the market and use of AI  systems in the Union following a proportionate risk -based approach . It further sets a  methodology to  define “high- risk” AI systems that pose significant risks to the health and safety or fundamental rights  of persons. If individuals or enterprises do not secure or manage their open source systems well, there  is an increased risk of a security breach . This was seen in the Apache Struts system in which a  vulnerability was discovered that impacted government and business entities that were connected to  the system. System breachers in this case were able to manipulate the impacted application a s if they  had full user rights: view, change, delete data, or create new accounts31. Most OSS does not have  dedicated technical support  and w ithout a support team, updates and security patches may not be  available. If vulnerabilities are discovered in the s oftware, cyber threat actors can exploit these  vulnerabilities to gain access to an organization’s network, systems, and information32. Due to the  public nature of open -source AI, cybersecurity  is also a challenge;  the systems that public and private  instit utions choose to deploy m ay be vulnerable and prone to attacks  from other AI applications33. In  fact, AI is likely to be used by both attackers and defenders in cyber defensive scenarios.  For example,  when considering government AI systems that are built to  identify management and access control ,  adversaries could compromise many techniques simply by stealing authorization tokens. AI  monitoring of behavioural  patterns could also lead to privacy violations , and for this reason should be  prohibited if aims at manipulating user behaviours, according to the proposal of AI regulation and  unless required for public security .   3.5. Society and ethics  challenges   From a societal and ethical point of view, open source may bring about challenges , which have been  identified a s especially prone in the public sector. The first of the challenges is gaining social  acceptance and trust  in the technology from both citizens and civil servants . If citizens feel  discriminated by AI or that it threatens their safety, privacy, or employment, thus contradicting their  expectations with regard to AI, they will be very unlikely to accept or trust it. Once trust is established,  it is fragile and must be maintained by performance reliability, collaboration, and communication34.  While open codes increase transparency, the difficult comprehension of these algorithms will demand                                                                  28  AI Sweden (2021) Decentralized AI.

Furthermore, the accuracy in data analysis has improved to a point, where it is –  in general  and for not complex tasks -  better than the human ability38. As OSS AI I will take over a great number  of  tasks, t he challenge lies in how to help workers gain the s kills required through workforce  transformation  to take advantage of the new work opportunities that OSS AI  entails39. While there are  opportunities for open source maintainers to receive financial support for their contributions, it is  essential that gover nments take into consideration a clear financing structure for OSS AI . Exclusive  dependence on volunteers could lead to risk management issues.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.908  16    OPPORTUNITIES OF OPEN SOURCE ARTIFICI AL INTELLIGENCE   4.1. Mitigating AI -related challenges   When considering the challenges of AI, OSS  has the potential to address or mitigate some of the risks  that are inherent to AI use. An example of this is that OSS AI  could mitigate discrimination and bias  in ML models  as compared to traditional AI  or software due to the convergence of AI  and transparency  of code41. Open source toolkits have been developed, such as the IBM AI Fairness 36042, which allow  the user to examine, report, and mitigate discrimination and bias in ML models throughout the AI  application lifecycle. In particular, experts in the field have emphasised that open source solutions  facilitate the auditability of AI  because it is often the most transparent option. In addition, as AI is  currently dominated by an oligopoly of centrali sed mega -corporations, th is type of technologies is thus  spoken for by a small, biased minority43. An OSS approach to AI can help tackle this issue in two distinct  manners. Firstly, it can help develop a local software industry which is able to compete with  technological giants  and increase the diversity of AI expert sources - provided that  there is  government support for it to thrive44,45. For instance, Dutch administrations  showed higher odds of  OSS  adoption  in the presence of high political commitment46 Additionally, a s it has been illustrated in the  literature : if governments’ software is run  on something other than Windows, then the market for these  alternative platforms would be wildly expanded47. Secondly, open source could increase transparency  if supported by a team which makes the complex algorithms “readable” for citizens, and therefore,  giving them the tools to identify any potential AI bias.  The open source community also offers an extra  layer of security by continually monitoring software code for flaws and vulnerabilities which is  especially beneficial during the development stage of new and emerging technologies like  AI48. In fact,   the cybersecurity sector  uses open source tools to perform  risk management and prevent algorithms   from being manipulated by external hackers.   OSS drives innovation due to the decentralized quality of code contributions , which  means that  developers from a multitude of organizations, industry verticals, and geographies can contribute. As   OSS inherently embraces contributions from large and diverse gr oups of developers, an open source  community of developers is more likely to make innovative code contributions  than a closed source  community of developers such as those within a specific enterprise49. This is important also when  considering the commercial sector. Businesses that can explain and trust AI, can increase the number  and accuracy of models in production  — resulting in measurable economic value. Open source is a  key part of this effort50. OSS,  as a public resource based on non -rival use rights , allows  for lower entry                                                                  41  Angell,  R.; Johnson, B.; Brun,  Y.; & Meliou , A.

An OSS  AI can also facilitate  interoperability and avoid lock -in issues if it is based on open standards. As  specifications are known and open, it is always possible to get another party to put into operation the  same solution adhering to the standards being followed52. In addition, the use of open standards  ensures that data and systems  can be interpreted independently of the tool which generated it and  increase the control by supporting migration, thereby reducing an organisation’s reliance on a single  product or supplier53. They can  create value by promoting competition between implementations,  which leads to lower prices and improved product quality54.   4.2. AI uptake and innovation  in private sector   The widespread and pervasive use of technology is changing the every -day functions of society.  Further advancement of these technologies has been cited as bringing society to the dawn of the  Fourth Industrial Revolution, also known as Industry 4.055,. At the heart of the Industry 4.0 is AI, which  continues to advance hyper -automation and hyper -connectivity.  Industry 4.0 is being further  complemented by Industry 5.0 which captur es the value of new technologies, providing prosperity  beyond jobs and growth, whi le respecting planetary boundaries, and placing the wellbeing of the  industry worker at the centre of the production process56. Recent advances in AI have been  extraordinary, with many technologies already achieving or surpassing human- level performance in  tasks such as data analytics, transcription, and image recognition.  The combination of OSS and AI is  considered a catalyst  to transform and revolutionize services  in a multitude of areas in the private  and public sector.  In the EU, AI has a high opportunity to bring digital transformation in sectors such as  commerce: currently, only 1 out of 5 companies in the EU are highly digitalised, while 60% of large  industries and more than 90% of Small and Medium Enterprises ( SMEs ) lag behind in digital  innovation57. An open -source approach to AI can support companies to leverage the best innovations  in models and platforms that have already been created, and hence focus on innovating their domainspecific expertise, which will eventu ally accelerate technological advancements  further.  Open source could further help to create a level playing field and balance issues that small  organizations face by using the open source community as a foundation and feedback loop for their  own technolog ies. Furthermore,  studies on the world -wide economic developments and implications  brought about by AI reveal that by 2035, AI could increase labour productivity by up to 40 percent and  double economic growth rates in at least 12 developed countries58. The benefits are expected to  present new levels of service, increased profit, expansion of businesses, improved efficiency, and cost  structures59. The potential of OSS AI uptake  can be identified in a variety of sectors due to its low costs  and potential for innovative capacity. The financial sector  uses OSS AI  systems to analyse data,                                                                  51  Rexhepi, G.; Hisrich, R. D.; & Ramadani, V.

Open source systems such as  H2O.ai are being used to identify money laundering, perform credit risk scoring, and churn predictive  analysts60. In healthcare , AI is becoming used more frequently as a tool for diagnostics and medical  image analysis tasks due to its accuracy compatible to expert clinicians. Computer assisted detection  and diagnosis, and image segmenta tion and registration have significantly benefited from AI61. OSS AI   systems such as the Tesseract- Medical Imaging62 are used in the medical field to provide standard  image viewing and reporting schemes.  Additionally, OSS AI  is considered the future in the  cybersecurity sector63 in which open source tools, such as Adversarial Robustness Toolbox, are  currently used in risk management to prevent algorithms from being manipulated by external hackers.   In addition to the potential for uptake, there is further opportunities for innovation  and business . The  open source setting  is truly  effective because it can attract tremendous technical talent, since many  more people can become innovators than could be possible in a proprietary model . Talented  programmers at small i nstitutions can gain  higher visibility64, while the main aim of developers will be  to obtain  recognition  and be highly valued in open source  communities to further advance  their  careers65. When considering innovation through AI, open source creates a valuable, global network of  feedback that increases the speed at which AI algorithms are created and improved . From the  business perspective, OSS AI  stimulates economic activity, sustainability and innovation power by  allowing companies to make use of existing source code and develop services on it.  They also offer  significant benefits for businesses and economies by contributing to productivity growth, decreasing  operational costs, producing rev enue, enhancing efficiency and improving customer  experience66.When considering AI  models, they are both often expensive to develop, and require a  large amount of data to build and train algorithms . In the context of government and innovation  capacity, reus e prevents partial solutions, waste and reali ses synergy within the government67. If  an open source solution is devised in one municipality or country , then another community could  also  benefit from that.   As a matter of fact, a  large majority of the AI ecosystem used in many applications is already open  source. For instance,  Python is the la nguage behind a majority of AI  applications, and th e same applies  to AI systems powered by software such as T ensorFlow, IBM Watson, Apache M ahout, and others. What  changes is whether the code is made publicly available or not. And this may be even if most underlying  “components” are OS. An example is the case of the Generative Pre- Trained Transformers  (GPT), an  innovation in the Natural Langua ge Processing space developed by OpenAI68, an AI research and  deployment company . The GPT -2 version is an unsupervised deep learning transformer -based  language model created in 2019 for the single purpose of predicting the next word(s) in a sentence.  GPT -3 is instead the 3rd version release and upgraded version of GPT -2. It takes the GPT model to a  whole new level as it is trained on a massive number of parameters (i.e. 175 billions, which is over 10x  the size of its predecessor) on an open source dataset ca lled 'Common Crawl,' and other texts from  OpenAI such as Wikipedia entries. What is important for this argumentation, however, is the fact that                                                                  60   H2O (2021) H2O website: financial services.   61   Sedghi, A.; Hami di, S.; Mehrtash, A.; Ziegler, E.; Tempany, C.; Pieper, S.; Kapur, T.; & Mousavi, P.

Challenges and limits of an open source approach to A rtificial Intelligence      19 PE 662.908  Microsoft announced in September 2020 that it had licensed 'exclusive' use of GPT -3; others can still  use the pu blic API to receive output, but only Microsoft has control of the source code. Due to  this,  EleutherAI developed its own tra nsformer -based language models styled around the GPT architecture   so to use their own GPT -Neo to replicate a GPT -3 sized model and o pen source it to the public, for free.    4.3. Leveraging on a community of experts   From the commercial perspective, open- source is often considered as an option by  businesses to  reduce costs and to leverage the ideas of the open -source community. For businesses  that have  less expertise in programming, open- source offers visibility into how developers manage datasets and  software. Due to the accessibility to a myriad of AI tools, libraries, and documentation, open- source  facilitates access for businesses to devel op in their sectors using AI techniques and feedback from  experts within the community. Highly innovative software organizations are exemplary of  development- related innovation, transparency, speed, and efficiency because of their ability to  integrate open source technologies and culture into their practices and methodologies69. Due to the  volunteer nature of participation, developers  may join/leave a project according to their desire and  need. In this sense, engineers from tech giants as well as independent developers, who routinely  contribute to the open- source AI community, help deliver AI tools that characterize high- speed  innovation.  In fact, open source solutions released by tech giants , such as TensorFlow, are essential to  innovation as they act as an essential foundation to many open source projects. TensorFlow is now  used by some of the world’s largest brands including Airbnb, Coca- Cola, and PayPal70 and is prevalent  in a variety of  sector s.  4.4. Relevance of open data   The capacity of AI -based systems to develop is possible thanks to the use of large datasets to train the  algorithms. While making open data available alone could favour larger companies as they have access  to proprietary datasets to combine with open data sources –  which smaller companies do  not have  access to, the creation of open data portals  such as Kaggle.com71, open data repositories on GitH ub72,  or on official public websites can play a big role for AI projects. The business value,  however , would  come mainly by integrating such open data with specific data –  such as those coming from the  enterprise itself or gathered from internal processes of the organizations or networks, depending on  the purpose of the data analysis and AI applications.   One way to make more data available and to improve data quality is to push governments that use  algorithms and AI systems for public service delivery to open up the data upon which these systems  rely73. The Open Data Barometer suggests that 9 in 10 governme nt data sets are still not open,  there is  therefore much potential from the public sector74. AI algorithms have to be trained with a large amount  of high -quality dataset that sometimes is not available across all countries . Availability of highquality data sets are essential to guarantee strong AI models and trustworthy outcomes, especially for  cross- border care provision75. In EU, an individual’s right of protection of their personal data  is set  out by the GDPR. Several articles of the GDPR can be applied when governing AI, and specifically AI use                                                                  69  Bocetta, S.

For ensuring that organisations comply with GDPR, a process called Data  Protection Impact Assessment  needs to be performed to assess sys tems when they could attempt  against human rights and freedoms. Furthermore, with the adoption of the Data Governance Act76,  the EU is already calling to increase the amount of data available for re -use within the EU by allowing  public sector data to be use d for purposes different than the ones for which the data was originally  collected.  In this regard, d ata openness and the free flow of non- personal data across public and private  sector77 are being advocated as beneficial for European  SME s.                                                                     76  COM/2020/767.   77  Regulation 2018/1807.  
Challenges and limits of an open source approach to A rtificial Intelligence      21 PE 662.908    LANDSCAPING AI  IN DIGITAL PUBLIC A DMINISTRATION   The widespread adoption  of digital technologies in general, and that of self -learning algorithms in  particular, ha ve given rise to much debate about their  implications for the public domain, e.g., with  regard to policy an alysis, policy making and governance78.   5.1. OSS  and data for evidence -based decision  making   At the highest level, governments have been discussing how to deal with AI systems  across many  functions, including how to manage and promote innovation in the busines s environment, how to  drive best practice and regulate misuse, and, most importantly, how to fit them into the day -to-day  work of government79. Decision -making is at the heart of administration80. As AI is changing  decision making practices, it could simultaneously offer an unprecedented access to information  to guide  governmental action and make sense of a daunting abundance of data about the state of society81. In  this framework, it could  be used to model and simulate decisions  to explore possible outcomes of  certain policies82 or to predict certain societal dynamics (e.g., crime in public transportation) so that  authorities can deploy their resources more efficiently. The expectations that are  thus  raised by AI  systems  are high , for making servic es to citizens proactive and personalised.  Software involved in  decision -making can be categorized into supportive technology assisting  the person making decisions ;  replacement technology, meaning tasks previously carried out by humans are now done by software ;  and disruptive technology that changes the way decision- makers work and ultimately reshapes our  understanding of the decision -making  process83. Another distinction can be made according to the  systems autonomy: there is decision support (programs help ing humans to make decisions), so called  “human -in-the- loop approaches” (decisions are made with some human involvement) and completely  autonomous decision -making84. Alternatively, one can categorize such software by assuming the  perspective of the people a ffected by the decision. Some decision- support tools concern purely  technical questions such as public procurement. Humans are either , not at all or scarcely and only  indirectly affected. Other decision- support tools provide information which directly infl uences the  decision. Lastly, a decision can be rendered by software itself, thus directly deciding upon humans. In  all cases a proportionate risk-based approach  will be required under the new regulatory framework .  As mentioned previously, the recently published  Proposal for the Artificial Intelligence Act85  provides a horizontal  framework to follow a risk-based approach and impose regulatory burdens on AI  system s that poses  high risks to fundamental rights and safety. The obligations for ex ante testing,  risk  management and human oversight will also facilitate the respect of other fundamental rights by                                                                  78  Gerrits, G.

Costs  and benefits   Governments have been moving away from the digitali sation of documents, processes and decisionmaking towards a new model that involves citizens in the co -production and information sharing87. As  a matter of fact, big data -based systems can help public administrations in financial, healthcare or  education budget planning by understanding the data patterns and the relationship between them  with the help of AI  algorithms88. Furthermore, social development and OSS growth were found to  be  the most important facilitators for eGovernment maturity, across countries of all stages of  development, with technological infrastructure and innovation as important drivers for OSS growth  across all countries at all stage of development89.   5.2.1.  Costs  Whil e digitalising government administrative tasks can save money in the long -term by improving  efficiency, decision  making for public spending should consider all associated direct and indirect costs  including license agreements, required upgrades and extensi ons, technical support, training, and  maintenance fees90, which is the purely direct economic cost . For instance, as  part of  the strategy of  the Digital Finland Framework, a framework which aims to maximize future opportunities through  specialised IT sectors and global megatrends, the Finnish government allocated more than€400 million   to support digital projects run by the country’s local authorities between 2018 and 202291. The costs  of hiring new workforce and training current public sector personnel  on how to use digital systems   such as AI , should al so be considered  when choosing to digitalise.  Furthermore , a cost  is also  determined by the potential low level of user acceptance of digital  government  services . One of  the reasons of poor uptake could be the design of the digital services and the lack of proper staff within  the government to understand what would make citizens use the app, chatbot, o r other service92. In  fact, experts also cite the design of technology in public administration  as a high cost that has not been  yet sufficiently studied,  and for which implications exist in terms of public procurement. It is in this  perspective that the review of the AI Coordinated Plan93 announce d the launch of a dedicated AI adopt  programme, aimed at supporting public procurement of AI systems and transfo rming procurement  processes themselves . The lack of efficiency and effectiveness in service provision, coupled with  broader trends of political distrust and apathy, can translate into low citizen satisfaction and trust.                                                                   86  The Proposal for a n AI regulation prohibited certain AI practices considered unacceptable as contravening Union values, for instance by  violating fundamental rights. The regulation follows risk- based approach, differentiating between uses of AI that create (i) an  unacceptable risk, (ii) a high risk, and (iii) low or minimal risk.   87  Bani, M.; & De Paoli, S.

Challenges and limits of an open source approach to A rtificial Intelligence      23 PE 662.908  Particularly the use of AI in govern ment may also reduce citizens' trust in government94 and  government decisions95, which  may be due to a violation of citizens' privacy or a lack of fairness in using  AI for public governance96. These realities raise the stakes for governments since failures du e to AI use  in government may have strong negative implications for governments and society97.  5.2.2.  Benefits   AI systems  are increasingly being used at all levels of government to automate or augment their  systems and increase the efficiency of public sector oper ations or to support policy public making98.  From a public sector perspective, OSS  has the potential to deliver cost savings  in p ublic sector  organizations, as well as other downstream political, economic, social and technical benefits for the  country99. This is a crucial factor since public  expenditure accounts for a quarter of Gross Domestic  Product ( GDP ) globally and the wage bill around 8% of GDP. As such, improvements in public -sector  productivity  can have substantial implications for public finances,  including development- assistance  funds100. The Dutch government cited that releasing its own OSS could amount to € 1.1 billion in saving  per year  for its government alone101. The cost savings come from the avoidance of in -house  development costs and preventio n of failure of  information and communications technology   (ICT) projects , since with OSS there are a multitude of “best practice” code projects . The availability of  source code for sharing and re -use could also avoid duplicative custom software purchases across  federal agencies. The Finnish government is another example of a public authority that has and plans  to achieve benefits through digitalisation of public finance activities. The digitalisation of  municipalities and the state could account for cost s avings of €100 million for municipalities and €100  million for the state by 2029102. Additionally, the automation of the Finnish payment system, including  e-invoicing, and electronic receipts is citied as having the potential to generate savings of tens of  millions of euros per year for the government103. The use of digital and AI-based applications may  increase efficiency and lead to cost savings by automating processes, assisting resource allocation  and reducing waiting time and administrative burden104. The Fi nnish government cites the reduction  of tasks and obligations of municipalities, through its digitalisation reform, to have an estimated  savings potential of €370 million105. Interestingly, as some jobs become obsoletes, AI is argued to  enhance the emergence of jobs which require new skills. The challenge lies in ensuring the adequate                                                                  94  Al-Mushayt, O. S.

OSS can stimulate economic activity  as companies and devel opers can create new  services based on open government software. It should be noted that publishing software can also  have a negative impact for some parties (software that has been made public and may be reused does  not need to be rewritten by a supplier)107. An open source approach to AI in public administration is  considered to help to unlock the “black box of AI108”. The bias in algorithms can be caused by many  different flaws at different stages of the algorithm’s development109. Carefully designed software will  display less bias than human alternatives, because the bias of algorithmic decisions does not originate  from the algorithm itself but from its design, the training data, and the process of training itself. Greater  transparency  will ultimately enhance trust  and accountability110.   5.3. Cases of open source AI  in public services   Current deployment of OSS AI  can be found in a broad spectrum of public administration domains  such  as healthcare, education, defence and cybersecurity, voting, or general information accessibility.  Open  source AI is used to improve transparency and access of government information for citizens , such  as the example of the Federal AI Personal Assistant Pilot, an open -source AI project implemented  in the  United States government in 2017. In this process, federal agencies worked with the private- sector and  tech industry to make their public service information available to consumer Intelligent Personal  Assistants (IPAs), such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Facebook Messenger. Eston ia and  Finland have also introduced personal assistants as part of their government services , and several  countries are following with dedicated automatic answering systems and Chatbots . AI is also being  applied in cybersecurity  to protect government insti tutions and citizens from cyber -attacks. This is the  case of the open source Dutch platform Entrada, which stabilizes the .nl domain by increasing security  and stability with features such as detecting botnets  and pop -up/burner domains to sell stolen, fake,  or illegal goods111. Public sectors are also considering using OSS AI  for voting systems . The United  States’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency recently , in 2019,  awarded a $10 million contract  to design and build an “unhackable” open source online voting system112. Furthermore, with the  current public health threat of the Co vid-19 pandemic, many MS  have been implementing and using  open -source solutions to track, predict, or report outbreaks of the Covid -19 virus , examples include  Spain (Covid radar113) and Ireland (COVID Tracker App ). Another example is the use  of a chatbot to help  citizens fill out their taxes , as the one provided by the FinTech- based Intelligent Tax Administration  Service114. In this respect, g overnments should regard AI solutions as an opportunity to increase citizens  trust and to meet citizens expectations.  So far there is an  uneven adoption of  OSS AI  in public  administration around the world115, with Europe not being an exception.  In fact , it remains challenging                                                                  106  Susar, D. ; & Aquaro, V.

While governments  weight the opportunities and risks associated with the adoption of OSS AI , several EU MS have already  implemented successful services , with examples exhibited  in Annex  II.                                                                      116  Misuraca, G.; & Van Noordt, C.

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.908  26    REGULATIONS AND POLICIES   6.1. Examples of national OSS AI policies   The method that policymakers choose to govern the wide range of AI technologies and applications  will have a dramatic effect on the ultimate array of opportunities and benefits that could result117.  Policymakers and regulators face two competing  approaches: a precautionary approach, which preemptively limits  or even bans  certain applications out of fears for worst- case scenarios, or a “permission  less innovation”118 approach, which  prioritize s experimentation and collaboration by  default ,  addressing upcoming  issues while they show up . The importance of OSS in public sector s across Europe  is affirmed by governments incorporating OSS as part of their country’s political and legal framework.   Most commonly, OSS policies and legislation are embedded in the broader digitalisation initiatives   within the policy and legal framework of these countries119. However, a clear link to the AI policies and  strategies are missing for most countries  (see Czech Republic and Finland being the only countr ies with  overlapping policy document s). Some MS have started to explore innovative public procurement to  stimulate the development and adoption of A I120, and a few committed themselves to the adoption of  “open source by default” , including OSS AI  as a means to accelerate AI uptake121, 122. In 2020, under the   Dutch Digitisation Strategy 2018-2021123, the Dutch government committed to  the release of the  source code by public administration and the application of the “open source by default” principle   although  administrat ions were encouraged to implement OSS when no clashing interests existed . In  order to bring public bodies closer to both OSS and the open source community, the open source  toolbox124 was launched to help civil servants switch to open source. In 2019, Dutch g overnment  published the Strategic Action Plan for Artificial Intelligence125, which also mentioned  Public -Private Partnerships, education and ethical concerns . The efforts on the openness of public  AI solutions can  also be observed at a local level with initiatives  such as Amsterdam’s Algorithm Register126. Amsterdam  along with Helsinki are the only two major European cities to have opened an AI register to  the public,  which details  how each city government uses algorithms to deliver services127. Estonia’s na tional AI  strategy, known as #KrattAI , advance s the take- up of AI both in the private and public sector. Hence,  #KrattAI  will be an interoperable network of public and private  sector AI applications (agents, bots,  assistants, etc .) which would work from the user perspective as a single, united channel for accessing  public direct and informational services128. According to the Estonian Government, AI solutions have  to be open- source and reusable  if there are no reasons not to129. In this framework, a ll softwar e  developed should be made available free of charge (if possible) via the e -state code repository130, a                                                                  117  Thierer, A.; O'Sullivan, A.

However, in some  cases, these solutions will not be made open source and need to be evaluated on a case- by-case basis.   Finland’s ambitious national AI strategy  aims at Finland becoming a leading country in the  application of AI . The National AI Strategy131 fosters the development of AI innovation activities in an  open ecosystem which encourages international cooperation. Finland also recently introduced their  national e -government service platform, Suomi.fi, as part of the KaPa (Kansallinen Palveluarkkitehtu uri  or National Service Architecture) program. The KaPa program involves a national data exchange layer;  a shared service view required by citizens, companies and authorities; a new model of nation- wide eidentification, and national solutions for the admi nistration of roles and authorizations for  organizations and individuals132. In addition , the AI accelerator will be based on an open environment  which includes open source code and data. The AuroraAI133 national AI programme aims at preparing   Finland for a hu man -centric and ethical society in the age of AI.  As part of this effort it is significant to  mention the development of a “Digital Twin” of the government, that is a digital platform where the  user can choose which applications and services to engage with and how much data to share.  This  approach builds on a community of OS S developers across the country. Beyond the European Union ,  Canada was the first country in the world to adopt a national AI strategy in 2017, the Pan-Canadian AI  Strategy134 fosters the u se of open data and standards135, yet it does not include any specific mention  to the use of OSS in AI. On the other hand, the United Kingdom’s  (UK)  national AI strategy adheres to  the tenth Government Design Principle: “Make things open: it makes things better136”. According to the  UK AI Roadmap137, public AI should adopt open licenses where possible whilst AI developers should  bear in mind the openness of data in the design stage.   6.2. Current achievements and ways ahead   The EU has several initiatives to support the implementation of both OSS  and AI solutions in public  administration across EU MS. The EC adopted its first strategy for the internal use of OSS  in 200 0138,  encouraging the use of open -source solutions.  In the case of AI, the White Paper on Artificial  Intelligence139 (2020) acknowledged the need for increased  take -up of AI technology across the EU  economy  to remain competitive,  in particular , with the US and China, both of which exploit large  amounts  of data. Recently, the Proposal for the Artificial Inte lligence Act140 delivers on the political  commitment by Commission President von der Leyen to put forward a legislation for a coordinated  European approach on the human and ethical implications of AI.  It further  proposes a single future proof definition of AI under Art. 3 and defines common mandatory requirements applicable to the  design and development of certain AI systems , before they are placed on the market (see Art. 52).

The European Parliament  (EP) has also undertak en  a considerable amount of work in the area of AI , including Resolutions  related to AI  such as ethics 144,  liability145 and copyright146. Through the signature of the Declaration on Cooperation on A rtificial  Intelligence  in April 2018147, EU MS have committed themselves to join forces and enga ge in a  common AI policy approach, to leverage the achievements and investments in AI of the European  research and business community, while at the same time appropriately  dealing with related social,  econo mic, ethical and legal issues . The European AI Alliance148 was created in 2018 as a multi stakeholder forum for the provision of feedback to the High- Level Expert Group on AI  appointed by the   EC. More recently, under the new Multiannual Financial Framewor k, the Digital Europe Programme   is planned to invest € 2.5 billion to help spread AI across the European economy and society. Within this  framework, the EC has proposed “to develop common “European libraries” of algorithms that would  be accessible to all149”. In addition, the EC along with MS is developing European Digital Innovation  Hubs to deliver services that stimulate the uptake of AI .   The EU has made significant efforts to open up public sector information and publicly funded  research results for re -use, such as data generated by the EU's space programmes ( e.g. Copernicus). In  terms of OSS, the OSS strategy 2020-2023150 provides a practical instrument for achieving digital  transformation in the EC.

An example of a n  OSS project launched by the EC, at the initiation  of the EP , is the Free and Open Source Software  Auditing  (EU-FOSSA ) project which aimed to improve security and integrity of critical open  software151. Following the success of the pilot, the project was renewed for another three years (EU FOSSA 2)  and currently has ended . Furthermore, in  order to facilitate knowledge shari ng, the EC  developed a collaborative platform based on OSS called Joinup152 to promote  open source adoption  across Europe, including showcasing  several AI initiatives (in part  already mentioned  earlier ). In  addition, the Open Source Observatory (OSOR)153 is an EC project hosted on the Joinup collaborative  platform  that allows  European public administrations  to connect with other relevant stakeholders  involved or interested in open source.  In addition, t he White Paper on AI154 emphas ized  the need for  investments  to strengthen fundamental research and make scientific breakthroughs, upgrade AI  research infrastructure, and develop AI applications in key sectors to  facilitate the uptake of AI and the  data access .

IPOL | Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.908  30    CONCLUSIONS AND  RECOMMENDATIONS   Existing research  highlights  the advantages and great potential of  open source . OSS AI  has the  potential to leverage the knowledge of an entire community , to balance out the dominance of big tech  players , or build off the existing technologies and data of these tech giants . This analysis focussed on  the risks and challenges of OSS AI . When c onsidering the inherent risks to AI, it will be crucial to see  how much of these risks can be mitigated with an open source approach. Furthermore, the recently  published Proposal for the Artificial Intelligence Act155 will be essential to follow , since once the act is  adopted, it will provide a horizontal regulatory and tru st-based approach to mitigate some of those  risks. From  the expert consultation,  it was reaffirmed that the instruments used by the EU  so far - largely   non -binding  in nature  - have not been sufficient to boost uptake of open source despite its innovation  potential. Based on the conclusion of this analysis, the following policy recommendations  can be  drawn:   • Defining an OSS AI assessment policy  / methodology to determine which public services  are appropriate for the ( experimental ) use of OSS AI systems.  One of the findings of this  analysis was the lack of economic research  done  on the costs and benefits of using OSS AI  in  public administration  across the EU . Particularly, a case study  could also be performed on OSS  AI tools that the EC  has released  or is currently using.   • Promot ing GovTech and CivicTech ecosystems . It is crucial  to engage  local entrepreneurs,  social innovators and SMEs -  often people who have worked in public services and can see  exciting new ways of delivering improved outcomes and more efficient public services. Special  attention should be made to align strategies for the deployment and scale- up of AI -powered  Local Digital Twins and the creation of AI algorithm registries, for example through the AI -ondemand platform and the Living -in.EU action, as indicated in the review of the AI C oordinated  Plan .   • Facilitat ing good quality data access for public institutions.  It is pivotal to ensure  appropriate deployment of the common European Data Spaces as part of the recently agreed  Digital Europe  Programme (DEP). European data spaces (covering areas like the environment,  energy, agriculture and  public administrations at national and local level) should consider  promoting OS approaches to AI, supporting voluntary data exchange by individuals and  communities of developers, setting up structures to enable key public and private sector  organisations to share data and nurture a local ecosystem of OS for AI .  • Supporting public organisations as potential OSS AI producers . Third -party intermediaries  could be used to identify and manage OSS AI  projects across the EU. They could form teams of  independent developers and distribute funding to various projects that align with the digital  transformation goals of Europe, which shou ld also be aligned with the 2030 Agenda for  Sustainable Development as  well as the goals of the European Green Deal. Having a framework  contract with universities could be a way to introduce, maintain, and monitor OSS AI  solutions  in government in a sustai nable way.   • Using public procurement to encourage OSS AI  digital solutions  in the public and private  sector. As underlined in the review of the AI Coordinated Plan, the Recovery and Resilience  Facility (RRF) offers an unprecedented opportunity to accelerate uptake of AI in the public  sector. MS are encouraged to focus on building capacity to seize the advantages of predictive  analytics and AI in policymaking and public service delivery, and for this to become a reality                                                                  155  COM(2021) 206 final.  
Challenges and limits of an open source approach to A rtificial Intelligence      31 PE 662.908  public procurement is considered cruci al to stimulate adoption of trustworthy and secure AI.  As part of the Adopt AI programme to support public procurement of AI systems and  transforming procurement processes themselves, a special effort should be dedicated to  developing  OS approaches to AI, also within the context of the new public procurement data  space proposed in the Coordinated Plan. Additionally, it is suggested  to launch a new FOSSA 3 initiative , which could give an additional layer  of auditing and justification for  the public  procurement of OSS AI.   • Stimulating the OSS innovation ecosystems to accelerate AI development and use  through incentives to O SS collaborators , especially SMEs, and increasing the transparency of  the source of software underpinning the digital i nfrastructure and functionalities deployed  along the entire value chain.   • Creating opportunities for strengthening the sharing of O SS data  and analytical tools   across communities of research and practice, promoting the creation of repositories to  support  developing  AI applications  (such as Joinup) , and the transfer of specific AI components  to be used “on demand”, following the approach the EC  initiated with the “AI4EU platform” , to  develop an  AI resources catalogue, which includes reusable AI datasets, m odels, libraries and  other resources. M any AI tools require specific skillsets to make the most out of analytical  software. These public platforms would thus pr ovide data scientists with an alytical options to  experiment and test with dataset to train algor ithms and models, so to develop innovative  applications and strengthen the OSS AI ecosystems across the EU.

Advantages include the ability to enhance transparency, facilitate the auditing of AI and thereby  enhance citizen trust, while stimulating economic activities and domain- specific expertise.  Disadvantages and limits include legal, technical, data, risk management, societal and ethical  challenges. This analysis examines all main open source artificial intelligence pro and cons and  proposes seven recommendations to boost its uptake.
