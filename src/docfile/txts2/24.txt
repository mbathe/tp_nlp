  Trustworthy AI in  Aotearoa   AI Principles            March  2020                                                         
March  2020, AI Forum, AI Principles   |  1         _______________________________________________________________________________________   Trustworthy A I in Aotearoa     March  2020  Artificial intelligence ( AI) can drive significant economic and social benefits for New Zealand. But it also  introduces a range of risks and challenges to New Zealand society that cannot be overlooked .     To help maintain public trust  in the development and use of AI in New Zealand , the La w, Society and Ethics  Working Group of the AI Forum has published a set of guiding principles for “Trustworthy AI in Aotearoa New  Zealand ” (the AI Principles ). Those principles are designed to provide high- level guidance for anyone involved  in designing, d eveloping and using artificial intelligence in New Zealand  (AI stakeholders ), with the goal of  ensuring New Zealanders have access to trustworthy AI.    A key focus of the group has been to make sure the AI principles are simple, succinct and user friendly.        The AI Principles  aim to:   • start a conversation about the importance of ethical and legal considerations in AI design, development ,  deployment  and operation   • raise awareness that AI ethical and legal issues need to be identified and addressed early on   • set the groundwork for more detailed , practical  guidance that will define and inform good practice in AI  design, development and implementation in New Zealand .          The AI Principles are designed to be very much a first step in developing more comprehensive Trustworthy AI  guidance for New Zealand.   It is hoped t he AI Principles can be operationalised through a follow -up set of detailed and practical guidelines  to hel p ensure adequate consideration of the legal and ethical implications of AI at each stage of the AI  lifecycle.  It is expected that such guidelines would help AI  stakeholders  understand what they should be  planning, doing and reviewing at each state of the AI lifecycle .  PURPOSE OF THE PRINC IPLES   A FIRST STEP  
  March  2020, AI Forum, AI Principles   |  2    We also recognise the complex issues associated with AI cannot be reduced to a simple “tick -box” activity. As  such, this document is intended to provide to set of overarching first principles for AI stakeholders to refer to  when faced with c hallenging questions relating to AI .       We have drawn upon the common themes emerging from the growing body of published AI ethical principles ,  including the OECD Recommendation on Artificial Intelligence , the  European Commission’s Ethics Guidelines  for Trustworthy AI , the iTech  Principles , the Montréal Declaration  and Singapore’s Proposed Model AI  Governance Framework .    However, we have aimed to distil  the language and concepts used elsewhere into something more accessible  and relevant to New Zealand.          A common feature of many sets of AI principles is a focus on ethical considerations only.    We believe it is important to remind AI stakeholders that existing laws and regulations apply to AI just as they do to any other form of technology. AI does not exi st in a legal vacuum  - among others, e xisting laws relating to  consumer protection, privacy, liability, intellectual property and human rights  will all continue to apply.  The AI  Principles are no substitute for compliance with those legal regimes.    Human rights law plays  a key role . It provides a ready -made, internationally tested and legitimate framework of  civil, political, economic, cultural and social values , addressing both individual and collective concerns.           The AI Principles  are designed to assist everyone in the AI ecosystem, including in both the private and public  sectors. However, we recognise that Government has add itional obligations and a broader  role to play in  ensuring AI and other emerging technologies serve the long -term public good of New Zealand, including in  meeting its obligations under Te Tiriti o Waitangi.     Government  regulation and regulator s have an important role  to play here . Self-regulat ion in the form of  ethical principles  or standards may fill a gap where the law is incomplete or out of date, but they are no  substitution for democratically -mandated rules backed up by the force of law.     We note also that p ublic sector agencies’ AI -related decisions are subject to additional public and international  law obligations . Those demand a higher level of scrutiny, transparency and protection of human rights than is  currently legally demanded of businesses. Drawing o ut the implications of these requirements in the AI context  is an important task we hope the Government will undertake , with support from organisations like the AI  Forum, which is a neutral, professional and inclusive group of thought leaders, experts and practitioners .     THE ROLE OF GOVERNME NT MORE THAN ETHICS  ALIGNMENT WITH EMERG ING AI ETHICAL NORMS  
  March  2020, AI Forum, AI Principles   |  3        The overall intention of these AI principles is not to provide an exhaustive list of AI legal and ethical principles .  Instead, we have aimed to provide a useful reference point that summarises key considerations  in the design,  development, deployment and operation of AI systems.     We believe AI stakeholders that design , develop  and use AI systems in accordance with these principles  will be  better able to manage many of the identified risks and untintended consequences of AI . As a result, the public  will be more likely to trust AI, ultimately enhancing the ability of all New Zealanders  to enjoy the benefits of AI.     CONCLUSION  
  March  2020, AI Forum, AI Principles   |  4  Trustworthy AI in Aotearoa    The AI Principles     The following principles aim to foster both innovation and trust in the design, development and deployment of  artificial intelligence ( AI) in Aotearoa New Zealand.            Designers , developers and users of AI systems ( AI stakeholders ) must respect:   • Applicable laws in  New Zealand and other relevant jurisdictions   • Human rights  recognised under domestic and international law   • Rights of Māori  articulated in Te Tiriti o Waitangi    • Democratic values including the electoral process and informed public debate   • Principles of equality a nd fairness so that AI systems do not unjustly harm, exclude, disempower or  discriminate against individuals or particular groups.             AI stakeholders must ensure AI systems and related data are reliable, accurate and secure and the privacy of  individuals is protected throughout the AI system’s life cycle, with potential risks identified and managed on an  ongoing basis.             The operation and impacts of an AI system should be transparent, traceabl e, auditable and generally  explainable to a degree appropriate to its use and potential risk profile so outcomes can be understood and  challenged, particularly where they relate to people.             AI stakeholders should retain an appropriate level of human oversight of AI systems and their outputs.  Technologies capable of harming individuals or groups should not be deployed until stakeholders have  determined appropriate accountability and liability.             Where appropriate, AI stakeholders should design, develop and use AI systems to promote, as much as  possible, the wellbeing of New Zealand’s people and environment in areas such as health, education,  employment, sustainability, diversity, inclusion and recognition of the unique values of Te Ao Māori.  1.
