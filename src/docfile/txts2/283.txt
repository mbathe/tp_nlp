Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      7 PE 662.911  EXECUTIVE SUMMARY   Background   Artificial Intelligence (AI)  is a key area for E uropean Union  research and development, with  approximately  EUR  1.1 billion invested in AI -related research between 2014 and 2017 under Horizon  2020. The EU is taking a variety of actions to support the adoption of AI, including the White Paper on  Artificial Intelligenc e1 and the upcoming regulatory framework .   Aims and method   This study  aims to support the work of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age   (AIDA)  by considering the evidence about whether and how AI can be used to enhance quality w ork  and good working conditions .  To do so, the study investigates  the following research questions:   • What is the nature of evidence available on the expected impact of AI on jobs in the EU?   • What is the potential of AI to create decent jobs in the EU?   • To wha t extent does AI (a) offer opportunities to improve working conditions and (b) pose risks  associated with the use of AI in a working environment?   • What is the current evidence on national and EU policies and practices on the use of AI for  improving working conditions?   The study  uses the findings of a targeted literature review  (including 25 sources)  and five semi structured interviews with key informants to map out the current landscape of research.   Key findings   • What is the nature of evidence available on th e expected impact of AI on jobs in the EU?   The current evidence and forecasts on the impact of AI on jobs present a mixed picture of job losses  and gains. The impact of AI on the future of jobs foresees the displacement of tasks by AI -based  technologies, rather than the replacement of  jobs. Despite the limits of forecasts in anticipating  large scale disruption s, AI is expected to disproportionately displa ce low- skill and low- wage jobs. Member  States  with existing high levels of technology adoption may  expe rience minimal or positive net  employment effects , depending on the role that sectors affected by AI play in the labour market.  Member States with low levels of technology adoption and a hi gh proportion of jobs with well -defined  task routines are expected  to experience negative net employment effects.   • What is the potential of AI to create decent jobs in the EU?   The extent to which AI can create decent jobs is as yet underexplored and is likely to depend on the  institutional and societal factors , which are p revalent in individual EU Member States. Job displacement  effects due to AI may contribute to a rise in platform work , adding multiple risks to job quality. EU  Member States with low levels of labour market segregation and strong coll ective bargaining  fram eworks will more likely benefit from AI in terms of decent jobs.  The way AI will be  incorporated  into the legal frameworks regulating  labour markets will play a large part in determining the ultimate  impact of AI on decent jobs.                                                                 1  See the communication 'White paper on Artificial Intelligence - A European approach to excellence and trust' (COM(2020) 65 final).  
Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.911  8  • To what extent does AI (a)  offer opportunities to improve working conditions and (b) pose ri sks  associated with the use of AI in a working environment?   AI has the potential to bring both risks and opportunities to working conditions . On the one hand, i t   can reduce the risk of dangerous o r unhealthy working conditions,  encourage the development of  specialist or soft skills, and improve accessibility  to certain jobs. On the other hand, the application of  automated technologies to the job market brings phys ical and psychosocial risks. The use of AI  software to monitor and  manage employees may  reduce bias in decision -making and identify skills  needs, but also reinforce ex isting biases, increase psychological risks and result in unprecedented  amounts of person al data being held by employers. Future policy -making and technologic al  development will be important  in determining  the extent of the realisation of  the potential ben efits   and risks of AI .  • What is the current evidence on national and EU policies and pract ices on the use of AI for  improving working conditions?   A range of EU legislation addressing health and safety, data protection and workers’ rights plays a rol e  in regulating the impact of AI on working conditions. Recent EU strategies and whi te papers exa m ining  AI are considered an important step towards a cohesive policy. Although Member States are  increasingly developing national AI policies , these usually tend to focus more on the economic benefits  that automation and software could bring to the country . Few have policies in place that explicitly  address how AI can be used to improve working conditions , or consider how to mitigate risks brought  by AI to working conditions.   Recommendations   This study identified four key areas  where the EU and its Member States could  take new or additional  actions to optimise the impact of AI on working conditions :  • Increas ing investment in technology and computer literacy as part of education and  training to create a more economically resilient workforce.   • Address ing eviden ce and knowledge gaps highlighted in this report by conducting more  granular and empirical research capturing the impact of AI in the workplace and on job  quality across Member States, industry sectors, occupations and demographic groups.  • Updat ing the exis ting ethical and legal frameworks that govern employment lifecycles  to explicitly address the emerging role that AI plays in hiring, promoting and firing  decisions.   • Examin ing the role of the General Data Protection Regulation in protecting privacy risks  posed by AI and mitigating high -risk activities.     
Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      9 PE 662.911  1. BACKGROUND   1.1. AI is an increasingly common feature of modern working life   AI has been a key area for EU research and development since 2004  (see section 1.3 for a definition ).  Under  the Horizon 2020 programme , about  EUR  1.1 billion was  invested in AI -related research between  2014 and 20172. The EU has taken a variety of actions in order to support  adoption of AI and the  consequent changes in the world of   work. The  Communication from the Commission on Artificial  Intelligence for Europe aims to boost the EU’s technological and  industrial capacity while also  proposing ethical and legal frameworks bas ed on EU values3. The White  Paper on Artificial Intellige nc e   highlights the importance of  ensuring trust and security in AI, matching digital competencies to job   market needs and providing inclusive employment opportunities4. The European Parliament  established a S pecial Committee on Artificial Intelligence in a Digital Age (AIDA)  with a mandate  to analyse the future impact of AI on the EU economy, including on skills and employment5. Member  States are also taking the initiative t o develop their own capacities in AI, including through training and  education, adaptation of existing labour regulations, and enhancing research6.  Identifying the impact of AI on the future of work and working conditions is inherently challenging ,  since the jobs of tomorrow do not yet exist. This makes it difficult to define the contribution of AI to  improving working conditions in precise  detail . AI therefore comes with risks and opportunities for the  EU, bringing both the possibility of improving  working conditions and  various associated challenges  for working populations. Given that AI is a rapidly evolving feature of modern working life, further  research is needed to understand its potential  beneficial and challenging impacts on jobs, job  market s  and working conditions.   1.2. Objectives, research questions and methods   The objectives of the analysis  are (i) to  examine the extent of use of AI as an opportunity to reduce  human exposure to harmful and hazardous conditions and  to create more quality and decent jobs  before improving productivity  and  (ii) to critically assess key research and data published on the  subject, highlighting any points of contention in the public debate and stakeholders’ positions, and  outline policy options .  Based on the above objectives, we investigate the following research questions:   • What is the nature of evidence available on the expected impact of AI on jobs in the EU?   • What is the potential of AI to create decent jobs in the EU?   • To what extent does AI (a) offer opportunitie s to improve working conditions and (b) pose risks  associated with the use of AI in a working environment?   • What is the current evidence on national and EU policies and practices on the use of AI for  improving working conditions?                                                                 2  European Commission (2018).   3  European Commission (2018).   4  European Commission (202 0a).   5  European Parliament (202 0a); European Parliament (2020b) .  6  Cedefop (n.d.).  
Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.911  10  This analysis uses the find ings of a targeted literature review and five semi -structured interviews with  key informants  to map out the current landscape of research.   1.3. Key concepts and definitions   This analysis  uses the European Commission’s definition of the term artificial intellige nce: it “refers to  systems that display intelligent behaviour by analysing their environment and taking actions – with   some degree of autonomy – to achieve specific goals ”7. The literature reviewed considers  the broader  implications of automation and  digit alisation , rather than being focus ed solely on AI  as a software .  However, we make specific references to AI -based technologies (including robotics)8 where these  references are supported by the evidence.  Job quality and decent work  are generally difficult concepts  to define and measure. For the purposes of defining decent work  for this analysis , we use the aspects of  job quality identified by Eurofound9: earnings, prospects ( for example,  employment security and  growth), intrinsic qu ality ( for example, work intensity, environment, autonomy), and working time  quality ( for example,  hours, flexibility).  The working conditions  examined through this analysi s  consider the findings of EU -OSHA10 on the  main occupational safety and health risks  and on the  opportunities associated with digitalisation ( work equipment and tools; skills, knowledge and  information requirements; work organisation and management; employment status, hierarchies and  relationships; characteristics of the workforce; responsibilities for managing occupational health and  safety ).  1.4. Structure of the analysis   This analysis covers the expected impact of AI on jobs in the EU ( section 2.1), the  potential of AI to  create decent jobs in the EU ( section 2.2), the opportunities and risks that AI brings to worki ng  conditio ns (section 2.3), and the current  EU and Member State policies and practices that consider the  issue  (section 2.4). Conclusions and  recommendations for future action  are included in s ection 3.                                                                   7  EU-OSHA (2019, p. 2). Unless otherwise specified in this analysis, AI is identified as a software, AI -base d decisions and AI data processing.   8  Further information on the challenges and methodological limitations can be found in the annex.   9  Eurofound (2016).   10  EU-OSHA (2018).  
Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      11 PE 662.911  2. FINDINGS  2.1. The e xpected impact of AI on jobs in the EU   This section examines the available evidence on (i) the forecasted and predicted impact of AI on jobs  in the EU  and (ii) the impact of AI  on jobs in the EU .  2.1.1.  There are multiple and differing forecasts and predictions regarding the impact of  AI on job losses and job creation   This analysis is focused on forecasts on job losses and creation where AI  is an enabler of software -based ,  autonomous decision -making. Forecasts typically use forms of quantitative, economic -based  modelling11; surveys to present the prevailing sentiments about job displacement12; or estimates based  on research intensities  and  research and development  expenditure in industry and academia13. We can   discern the following types of forecasts:  country -specific forecasts not focused on the EU ; country specific forecasts focus ed on EU Member States ; forecasts of types of jobs, tasks and skills;  sector specific forecasts ; and socio economic  forecasts. We discuss relevant findings from each of these types  of forecasts below.   a. High -income countries will be better positioned to adapt to the requirements of  AI-led  automation   Thanks to the availability of robust , long -term employment and labour market data , more evidence on  the impact of AI is available for high -income countries , which include Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development ( OECD ) countries  and many EU Member States . Cross -analysis of forecasts,   including those provided by OECD and McKinsey & Company on AI and job losses14, suggests  that up  to one third of work activities could be displaced by 2030 due to automation15. High -income economies  are expected to be better position ed to adapt  to the changes required by AI -led automation than  middle - to low- income ones16. A study considering tasks (rather than jobs) across 32 countries  found  that about one in two jobs could be significantly transformed by automation, given the tasks they  involve17. About 14% of jobs in OECD countries are estimated to be highly automatable ( i.e. to be at  least 7 0% likely to be automated ).  Among high -income Asian countries  (with high  levels of investment in science, technology,  engineering , and m athematics (STEM)  education ), Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea are  expected to economically prosper despite the risks of AI -led automation18. In middle -income countries ,  such as Thailand and India, 70% of total employment  is deemed to be at risk due to AI-based  automation .19 Middle - to low- income countries (such as Central and South American countries and  North African countries) may not be equipped to address the challenges posed by automation and                                                                11  Acemoglu & Restrepo (2018); Braganza et al.

EU Member States  with high levels of technology adoption are expected to see minimal or  positive net employment effects due to adoption of AI technologies   Among  EU countries, Nordic  countries  are expected to manage the risks of AI -led automation without  significant loss of economic activity or social disruption21. Similarly, the net employment effects of AI  technologies in “digital forerunner” countries in n orthern Europe  are expected to be minimal or even  posi tive22. EU countries that are not technology  rich  (for example,  Bulgaria, Romania and Croatia) are  more likely to experience negative effects of AI -based automation23. Evidence from France suggests  that such sectors as transport, retail banking , and health  are likely to adapt well to the risks posed by  AI and AI -led automation24. Manufacturing , utilities and  communication  in the EU are projected to  have the highest proportional job losses in all scenarios. Growth in employment is projected for only a  few occ upations, such as information and communication technology  (ICT), legal , social , and  cultural  (and related associate) professionals, science and engineering  associate s, and  pr o fess ional  and customer services clerks25.  c. Jobs that rely on well- defined task routines are at risk of being replaced due to adoption of AI   Based on  current empirical evidence on AI adopted from 2011 to 2020,  only a few occupations can be  expected to be either eliminated or unaffected26.  Occupations that rely on well- defined routines and occupations involving physical work/manual work  that rely solely on physical strength are at the most risk of loss of demand27. This includes jobs in  agriculture  (due to the development of remotely controlled, self -driving tractors); in call centre s  (which can be replaced by speech recognition software); in postal services  (mail sorters, processors,  carriers); in clerical work ( data entry , legal) ; and in retail  (shop assistants )28. Jobs in unpredictable  environments  (such as gardening, plumbing, childcare  and care of the elderly ) are considered  technically difficult to automate and so are projected to be at lower risk of automation by 203029.  Occupations involving non- routine cognitive tasks  (such as lab technicians, engineers and actuari es )  are often judged to be most exposed to AI30. Forecasts highlight that jobs requiring social and cognitive  intelligence31 and  empathy , as well as  jobs in unpredictable environments , are expected to be at low  risk from  AI32. From this perspective, those with jobs i n IT, manag ement, science,  teaching , h u ma nit ies ,  social science, media science or artistic professions  or as l awyers , doctors and nursing staff are likel y to                                                                20  Wissikirchen et al.

Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      13 PE 662.911  remain in demand33. The World Economic Forum (W EF)’s 2020 Future of Jobs report suggest s that  algorithms and machines are likely to  replace  tasks of information  and data processing  and retrieval ,  administrative tasks , and some aspects of traditional manual labour. H umans will, however, r et ain  a  comparative advantage in such tasks as managing, a dvising, decision -making, reasoning,  communicating and interacting34.  d. Different sectors (and therefore different Member States) will be affected to different degrees  by AI   The varying levels of impact on sectors may also result in differing levels of impact  on Member States   due to  the varying  size of sectors within each . Agriculture  is identified as an area in which the impact  of AI on jobs is expected to differ significantly across the Member States35. Countries such as Germany  and the Netherlands  (which rely on large economies of scale through industrial fa rming ) may be likely   to be the first adopters of AI-led technologies36. Countries such as Bulgaria and  Romania, with thei r  predominance of individual farmers , are likely to lag behind in automation37. There is  a need for  differentiated policy measures depending on the type of sector to which AI is being deployed  and the  stage of AI deployment and adoption  in the sector38.  e. Predictions of how AI will impact employment are highly dependent on the underlyi ng  datasets   The WEF 2020 Future of Jobs survey respondents estimated that by 2025, 85 million jobs may be  displaced by a shift in the division of labour between humans and machines39. Other forecasts suggest  that women are likely to be affected disproportionately by increased uptake of AI , with estimates that  women will be over 57% of the workers who will be affected by these job market disruptions40. One of  the explanations is that wom en are more likely to be employed in jobs facing a high risk of  automation41.  However, other forecasts do not predict  large -scale  unemployment and social disruption in the wake  of increased adoption of AI and robotics technologies. Other authors assert that  the share of jobs lost  to technology is at a historic low and that, therefore , fears of technologically  driven unemployment are  often overstated42. Based on the analysis of job task descriptions and the text of patents, a recent study  highlights that , unlike software and robots , AI is directed at high -skilled tasks43. Therefore, provided  that historical patterns of job and task  substitution continue, AI will reduce wage inequality, but will  not affect the top 1%  of earners44. For example, the WEF 2020 Future of J obs survey  estimates that by                                                                33  Wisskirchen et al. (2017).

Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.911  14  2025, 97 million new roles may emerge that are more adapted to the new division of labour between  humans, machines and algorithms45.  2.1.2.  Current evidence on the impact of AI on jobs presents a mixed picture of job losses  and gains   AI is expected to play a role in automating complicated but repetitive or regularly performed tasks  in   the period 2020–204046. The banking , transport and  health  sectors are identified as examples of  sectors which have adapted to such a transformation by modifying job requirements, reskilling workers  and developing new services. The agricultural sector  faces job losses in high -income countries. Due  to the use of automatic irrigation systems  and  intelligent harvesting and transporting machines, the  deman d for seasonal, temporary labour (which is often employed through foreign harvest hands and  helpers ) is expected to decrease47. In large agricultural businesses , the demand for technically versed  employees to check and repair the machines will grow as the d ependence of high -income countries  on low- wage  workers from abroad decreases . This is likely to result in an oversupply of manual labour  in agriculture in medium - and low- income countries48.  a. New , high -productivity tasks and jobs need to be created in response to increased adoption   of AI   To produce positive outcomes for workers, new , high -productivity tasks need to be created by AI to  boost productivity sufficiently to raise consumer demand and therefore increase the demand for  human labour49. As the use  of AI displac es well- defined, routinised tasks , the remaining tasks, wh ich   require  human input , will be highly skilled , leading to the potential for greater responsibility and /or  pressures on workers50. However, the evidence of increased polarisation of wo rk between highly  s killed  and low- skilled workers (affecting the medium -skilled middle -income jobs ) is linked with trade  liberalisation and the digital technologies landscape , rather than being a specific outcome of AI -based  technologies51. The estimates on  income losses  and  job displacement vary , with a shift from  manufacturing to services cited as a  significant influencing factor in job displacement by some  sources52.  When considering the  shift from human s to machines, one interviewee caution ed against  assu ming  that automation is inevitable  for low -wage jobs53. This interviewee posit ed that such a transition will  be highly dependent on whether  the use of machines  is cost  effective . This interviewee argued that a s  long as there is a  supply of low- income human labour  for low- paid  jobs and no demonstrable c ost  advantages to using machines , automation is not a certain outcome54. Such a scenario suggests that a  further examination of different types of work , and whether AI complements it or substitutes it, is  requir ed.                                                                45  World Economic Forum (2020).   46  Benhamou et al.

Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      15 PE 662.911  b. AI-based technologies are expected to displace tasks rather than completely replace jobs   Although there have been notable forecasts identifying large -scale disruption of current job markets55,  AI is expected to displace parts of the activities within jobs over the long  term , rather than replace  entire jobs . Very few occupations consist primarily of performing automatable tasks, although nearl y  all occupations include automatable components56. This view of AI and robotics displacing tasks rather  than job s in their entirety was also echoed by some interviewees57. One of the interviewees highlighted  that when considering  labour market history , the role of technologies is more likely to be evolutionary  than revolutionary58.  Thanks to AI -based technologies , certain segments of the job  market may experience growth in better paying occupations59. Provided that workers are able to gain access to such occupations through  reskilling or upskilling, markets may witness productivity gains60. However, t o ensure this , policy  mechanisms to support such a change in occupational demand will be needed to ensure competitive  market structures that enable equitable diffusion of innovation61.  However, t hese estimates often consider the broader  landscape of  digital technologies , rather than the  impact of specific technologies , such as AI. One of the estimates suggests that current technology  could automate 45% of the activities people are paid to perform, with  60% of all occupations  potentially seeing  30% or more of their constit uent activities automated62. An OECD report estimates  that only 9% of jobs are at high risk of being fully automated63. A McKinsey report also estimates that  only 5% of jobs could be totally substituted by technology64. In this context , such sectors as accounting,  sales, logistics and trading are likely to see some tasks being replaced by specialised software and AI65.  c. The impact of AI will depend on  institutional investment  and ownership patterns of the  technology   The impact of AI will depend on the policies  and  the public and private investment in and ownershi p  of the technological research that underpins it66. The impact of AI on workers will depend on  organisational incentives to retain and retrain staff and also on the general infrastructure  fo r t r a ining  and job -search available in the country, direct government funding, tax incentives and the reac h of  social benefit systems in the country67. Workers will need to acquire not only AI -related skills, but also  skills in areas that AI cannot perfo rm well, such as creative and social intelligence, reasoning skills, and  dealing with uncertainty68. This suggests that the impact of AI will differ  across EU Member States  due  to the differen t structures governing  their labour markets  and the level of d ependence upon  jobs at  increased risk of AI -led displacement .                                                                55  Frey & Osborne (2013); Brynjolfsson & McAfee (2017).   56  Brynjolfsson et al.

Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.911  16  2.2. The potential of AI to create decent jobs in the EU   There is very limited direct evidence on the potential of AI to create decent jobs in the EU. Although  there has been  some exploration of pote ntial ways in which decent jobs may be manifested in the  context of A I, this is not in the context of EU -specific information. We therefore additionally  draw on  interview testimonies to identify trends that are relevant to the impact AI could have in terms  of  creating  and maintaining  decent jobs.   2.2.1.  AI brings both risks and opportunities in terms of creating and maintaining decen t  jobs   The evidence suggests that there are important divergences between the development and  implementation of AI technologies and the maintenance and improvement of the availability of   “decent work ”69. The increased adoption of AI could result in decent jobs being replaced with ad  hoc  or temporary , gig-economy work. This could result in the certainty of regular income in a decent job  being replaced with income volatility or no income, due to the workers being shifted to contingency  work, which could disrupt family and social cohesion70. Although not specific to AI, some evidence  indicates that automation can play a role in reducing the availability of decent jobs. There may be  additionally demographic and geographic al barriers to the creation of decent jobs71: 90% of the new  jobs brought about by automation need to be generated in low - and lower  middle -income countries ,  where traditions o f “decent jobs ” are not well established72.  The study commissioned by the Nordic Council of Ministers offers a useful counterpoint . This sourc e  suggests that digitalisation can be an enabler in delivering flexibility in staffing and work organisation  by mat ching local labour supply and demand, and by online crowd  work matching tasks and workers  regardless of geographical constraints73. In addition, the shift towards gig -economy work can have  benefits for some workers: the p otential de -bundling of jobs into sm aller tasks can create opportunities  for workers to freelance or top  up their income and for organisations to gain  “on-demand ” access to  external labour74. The evidence identifies that digital platforms enabl e non- standard employment and  work environment patterns75.  The extent to which AI can contribute to a decent salary for work is unclear. Some studies suggest  that  AI may have a positive impact on wage growth for workers who are in higher -wage occupations, ha ve  highly specialist skills and/or have higher educational attainment76,77. One study found that the relative  wages across skill groups (high, medium and low) were unchanged after the introduction of AI78.  However, other  evidence suggests that for those in mi ddle - or lower -skilled jobs , AI-based automation  could lead to salary reduction despite the employee experiencing no significant change in worki ng  hours79.                                                                69  Braganza et al.

Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      17 PE 662.911  2.2.2.  The impact that AI could have on decent jobs  may depend on the broader societal,  commercial  and industrial frameworks and drivers in place   Interviewees noted key areas that need further investigation when examining the potential for AI to  improve decent jobs : the role of institutional factors, the use of AI for conducting hire -and-fire policies,   and the operational framework s within which  algorithmically  managed platform work is governed80.  The risks to decent jobs due to  platforms which rely on AI -powered algorithms to make real -time  decisions was identified as a legislative  and regulatory respon sibility , rather than a n inherentl y   negative characteristic of AI81. The legal framework s in which AI would work with human workers , as  well as the business drivers for AI -enabled decent job creation , are not yet clear82.  One interviewee considered that the impact would be affected by the significant disparities between   Member States  in terms of the  collective bargaining powers vested in workers83. The interviewee  suggested that the potential of AI to create decent jobs is limited in places where the labour market is   quite segregated (including e astern and  southern Europe ) compared with those with well- developed  collective bargaining power systems  (Nordic  countries ). As a result, the benefits accrued due to AI will  vary for different workers across Member States84.  2.3. Opportunities and risks associated with AI in a working environment   This section examine s the extent to which AI  offer s opportunities to improve and, conversely, pose s  risks to the working conditions  and the working environme nt.  2.3.1.  Using AI in the workplace has the potential to reduce physical risks, encourage  skills development and reduce inequality in hiring   a.  AI-driven automation can reduce the risk of harm to the worker through taking over  repetitive  or dangerous  tasks  AI can facilitate the automation of tasks  by allowing machines (including robots)  to take over or  facilitate repetitive, routine and dangerous tasks  that would otherwise be carried out by humans . While  some potential risks to harm were  also identified (see sectio n 2.3.2) , reducing injury  was  a key po t ential  benefit of AI that was  identified in the literature85 and by interviewees86. Such technology  can carry out   tasks  within  environments that are dangerous for human workers. Workers may be less  likely to be  injured  by malfunction , as there are fewer mechanical  moving parts involved in  automated  machinery87 and  AI can use d ata to alert human operators and workers t o the risk of injury88.                                                                80  Interviewees 4 and 5.   81  Interviewee 3.   82  Interviewee 1.   83  Interviewee 4.   84  Interviewee 4.   85  Benhamou et al.

Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.911  18  b. Automation of repetitive tasks by AI may also encourage interpersonal or specialist skills  development   Within  more specialist and highly  skilled jobs, the use of AI to complement and support job elements   may lead to workers being able to focus more on interpersonal or “ softer ” skills , rather than techni c al  skills. In this way, AI could augment and support workers’ “uniquely human” abilities89,90. F o r  exa m ple,  AI’s use in healthcare may  lead clinicians to focus more on the uniqu ely human skills of holistic  diagnos is and empathy91. Case studies examining how remote patient -monitoring platforms in  hospitals affected the work of nurses and how diagnostic assistance software is used by general  medicine practitioners both suggested tha t the human professionals would be able to spend more  time liaising with patients (doc tors) or with other healthcare professionals (nurses ) when using  AIenabled devices92. In sales , AI may be used in routine interactions with customers , allowing  human  workers to focus on complex cases and sophisticated  interactions with customers93. An example is the  Alibaba chatbot , which managed 95% of customer inquiries in  201794. When AI technologies were used  to provide financial  advice to bank advisers throug h chatbots, the skills required from human financ i al  advisers shift ed away from technical knowledge (as this can be gained from the chatbot) and towards  the management of customers and risky financial situations , both of which were argued to r equ ire   human input . As a result, the source reflected on the need for more training in a different direction  (such as negotiation)95.  Examples abound from various healthcare specialisms, where the introduction of AI led  to medical  professionals being required or able to  develop more specialist skills  in the field (see Box 1 ). While the  use of AI to replace routine tasks may require new skill s development and more training, few articles  appeared to explicitly address this96. Instead, the literature focus ed on the implications that such uses  of AI might have for overall productivity97 and where AI can improve the accuracy of a task or where AI  can make a previously impossible task possible.                                                                 89  Manyika et al.

Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      19 PE 662.911  Box 1: AI technologies can support the development of healthcare specialisms     Source:  Benhamou et al. (2018).   c. AI could potentially be used to improve equality in  hiring staff, manage employees  and  promote  wellbeing   Some sources consider that algorithms, which use AI to make decisions based on existing  datasets, may   provide  more objective and neutral way s of measuring employees’ performance and eliminate the  possibility of individual biases by supervisors98. Similarly, in recruitment decisions, there is potential for  tools using AI to reduce bias against group s of applicants,  again ensuring more inclusion and diversi ty  in the workplace99. Other sources, however, identified more risks than benefits in this regard (see  section 2.3.2).   AI may be able to identify new skills and training that are needed among  workers. Its ability to proc ess  large amounts of data and learn in real time may help in providing continuous feedback100. One  example given is that of IBM, which experimented using an AI -enabled tool to identify the reasons why  employees were underperforming and to suggest training options , before considering redundancy.  The trial , in 2017,  resulted in 3,500 employees in Europe (out of 80,000) improving their perfo rmance  and remaining at the company , and it saved the company USD 450 million in retraining and  redundancy101.  Algorithmic management techniques can offer  considerable flexibility and autonomy , including by   enabling remote working  and providing flexibility in working time for workers102. However, s o u rces  emphasised that such a benefit  was not an inevitable result of AI technology being developed , but  rather a conscious policy option that depended on regulatory efforts103.                                                                98  Bodie et al. ( 2016) in De Stefano (2018) . There is also a risk , however , that AI may be more narrowl y focussed on what can be measured.   99  Frontier Economics (2018) .  100  Kark et al .

In cardiology : AI technologies are used in electrocardiograms (ECGs) in order to interpret ECG s and  detect pathologies quickly and to a better extent than cardiologists  can.

In patient monitoring : AI technologies are used in remote patient -monitoring platforms to moni tor  patients’ vital signs (which are usually monitored by nurses) .

Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.911  20  AI-enabled monitoring devices can be used  to support work wellbeing initiatives. S ome interviewees  considered that the use of AI to improve the monitoring of  employees’ activity and wellbeing could be  beneficial  if introduced well and in a transparent way, as it could provide significant amounts of  personal  data that may allow for  earlier intervention for workers experiencing stress and burn -out104. It   could also be used, at a meta level, for inspectors and auditors to examine the impact of work –life  balance measures at a workplace105. In general, i nterviewees were emphatic that care over  implementation, including  strict systems and regulations around how such data is collected, is vital to  ensure that these benefits c ome about106.  2.3.2.  Using AI in the workplace is associated with multiple risks to working co nditions   a. Working with AI -enabled technology may  increase  the risk of physical or psychosocial injury  among  workers   Technology that relies on AI may b e more limited than human workers in i ts abilities to calculate risks.  AI-assisted technology that is designed to detect specific objects can work  less well in low lighting  conditions , while the over 90% success rate of t echnologies used for fruit -picking and other agricultural  processes still leaves room for errors that cause h arm107. Machines’ reliance on software  and AI  algorithms  can be problematic , and there are examples of serious injury and death as a result of AI operated technology in the US A108. Ensuring that workers receive sufficient training to operate AI and  to avoid ac cidents will be  important109.  Workers’ tasks may also become increasingly fragmented when AI is used to  take over some or all  aspects. This may result in workers feeling that they do not understand the entire task , feeling less  interested110, or feeling that  they are being de-skilled and under -valued111. The European Parliament  discussed the risks of dehumanisation within those receiving services from AI technologies,  but fewer  studies have discussed the similar pressure on workers collaborating with automated t echnology112.  Workers who increasingly work alongside AI -powered  algorithms instead of colleagues or managers  may experience a decline in their social  interaction113. Relationships with colleagues and co -workers  are considered to be important for workers’ moti vation and wellbeing , and the elimination of suc h  interactions from workplaces may lead to dissatisfaction and less motivation114. However, much of the  evidence reviewed  is conceptual , with few direct examples of the precise nature of the psychosocial  risks.                                                                 104  Cabrelli & Graveling (2019) and also Interviewee 1.   105  Interviewees 1 and 4.   106  Interviewees 1 and 4.   107  European Commission (2020b) .  108  Wisskirchen et al.

Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      21 PE 662.911  b. Excessive and opaque  uses of AI-enabled monitoring devices lead to  privacy concerns  and  further psychosocial risks   The use of AI to monitor workers is seen as a negative innovation in most of the literature reviewed.  Concerns tend to focus on (i) data and  privacy concerns and (ii) the perceived loss  of autonomy and  associated psychosocial risks115. Interviewees suggested that remote monitoring in this way may  increase further due to the COVID -19 pandemic , as more workers work from home or remotely116.  AI-enabl ed devices may have the potential to gather more data than is expected  or for the data to be  used by the employer in algorithms that are not transparent. Examples include wearable devices that  measure if workers are gathering together117, algorithms that use  employees’ data to affect their ratings  and pay118, and health -monitoring wearable devices that can also be used to consider the number of  hours worked, rest breaks taken and activity levels119. The potential  risk to data  privacy is widely  recognised not only  in the literature and by interviewees, but also by the European Commission and  an increasing number of Member States ( as discussed in section 2.4)120.  Excessive  monitoring or surveillance can be  facilitated by AI and  can have a negative impact  on the  wellbeing of workers121. Many  sources  suggest that excessive monitoring generates psychosoc ial risks,  including the loss of autonomy122, increased stress123, decreased self -esteem, decreased confidence,  increased anxiety and paranoia, and decreased levels of creativity and communication124. Mo n it or ing  can lead to physical risks, with a higher likeliho od of repetitive strain injury, nerve disorders and high  blood pressure125. Workers are also increasingly likely to overwork  and thus be at risk of further injury.  For example, workers at UPS ignored safety rules in order to meet their targets , and truck drivers  skipped legally mandated breaks126.  AI facilitates monitoring to a greater degree and may increase the existing  psychosocial risks by being   pre-embedded in tools for workplace management127. A lack of transparency in how data are  used i s  likely to exacerbate the effect of monitoring data128. Interviewees explained that  the privacy concerns  brought about by AI -enabled monitoring devices  represent  significant risks to working conditions ,  because of the power imbalance that is  create d between the employer (who gathers a large amount  of data) and the worker (who provides data for free without understanding fully how this is used)129.                                                                115  Cabrelli & Graveling (2019) ; De Stefano (2018) ; Moore (2020); Servoz (2019) .  116  Interviewees 4  and 5 .  117  Servoz (2019) .  118  De Stefano (2018) .  119  Servoz (2019) .  120  European Commission (2020a); Lane & Saint -Marti n (2021) .   121  Benhamou et al.

Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.911  22  c. Using AI may contribute to lower employee engagement and feelings of alienation   Using AI -monitoring tools could decrease trust in the employment relationship because of the feeling  of being watched and thus feeling inhibited. In some instances, this may lead to workers  per forming  tasks more poorly or to managers focusing on surveillance rather than development and training130.  Working with AI -powered platforms instead of with colleagues may lead to a decrease in interpersonal  skills and social skills (including critical t hinking,  motivating, negotiating, decision -making)131.  Using AI -monitoring systems to collect performance data on employees may encourage more coercive  supervisory styles and less focus on skills development. Drawing on data from call centre workers, a  study  found that,  although more participatory management styles were anticipated after the  introduction of AI, these management styles did not come about;  instead , monitoring data tended to  be used to validate managers’ existing opinions132. This contradicts the potential benefit that AI coul d  bring in providing a counter to the potential biases of the individual supervisor (see section 2.3.1).   Adapting a wor kplace to include AI is likely to bring about wider organisational changes that can be  disruptive133. Change s in the structure of jobs ( for example,  working with fewer colleagues ) and  managing systems ( for example, these becoming  automated) had significant effects on organisati onal  structure, styles of leadership and management, and general organisational culture134. Evidence  suggest s that changes in organisational identity in this way can have negative impacts on the  engagement of existing employees135. In a  study which used a survey to examine the impact of  introducing  AI on employees’ psychosocial  contracts,  engagement and trust , employee engagement  fell when AI was adopted , regardless of the extent of prior relationships between em ployer and  employee136. The study suggests  that AI adoption brought about a new  type of psychological contract,  called  “alienational ,” where there was only ad  hoc communication, maintained  through technol ogy,  with sporadic time periods and limited human interaction137.  d. Using algorithmic monitoring and decision -making in human resources and workforc e  management may entrench bias and inequality   While some sources were hopeful  that AI may be abl e to reduce individual biases in promoting and  hiring decisions  (see section 2.3.1), others discussed the risk  that AI , being  dependent on past data, will  entrench existing biases. An AI-enabled tool that uses data of past recruitment decisions to trai n  machine -learning algorithms on the use of future applications will be likely to learn to perpetuate any  existing racial, gender, ethnic or other biases  within the dataset138. For example, a recent Amazon AI enabled recruitment tool downgraded CVs perceived to be from women (for example, which  mentioned all -women’s colleges or female -indicating phrases)  due to the prevalence of men in  technical roles139. There is also a  risk that AI may perpetuate bias  due to having been developed in                                                                130  Aiello & Svec (1993) in  Moore (2020) .  131  Doyle (2017) ; International Bar Association (2017); Lin dzon (2017)  in Saithibvongsa & Yu (2018) .  132  Ajunwa et al.

To  mitigate these risks , the data used needs to be as unbiased as possible141, and  also varied142, to ensure  that AI software can make balance d decisions143.  e. AI may weaken  workers’ bargaining power and privacy rights   Some  literature and interviewees suggest that the extensive amount of data gathered by AI -en abled  monitoring devices gave employers  a stronger position than employees144. This had the potenti al to  undermine worker rights and hinder improvements in working conditions145.  The lack of transparency about how AI technologies are being used to monitor in the workplace and  how they are used in decisions about hiring, firing and promoting  means that there are fewer  opportunities for workers to challenge the decisions146. There is the potential  for highly  personal data  to be gathered from workers and used for performance management without t his being transparent   to the worker147. In some instances, location- tracking data has been used to prevent unionisation and  meeting of workers by employers, including in McDonald ’s in the US A148 and by Amazon warehouse  operatives149. A recent study indicated tha t worker representatives in call centres in Germany  and  Poland  were frequently blocked from accessing information about the data collected on employees  and to find ways in whic h unions could have a presence in bargaining around call centre rights .150  Interviewees considered that this was more likely to be the case in Member States  where there were  fewer regulations around workers’ rights151.  The m onitoring of workers’ progress may also push for more performance -driven remuneration, which  can risk workers  exceeding maximum working hours as a result.  More long -term considerations are the  potential eroding effect of AI technology on workers’  holidays, sick leave and other protections , given   that such protections will not be required by the AI -enabled algorit hms and robot s152. Potenti al  solutions  suggested include ensuring that there is a minimum wage set for workers153 and adapti ng  legislation and regulations around working time to encompass and consider these risks154.                                                                140  De Stefano (2018) .  141  Interviewee 2.   142  Li et al.

Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.911  24  2.3.3.  Regulation and policy -making play important roles in determining the extent of  the impact that AI may have on  working conditions   AI and other developing technologies are likely to have an impact on working conditions (includi ng  time, work intensity, autonomy, flexibility, control, health and safety) . However, it is not yet always  possible to tell whether these changes will bring improvements or increased risks to the worker155.  While AI could  bring opportunities for skills development, it will be important to ensure that there are  funds and mechanisms available for such skills development to take place156. Although AI could bring  potential benefits for workers in terms of wellbeing, flexibility and reduced hours, the actual benefit is  dependent on the actions of  institutions and government  to ensure that legislation relating to workers  is sufficiently updated to protect those working with AI157. Interviewees considered that the EU would  be important in future regulation of AI to ensure a united and cohesive approach158, but they also  emphasised the need to ens ure suitable flexibility to allow for Member States to take actions  appropriate to their context and labour market159.  This highlights the  need to have regulation and legislation to  ensure that AI is developed in a “human centred way” : encompassing research and consideration of human supervisors, users, and  collaborators160; addressing the potential for information asymmetry (where employers hold more  information and knowledge about the information than the employees  do)161; and considering how  AI  can be used to protect and enhance workers’ rights162.  2.4. Policies and practices in EU and  Member S tate s relating to AI and  working conditions   This section covers  the current state of play on policies and practices (including legislation) at the EU  and Member State level that  consider AI in relation to working conditions and aim to use  AI to improv e  working conditions .  2.4.1.  Recent EU strategies on AI were considered important  in setting future policy   When considering the direction of future policies and practice, the European Commi ssion’s 2020 Data  Strategy  and White Paper on Artificial Intelligence  were cited as important163. These set out a  strategic approach to AI and identified key principles with implications for the use of AI in the  workforce . These key principles include p utting people before technology  (including in developing  technology and regulating use) and ensuring a coordinated European approach to AI164. The White  Paper lays out a risk -based approach to AI regulation , where the level of risk is dependent on the impac t   of AI on citizens’ lives. In this model, high -risk cases (including using AI for recruitment processes and  for situations impacting human rights) would require transparent, traceable and overseen AI systems,  with algorithms tested and certified. Interview ees considered the upcoming regulatory framework                                                                155  Eurofound (2020).   156  Interviewee 2.   157  Interviewee 2.   158  Interviewees 2, 3 and 4.  159  Interviewee 4.   160  Wisskirchen et al.

Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      25 PE 662.911  from the European Commission on AI  to be vital to ensure that there will be  cohesive policy across  the EU165 and that Member States  develop comprehensive national strategies on AI166.  The Opinion on Artificial I ntelligence from the European Economic and Social Committee167  recommend s that the EU, national governments and social partners identify the job sectors lik ely  to be  affected by AI and consider solutions that consider the impact on the nature of work, employ ment,  social systems and inequality168. It states  that national governments should consider how AI systems  could be “co-created ” in the workplace to ensure that AI complements and improves upon humans’  work , and  it states  that ethical guidelines on AI should include principles of transparency in the use of  AI systems to manage and hire employees169.  2.4.2.  A broad range of existing  EU legislation already plays a part in regulating  the  impact of AI on working conditions   While EU act ion that specifically covered AI was limited to strategies, in practice, the impact of AI on  working conditions was governed by a broad range of EU legislation. This included those focusing on  data privacy, h ealth and safety, working time and workers’ righ ts.  a. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulated  use of workers’ personal data as  gathered through AI tools   The GDPR  was considered of key importance when considering how AI and its use in the workplace  was and could be sufficiently regulated by Member States170. The GDPR requires Member States  to set  out specific rules to ensure that the rights and freedoms of employees  regarding their  personal data  being processed in an employment context are being protected. This has implications for data  collected by monitoring devices of all kinds, including those using AI. Member  States have addressed  this issue in various ways  when transposing  GDPR  into national legislation171. Some Member States   have national regulations or agreements that explicitly address surveillance devices and require  employers to inform both the workforce and trade union/worker representative groups , following a  strict procedure  (including Belgium172 and France173). Other countries have fewer procedures that  monitor the use of surveillance, which may not include trade unions or may give more power to the  employer (examples include Germany174, the Netherlands175 and Swed en176). Building on GDPR,  Opinion 2/2017 on Data Processing at Work  focused on nine scenarios where modern technology  has increased the ability of the employer to monitor employees and sets  out good practice in ensuri ng  workers’ privacy rights a re maintained177. One interviewee suggested that po tential refinements  – s uch                                                                165  Interviewees 1 and 5 .   166  Interviewees  4 and 5 .  167  European Economic and Social Committee (2019).   168  De Stefano (2018).   169  European Economic a nd Social Committee (2019).   170  Hendrickx (2018) in De Stefano (2018) ; Moore (2020) .

Legislation around informing and consulting employees about changes in the workplac e may  also be relevant   The  EU Directive 2002/14EC179 requires employers to engage in social dialogue when considering the  impact of technological innovation. The Directive mandates both ad  hoc and regular  information and  consultation duties on the part of the employer  and is an important regulation that ensures workers  are consulted about the introduction of AI technology180. This is transposed in different ways in  Member States. In some,  the introduction of  automated machinery or the use of AI technology may  require consultation or permission from the employer (often, again, to trade unions or collective  bodies). For example, in Sweden , employers are required to regularly inform an employee organisati on  about how their business is developing in terms of production and personnel policy (including those  in AI)181. In Italy , a 2017 national collective agreement for the manufacturing sector includes  a specific  individual right for workers to receive training, t o be better prepared for the introduction of new  automated machinery , and to move to other tasks (if their roles are replaced by machinery)182.  c. Legislation around product  safety, worker protection  and occupational health and safety   regulates the potential im pacts of AI on physical and psychosocial risks   There are several important pieces of legislation from international and EU sources that regulate  product safety , occupational health and safety , and worker protections  and that implicitly guard  against some effects of AI. These include:   • EU Machinery  Directive183: While not explicitly covering robotics and AI184, this Directive  ensures that risk assessments must be carried out by companies before employees work with  robots and that there is a minimum standard for all machine products185.  • General Product Safety Directive186 and Radio Equipment Directive187: These ensur e that  only safe products are sold on the market and that users are informed of associated risks188.                                                                178  Interviewee 5.   179  Council and European Parliament Directive of 11 March 2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees  in the European Community -  Joint declaration of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission on employee representatio n  (2002/14/EC).   180  De Stefa no (2018).   181  De Stefano (2018).   182  Poglietti (2016) in De Stefano (2018).   183  Council and European Parliament Directive of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC. 157 (2006/42/EC) .  184  Interviewee 3.   185  European Commission (2020b).   186  Council and European Parliament Directive of 3 December 2001 on general product safety (2001/95/EC).   187  Council and European Parliament Directive of 16 April 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to the making  available on the  market of radio equipment and repealing Directive 1999/5/EC. 153 (2014/53/EU).   188  European Commission ( 2020b).  
Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      27 PE 662.911  • Multiple occupational health and safety (OSH) directives189, including the Directive s on  Working Time190, Work Equipment191 and the Workplace192, are organised in a common  Framework Directive193 and lay down minimum protection levels194.    While psychosocial risks were covered in the OSH directives, there is some evidence that these are not  yet substantially used in practice : a 2017 evaluation of the OSH directives found that the type and  nature of measures to address these risks  in the workplace were not yet clear195.  The 2018 Council recommendation on  access to social protection for workers and the self employed  and the 2019 Commission proposal on transparent and predictable working  conditions  propose rights to transparent and predictable working conditions for those working i n  non- standard and new for ms of work. T hese principles c ould be the basis for any future adaptati ons of  employment conditions legislation to AI (including  robotics )196. The January 2021 legislative  initiative set out by the European Parliament197 proposes a law enabling digital workers  to  disconnect outside their working hours ; setting out minimum requirements for remote working ; and  clarifying working conditions, hours and rest periods . One interviewee considered it an important  development in terms of regulating the use of AI to monitor workers198.  2.4.3.  Few Member States have policies or strategies that explicitly consider AI in relatio n  to labour markets or working conditions   Evidence reviewed  suggests  that although  most Member States have considered the future of work in  light of digit alisation (e.g. the platform economy), few Member States have policies or strategies that  explicitly consider AI  in relation to working conditions .  Some Member States’ AI strategies have  not consider ed or address ed the labour market (including  Austria, Por tugal , Denmark and  Estonia )199. Some Member States ( Germany and  Poland ) have  consider ed AI in relation to the labour market to focus on the potential positive impacts that AI coul d  have on the country’s international standing in the global economy , rather than on any potential risks  (see Box 2  for examples).                                                                 189  EU-OSHA (n.d.) .  190  Council and European Parliament Directive of 4 November 2003 concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time  (2003/88/EC).   191  Council and European Parliament Directive of 16 September 2009 concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the u se  of work equipment by workers at work (second individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Dir ective 89/391/EEC), 260  (2009/104/EC).   192  Council Directive of 30 November 1989 concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the workplace (first individu al  directive within the meaning of Article 16 (1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) (89/654/EEC) .  193  Council Directive of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at  work (89/391/EEC) .   194  Mateescu & Elish (2019).   195  European Commission (2017b) ; IOM et al.

One exception is France, where the 2019 AI strategy includes key proposals that directly speak to the  impact of AI on labour and working conditions. The strategy was based on a research report that  examined s pecifically the impact of AI on jobs and employment  and sets out plans to consider the  impact of AI on labour , namely , setting  up a research think -tank  to consider the transformation of w ork  and how humans and machines can complement each other in work and developing schemes to  ensure that vocational training is provided to those in jobs at high risk of automation200. Similarly , in   Flanders, Belgium , recen t use of an algorithmic service by the Flanders public employment service to  predict jobseekers’ likelihood of unemployment and motivation201, and the suggestions by the leaders  of the service that further use of artificial intelligence would be beneficial202, has led to increased debate  in the regional parliament over the transparency of the algorithms and the potential for biased data203.                                                                   200  Villani  (2018).   201  AlgorithmWatch (2020).   202  De Cort (2019) in AlgorithmWatch (2020).   203  El Kaouakibi (2020) in AlgorithmWatch (2020).  In Germany, the strategy on AI includes the aims of keeping Germany competitive  internationally, ensuring that AI is deployed and developed for the common good, and ensuri ng  that AI is embedded ethically into society. Althou gh the economic working group advising the  strategy considered the risks of AI relating to social injustice and labour market participation, this  was not addressed in the resulting strategy.   In Poland , the national AI strategy being developed (as of 2020) was expected to focus on the  role that AI can play in providing Poland with an important place in the global economy and to  build a strong internal market. This involves little focus on the potential effects of AI on worki ng  conditions or on the risks that  AI may bring.  
Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      29 PE 662.911  3. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDA TIONS   3.1. Overall conclusions   This analysis provides a complex  picture of the benefits and drawbacks associated with the  increased  adoption of AI in the workplace  and its impact on working conditions . Managing the impact of AI whi l e  minimising disruption to the prevailing social and economic fabric will require careful co n s idera tion  of  the balance of different skills, wages and levels of productivity  in an AI -enabled workplace , as well as  effective regulation and legislation  at a regional and national level .  3.1.1.  Estimates on the impact of AI indicate  trends but lack  granular ity and empirica l  evidence  There is significant variance in the current estimates on the impact of AI , due to differences in  underlying assumptions, datasets used, and (perhaps most importantly ) the regional and national  settings in which the models on job displacement were  created. This  variance indicates the need for a  more consistent analytical framework and the selection of robust datasets to examine the impacts of  AI and  to enable evidence- based planning. Similarly, the benefits and risks of AI to working conditi ons  and the overall impact on job quality remain hypothetical and not yet supported by empirical evidence.  Ongoing monitoring and research examining the state of working conditions in tasks that are exposed  to the increased use of A I are needed . This would open up  opportunities for policy experimentation  and for robust studies examining  how AI can improve specific tasks , what the empirical impact is of AI  in the workplace , and what strategies can both minimise AI’s negative effect on working conditions  and support AI ’s positive influence on  working conditions  or.  3.1.2.  The potential of AI to create decent jobs in the EU will depend on institutional  factors in the Member States   The introduction of AI and automation may have a detrimental effect on the quality of jobs for  displaced workers, pushing them to platform or ad  hoc work , which presents challenges in terms of  lack of job security, income volatility and non -standard working conditions (see section 2.2.1).  Ultimately, the potential for AI to create decent jobs is likely to depend on institutional and societal  factors prevalent in the Member States. Member States with low levels of labour market segregation  and strong collective bargaining frameworks (typically, north ern and western EU Member States) are  more likely to see decent jobs as a result of AI. However, the legal frameworks within which AI  will work  with humans and by which labour markets will be regulated will also play a large part , and these are  not yet established.   3.1.3.  AI is likely to disproportionately affect low-skill and low -pay jobs , thereby  increasing inequalities in the job market and in working conditions   Widespread  use of AI may exacerbate existing inequalities  if it is run in the absence of regulatory  oversight . The evidence highlights that the adoption of AI  disproportionate ly affect s well- defined and  highly routinised  low-  and mid dle-skilled and - paid jobs in specific sector s. These are also the workers  who face the potential risks that AI may bring to working conditions. This will contribute to the ongoing  polarisation (or “hollowing out ”) of the labour market. While this process bring s potential benefits for  skilled workers, it puts some populations ( including women  and older workers) at  a disadvantage.  
Policy Department for Economic, Scientific and Quality of Life Policies     PE 662.911  30  3.1.4.  Optimal use of AI in improving working conditions will depend on legislation ,  enforcement and employer awareness   The negative imp acts of AI on working conditions are, to some extent, mitigated by current EU  legislation , particularly in the field of data privacy  and occupational health and safety. However, further  action by policymakers and institutions may be  required to ensure that  the potential  improvements  that AI could bring to  working conditions can be realised. At present, the lack of explicit reference to AI  in EU legislation and in many Member States’  legislation around working conditions means that thi s  action is not yet suf ficient to realise the benefits. The European Commission’s horizontal regulatory  proposal on artificial intelligence is particularly valuable204. However , all existing and any future  legislation needs to be implemented and enforced in workplaces. T here is a key implementation and  enforcement role to play by relevant EU and national authorities, such as labour inspectorates , by trade  unions ; and by employers. This may pose challenges for sectors and occupations where the use of  machinery (and familia rity with the relevant legislation) is not widespread.   3.1.5.  Member States’ policies on the use of AI for improving working conditions are in  early stages of development   At present , few Member States have policies in place that explicitly address how AI can be u sed to  improve working conditions or consider how to mitigate risks brought by AI to working conditi ons.  With a few exceptions, national policies tend to focus on AI’s potential economic benefits for t he job  market. Promising practices of AI strategies tha t directly refer to the impact of AI on working conditi ons  may be taken from some Member States ( such as France). However, further exploration of how regional  and national governments in EU Member States with different levels of technological development  plan to address the impact of AI on working conditions could offer inspiration and learning.   3.2. Outline recommendations   This study points to  some key recommendations for further investigation and  decision -making to  optimise the impact of AI on working conditio ns.  3.2.1.  More investment in digital skills, tech nology  and computer literacy  is needed to   create a more economically resilient workforce   Workers who are most at risk of job displacement need to be either upskilled to more complex tasks or  reskilled to transition to other in -demand occupations.  If historical patterns of task and job  displacement continue, workers need to move towards those industries and occupations where their  skills are complementary to AI  in order to have more secure jobs . Increased  investment in t echnol ogy  and computer literacy as part of education  and training  offer s (including continuing education)  could  enabl e such  workers  to acquire the necessary skills to thrive in an era dominated by AI -led technologies .  In particular, workers e ngaged in highly routinised  and  well- defined low -wage jobs are at high risk of  their jobs being displaced. Any such  schemes need to provide workers with  a resilien t skill  s et  wh ich   enables them  adapt to changing job markets rather than overemphasise specific skills and jobs whic h  may disappear in the long  term. The Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition  could play a crucial role in  disseminating these opportunities a nd improving the uptake by  employe rs to reach out to those at ri sk  of losing out on the  possible  benefits  of AI.                                                                 204  Proposal for a Regulation laying down harmonised rules on artificial intelligence (Artificial Intelligence Act), https://digital strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/proposal -regulation -laying -down -harmonised -rules -artificial -intelligence -artificial -intelligence . 
Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      31 PE 662.911  3.2.2.  A more granular understanding of AI impact on workplaces and job quality is  necessary  to better harness its potential to improve working conditions   The potential impacts of AI o n working conditions need to be understood and articulated in sufficient  detail to reduce the uncertainty , for example, in  order to prepare workers for the socio econ o mic  and  behavioural changes necessary to work along side  AI-powered algorithms . This suggests the need for  AI-led workplace transformation , introduced in a phased manner  and based on substantial  and  evidence- based decision -making. More granular and empirical data  need  to be collected on  the impac t  of AI in the workplace across Member States, industry sectors, and tasks and for different demographic  groups  by Member S tates and the European Commission and its relevant agencies , such as Eurofound  and EU -OSHA .  Furthermore, t he ubiquity of AI , combined with its likely influence upon a number of other game changing technologies , requires a more thorough  examination of the role that technological factors  play in defining decent jobs. For example, should access to technology  and  connectivity be a  consideration in how decent jobs are conceptualised? Digital inclusion could prove influential in  addressing existing social in equities  and in the successful execution of the E uropean Commission ’s  digital single market strategy . Given this, EU agencies , such as Eurofound , could investigat e how AI  software an d machinery affect job quality (especially in relation to environment and autonomy of  workers)  and  the role of AI and AI -enabled technologies in helping to improve job quality .  3.2.3.  Existing r ules and regulations  across different stages of employment and labour  market lifecycle s need to be updated for the use of AI in the workplace   AI-based technologies are expected to significantly change a number of aspects of existing job  markets , from job advertisement, candid ate selection and skill assessments to worker supervision and  reporting of work and workplaces. In this context, current legislation at Member State  level needs to  be reviewed to understand whether the existing rules and regulations are fit -for-purpose to address  the challenges posed by AI and robotics . The institutional structures  in place for regulatory and legal  oversight  and consultation (including , for example , statistical authoriti es which collect data on  employment  and social wellbeing, national regulatory authorities  which govern specific indust ries, and  ombudsperson services ) may also need to adapt to  anticipate and provide dynamic  responses to  emerging challenges.  To support these changes, the European Commission and its agencies, suc h as  EU-OSHA and Eurofound , will have an important role to play in identifying and promoting good  practice and learning among the EU Member States .  3.2.4.  The role of GDPR in protecting privacy needs to be examined as Member States   devise their own strategies  to address the impact of AI on work and working  conditions   The current provisions of GDPR vis -à-vis the automatic processing of data could be adapted by the  European Parliament and the Council of the European Union to explicitly consider the risk s posed by  the use of AI in surveillance and monitoring to  workers’ privacy and rights . At present, although several  EU Member States  are in the process of identifying regulatory frameworks for the use of AI, the role of  AI in the workplace and its impact on worke rs remains insufficiently investigated. In particular , the use  of GDPR to mitigate the potential ways in which high -risk AI could limit workers’ rights s h o u ld be  assessed to provide a set of good practices to the  Member States .

Improving working conditions using Artificial Intelligence      39 PE 662.911  ANNEX : DESCRIPTION OF  METHOD S USED   This analysis  relied on information gathered through two methods: a targeted literatu re review and  interviews with key stakeholders.   Targeted literature review   In order to identify  relevant literature and policy documents, the team ran a series of targeted searches  in Scopus, Google Scholar and Google to obtain a set of relevant articles . We used combinations of  search terms relating to AI ( "Artificial intelligence" OR "AI" OR "machine learning" OR "ML" OR "roboti c s"  OR "automation" ), the workplace ( "working conditions" OR "workplace safety" OR "decent jobs" OR  "decent work" OR "harmful and  hazardous conditions" OR "occupational safety" OR "work -life balance"  OR " HR management” ), functions of AI ( "surveillance and monitoring" OR "technological delegation"  OR "skill obsolescence" OR "mental health stress" OR "information overload" OR "product ivity" OR  "human bias" OR "digital and AI literacy" ) and geography ("European union" OR "EU" OR "EU Member  States" OR "United Kingdom" OR "United States" OR "US" OR "Australia" OR "OECD countries" ).  For the articles identified on the basis of these searches, the team prioritised evidence published after  2015,  peer -reviewed journal articles and grey literature from well -established national, internati onal  agencies , and evidence from high -income countries (including EU Member States) and OECD countries .  The t eam excluded technical evidence on AI and robotics that focus on design and development of the  technologies. Only English language sources were considered. We included 25 articles.   Interviews with key stakeholders   In order to supplement the information and learning gained from the literature review, we conducted  five  semi -structured interviews with  a broad range of  stakeholders  at the EU/international and  national level. These interviews aimed at gathering view  and inform analysis on  topics related to using  AI to improve working conditions  at a high level . The interviews lasted up to an hour and were  conducted virtually using tele - or web -conferencing methods.  Data safeguarding measures were put  in place to meet the requirements of GDPR. Data were collected on the basis of legitimate interest.  The  following individuals (organisations identified in parentheses) were consulted as part of the interviews  and have consented to being named in this annex: Dragos Adascalitei (Eurofound), William Cockburn  (EU-OSHA), Rossana Merola ( International Labour Organization ), Isabelle Schömann ( European Trade  Union Confederation ), and Sascha Wischniewski (Bundesanstalt für Arbeitsschutz und Arbeitsmedizin).   Limitations of the methods used   We note a few limitations in the methodology followed in this paper. First, the scope of the research  questions and the research conducted was highly concise by design of the European Parliament.  We consulted five interviewees and focused on literature pub lished in the English language. While w e  consider that this may mean that valuable inputs and information could be omitted, we carefull y  selected these to ensure a broad coverage of our proposed research questions. The processes for  selecting relevant sour ces of information are documented above for clarity . Second, our focus was on  AI as a software. Given that the broader literature focused more heavily on trends in automation,  digitalisation and technological development, identifying and distinguishing for ecast and impac ts of  AI was not always possible. Where supported by underlying evidence, we identify the impacts of AI  (including robotics ) on jobs and working conditions clearly in this analysis. We have used the terms  automation and digitalisation trends  in the remaining analysis to ensure consistency with the  underlying evidence.
  PE 662.911  4      The analysis considers evidence on the expected impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on jobs,  discusses the potential of AI to create decent jobs and explores the extent  to which AI offers  opportunities and poses risks to working conditions. The study examines current policies at the EU  and Member State level and recommends some areas for action at the EU level.
