Understanding  artificial in telligence  ethics a nd s afety A guide for the responsible  design and implementation of AI  systems in the public sector Dr David Leslie Public Policy Programme
                  The Public Policy Programme at The Alan Turing Institute was set up in May 2018 with the   aim of developing research, tools, and techniques that help government s innovate with data -intensive  technologies and improve the quality of people's lives. We work alongside policy makers to explore how data  science and artificial intelligence can inform public policy  and improve the provision of public services. We  believe that governments can reap the benefits of these technologies only if they make considerations of  ethics and safety a first priority.     This document provides end-to-end guidance on  how to apply principles of AI ethics and safety  to the design  and implement ation of algorithmic systems  in the public sector. We will shortly release a workbook to bring  the recommendations made in this guide to life. The workbook will contain case studies highlighting how the  guidance contained here  can be applied  to concrete AI  projects.  It will also contain exercises and practical  tools to help strengthen the process -based governance of your AI project.     Please note, that t his guide  is a living document that will evolve and improve with input from users, affected  stakeholders , and interested part ies. We need your participation.

Intended audience and e xisting government g uidance     The following guidance is d esigned to outline values, principles , and guidelines to assist department  and delivery leads in ensuring that they  develop and deploy  AI ethically, safely, and  responsibly.  It is  designed to complement and supplement the Data Ethics Framework. The Data Ethics Framework  is a  practical tool that should be used in any project ini tiation phase.     AI ethics     A remarkable time of human promise has been ushered in by the convergence of the ever -expanding  availability of big data, the soaring speed and stretch of cloud computing  platforms , and the  advancement of increasingly sophistica ted machine learning algorithms.     This brave new digitally interconnected world is delivering rapid gai ns in the power of AI to better   society.  Innovations in AI are already dramatically improving the  provision of essential social goods   and services f rom healthcare, education, and transportation to food supply, energy, and  environmental management. These bounties are, in fact, likely just the start. Because AI and   machine learning systems organically i mprove with the enlargement of access to  data  and the  growth of computing power , they  will only become more effective and useful  as the information age  continues to develop apace . It may not be long before AI technologies become gatekeepers for the  advance ment of vital public interests and sustainable human development.     This prospect that progress in AI will help humanity to confront some of its most urgent challenges is  exciting, but legitimate worries still abound. As with any new and rapidly evolving te chnology, a  steep learning curve means that mistakes and miscalculations will be made  and that both  unanticipated  and harmful impacts will inevitably occur.  AI is no exception.     In order to manage these impacts responsibly and to direct the development o f AI systems toward  optimal public benefit, you will have to make considerations of AI ethics  and safety  a first priority .     This will involve integrating considerations of the social and ethical implications of the design and  use of AI systems into every stage  of the delivery of your  AI project. It will also involve a collaborative  effort  between  the data scientists, product ma nagers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery  managers  on your team  to align the development of artificial intelligence technologies with ethical  values and principles that safeguard and promote the wellbeing of the communities that these  technologi es affect.     By including a primer on AI ethics with the  Guide, we are provid ing you with the conceptual  resources and practical tools that will enable you to steward the responsible design and  implem entation  of AI projects.      AI ethics is a set of values, principles, and techniques that employ widely accepted standards of right  and w rong to guide moral conduct in the development and use of AI technologies.     
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  4 These values, principles, and techniques are intended both to motivate morally acceptable practices  and to prescribe the basic dutie s and obligations necessary to produce ethical,  fair, and safe AI  applications.       Why AI e thics?            The field of AI ethics has largely emerged as a response to the range of individual and societal harms  that the misuse, abuse, poor design , or negative unintended consequences  of AI systems may cause.  As a way to orient you to the importance of building a robust culture of AI ethics, here is a table that  represents some of the most consequential forms that these potential harms may take:       Potential Harms  Caused by  AI Systems   Bias and Discrimination     Because they gain their insights from the existing structures and dynamics of the societies they analyse, data driven technologies can reproduce, reinforce , and amplify  the patterns of marginalisation, inequality, and  discrimination that exist in these soc ieties.     Likewise, because many of the features , metrics,  and analytic structures of the models that enable data  mining are chosen by their designers, these technologies can potentially replicate the ir designers’  preconceptions and biases.     Finally, the data samples used to train and test algorithmic systems can often be insufficiently representative  of the populations from which they are drawing inferences. This creates real  possibilities of biased and  discriminatory outcomes, because the da ta being fed into the systems is flawed from the start.     Denial of Individual Autonomy, Recourse, and Rights     When citizens are subject  to decisions, predictions, or classifications produced by AI systems, situations may  arise where  such  individuals are unable to hold  directly accountable  the parties responsible for these  outcomes .    AI systems automate cognitive functions that were previousl y attributable exclusively to accountable human  agents. This can complicate the designation of responsibility in algorithmically generated outcomes, because  the complex and distributed character of the design, production, and implementation processes of AI  systems  may make it difficult to pinpoint accountable parties.     In cases of injury or negative consequence, such an accountability gap may harm the autonomy and violate  the rights of the affected individual s.     Non-transparent, Unexplainable, or Unjusti fiable Outcomes     Many machine learning models generate their results by operating on high dimensional correlations that are  beyond the interpretive capabilities of human scale reasoning. In these cases, the rationale of algorithmically  produced outcomes that di rectly affect decision subjects  remain s opaque to those subjects . While in some  use cases, this lack of explainability may be acceptable, in some  applications, where the processed data could 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  5 harbour traces of discrimination, bias, inequity,  or unfairness, the opaqueness of the model may be deeply  problematic .      Invasion s of Privacy     Threats to privacy are posed by AI systems both as a result of  their design and development processes , and as  a result of  their deployment. As AI projects are anchored in the structuring and processing of data, the  development of AI technologies will frequently involve the utilisation of personal data. This data is sometimes  captured and extracted without gaining the proper consent of the data subject or is handled in a way that  reveals (or places under risk the revelation of) personal information.     On the deployment end, AI systems that target, profile, or nudge data subjects without their knowledge or  consent c ould in some circumstances be interpreted as  infring ing upon their ability  to lead  a private life in  which they are able to intentionally manage the transformative effects of the technologies that influence and  shape their development. This sort of privacy  invasio n can consequently harm a person’s more basic right to  pursue their goals and life plans free from unchosen  influence.     Isolation and Disintegration of Social Connection     While the capacity of AI systems to curate individual experiences and to personalise digital services holds the  promise of vastly improving consumer life and service delivery, this benefit also comes with potential risk s.  Excessive automation , for example,  might  reduce the need for  human -to-human interaction, while  algorithmically enabled  hyper -personalisation , by limiting our exposure to worldviews different from ours,  might polarise social relationships. Well -ordered and cohesive societies are built on re lations of trust,  empathy, and mutual understanding. As AI technologies become more prevalent, it is important that these  relations be preserved .    Unreliable, Unsafe, or Poor -Quality Outcomes      Irres ponsible data management,  negligent design and production processes , and  questionable deployment  practices can, each in their own ways, lead to the implementation and distribution of AI systems that produce  unreliable, unsafe, or poor -quality outcomes. These outcomes can do direct  damage to the wellbeing of  individual persons and the public welfare. They can also undermine public trust in the responsible use of  societally beneficial AI technologies, and they can create harmful inefficiencies by virtue of the dedication of  limited p ublic resources to inefficient or even detrimental AI technologies.           An ethical  platform for the responsible delivery of an AI p roject     Building a project delivery environment, which enables  the ethical design and deployment  of AI  systems , requires a multidisciplinary team effort. It  demands  the active cooperation of all team  members both in maintaining a deeply ingrained culture of responsibility  and in executing a  governance architecture that adopt s ethically sound practices at every point  in the innovation and  implementation lifecycle .    This task of uniting  an in-built  culture of responsible innovation  with  a governance architecture that  bring s the values and principles of ethical, fair,  and safe AI to life,  will require that  you and your team   accomplish several  goals:  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  6   • You will have to ensure  that your AI project  is ethically permissible  by considerin g the  impact s it may have  on the wellbeing of affected  stakeholders  and communities.     • You will have to ensure that  your AI project  is fair and non -discriminatory  by accounti ng for  its potential to have discriminat ory e ffects on individuals and social groups, by mitigating  biases  that ma y influence your model’s outputs , and by  being aware of the issues  surrounding  fairness  that come into play at every phase  of the design and implementation   pipeline.     • You will have to ensure that  your AI project  is worthy of public trust  by guaranteeing to the  extent possible the safety , accurac y, reliability, security, and robustness of its product .    • You will have to ensure that your AI project is justifiable  by prioritis ing both the  transparency of the process by which your model is designed and implemented , and the  transparency and interpretab ility of its decisions and behaviours.     We call this governance architecture an ethical  platform  for two important reasons. First, it is  intended to provide you with a solid, processed -based footing of values, principles, and protocols — an ethical platform to stand on —so that  you and your team are better able to design and implement  AI systems ethically, equitably, and safely. Secondly, it is intended to help you facilitate a culture of  responsible AI innovation —to help you  provide  an ethical platfo rm to stand for —so that your project  team can be united in a collaborative spirit to develop AI technologies for the public good.         Preliminary considerations about the ethical platfor m     Our aim for the rem ainder of this document is to provide you with guidance that is as  comprehensive as possible in its presentation of the values, principles, and governance mechanisms  necessary to serve the purpose of responsible innovation. Keep in mind, however, that not all issues  discussed in this document will  apply equally to each project. Clearly, a machine learning algorithm  trained to detect spam emails will present fewer ethical challenges compared to one trained to  detect cancer in blood samples. Si milarly,  image recognition systems used for sorting and r outing  mail  raise  fewer ethical dilemmas compared to the facial recognition technologies used in law  enforcement.     Low-stakes AI application s that are not safety -critical, do not directly impact the lives of people, and  do not process potentially sensitiv e social and demographic data will need less  proactive  ethical  stewardship than  high -stakes projects. You and your project team will need to evaluate the scope  and possible impacts of your project on affected individuals and communities, and you will have to  apply reasonable assessments of the risks posed to individual wellbeing and public welfare in order  to formulate proportional governance procedures and protocols.     Be that as it may, you should also keep in mind that all AI projects have social and ethical impacts on  stakeholders and communities even if just by diverting or redistributing limited intellectual, material,  and economic resources away from other concerns and possibilities for socially beneficial innovation.  Ethical considerations and pri nciples -based policy formation should therefore play a salient role in  every prospective AI project.  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  7   Three building -blocks  of a responsible AI project delivery  ecosystem     Setting up an ethical platform for responsible AI project delivery involves  not only  building from the  cultural ground up ; it involves providing you r team  with the means to accomplish the goals of  establishing the ethical permissibility, fairness, trustworthiness, and justifiability of your project. It  will take three building -blocks to make such an ethical platform possible:     1. At the most basic  level, it necessitates that you gain a workin g knowledge of a framework of  ethical  values  that Support, Underwrite, and Motivate  a responsible data design and use  ecosystem. These  will be called  SUM Values , and they will be  composed of four key notions:  Respect, Connect, Care, and Protect . The objectives of these SUM Values  are (1) to provide  you with an accessible framework to start thinking about the moral scope of the  societal   and ethical impacts of your project and (2) to establish well-defined criteria to evaluate  its  ethical permissibi lity.     2. At a second and more concrete level, an ethical platform for responsible AI project delivery  requires a set of actionable  principles that facilitate an orientation to the responsible design  and use of AI systems. These  will be called  FAST Track Principles , and they will be  composed  of four key notions: Fairness, Accountability,  Sustainability , and Transparency . The objectives  of these FAST Track Principles are  to provide you with the moral and practical tools  (1) to  make sure that your project  is bias -mitigating, non -discriminatory, and fair , and (2)  to  safeguard public trust in your project’s capacity to deliver safe an d reliable AI innovation .    3. At a third and mo st concrete level, an ethical platform for responsible AI project delivery  requires  a process -based governance framework  (PBG Framework)  that operationalises the   SUM Values  and the FAST Track Principles  across the entir e AI project delivery workflow. The  objective  of this PBG Framework is  to set up transparent process es of design an d  implementation that safeguard and enable the justifiability of  both  your  AI project and its  product .    Here is a summary visualisation of the se three building blocks of the  platform:         
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  8 How to use this guide     This guide is intended to assist you in stewarding practices of responsible AI innovation. This entails  that the ethical platform be  put into practice at every step of the design and implementation  workflow. Turning the SUM Values, the FAST Track Principles, and the PBG Framework into practice  will require that you and your team continuously reflect, act, and justify :                  The SUM Value s    Background     The challenge of creating a culture of responsible innovation begins with the task of building an  accessible moral vocabulary  that will allow team members to explore and discuss the ethical stakes of  the AI projects that they are involved in or are considering taking on .    In the field of AI ethics, this moral vocabulary draws primarily on two traditions of moral thinking: (1)  bioethics  and (2) human rights discourse . Bioethics  is the study of the ethical impacts of biomedicin e  and the applied life sciences. Human rights discourse  draws inspiration from  the UN Declaration of  Human Rights . It is anchored in  a set of universal principles that build  upon  the idea that all humans  have an equal moral status as bearers of intrinsic human dignity.   
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  9   Whereas bioethics largely stresses the  normative values that underlie the  safeguarding of individual s in instances  where technological practices affect their  interests and wellbeing, human rights  discourse mainly focus es on the set of  social, political , and legal entitlements that  are due to all human beings under a  universal framework of juridical protection  and the rule of law.      The main principles of bioethics include   respecting the autonomy of the individual, protecting people from harm, looking after the well -being  of others, and treating all individuals equitably and justly . The main tenets of human rights include the  entitlement to equal freedom and dignity under the law, the protection of civil, political, and social  rights, the universal recognition of personhood, and the right to free and unencumbered participation  in the life of the community .      The SUM Values : Respect, Connect, Care, and Protect     While the  SUM Values  incorporate  conceptual elements from both bioethics and human rights  discourse, they do so with an eye to applying the most critical of these elements to the specific social  and ethical problems raised by the potential  misuse, abuse,  poor design , or harmful unintende d  consequences  of AI systems .     They are also meant to be utilised  as guiding values  throughout the innovation lifecycle: from the  preliminary steps of project evaluation, planning, and problem formulation, through processes of  design, development, and tes ting, to the stages of implementation and reassessment. The SUM  Values  can be visualised as follows :                     Key Concept: Normativity/Normative     In the context of practical ethics, the word ‘normativity’  means that a giv en concept, value, or belief puts a moral  demand on one’s practices , i.e. that such a concept, value, or  belief indicates what one ‘should’  or ‘ought to’  do in  circumstances where that concept, value, or belief applies.  For example, if I hold the moral bel ief that helping people in  need is a good thing, then, when confronted with a sick  person in the street who requires help, I should help them.  My belief puts a normative demand on me to act in  accordance with what it is indicating that I ought to do,  namel y to come to the needy person’s aid.  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  10 In order to f ocus in on a more detailed exploration of each of the values’ meanings , their contents  will be presented  individually . Formulating  it as a question : What are each of these values charging  you to do?     → RESPECT the dignity of individual persons:     • Ensure their abilities to make free and informed decisions about their own lives      • Safeguard their autonomy, their power to express themselves, and their right to be heard     • Secure their  capacities to make  well-considered  and independent contributions to  the life of  the community      • Support their abilities to  flourish, to  fully develop th emselves , and to pursue their passions  and talents according to their o wn freely determined life plans         → CONNECT with each other sincerely, openly, and inclusively :    • Safeguard the integrit y of interpersonal dialogue, meaningful human connection , and social  cohesion     • Prioritise diversity, participation, and inclusion at all points in the design, development, and  deployment processes  of AI innovation .     • Encourage all voices to be heard and all opinions to be weighed seriously and sincere ly  throughout the production and use  lifecycle     • Use the advancement and proliferation of AI technologies  to strengthen  the developmentally  essential relationship between interacting human being s.     • Utilise AI innovation s pro-socially  so as to  enable  bonds of interpersonal solidarity to form  and individuals to be socialised and recognised by each other      • Use AI technologies  to foster this capacity to connect so as to reinforce the edifice of trust,  empathy, reciprocal responsibility, and mutual understanding upon which all ethically well founded social orders rest     → CARE for the wellbeing of each and all :    • Design and deploy  AI systems  to foster and to cultivate the welfare of all stakeholders whose  interests are affected by their use     • Do no harm with these technologies and minimise the risks of their misuse or abuse    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  11 • Prioritise the safety and the mental and physical integri ty of people when scanning horizon s  of technological possibility and when conceiving of and deploying AI applications     → PROTECT the priorities of social values, justice, and the public interest :    • Treat all individuals equally and protect social equity     • Use digital technologies as a n essential support  for the protection of fair and equal treatment  under the law     • Prioritise social welfare, public interest, and the consideration of the social and ethical  impacts of innovation in determining the legitimacy and  desirability of AI technologies     • Use AI to empower and to advance the interests and well -being of as many individuals as  possible     • Think big -picture about the wider impacts of the AI technologies you are conceiving and  developing. Think about the ramifications of their effects and externalities for others around  the globe, for future generations, and for the biosphere as a whole          As a general rule, these SUM Values  should orient you in deliberating about the ethical permissibility   of a p rospective AI project.  They should also provide you with a framework of concepts to consider  the ethical impacts of an AI system across the design, use, and monitoring lifecycle .     Taking these SUM Values  as a starting point of conversation, you should also encourage discussion  within your team of how to weigh the values against one another and how to  consider trade -offs  should use case specific circumstances arise when the values com e into tension with each other.       The FAST Track Principles :     Background     While the SUM Values  are intended to provide you with some general normative guideposts and  moral motivations for thinking through the social and ethical aspects of AI project delivery, they are  not specifically catered to the actual processes involved in developing and deploying AI systems.     To make clear what is needed for this next step toward a mo re actionable orientation to the  responsible design and use of AI technologies, it would be helpful to briefly touch upon what has  necessitated the emergence of AI ethics in the first place.     Marvin Minsky, the great cognitive scientist and AI pioneer, def ined AI as follows:  ‘Artificial  Intelligence is the science of making computers  do things that require intelligence  when done by  humans .’ This standard definition should key us in to the principal motivation that has driven the  development of the field of the applied ethics of artificial intelligence:    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  12 When humans do ‘things that require intelligence, ’ we hold them responsible for the accuracy,  reliability, and soundness of their judgements . Moreover, w e demand of them that  their actions and  decisi ons be supported by good reasons, and we hold them  accountable for the fairness, equity, and  reasonableness  of how they treat  others.    What creates  the need for principles tailored to the design and use of AI systems is that their  emergence and expanding p ower ‘to do things that require intelligence ’ has heralded a shift of a  wide array of cognitive functions to algorithmic processes that themselves can be held neither  directly responsible nor immediately accountable for the consequences of their behaviour.      As inert and program -based machinery, AI systems are not morally accountable agents.  This has  created an ethical breach in the sphere of the applied science of AI that the growing number of  frameworks for AI ethics are  currently  trying to fill.  Targeted principles such as fairness,  accountability, sustainability , and transparency are meant to ‘ fill the gap ’ between the new ‘smart  agency’ of machines and their fundamental lack of moral responsibility.              The FAST Track Principles : Fairness, Accountability, Sustainability, and Transparency     By becoming well -acquainted with the FA ST Track Principles, all members  of your project delivery  team will be better able to support a responsible environment for data innovation.     Issues of fairness, accountability, sustainability,  and transparency operate at every juncture and at  every level of the AI project delivery work flow and demand the cooperative attention and  deliberative involvement of those with technical expertise, domain knowledge, project/product  management skill, and policy competence. Ethical AI innovation is a team effort from start to finish.     To introduce you to the scope of the FAST Track Principles, here is a summary visualisation  of them :      
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  13   You should keep in mind , initially, that while fairness, accountability, sustainability, and transparency  are grouped together in the FAST acronym, they do not nece ssarily relate to each other on the same  plane or as equivalents.  The principles of accountability and transparency are end-to-end governing  principles . Accountability entails that hu mans are  answerable for the parts they  play across the entire  AI design a nd implementation workflow. It also demands that the results of this work are traceable  from start to finish. The principle of transparency entails that design and implementation processes  are justifiable through and through. It demand s as well that an algorithmically influenced outcome is  interpretable and made understandable to affected parties.     The governing roles of accountability and transparency are very different f rom the more dependent  roles  of fairness  and sustainability. These  latter two are qualities  of algorithmic systems for which  their designers and implementers are held accountable  through the transparency both of the  outcomes of their practices and of the practices themselves . According to the principle of fairness,  desig ners and implementers are held accountable for being equitable and  for not harming anyone  through bias or discriminat ion.  According to the principle of sustainability , designers and  implementers are held accountable for  producing AI innovation that is saf e and ethical in its  outcomes and wider impacts .      Whereas the principles of transparency and accountability  thus  provide the procedural mechanisms  and means  through which AI systems  can be justified  and by which their producer and implementers   can be hel d responsible,  fairness and sustainability are  the crucial aspects of the design,  implementation, and outcomes of these systems  which  establish the normative criteria fo r such  governing constraints .  These four principles are therefore all deeply interrela ted, but they are not  equal.     There is one more important thing to keep in mind before we delve into the details of the FAST Track  principles. Transparency, accountability, and fairness are also data prote ction principles , and w here  algorithmic processing involves personal data, complying with them is not simply a matter of ethics  or good pr actice, but a legal requirement, which is enshrined in the General Data Protection  Regulation (GDPR) and the Data Protection Act of 2018 (DPA 2018 ). For more detailed information  about the specific meanings of transparency, accountability, and fairness as data protection  principles in the context of the GDPR and the DPA 2018, please refer to the   Guide to Data Protection   produced by the Information Commissioner’s Office.       Fairness     When thinking about fairness in the design  and deployment of AI systems, it is important to always  keep in mind that these technologies, no matter how neutral they may seem, are designed and  produced  by human beings, who are bound by the limitations of their contexts and biases.      Human error, prejudice,  and misjudgement can ente r into the innovation lifecycle and  create bias es  at any point  in the project delivery process  from the preliminary stages of data extrac tion, collection ,  and pre -processing  to the critical phases of problem formulation, model building, and  implementation.    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  14 Additionally , data -driven technologies  achieve  accuracy and efficacy by building inferences from  datasets that record  complex social and historical patterns, which  themselves may contain culturally   crystallis ed forms of bias and discrimination. There is no silver bullet when it comes to remediating  the dangers of discrimination and unfairness in AI systems.  The problem of fairness and bias  mitigation in algorithmic design and use therefore has no simple or strictly technical solution.     That said, best practices of fairness -aware design  and implementation  (both at the level of non technical self -assessment and at the level of technical control s and means of evaluation) hold great  promise in terms of securing just , morally acceptable , and beneficial  outcomes that  treat  affected  stakeholders fairly and equitably.     While there are different ways to characterise or define fairness in the design and use of AI systems,  you should consider the principle of discriminatory non -harm  as a minimum required threshold of  fairnes s. This principle directs us to do no harm to others through the biased or discriminatory  outcomes that may result from practices of AI innovation :                                                  Data f airness     Responsible data acquisition, handling, and management is a necessary component of algorithmic  fairness. If the results of your AI project are generated by biased, compromised,  or skewed  datasets,  affected stakeholders will not adequately be protected from  discriminatory harm. Your project team  should keep in mind the following key elements  of data fairness :   Principle of Discriminatory Non -Harm:  The designers and users of AI systems, which  process social or demographic data pertaining to features of human subjects, societal  patterns , or cultural formations , should prioritise the mitigation of bias and the  exclusion of discriminatory influences on the  outputs and implementations of their  models. Prioritising discriminatory non -harm implies that the designers and users of AI  systems ensure that the decisions and behaviours of their models do not generate  discriminatory or inequitable impacts on affected  individuals and communities. This  entails that these designers and users ensure that the AI systems they are developing  and deploying:     1. Are trained  and tested  on properly representative, relevant, accurate, and  generalisable data sets ( Data Fairness )  2. Have model architectures that do not include target variables, features,   processes, or analytical structures ( correlations, interactions,  and inferences)  which are unreasonable , morally objectionable,  or unjust ifiable ( Design  Fairness )  3. Do not have discriminator y or inequitable impacts on the lives of the people  they affect  (Outcome Fairness)   4. Are deployed by users sufficiently trained to implement them responsibly and  without bias  (Implementation Fairness ) 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  15 • Representativeness : Depending on the context , either underrepresentation or  overrepresentation of disadvantaged or legally protected groups in the data sample may  lead to the systematic di sadvantaging of vulnerable stakeholder s in the outcomes of the  trained model . To avoid  such kinds of  sampling  bias, domain expertise will be crucial to  assess the fit between the data collected or procured and the underlying population to be  modelled. Technical team members should, if possible, offer means of remediation to  correct for representational flaws in the sampling .    • Fit-for-Purpose and Sufficiency : An i mportant question to consider in the data collection and  procurement process is: Will the amount of data collected  be sufficient for the intended  purpose of the project? The quantity of data collected or procured has a significant impact  on the accuracy an d reasonableness of the outputs of a trained model. A data sample not  large enough to represent with sufficient richness the significant or qualifying attributes of  the members of a population to be classified may  lead to unfair outcomes. Insufficient  data sets may  not equitably reflect the qualities that should rationally be weighed in  producing a justified outcome that is consistent with the desired purpose of the AI system.  Members of the  project  team with technical and policy competences should collabora te to  determine if the data quantity is , in this respect,  sufficient and fit -for-purpose.        • Source  Integrity  and Measurement Accuracy : Effective bias mitigation  begins at the very  commencement of data extraction and collection processes. Both the sources and  instruments of measurement may introduce discriminatory factors into a dataset. When  incorporated as inputs in the training data, biased prior human decision s and judgments — such as prejudiced scoring, ranking, interview -data or evaluation —will become the ‘ground  truth’ of the model and replicate the bias in the outputs of the system. In order to secure  discriminatory non -harm, you must do your best to make sur e your data sample has optimal  source integrity. This involves securing or confirming that the data gathering processes  involved suitable, reliable, and impartial sources of measurement and sound methods of  collection.     • Timeliness  and Recency : If your data sets include  outdated data  then changes  in the  underlying data distribution may adversely affect the generalisability of your trained model.  Provided these distributional drifts  reflect changing social relationship or group dynamics,  this loss of accuracy with regard to the actual characteristics of the underlying population  may introduce bias into your AI system.  In preventing discriminatory outcomes, you should  scrutinise t he timeliness and  recency of all elements of the data tha t constitute  your  dataset s.       • Relevance , Appropriateness and Domain Knowledge :  The understanding and utilisation of  the most appropriate sources  and types  of data are  crucial for building a robust and  unbiased AI system. Solid domain knowledge of the underlying population distribution and  of the predictive or classificatory goal of the project  is instrumental for choosing optimally  relevant measurement inputs that cont ribute to the reasonable determination of the  defined solution . You should make sure that domain experts collaborate closely with your  technical team to assist in the determination of the optimally appropriate categories and  sources of measurement.    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  16 To ensure the uptake of best practices for responsible data acquisition, handling, and management  across your AI project delivery workflow, you should initiate the creatio n of a Dataset Factsheet  at  the alpha stage of your project. This factsheet  should be ma intained diligently throughout the design  and implementation lifecycle in order to secure optimal data quality, deliberate bias -mitigation  aware practices, and optimal auditability. It should include a comprehensive record of data  provenance, procurement, pre-processing, lineage, storage, and security as well as qualitative input  from team members about determinations made with regard to data representativeness, data  sufficiency, source integrity, data timeliness, data relevance, training/testing/validating  splits, and  unforeseen data issues encountered across the workflow .    Design  Fairness     Because human beings have a hand in all stages of the construction of AI systems, fairness -aware  design must take precautions across the AI project workflow to prevent  bias from having a  discriminatory influence:     • Problem Formulation: At the initial stage of problem formulation and outcome definition ,  technical and non -technical members of your team should work together to translate project  goals into measurable targets . This will involve the use of both  domain knowledge and  technical understanding to defin e what is being optimised in  a formalis able way  and to  translate the project’s objective into a target variable  or measurable  proxy , which operate s as  a statistically actionable rendering of  the defined outcome .     At each of these points , choices must be made about the design of the algorithmic system  that may introduce structural biases which ultimately lead to discriminatory harm. Special  care must be taken  here  to identify affected stakeholders and to consider  how  vulnerable  groups migh t be negatively impacted by the specification of outcome variables and proxies.  Attention must also be paid to the question of whether these specifica tions  are reasonable   and justifiable given the general purpose of the project and the potential impacts th at the  outcomes of the system ’s use  will have on the  individuals and communities involved.     These challenges of fairness aware design at the problem formulation stage show the need  for making  diversity and inclusive participation  a priority  from the start  of the AI project  lifecycle . This involves  both the collaboration of the entire team  and the attainment of  stakeholder input about the acceptability of the project plan. This also  entails  collaborative  deliberation across the project team and beyond about the ethical impacts of the design  choices  made .    • Data Pre -Processing: Human judgment enters into the process of algorithmic system  construction at the stage of labelling, annotating, and organising the training data  to be  utilised in building the model. Choices made about how to classify and structure raw inputs  must be taken  in a fairness aware manner with due consideration given to the sensitive social  contexts that may introduce bias into such acts of classificati on. Similar fairness aware  processes should be put in place  to review automated or outsourced classifications . Likewise,  efforts should be made to attach solid contextual information and ample metadata  to the  dataset s, so that downstream  analyse s of data p rocessing  have  access to properties of  concern in bias mitigation.  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  17   • Feature Determination  and Model -Building : The constructive task of selecting  the attributes  or features that will serve as input variables for your model involves human decisions  be  made about what sorts  of information may or may not be relevant or rationally required to  yield an accurate and unbiased classification or prediction.  Moreover,  the feature  engineering  tasks of  aggregating, extracting , or decomposing  attributes from  datase ts may  introduc e human  appraisals that have biasing effects. For this reason, discrimination  awareness should play a large role at this stage of the AI model -building workflow as should  domain knowledge and policy expertise. Your team should proceed  in the  modell ing stage   aware  that choices made about grouping  or separating and  including or excluding  features as  well as more general judgements about the comprehensiveness or coarseness of the total set  of features may have significant consequences for vulner able or protected groups.     The process of tuning  hyperparameters and setting  metrics  at the modelling, testing, and  evaluation stages also involves human choices that may have discriminatory effects in the  trained model.  Your technical team should proceed with an attentiveness to bias risk, and  continual iterations of peer review and project team consultation  should be encouraged  to  ensure that choices made in adjusting the dials and metrics of the model are in line with bias  mitigation and discriminatory non -harm .    • Evaluating Analytical Structures: Design fairness also demands close assessment of the  existence in the trained model of lurking or hidden proxies for discriminatory features that  may act as significant factors  in its output. Including  such hidden proxie s in the structure of  the model may lead to implicit ‘redlining’ (the unfair treatment of a sensitive group on the  basis of an unprotected attribute  or interaction of attributes  that ‘stands in’  for a  protected  or sensitive one).      Desig ners  must additionally scrutinis e the moral justifiability o f the significant correlations  and inferences  that are  determ ined by the model’s learning  mechanisms themselves . In cases  of the processing of social  or demographic  data related to human features , where the  complexity and high dimensionality of machine learning models preclude the confirmation of  the discriminatory non -harm of these inferences  (for reason of their uninterpretability by   human assessors) , these  models should be avoided .  In AI systems  that process  and draw  analytics from  data arising from human relationships, societal patterns , and complex  socioeconomic and cultural formations , designers must prioritise a degree of interpretability  that is sufficient  to ensure that the inferences produced by these systems are non discriminatory. In cases where this is not possible, a different, more transparent and  explainable model or portfolio  of models should be chosen.     Analytical  structures must a lso be confirmed to be procedurally fair . Any rule or procedure  employed in an AI system  should be consistently and uniformly applied to every d ecision  subject whose information is be ing processed by that system. Your team should  be able to  certify that when a rule or procedure has been used  to render an ou tcome for any given  individual , the same rule or procedure will be applied to any other individual  in the same way  regardless of th at other subject’s similarities with or differences from the first.    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  18 Implementers, in this respect, should  be able to show that any algorithmic  output  is  replicable when the same rules and procedures are applied to the same inputs. Such a  uniformity of th e application of rules and procedures secures the eq ual procedural treatment  of decision  subjects and precludes any rule -changes  in the algorithmic processing  targeted at  a specific person that may disadvantage that individual  vis-à-vis any other.     Outcome  fairness     As part of this minimum safeguarding of discriminatory non -harm, forethought and well -informed  consideration must be put into how you are going to define and measure the fairness of the impacts  and outcomes of the AI system you are developing .     There is a  great diversity of beliefs in the  area of outcome fairness as to how to properly classify  what  makes the consequences of an algorithmic ally supported  decision equitable, fair, and allocatively  just. Different approaches —detailed below —stress different pri nciples:  some  focus on  demographic  parity, some on individual fairness , others  on error rates  equitably distributed across subpopulations .     Your  determination  of outcome fairness should  heavily depend both on the specific use case for  which the fairness of outcome is being considered  and the technical feasibility of incorporating your  chosen criteria into the  construction of the AI  system . (Note that diffe rent fairness -aware methods  involve  different types  of technical intervention s at the pre -processing, modelling, or post processing stages  of production ). Again, this means that  determining  your  fairness definition should  be a cooperative and multidisciplinary effort across the project team .       You will find below a summary table of some of the main definitions of outcome fairness that have  been integrated by researchers into formal models  as well as a list of current articles and technical  resource s, which should be consulted to orient your team to the relevant knowledge base . (Note  that this is  a rapidly developing field, so  your technical team should keep  updated about further  advances.)  The first four  fairness types fall under the category of group fairness and allow for  comparative criteria of non -discrimination to be considered in model construction and evaluation.  The final two fairness types focus instead on cases of individual fairness, where cont ext-specific  issues of effective bias are considered and assessed at the level of the individual agent.      Take note, though, that these technical approaches have limited scope in terms of the bigger picture  issues of algorithmic fairness that we have alre ady stressed . Many of the  formal approaches work  only  in use cases that have distributive or allocative consequences . In order to carry out group  comparisons, these approaches require access  to data about sensitive/protected attributes  (that  may often be u navailable or unreliable)  as well as accurate demographic information about the  underlying population distribution.  Furthermore, there are unavoidable trade -offs and  inconsistences between the se technical definitions that must be weighed in determining  which of  them are best fit  for your use case.  Consult those on your project team with the technica l expertise  to consider the use case appropriateness of a desired formal approach.            
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  19 Some Formalis able  Definitions of Outcome Fairness   Type of Fairness  Definition   Demographic/   Statistical Parit y        Group Fairness  An outcome is fair if each group in the selected set receives benefit in equal or  similar proportions, i.e. if there is no correlation between a sensitive or  protected attribute and the allocative result. This approach is intended to  prevent  disparate impact , which occurs when the outcome of an algorithmic  process disproportionately harms members of disadvantaged  or protected  groups.   True Positive Rate  Parity             Group Fairness  An outcome is fair if the ‘true positive’ rates of an algorithmic prediction or  classification are equal across groups. This approach is intended to align the  goals of bias mitigation and accuracy by ensuring that the accuracy of the  model is equivalent be tween relevant  population subgroups . This method  is  also referred to as ‘equal opportunity ’ fairness because it aims to secure  equalised odds of an advantageous outcome for qualified individuals  in a given  population regardless of the protected or disadvantaged  groups of which they  are members.      False Positive Rate  Parity         Group Fairness  An outcome is fair if it does not disparately mistreat people belonging to a  given social group by misc lassifying them at a higher rate than the members of  a second social group, for this would place the members of the first group at an  unfair disadvantage. This approach  is motivated by  the position that sensitive  group s and advantaged groups should have si milar error rates in outcomes of  algorithmic  decisions .  Positive Predictive  Value Parity         Group Fairness  An outcome is fair if the rates of positive predictive value (the fraction of  correctly predicted positive cases out of all predicted positive cases) are equal  across sensitive and advantaged groups. Outcome fairness is defined here in  terms of a parity of precision, where the probability of members from different  groups actually having the quality they are predicted to have is the same  across  groups .   Individual Fairness       Individual  Fairness  An outcome is fair if it treats individuals with similar relevant qualification s  similarly.  This approach relies on  the establishment of  a similarity metric that  shows the degree to which pairs of individuals are alike with regard to a specific  task.      Counterfactual  Fairness                   Individual  Fairness  An outcome is fair if  an automa ted decision made about  an indiv idual  belonging to a sen sitive group would have been the same were that individual  a member of a different group in a closest possible alternative (or  counterfactual) world. Like the individual fairness approach, this method of  defining fairnes s focu ses on the specific circumstan ces of an affected decision  subject, but, by using the tools  of contrastive explanation , it moves beyond  individual fairness insofar as it brings out  the causal influences behind the  algorithmic output.  It also presents the possibility of offering the subject of an  automated decision knowledge of what factors, if changed, could have  influence d a different outcome. This could provide them with actionab le  recourse to change an unfavourable decision.

This FP S should then be made publicly available for review by all  affected stakeholders.       Implementation f airness     When your project team is approaching the beta stage, you should begin to build out your plan for   implementation  training and support. This plan should include adequate preparation for the  responsible and unbiased deployment of the AI system by its on -the-ground users. Automated 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  21 decision -support systems present novel risks of bias and misapplication at the point of delivery, so  special attention should  be paid to preventing harmful or discriminatory outcomes at this critical  juncture of the AI project lifecycle.     In order to design an optimal regime of implementer training and support, you should pay special  attentio n to the unique pitfalls of bias -in-use to which the deployment of AI technologies give rise.  These can be loosely classified as decision -automation bias (more commonly just ‘automation bias’)  and automation -distrust bias:     • Decision -Automation Bias /The Technological Halo Effect : Users of automated decision -support  systems may tend to become hampered in their critical judgment, rational agency, and  situational awareness as a result of their faith in the perceived objectivity, neutrality,  certainty, or  superi ority  of the AI system.       This may lead to over -reliance  or errors of omission , where implementers lose the capacity to  identify and respond to the faults , errors, or deficiencies , which might arise  over the course   of the use of an automated system, because they become complacent and overly deferent to  its directions and cues . Decision -automation bias may also lead to over -compliance  or errors  of commission  where implementers defer to the perceived infallibility of the system and  thereby become unable to detect problems emerging from its use for reason of a failure to  hold the results against available information.     Both over -reliance and over -compliance may lead to what is known as out -of-loop syndrome  where the deg radation of the role of human reason  and the deskilling of critical thinking   hampers the user’s ability to  complete the tasks that have been automated . This condition  may bring about  a loss of the ability to respond to system failure  and may lead both to s afety  hazards and to dangers of discriminatory harm.       To combat risks of decision -automation bias, you should operationalise str ong regimes of  accountability at  the site of user dep loyment  to steer human decision -agents to act on the  basis of good reaso ns, solid inferences, and critical judgment.     • Automation -Distrust Bias: At the other extreme, u sers of an automated decision -support  system may tend to disregard  its salient contributions to  evidence -based reasoning either as  a result of their distrust o r skepticism  about AI technologies in general or as a result of their  over -prioritisation of the importance of prudence, common sense, and human expertise . An  aversion to the non -human and amoral character of automated systems  may also influence  decision subjects’ hesit ation to consult these technologies in high impact contexts such as  healthcare, transportation, and law.          In order to secure and safeguard fair implementation of AI systems by users well -trained to utilise  the algorithmic outputs a s tools  for making evidence -based judgements, you should consider the  following measures:     • Training of implementers should include the conveyance of basic knowledge about the  statistical and probabilistic character of machine learning and about the limitations of AI and  auto mated decision -support technologies. This training should avoid any anthropomorphic 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  22 (or human -like) portrayals of AI systems and should encourage users to view the benefits and  risks of deploying these systems in terms of their role in assisting human judg ment rather  than replacing it.     • Forethought should be given in the design of the user -system interface about human factors  and about possibilities for implementation biases. The systems should be designed into   processes that encourage active user judgment  and situational awareness. The interface  between the user and the system should be designed to make clear and accessible to the  user the system’s rationale, compliance to fairness standards, and confidence level. Ideally  this should happen in a ‘runtime’ manner.     • Training of implementers should include a pre -emptive exploration of the cognitive and  judgmental biases that may occur across deployment context s. This should be done in a use  case based  manner that highlights the particular misjudgements that may occur when people  weigh statistical evidence. Examples of the latter may include overconfidence in prediction  based on the historical consistency of data, illusions that any clustering of data p oints  necessarily indicates significant insights, and discounting of societal patterns that exist   beyond the statistical results.         Putting  the p rinciple of discriminatory non -harm into a ction     When you are con sidering how to put the principle of discriminatory non -harm into action, you  should come together with all the managers on the project team to map out team member  involvement at each stage of the AI project pipeline from alpha through beta. Considering  fairness  aware design and implementation from a workflow perspective will allow you, as a team,  to  concretis e and make explicit end -to-end paths of accountability in a clear and peer -reviewable   manner.  This is essential for establishing a robust accountab ility framework. Here is a schematic  representation of the fairness aware workflow . You will have to complete the final row.       
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  23   Considering fairness aware design and implementation from such a workflow perspective will also  assist you in pinpoint ing risks  of bias or downstream discrimination and streamlining  possible solutions  in a proactive, pre -emptive, and anticipatory way .  At each stage of the AI project pipeline (i.e. at each  column of the above table), you and the relevant members of your team should carry out a  collaborative self -assessment with regard to  the applicable dimension of fairness . This is a three -step  process:                                     Accountability     When considering the role of accountability in the AI proje ct delivery lifecycle, it is important  first to  make sure that you are taking a ‘best practices’ approach to data processing that is aligned with  Principle 6 of the Data Ethics Framework . Beyond following this general guidance, however, you should  pay special attention to the new and unique challenges posed to public sector accountability by the  design and implementation of AI systems.     Responsible AI project delivery requires that two related challenges to public sector accountability  be confronted directly:      1. Accountability gap: As mentioned above, a utomated decision s are not self -justifiable.  Whereas human agents can be call ed to account for their judgements and decisions in  instances where those judgments and decisions affect the interests of others, the statistical  models and underlying hardware that compose AI systems are not responsible in the same  morally relevant sense.  This creates an accountability gap that must be addressed so that   clear and imputable  sources of human answerability can be attach ed to decision s assisted or  produced by  an AI system.     2. Complexity of AI production process es:  Establishing h uman  answerabili ty is not a simple  matter when it comes to the design and deployment of AI  systems . This is due to  the  complexity and multi -agent character of the development and use of these systems.  Typically, AI project delivery workflows include department and delivery leads, technical Discriminatory Non -Harm  Self-Assessment     Step 1:  Identify the fairness and bias mitigation dimensions  that apply to the specific  stage under consideration (for example, at the data pre -processing  stage , dimensions of  data fairness , design fa irness, and outcome fairness may be  at issue).     Step 2: Scrutinise how your particular AI project might pose risks or have unintended  vulnerabilities in each of these areas.     Step 3: Take action to correct any existing problems that have been identified,  strengthen areas of weakness that have possible discriminatory consequences, and take  proactive bias -prevention measures in areas that have been identified to pose potential  future risks.       
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  24 experts, data procurement and preparation personnel, policy and domain experts,   implementers, and others. Due to  this production complexity, it may become difficult to  answer the question of who among these parties involved in the production of AI systems  should bear responsibility if th ese systems’ uses have  negative consequences an d impacts.          Meeting the special requirements of accountability, which are born out of the se two challenges , call  for a sufficiently  fine-grained concept of what w ould make an AI project  properly accountable. This  concept can be broken down into two subcomponents  of accountability : answerability  and  auditability :      • Answerability : The principle of accountability demands that the onus of justifying  algorithmically  support ed decisions be placed on the shoulders of the human creators and  users of those AI systems. This means that it is essential to establish a continuous chain of  human responsibility across the whole AI project delivery workflow. Making sure that  accountability is effective  from end to end necessitates that no gaps be permitted in the  answerability of responsible hu man authorities from first steps of the design of an AI system  to its  algorithmically steered outcomes.      Answerability also demands that explanations and justifications of both the content of  algorithmically  supported  decisions and the processes behind their production be offered by  competent human authorities in plain, understandable, and coherent language. These  explanations and justifications should  be based upon sincere, consistent, sound,  and  impartial reasons that a re accessible to non -technical hearers.      • Auditability : Whereas the notion of answerability responds to the question of who is  accountable for an automation supported  outcome,  the notion of  auditability answer s the  question of how  the designers and  implementers of AI systems are to be held  accountable .  This aspect of  accountability  has to do with  demonstrating  both the responsib ility of  design  and use practices  and the justifiability of outcomes .     Your project team must ensure that every step of the process of de signing and implementing  your AI project is accessible for audit, oversight, and review. Successful audit requires  builders and implementers of algorithmic systems to keep records and to make accessible  informatio n that enables monitoring of the soundness and diligence of the innovation  processes that produced the AI system.     Auditability also requires that your project team keep records and make accessible  information that enables monitoring of data provenance and  analysis from  the stages of  collection, pre -processing, and modelling  to training , testing , and deploying . This is the  purpose of the  previously mentioned  Dataset  Factsheet.     Moreover, it  requires your team  to enable peers and overseers to probe and to cr itically  review the dynamic operation of the system in order to ensure that the procedures and  operations  which are producing the model’s behaviou r are safe, ethical , and fair. P ractically  transparent algori thmic models must be built for auditability , reproducible , and equipped for  end-to-end recording  and monitoring  of their data processing.      
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  25 The deliberate incorporation of both of these elements of accountability  (answerability and  auditability) into the AI project lifecycle  may be cal led Accountability -by-Design :                  Acco untability deserves consideration across the entire design and implementation workflow     As a best practice, you should actively consider  the different demands that accountability  by de sign  places on you  before and after the roll out  of your AI project. We will refer to the process of ensuring  accountability during the design and development stages of your AI project as ‘ anticipatory  accountability .’ This is because you are anticipating your AI project’s accountability needs prior to it  being completed. Following a similar logic, we will refer to the process of addressing account ability  after the start of the deployment of your AI project as ‘ remedial accountability .’ This is because after  the initial implementation of your system,  you are remedying any of the issues that may be raised by  its effects and potential externalities.  These two subtypes of accountability are sometimes referred  to as ex-ante (or before -the-event) accountability and ex-post (after -the-event) accountability  respectively.     • Anticipatory Accountability: Treating accountability as an anticipatory principle entails that  you take  as of primary importance  the decisions made and actions taken by  your project  delivery team prior to the outcome of an algorithmically  supported decision  process .     This kind of ex ante accountability should be prioritised over remedial  accountability, which  focu ses instead on the corrective or justificatory  measures that can be taken after that  automa tion supported process had been completed.     By ensuring the AI project delivery processes are accountable prior to the actual application  of the system in the world, you will bolster the soundness of design and implementation  processes and thereby more effectively pre-empt possible harms  to individu al wellbeing and  public welfare.     Likewise, by establishing strong regimes of anticipatory  accountability and by making the  design and delivery process as open and publicly accessible as possible, you will put affected   stakeholders  in a position to make be tter informed and more knowledgeable decisions  about  their involvement with these  systems  in advance of potentially  harmful impacts . In doing so,  you will also strengthen the public narrative and help to safeguard the project from  reputational harm.     • Remed ial Accountability:  While  remedial accountability  should  be seen , along these lines, as a  necessary fallback  rather than as a first resort for imputing responsibility in the design and   deployment of AI systems, strong regimes of remedial accountability are no less important  in Accountability by Design: All AI systems must be designed to facilitate end -to-end  answerability and auditability. This requires both responsible humans -in-the-loop  across the entire design and implementation chain as well as activity monitoring  protocols  that enable end -to-end ove rsight and review.    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  26 providing necessary justifications for the bearing these systems have on the lives of affected  stakeholders.     Putting in place comprehensive auditability regimes as part of your accountability framework  and establishing transparent design and use practices, which are methodically logged  throughout the AI project delivery lifecycle, are essential components for this sort of remedial   accountability.     One aspect of  remedial accountability that you must  pay close attention to is the need to  provide explanations  to affected stakeholders for a lgorithmically  supported decisions . This  aspect of accountable and transparent design and us e practices will be  called  explicabi lity,  which literally means the ability to make explicit the meaning of the algorithmic model’s  result .     Offering explanations for the results of a lgorithmically  supported decision -making involves  furnishing decision subjects  and other interested parties  with an understandable account of  the rationale behind the specific outcome of interest. It also involves furnishing the decision  subject  and other interested parties  with an explanation of the ethical permissibility , the  fairness, and the safety  of the  use of the  AI system. These tasks of content clarification  and  practical justification  will be explored in more detail below as part of the section on  transparency.        Sustainability     Design ers and users of AI systems should  remain aware that these te chnologies may have  transformative and long -term  effects on individu als and society. In order to ensure that the  deployment of  your  AI system  remains  sustainable and support s the sustainabil ity of the  communities it will  affect , you and your team  should proceed with a continuous sensitivity to the  real-world impacts  that your system will  have .    Stakeholder Impact Assessment     You and your project team should come together to evaluate the social impact and sustainability of  your AI  project  through a Stakeholder Impact Assessment (SIA) , whether the AI project is being used  to deliver a public service or in a back -office administrative capacity.  When we refer to ‘stakeholders’    we are referring primarily to affected individual  person s, but the term may also extend to groups and  organisations in the sense that individual members of these collective s may also be impacted as such  by the design and deployment of AI systems.  Due consideration to stakeholders should be given at  both of these  levels.        The purpose of carrying out an SIA is multidimensional. SIAs can  serve several purposes, some of  which include :    (1) Help to build public confidence that the design and deployment of the AI system by  the public sector agency has been done responsibly   (2) Facilitate and strengthen your accountability framework   (3) Bring to light unseen risks that threaten to affect  individuals and the public good  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  27 (4) Underwrite well -informed decision -making and transparent innovation practices   (5) Demonstrate forethought and due diligence not only within your organisation  but  also to the wider public      Your team should convene to evaluate  the social impact and sustainability  of your AI project   through the SIA at three critical points in the project delivery lifecycle:     1. Alpha Phase (Problem Formulation) : Carry out an initial Stakeholder Impact A ssessment  (SIA) to determine the ethical pe rmissibility of the project. Refer to the SUM Values as a  starting point for the considerations of the possible effects of you r project on individual  wellbeing and public welfare.  In cases where you conclude that your AI project will have  significant ethic al and social impacts, y ou should open  your initial SI A to the public so that  their views can be properly considered . This will bolster the inclusion of a diversity of voices  and opinions into the design and development process through  the participation of a more  representative range of stakeholders.  You should also consider consulting with internal  organisational stakeholders, whose input will likewise strengthen the openness, inclusivity,  and diversity of your project.     2. From Alpha to Beta  (Pre-Implementation) : Once your model has been trained, tested, and  validated, you and your team should revisit your initial SIA to confirm that the AI system to  be implemented is still in line with the evaluations and conclusions of your original  assessm ent. This check -in should be logged on the  pre-implementation section of the  SIA  with any applicable changes added and discussed.  Before the launch of the system, this SIA  should be made publicly available.  At this point you must also set a timeframe for r eassessment once the system is in operation  as well as a public consultation which predates  and provides input for that re -assessment . Timeframes for these re -assessments should be  decided by your team on a case -by-case basis but should be proportional to  the scale of the  potential impact of the system on the individuals and  communities it will affect.     3. Beta Phase  (Re-Assessment) : After your AI system has gone live, your team should  intermittently revisit and re -evaluate your SIA. These check -ins should be  logged on  the reassessment section of the SIA with any applicable changes added and discussed. Reassessment should focus both on evaluating the existing SIA against real worl d impacts and  on considering how to mitigate  the unintended consequences that may have ensued in the  wake of the deployment of the system.  Further public consultation for input  at the beta  stage  should be undertaken before the  re-assessm ent so that stakeholder input can be  included in re -assessment deliberations .     You should keep in mind that , in its specific focus on social an d ethical sustainability, your  Stakeholder Impact A ssessment constitutes just one part of the  governance platform for your AI  project and should be a comple ment to your accoun tability framework and other auditing and  activity -monitoring documentation .     Your SIA should be broken down into four  sections of questions and responses. In the 1st section,  there should be general questions about the possible big -picture social and ethical impacts  of the  use of the AI system you plan to build . In the 2nd section, your team should collaboratively formulate  relevant sector -specific and use case -specific questions about the impact of the AI system on 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  28 affected stakeholders . The 3rd section  should provide  answers to the  additional questions relevant to  pre-implementation evaluation. The 4th section should provide  the opportunity for members of  your  team to reassess the system in light of its real -world impacts , public input,  and possi ble unintended  consequences.      Here is a prototype of an SIA:       Stakeholder Impact Assessment for (Project Name)       1. Alpha Phase    (Problem Formulation)   General Questions     Completed on this  Date:    I. Identifying Affected Stakeholders     Who are the stakeholders that this AI project is most likely to affect? What groups  of these stakeholders are most vulnerable? How might the project negatively  impact them?     II. Goal -Setting  and Objective -Mapping      How are you  defin ing the  outcome  (the target variable)  that the system is  optimising for?  Is this  a fair, reasonable, and widely acceptable definition?     Does the target variable (or its measurable proxy) reflect a reasonable and  justifiable translation of the project’s objective into th e statistical frame?         Is this translation  justifiable given the general purpose of the project and the  potential impacts that the out comes of its  implementation  will have on the  communities involved?     III. Possible Impacts on the Individual     How might the  implementation of your AI system impact the abilities  of affected  stakeholders  to make free , independent,  and well-informed decisions about their   lives ? How might it enhance or diminish their autonomy?       How might it affect their capacities  to flourish and to fully develop themselves ?     How might it do h arm to their physical or mental integrity ? Have risks to individual  health and safety been adequately considered and addressed?     How might it infringe on the ir privacy  rights , both on the data processing end of  designing the system and on the implementation end of deploying it ?     IV. Possible Impacts on Society and Interpersonal Relationships     How might the implementation of your AI system adversely affect each  stakeholder’s fair and equal trea tment under the law? Are there any aspects of the  project that expose vulnerable communities to possible discriminatory harm?     How might the use of your system affect the integrity of interpersonal dialogue,  meaningful human connection, and social cohesion ?  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  29   Have the values of civic participation, inclusion, and diversity been adequately  considered in articulating the purpose and setting the goals of the project?  If not,  how might these values be incorporated into your project design?     Does the project aim to advance the interests and well -being of as many affected  individuals as possible? Might any disparate socioeconomic impacts result from its  deployment ?    Have you sufficiently considered the wider impacts of the system on  future  gene rations  and on the planet  as a whole ?      2. Alpha Phase   (Problem Formulation)   Sector -Specific and Use  Case -Specific Questions     Completed on this  Date:      In this section you shou ld consider the sector -specific and use case -specific issues  surrounding the social and ethical impacts of your AI project on affected  stakeholders. Compile a list of the questions and concerns you anticipate. State  how your team is attempting to address these questions and concerns.         3. From Alpha to Beta  (Pre-Implementation)     Completed on this  Date:    After reviewing the results of your initial SIA, answer the following questions:      Are the trained model’s actual objective, design, and testing results  still in line with  the evaluations and conclusions  contained in  your original assessment ? If not, how  does your assessment now differ?     Have any other areas of concern arisen with regard to possibly harmful social or  ethical impacts as you have moved from the alpha to the beta p hase?       You must also set a reasonable timeframe for  public consultation and  beta phase  re-assessment:     Date s of Public Consultation on Beta -Phase Impacts:     Date of Planned Beta Phase Re -Assessment:       4. Beta Phase    (Re-Assessment)     Completed on this  Date:          Once you have reviewed the most recent version of your SIA and the results of the  public consultation, answer the following questions:     How does the content of the existing SIA compare with the real -world impacts of  the AI system as measured by a vailable evidence of performance, monitoring data,  and input from implementers and the public?     What steps can be taken to rectify any problems or issues that have emerged?     Have any unintended harmful consequences ensued in the wake o f the  deployment of the system?  If so, how might these negative impacts be  mitigate d  and redressed?  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  30   Have the maintenance processes for your AI model adequately taken into account  the possibility of distributional shifts in the underlying population? Has the model  been proper ly retuned and retrained to accommodate changes in the  environment?       Date s of Public Consultation on Beta -Phase Impacts:     Date of Next Planned Beta Phase Re -Assessment:         Safety     Beyond safeguarding the  sustainability of your AI project as it relates to its social impacts on  individual wellbeing and public welfare, your project team must also confront the related challenge  of technical sustainability  or safety . A technically sustainable AI system is safe, accurate, reliable,  secure, and robust . Securing these goals, however, is a difficult and unremitting task.     Because AI systems operate in a world filled with uncertainty, volatility, and flux , the challenge  of  building safe and reliable AI can be especially daunting. T his job , however, must be met  head -on.  Only by making the goal of producing safe and reliable AI technologies central to your project, will  you be able to  mitigate risks of your system failing  at scale  when faced with real -worl d unknowns  and unforeseen events . The issue of AI safety  is of paramount importance, because these potential  failures may both produce harmful outcomes  and undermine publ ic trust.     In order to safeguard that your AI system f unctions safely , you  must prioritise the technical  objectives of accuracy, reliability, security,  and robustness . This require s that your technical  team put  careful forethought  into how to construct a system that accurately and dependab ly operates  in  accordance with its  designer s’ expectations  even when confronted with unexpected changes,  anomalies, and perturbations . Building an AI system that meets these safety goals  also require s  rigorou s testing, validation , and re -assessment  as well as the int egration of adequate mechanisms of  oversight and control  into its  real-world operation.     Accuracy, reliability, security, and r obustness     It is important that you gain a strong working knowledge of each of the safety relevant operational  objectives ( accuracy, reliability, security, and robustness ):    • Accuracy  and Performance Metrics : In machine learning, the acc uracy of a model is the  proportio n of examples for which it generates a correct output. This performance measure is  also sometimes characterised conversely as an error rate  or the frac tion of cases for which  the model produces an incorrect output.  Keep in mind that, in some instances, the choice of  an acceptable error rate or accuracy level can be adju sted in accordance with the use case  specific needs of the application . In other instances, it may be largely set by a domain  established benchmark.    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  31 As a performance metric, accuracy should be a central component to establishing and  nuancing yo ur team’s approach to safe AI. That said, s pecifying a reasonable performance  level for your system may  also often require you to refine  or exchange  your measure of  accuracy. For instance, if certain errors are more significant or costly than others, a metric for  total c ost can  be integrated into y our model  so that the cost of one class of errors can be  weighed against that of another . Likewise, if the precision  and sensitivity  of the system  in  detecting uncommon events is a priority (say, in instance s of the medical diagnosis of rare  cases of a dis ease) , you can  use the technique of precision and recall. This  method of  addressing imbalanced classification  would allow you to weigh the proportion of the system’s  correct detections —both of frequent and of rare outcomes —against the proportion of actual  detections of the rare event  (i.e. the ratio of the true detections of the rare outcome to the  sum of the true detections of that outcome and the missed detections or false negatives for  that outcome) .    In general, measuring accuracy in the face of uncerta inty is a challenge that must be given  significant thought. The confidence level of your AI system will depend heavily on problems  inherent in attempts to model a chaotic and changing reality. Concerns about accuracy must  cope with issues of unavoida ble no ise present in the data sample , architectural uncertainties  generated by the possibility that a given model is missing relevant features of the underlying  distribution, and inevitable  changes in  input data over time.     • Reliability:  The obje ctive of reliabil ity is  that an AI system behaves exactly as its designers  intended and anticipated.  A reliable system adheres to the specifications it was programmed  to carry out.  Reliability is therefore a measure of consistency  and can establish confidence in  the safety of a s ystem based upon the dependability with  which  it operationally conf orms to  its intended functionality .    • Security : The goal of security encompasses the protection of several operational dimensions  of an AI s ystem when confronted with  possible adversarial attack. A secure system  is capable   of maintaining  the integrity  of the informa tion that constitutes it . This includes protecting its  architecture  from the unauthorised modification or damage of any of its com ponent parts. A  secure system also remains continuously functional  and accessible  to its authorised users  and  keeps  confidential  and private information  secure  even under hostile or adversarial  conditions .        • Robustness:   The objective  of robustness can be  thought of as the goal that an AI system  function s reliably and accurately under harsh conditions . These conditions may include  adversarial intervention , implementer  error , or skewed goal -execution by an automated  learner  (in reinforcemen t learning applications) . The measure of robustness is therefore the  strength of a system’s integrity a nd the soundness of its  operation in response to  difficult  conditions,  adversarial attacks, perturbations , data poisoning, and undesirable reinforcement  learning behaviour.        Risks p osed  to accuracy and r eliability:    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  32 Concept Drift : Once trained, most machine learning systems operate on static models of the  world  that have been built from historical data  which  have become fixed i n the systems ’  parameters. This  freezing of the model before it is released ‘into the wild’ makes  its accuracy  and reliability  especially vulnerable to changes  in the underlying  distribution of  data . When  the historical data  that have  crystallised into the trained model’s architecture  cease  to reflect  the population concerned , the model ’s mapping function  will no longer be able to accurately   and reliably  transform its inputs into its target output value s. These systems can quickly   beco me prone to error in unexpected and harmful ways.     There has been much valuable research done on methods of detecting  and mitigat ing  concept  and distribution  drift, and you should consult with your technical team to ensure  that its members have familiarised themselves with this research and have sufficient  knowledge of the available ways to confront the issue. In all cases, you should remain vigilant  to the po tentially rapid concept drifts that may occur in the complex, dynamic , and evolving   environments in which your AI project will intervene. Remaining aware of these  transformations in the data  is crucial for safe AI, and your team should actively formulate a n  action plan to anticipate and to mitigate their impacts on the performance of your system.     Brittleness: Another possible challenge to the accuracy and reliability of machine learning  systems  arises from the inherent imitations of the systems themselves.  Many of the high performing machine learning models such as deep neural nets (DNN) rely on massive  amounts of data and brute force repetition of training examples to tune the thousands,  millions, or even billions of parameters, which collectively generate  their outputs.     However, when they are actually running in an unpredictable world, these systems  may  have  difficulty processing unfamiliar events and scenarios . They may  make unexpected  and serious  mistakes, b ecause they have neither the capacity to cont extual ise the problems they are  programmed  to solve nor the  common -sense  ability to determine the relevance of new  ‘unknowns’.  Moreover, these mistakes may remain unexplainable given the high dimensionality and computational complexity of their mathematica l structure s.  This fragility  or brittleness can have especially significant consequences in safety -critical applications like  fully automated transportation and medical decision support  systems where undetectable  changes in inputs may lead to  significant  failures . While progress is being made in finding  ways to make these models more robust, i t is crucial to consider safety first when weighing  up their viability.        Risks posed to security and robustness     Adversarial Attack:  Adversarial attacks on machine learning models maliciously modify input  data —often in imperceptible ways —to induce them into misclassification or incorrect  prediction. For instance, b y undetectably altering a few  pixels on a picture, an adversarial  attacker can mislead a model into generating an incorrect  output (like identifying a panda as  a gibbon or a ‘stop’ sign as a ‘speed limit’ sign) with an extremely high confidence. While a  good amount of attention has been paid to the risks that adversarial attacks pose in deep  learning applications like computer vision, these kinds of perturbations are also effective  across a vast range of machine learning techniques and uses such as spam filtering and  malware detection.   
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  33   These vulnerabilities of AI systems to adv ersarial examples have serious consequences for AI  safety. The existence of cases where subtle but targeted perturbations cause models to be  misled into gross miscalculation and incorrect  decision s have potentially serious safety  implication for the adopti on of critical systems like applications in autonomous  transportation, medical imaging, and security and surveillance. In response to concerns about  the threats posed to a safe and trusted environment for AI technologies by adversarial  attacks a field call ed adversarial machine learning  has emerged over the past several years.  Work in this area focuses on securing systems from disruptive perturbation s at all points of  vulnerability across the AI pipeline.     One of the major safety strategies that has arisen from this research is an appro ach called  model hardening , which  has advanced techniques that  combat adversarial attacks by  strengthening the architectural components of the systems. Model hardening techniques  may include adversarial training, where training data is  methodically enlarge d to include  adversarial examples. Other model hardening methods involve architectural modification,  regularisation, and data pre -processing manipulation. A second notable safety strategy is runtime detection , where the system is augmented with a discover y apparatus that can identify  and trace in real -time the existence of adversarial examples.  You should consult with  members of your technical team to ensure that the risks of adversarial attack have been  taken into account and mitigated throughout the AI lifecycle.  A valuable collection of  resources to combat adversarial attack can be found at https://github.com/IBM/adversarial robustness -toolbox  .     Data Poisoning :  A different but rela ted type of adversarial attack is called data poisoning. This  threat to safe  and reliable  AI involves a malicious compromise of data sources at the point of  collection and pre -processing. Data poisoning occurs when an adversary modifies or  manipulates part  of the dataset upon which a model will be trained, validated, and tested. By  altering a selected subset of training inputs, a poisoning attack can induce a trained AI system  into curated misclassification, system ic malfunction, and poor performance. An es pecially  concerning dimension of targeted data poisoning is that an adversary may introduce a  ‘backdoor’ into the infected model whereby the trained system functions normally until it  processes maliciously selected inputs that trigger error or failure .    In order to combat data poisoning, your technical team should become familiar with the  state of the art in filtering and detecting poisoned data. However, such technical solutions  are not enough. Data poisoning is possible because data collection and procure ment often  involves potentially unreliable or questionable sources. When data originates in  uncontrollable environments like the internet, social media, or the Internet of Things , many  opportunities present themselves to ill -intentioned attackers, who aim to manipulate training  examples. Likewise, in third - party data curation processes (such as ‘crowdsourced’ labelling,  annotation, and content identification), attackers may simply handcraft malicious inputs.    Your project team should focus on  the best pra ctices of responsible data management, so  that they are able to tend to data quality as an end -to-end priority.     • Misdirected  Reinforcement Learning Behaviour: A different set of safety risks emerges from  the approach to machine learning called reinforcement learning  (RL). I n the more widely 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  34 applied methods of supervised learning  that have largely been the focus of this guide , a  model transforms inputs into outputs according to a fixed mapping function that ha s resulted  from  its passively received training.  In RL, by contrast,  the learner system  actively  solves  problems by engaging  with its environment through trial and error. This exploration and  ‘problem -solving’ behaviour is determined by the objective of ma ximising  a reward function   that is defined by its designers .    This flexibility in the model, however, comes at the price of potential safety risks. An RL  system , which is operating in the real -world without sufficient controls, may determine a  reward -optim ising course of action that is optimal for achieving its desired objective  but  harmful to people . Because these model s lack context -awareness, common sense, empathy,  and understanding, they are unable to identify , on their own , scenarios that may have  dama ging consequences but that were not anticipated and constrained by their  programmers. This is a difficult problem, because the unbounded complexity of the world  makes anticipating all of its pitfalls and detrimental variables veritably impossible.     Existi ng strategies to mitigate such risks of misdirected reinforcement learning behaviour  include:   o Running extensive simulations during the testing stage, so that appropriate measures  of constraint can be programmed into the sy stem   o Continuous inspection and mon itoring of the system, so that its behaviour can be  better predicted and understood   o Finding ways to make the system more interpretable so that its decisions can be  better assessed   o Hard-wiring  mechanisms into the system that enable human override and system  shut -down         End-to-End AI Safety     The safety risks you face in your AI project will depend , among other factors,  on the sort of  algorithm(s) and machine learning techniques you are  using , the type of applications in which those  techniques are going to be deployed, the provenance of your data, the way you are specifying your  objective, and the problem domain in which that specification applies.  As a best practice,  regardless  of this variab ility of techniques and circumstances,  safety considerations of accuracy, reliability,  secur ity, and robustness should be in operation at  every s tage of your AI project lifecycle .    This should involve  both rigorous protocols of testing, validating,  verifying , and monitoring  the safety  of the system  and the performance of AI safety self -assessments  by relevant members of your team  at each stage of the workflow. Such self -assessments should evaluate how your team’s design and  implementation  practices line up with the safety objectives of accuracy , reliability,  security , and  robustness . Your AI safety self -assessments should be logged across the workflow on a single  document in a running fashion that allows review and re -assessment.                 Transparency  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  35   Defining  transparent AI     It is important to remember that transparency as a principle of AI ethics  differs a bit in meaning from  the everyday use of the term. The common dictionary understanding of transparency defines it as  either  (1) the quality an object has when one can see clearly through it or (2) the quality of a  situation or process that can be  clearly justified and explained because it is open to inspection and  free from secrets.      Transparency as a principle of AI ethics encompasses both  of these meanings:     On the one hand, transparent AI involves the interpretability of a given AI system, i .e. the ability to  know how and why a model performed the way it did in a specific context and therefore to understand  the rationale behind its decision or behaviour . This sort of transparency  is often referred to  by way of   the metaphor of ‘opening the black box ’ of AI. It involves content clarification  and intelligibility  or  explicability .     On the other hand, transparent AI involves the justifiability both  of the processe s that go  into its  design  and implementation  and of its outcome . It therefore  involves the soundness of the justification  of its use . In this more normative meaning, transparent AI is practically justifiable  in an unrestric ted  way if one can  demonstrate that both the design and implementation processes  that have gone into  the particular decision or behaviour  of a system and the  decision or behaviour  itself are ethically  permissible, non -discriminatory /fair, and worthy of public trust /safe ty-securing .      Three critical tasks  for designing and i mplementing  transparent AI     This two-pronged definition of transparency as a principle of AI ethics asks that  you to think about  transparent AI both in terms of the process  behind it (the design and implementation practices that  lead to an algorithmically support ed outcome) and in terms of its product (the content and  justification of that outcome).  Such a proce ss/product distinction is crucial, because it clarifies the  three tasks that your team will be responsible for in safeguard ing the transparency of your AI  project:     • Process  Transparency, Task 1: Justify Process.  In offering an explanation to affected  stake holders, y ou should be able to demonstrate that considerations of ethical  permissibility,  non-discrimination /fairness , and safety/ public trustworthiness were operative end -to-end in  the design and implementation processes that lead to  an automated decision  or behaviour .  This task will be supported both by following  the best practices outlined herein throughout  the AI project lifecycle and by  putting into place  robust aud itability measures through an  accountability -by-design framework.     • Outcome Transparency , Task 2: Clarify  Content and Explain Outcome.  In offering an  explanation to affected stakeholders, y ou should be able to show in plain language that is  understandable to non -specialist s how and why a model performed the way it did in a  specific decision -making  or behaviour al context . You should  therefore be able to clarify  and  communicate  the rationale behind its decision or behaviour.  This explanation should be  socially meaningful in th e sense that the terms and logic  of the explanation should not simply 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  36 reproduce the  formal characteristics or the  technical meanings and  rationale of the  mathematical model but should rather be translated into the  everyday  language of human  practices and therefore  be understandable in terms of  the societal factors and relationships  that the decision or behaviour implicates.     • Outcome  Transparency, Task 3: Justify Outcome.  In offering an explanation to affected  stakeholders, y ou should be able to demonstrate  that a specific  decis ion or behaviour of your   system is ethically permissible, non -discriminatory /fair, and worthy of public trust /safe tysecuring . This outcome justification should take the content clarification /explicated outcome  from task 2  as its starting point and weigh that explanation against the justifiability criteria  adhered to throughout the design and use pipeline: ethical  permissibility,  nondiscrimination /fairness , and safety/ public trustworthiness . Undertaking an optimal approach  to process transparency from the start should support and safeguard this demand for  normative explanation and outcome justification.         Mapping AI t ranspare ncy    Before exploring each of the three tasks individually, it may be helpful to visualise the relatio nship  between these connected components of transparent AI:         Process Transparency: Establishing a Process -Based Governance Framework     The central importance of the end -to-end operability of good governance practices should guide  your strategy to build out responsible AI project workflow processes. Three components are  essential to creati ng a such a responsible workflow: (1) M aintaining strong regimes of professional  and institutional transparency; (2) Having a clear and accessible Process -Based Governance  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  37 Framework (P BG Framework ); (3) Establishing a well -defined  auditability trail  in you r PBG Framework   through robust activity logging protocols that are consolidated digitally in a  process log .    1. Professional and Institutional Transparency: At every stage of the design  and  implementation of your AI project, team members  should be held to rigorous standards of  conduct that secure and maintain professionalism and institutional transp arency . These  standards should include the core values of  integrity, honesty,  sincerity, neutrality,   objectivity and impartiality . All p rofess ionals involved in the research, development,  production, and implementation  of AI technologies are, first and foremost,  acting as   fiduciaries of the public interest  and must, in keeping with these core values  of the Civil  Service , put the obligations to s erve that interest above any other concerns.      Furthermore, f rom start to finish of the AI project lifecycle , the design and implementation   process should be as transparent and as open to public scrutiny as possible with restrictions  on accessibility to re levant information limited to the reason able protection of justified  public sector confidentiality  and of analytics that may tip off bad actors to methods of  gaming the system of service provision.     2. Process -Based Governance Framework : So far, t his guide  has presented some of the main  steps  that are necessary  for establish ing responsible innovation practices in your AI proj ect.  Perhaps t he most vital of these measures is the  effective  operationalisation of the values  and principles that und erpin the development of ethical and safe AI . By o rganising all of  your governance  considerations and  actions into  a PBG Framework , you  will be better able  to accomplish  this task.     The purpose of a PBG Framework  is to provide a template for the integrations of the norms,  values, and principles, which motivate and steer responsible innovation, with the actual  processes that characterise the AI design and development pipeline. While th e  accompanying  Guide has focused primarily on the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data  Mining (CRISP -DM), keep in mind that  such a structured  integration of values and principles  with innovation processes is just as applicable in other related workflow  models like  Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD) and Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess   (SEMMA).      Your PBG Framework  should give you a landscape view of the governance procedures and  protocols that are organising the control structures of your  project workflow. Constructing  a good PBG Framework  will provide you and your team with a big picture of:     • The relevant team members and roles involved in each governance action.   • The relevant stages of the workflow in which intervention and targeted  cons ideration are necessary to meet governance goals   • Explicit timeframes for any necessary follow -up actions, re -assessment s, and  continual monitoring   • Clear and well -defined protocols for logging activity and for instituting  mechanisms to assure end -to-end aud itability    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  38 To help you get a summary picture of where the components of process transparenc y  explored so far fit into a PBG Framework , here is a landscape view:            3. Enabling Auditability with a Process Log:  With your controls in place and your governance  framework organised, you will be better able to manage and consolidate the information  necessary to assure end -to-end auditability. This information should include both the  records  and activity -monitoring  results  that are yielded by your PBG Fra mework  and the  model development data gathered across the modelling, training, testing, verifying, and  implementation phases.     By centralising your information digitally in a process log, you are preparing the way for  optimal process transparency.  A proces s log will enable you to make available, in one place,  information that may assist you in  demonstrating to concern ed parties and affected  decision subjects both the responsibility of design and use practices and the justifiability of  the outcomes  of your system’s processing behaviour .     Such a log  will also allow you to differentially organise the accessibility and presentation of  the information yielded by your project. Not only is this crucial to preserving and protecting  data that legitimately should remain unavailable for public view, it will afford your team the  capacity to cater the presentation of results to different tiers of stakeholders with different  interests and level s of expertise. This ability to curate your explanations with the use rreceiver in mind will be vital to achieving the goals of interpretable and justifiable AI.        Outcome t ransparency : Explaining  outcome  and clarifying content     Beyond  enabling process transparency through your PBG Framework, you must also put in place  standards and protocols to ensure that clear and understandable explanations of the outcomes of  your AI system’s decisions, behaviours, and problem -solving tasks  can:   
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  39   1. Properly inform the evidence -based judgments of the implementers that they are designed  to support;     2. Be offered to affected stakeholders and concerned parties  in an accessible way .     This is a multifaceted undertaking that will demand careful forethought an d participation across your  entire project team.     There is no simple technological solution for how to effectively clarify and convey the ration ale  behind a model’s output  in a particular decision -making  or behavioural context . Your team will have  to use sound judgement and common sense in order to bring together the technical aspects  of  choosing, designing, using a sufficiently interpretable AI system and the delivery aspects  of being  able to clarify  and communicate in plain, non -technical, and socially m eaningful language  how and  why that system  performed the way it did in a specific decision -making  or behaviour al context .     Having a good grasp of  the rationale and criteria behind the decision -making and problem -solving  behaviour of your system is essenti al for producing safe , fair,  and ethical AI. If your AI model is not  sufficiently interpretable —if you aren’t able to draw from it humanly understandable explanations of  the factors that p layed a significant role in determining  its behaviours —then you may not be able to  tell ho w and why things go  wrong in your system  when  they do.     This is a crucial and unavoidable issue for reasons we have already explored. Ensuring the safety of  high impact systems in transportation, medicine, infrastructure, and security requires human  verification that these systems have properly learned the critical tasks they are charged to complete.  It also requires confirmation that when confronted with unfamiliar circumstance s, anomalies, and  perturbation s, these systems will not fail or make unintuitive errors. Moreover, ensuring that these  systems operate without causing discriminatory harms requires effective ways to detect and to  mitigate sources of bias and inequitable influence t hat may be buried dee p within  their feature   spaces , inferences,  and architectures. Without interpretability each one of these tasks necessary for  delivering safe and mora lly justifiable AI will remain i ncomplete .    Defining Interpretable AI     To gain a foothold in both the techn ical and delivery dimensions of AI interpretability, you will first  need a solid working definition of wh at interpretable AI is.  To this end , it may be useful to recall once  again the defini tion of AI offered in the accompanying  Guide: ‘ Artificial Intelligence is the science of  making computers  do things that require intelligence when done by humans .’     This characterisation is important, because it brings out an essential feature of the explanatory  demands of interpretable AI: to do thin gs that require intelligence when done by humans means to  do things that require reasoning processes and cognitive functioning . This cognitive dimension has a  direct bearing on how you should think about  offer ing suitable explanations about algorithmically   generat ed outcomes:      Expla ining an algorithmic model’s  decision or behaviour  should  involve making explicit  how the   particular set of fa ctors which  determin ed that outcome  can play the role of evidence in supporting 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  40 the conclusion  reached . It should  involve making intelligible  to affected individuals the rationale   behind that decision or behaviour as if  it had  been  produc ed b y a reasoning, evidence -using, and  inference -making person .     What makes this explan ation -giving task so demanding  when i t comes to AI systems is that reasoning  processes do not occur, for humans, at just one level. Rather, human -scale reasoning and  interpreting includes:     1. Aspects of logic (applying the basic principles of validity that lie behind and give form to  sound thin king): This aspect aligns with the  need for  formal or logical explanation s of AI  systems.     2. Aspects of semantics  (gaining an understanding of how and why things work the way they  do and what they mean ): This aspect aligns with the  need for  explanation s of the technical  rationale  behind the  outcomes  AI systems.     3. Aspects of the social understanding of practices, beliefs, and intentions  (clarifying  the  content of interpersonal relations, societal norms, and individual objectives) : This aspect  aligns with the  need for the  clarification of the socia lly meaningful  content  of the outcomes  of AI systems.     4. Aspects of moral justification  (making sense of what should be considered right and wrong  in our everyday activities and choices) : This aspect aligns with the justifiability  of AI systems.     There are good reasons why  all four of these dimensions of human reasoning processes  must factor in  to explaining the decisions and behaviours of AI systems: First and most evidently, understanding the  logic and technical innerworkings ( i.e. semantic content) of th ese systems is a precondition for   ensuring  their safety and fairness .  Seco ndly, b ecause  they are designed and used to achieve human  objectives and to fulfil surrogate cognitive functions in the everyday  social world , we need to make  sense of these systems in terms of the consequential roles that their decisions and behaviours pl ay  in that human reality . The social context of these outcomes matters greatly. Finally , because they  actually affect individuals and society in direct and morally consequential ways, we need to  be able  to understand and explain their outcomes not just in terms of their mathematical lo gic, technical  rationale , and social context  but also in terms of the justifiability of their impacts on people.     Delving more deeply into the technical and delivery aspects of interpretable AI will show how these  four dimens ions of human reasoning directly line up with the different levels of demand for   explanations of  the outcomes of  AI systems. In particular, the logical and semantic dimensions will  weigh heavily in technical considerations whereas the social and moral dime nsions will be significant  at the point of delivery.      Note here, though, that these different dimensions of human reasoning are not necessarily mutually  exclusive but build off and depend upon each other in significant and cascading ways. Approaching  explanations of interpretable AI should therefore be treated holistically and inclusively. Technical  explanation of the logic and rationale of a given model, for instance,  should be  seen as a  support for  the context -based clarification of its socially meaning ful content , just as that socially meaningful  content should be viewed as forming the basis of explaining an outcome’s moral justifiability.  When 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  41 considering how to make the outcomes of decision -making and problem -solving AI systems  maximally transparent to affected stakeholders, you should take this rounded view of human  reasoning  into account , because it will help you address more effectively the spectrum of concerns  that these stakeholders may have.     Technical aspects of choosing, designing, and using an interpret able AI system     Keep in mind that, while, on the face of it, the task of choosing between the numerous AI and  machine learning algorithms  may  seem daunting,  it need not be so.  By sticking to the priority of  outcome transparency,  you and your team will be a ble to follow some straightforward and simple  guidelines  for selecting  sufficiently  interpretable but optimally performing algorithmic technique s.     Before exploring these guidelines , it is necessary to provide you with some  background information  to help you better understand  what face ts of explanation  are actually involved in technically  interpretable AI.  A good grasp of what is actually needed from such an explanation will enable you to  effectively target the interpretability need s of your AI project.        Facets of expl anation  in technically interpretable AI: A good starting point for understanding how th e  technical dimension of explanation works in interpretable AI systems is to remember that these  systems are largel y mathematical models that carry out step -by-step computations in transforming  sets of statistically interacting  or independent  inputs into s ets of target outputs. Machine learning is,  at bottom,  just applied statistics and probability theory fortified with several other mathematical  techniques. As such, it is subject to same methodologically rigorous requirements of  logical   validation  as other  mathematical sciences.     Such a  demand for rigour informs the  facet of formal and logical explanation  of AI systems that is  sometimes  called  the mathematical glass box . This characterisation  refers to the transparency of  strictly formal explanation: No matter how complicated it is (even  in the case of  a deep neural net   with a hundred million parameters), an algorithmic model is a closed system of effectively  computable operations where rules and transformations are mechanically applied to  inputs to  determine outputs. In this restricted sense, all AI and machine learning models are  fully intelligib le  and mathematically transparent if only formally  and logically  so.     This is an important characteristic of AI systems, because it makes it possible for supplemental  and  eminently interpretable  computational approaches  to model , approximate , and simplify even the  most complex and high dimensional  among them . In fact, such a possibility fuels some of the  technical approaches to  interpretable  AI that will soon be explored.     This formal  way of  understanding the  technical  explanation of  AI and machine learning systems ,  however, has immediate limitations. It can tell us that a model is mathematically intelligible because  it operates according to a collection of fixed  operations and parameters, but it cannot tell us much   about how or why the components of the model  trans formed a specif ied group  of inputs into  their  corresponding  outputs. It cannot tell us anything about the rationale behind the algorithmic  generation of a given outcome .    This second dimension of technical explanation has to do with the semantic facet  of interpretable AI.   A semantic explanation  offers an interpretation of the functions of the individual parts  of the 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  42 algorithmic  system in the generation of  its output . Whereas formal  and logical  explanation presents   an account of the stepwise application of the procedures and  rules that comprise the formal   framework of the algorithmic system, semantic explanation helps us to understand the meaning of  those procedures and rules  in terms of their purpose in the  input -output mapping  operation of the  system , i.e. what role they play in determining the outcome of the model’s computation.     The difficulties surrounding the interpretability of algorithmic decisions and behaviours arise in this  semantic dimension of  technical explanation . It is easiest to illustrate this by starting from the  simplest case.     When a machine learning model is  very basic,  the task of  follow ing the rationale of how it transforms  a given set of inputs into a given set of outputs can be relatively unp roblematic. For instan ce, in the   simple linear regression , y = a +  bx + , with a single predictor  variable  x and a response variable y,  the predictive relationship of x to y is directly expressed in a regression coefficient  b, representing  the rate and direction  at which y is predicted to change as x changes. This hypothetical model is  completely interpretable from the technical perspective for the following reasons:     • Linearity: Any change  in the value of the predictor variable is directl y reflected in a  change  in  the value of the  response variable at a constant  rate b. The interpretable prediction yielded   by the model can therefore  be directly inferred . This linearity dimension of predictive models  has been an essential feature of the automated decision -making systems in many heavily  regulated and  high -impact sectors, because the predictions yielded have high inferential  clarity and strength.     • Monotonic ity: When the value of the predictor changes in a given direction , the  value of the   response variable changes  consistently either in the same or opposite direction . The  interpretable prediction yielded by the model  can thus be directly inferred . This monotonicity  dimension is also a highly desirable interpretability condition of predictive models in many  heavily regulated sectors, because it incorporates reas onable  expectations about the  consistent application of sector specific selection constra ints into automated decision -making  systems. So, for example, if the selection criteria to gain employment at an agency or firm  includes  taking an exam, a reasonable expectation of outcomes would be that if candidate A  scored better than candidate B, then candidate B , all other things being equal,  would not be  selected  for employment  when A is not. A monotonic predictive model that uses the exam  score as the predictor variable and application success as the response variable would, in  effect, guarantee this  expectation is met by disallowing situations where A scores better  than  B but B gets selected and A does not.     • Non-Complexity:  The number of features (dimensionality) and feature interactions is low  enough  and the mapping function is simple enough  to ena ble a clear ‘global’ understanding  of the function of each part  of the mod el in relation to  its outcome.     While, all three of these desirable interpretability characteristics of the imagined model allow for  direct and intuitive reasoning about the relation  of the predictor and  response variable s, the model  itself is clearly too minimal to capture the density of relationships and interactions between  attributes i n complex  real-world  situations  where some degree of noisiness is unavoidable and the  task of app rehending the subtleties of u nderlying data distributions  is tricky .  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  43   In fact, o ne of the great strides forward that has been enabled by the contemporary convergence of  expanding computing power and big data availability with more advanced machine learning models  has been exactly this capacity to better capture and model the intricate  and complicated dynamics   of real -world situations . Still, this incorporation of the complexity of scale into the models  themselves has also meant significant challenges to the semantic dimension of  the technical  explanation of AI systems.     As machine lea rning system s have come to possess  both ever  greater access t o big data and  increasing  comput ing power , their designers have correspondingly been able  both to enlarge the  feature spaces  (the number of input variables)  of these systems  and to turn to gradua lly more  complex mapping functions . In many cases, this has meant vast improvements in the predictive and  classificatory performance  of more accurate and expressive models , but this has also meant the  growing prevalence of non -linearity, non -monotonicity, and high -dimensional complexity  in an  expanding array of so -called ‘black -box’ models.     Once high -dimensional feature spaces and complex functions are introduced into machin e learning  systems, the effects of changes in  any given input  become so entangled with the values and  interactions of other input s that understanding how individual components are transformed into  outputs becomes extremely difficult . The complex and unintu itive curve s of the decision functions of  many of these mod els preclude  linear and monotonic relations between  their  inputs and outputs.  Likewise, the high -dimensionality of their optimisation  techniques —frequently  involving millions of  parameters and comp lex correlations —ranges  well beyond the limits of human -scale cognition and  understanding.  To illustrate the increasing complexit y involved in  comprehe nding input -output  mappings, here is a visual representation that depict s the difference of between a lin ear regression  function and a deep neural network:         These  rising tides of computational complexity and algorithmic opacity  consequently  pose  a key  challenge for the responsible design and deployment of safe, fair, and ethical  AI systems: how should  the potential to advance the public interest through  the implementation of  high performing but  increasingly un interpretable machine learning models  be weighed agains t the tangible risks posed by  the lack of interpretability of such  systems?   
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  44   A careful answer to this  question is, in fact, not so simple. While the trade -off between performance  and interpretability may be real and important in some domain -specific applications , in others there  exist increasingly sophisticate d developments of standard interpretable techniques  such as   regression  extensions , decision trees, and rule lists that may prove just as effective for use cases  where the need for transparency is paramount. Furthermore, supplemental interpretability tools,  which function to make ‘black box’ models more semantically  and qualitatively  explainable are  rapidly advancing day by day.     These are  all factors  that you and your team should consider as you  work together to  decide on  which models to use for your AI project.  As a starting point for those considerations, let us now turn  to some basic guidelines that may help you to steer t hat dialogue toward points of relevance and  concern.             Guidelines for designing  and delivering  a sufficiently interpretable AI system     You should use the table below to begin thinking  about  how to integrate interpretability into your AI  project. While aspects of this topic can become extremely technical, it is important to make sure that  dialogue about making your AI system interpretable remains multidisciplinary and inclusive.  Moreover, it is crucial that ke y stakeholders be given adequate consideration when deciding upon  the delivery mechanisms of your project. These should include policy or operational design leads, the  technical personnel in charge of operating the trained models, the implementers  of the m odels , and  the decision subjects, who are affected by their outcomes.     Note that the first three guideline s focus on the big picture issue s you will need to consider in order  to incorpor ate interpretability needs into your project planning and workflow, wh ereas the last two  guidelines shift focus to the user -centred requirements  of desig ning and implementing a  sufficiently  interpretable AI system.            Guidelines for designing  and delivering  a sufficiently interpretable AI system     Guideline 1: Look first  to context, potential impact, and  domain -specific need  when determining the  interpretability requirements of  your  project     There are several related factors that should be taken into account as you formulate your project’s  approach to interpretability:     1. Type of application:  Start by assessing both the kind of tool you are building and the  environment in which it will apply. Clearly there is  a big difference between a computer  vision system that sorts handwritten employee fe edback forms and one that sorts   safety risks at a security checkpoint . Likewise, there is a big difference  between a  random forest model that triages applicants at a licencing agency and one that triages  sick patients in an emergency department.     Understa nding your AI system’s purpose and context of application will give you a  better idea of the stakes involved in its use  and hence also a good starting point  to think  about the scope of its interpretability needs . For instance, low -stakes AI models that are  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  45 not safety -critical, do not directly impact the lives of people, and do not process  potentially sensitive social and demographic data will likely have a lower need for  extensive resources to be dedicate d to a comprehensive interpretability platform.     2. Dom ain specificity:  By acquiring solid domain knowledge of the environment in which  your AI system will operate, you will gain better insight into any potential sector -specific  standards of explanation or benchmarks of justification  which  should inform  your  approach to interpretability. Through such knowledge, you may also obtain useful  information about organisational and public expectations regarding the scope, content,  and depth of explanations that have been previously offered in relevant use cases.     3. Existing technology:  If one of the purposes of your AI project is to replace an existing  algorithmic technology that may not offer the same sort of expressive power or  performance level as the more advanced machine learning techniques that you are  planning  to deploy, you should carry out an assessment of the performance and  interpretability levels of the existing technology. Acquiring this knowledge will provide  you with an important reference point when you are  consider ing possible  trade -offs  between perfo rmance and interpretability that may  occur  in your own prospective   system. It will also allow you to weigh the costs and benefits of building a more complex  system with  higher  interpretability -support  needs in comparison to the costs and  benefits of using a simpler model.           Guideline 2: Draw on standard interpretable techniques when possible     In order to actively integrate the aim of sufficient interpretability into your AI project, your team  should approach the model selection and development proces s with the goal of finding the right  fit between (1) domain -specific risks and needs, (2) available  data resources  and domain knowledge ,  and (3) task appropriate machine learning techniques . Effectively assimilating these three aspects  of your use case req uires open -mindedness and practicality.     Often times, it may be the case that high -impact, safety -critical, or other potentially sensitive  environments heighten demands for the thoroughgoing accou ntability and transparency of AI  projects. In some of these instances, such demands may make  choosing standard but   sophisticated non -opaque techniques an overriding priority. These techniques may include  decisions trees, linear reg ression  and its  extensions  like generalis ed additive models, decision /rule  lists, case -based reasoning , or logistic regression . In many cases, reaching for the ‘black box’ model  first may not be appropriate and may even lead to inefficiencies in project development, because  more interpretable models , which perform very well but do not require suppleme ntal tools and  techniques for facilitat ing interpretable outcomes , are also available.     Again, solid domain knowledge and context awareness are key components here. In use cases  where data resources lend to well -structured, meaningful representations and domain expertise  can be incorporated int o model architecture s, interpretable techniques may often be more  desirable than opaque ones. Careful data pre -processing and iterative model development can, in  these cases, hone the accuracy of such interpretable systems in ways that may  make the  advanta ges gained by the combination of their performanc e and transparency outweigh the  benefits of  more semantically intransparent  approaches.  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  46   In other use cases, however, data processing needs may disqualify the deployment of these sorts  of straightforward in terpretable systems. For instance, when AI applications are sought for  classifying images, recognising speech, or detecting anomalies in video footage, the most effective  machine learning approaches will  likely  be opaque. The feature spaces of these kinds of AI systems  grow exponentially to hundreds of thousands or even millions of dimensions. At this scale of  complexity, conventional methods of interpretation no longer apply. Indeed, it is the  unavoidability of  hitting such an interpretability wall  for certain important applications of  supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning  that has given rise to an entire subfield of  machine learning research  which  focuses on  providing technical tools to facilitat e interpretable  and explainable AI.     When the use of ‘black box’ models best fits the purpose of your AI project, you should proceed  diligently  and follow  the procedure s recommended in Guideline 3. For clarity, let us define a ‘black  box’ model as any AI system whose innerworkings and rationale are  opaque or  inaccessible to  human understanding . These systems may include neural networks  (including recurrent,  convolutional, and deep neural nets), ensemble methods  (an algorithmic technique  such as the  random forest method  that strengthens an overall prediction by combining and aggregating the  results of several  or many  different base models), and support vector machines  (a classifier that  uses a special type of mapping function to build a divider between two s ets of features in a high  dimensional feature space).     Guideline 3 : When considering the use  of ‘black box’  AI systems, you should:     1. Thoroughly weigh up  impacts and risks ;    2. Consider the options available for supplemental interpretability  tools that  will ensure  a  level of semantic expla nation  which is  both domain appropriat e and consistent with the  design and implementation of safe, fair, and ethical AI ;    3. Formulate an interpretability action plan, so that you and your team can put adequate  forethought into how explanations of the outcomes of your sys tem’s decisions,  behaviours, or  problem -solving tasks  can be optimally provided to user s, decision subject s,  and other affected parties .     It may be helpful to explore each of  these three  suggested steps of assessing the viability of the  responsible design and implementation of a ‘black box’ model in greater detail.      (1) Thoroughly weigh up impacts and risks:  Your first step in evaluating the feasibility of using a  complex AI system should  be to  focus on issues of ethics and safety. A s a general policy, you  and  your team  should utilise ‘black box’ models only:     • where their potential impacts and risks have been thoroughly considered in advance,  and you and your team have determi ned that your use case and domain specific  needs support the responsible design and implementations of these systems;    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  47 • where supplemental interpretability tools provide your system with a domain  appropriate level of semantic explainability that is reasonab ly sufficient  to mitigate its  potential risks  and that is therefore consistent with the design and implementation of  safe, fair, and ethical AI.     (2) Consider the options available for supplemental interpretability tools : Next, you and your team  should assess whether there are technical methods of  expla nation -support  that both  satisfy the  specific interpretability needs of your use case as determined by the deliberations suggested in  Guideline 1 and are appropriate for the algorithmic approach you  intend to use.  You should  consult closely with your technical team at this stage of model select ion. The e xploratory  processes of trial -and-error, which often  guide this discovery p hase in  the innovation lifecycle ,  should be informed and constrained by a solid working knowledge of the  technical  art of the  possible in  the domain  of available and useable  interpretability approaches.       The task of lining up the model selection process with the demands of interpretable  AI  requires a few conceptual tools that will enable thoughtful evaluation of whether  proposed supplemental interpretability approaches sufficiently  meet  your  project ’s  explanatory  need s. First and most importantly, you should be prepared to ask the right  questions when evaluating any given interpretability approach. This involves establishing  with as much clarity as possible how the explanatory results of that approach c an  contribute to the user ’s ability to offer solid, coherent, and reasonable accounts of the  rationale behind any given algorithmically generated out put. Relevant  questions to ask   that can serve this end are :    • What sort of explanatory resources w ill the interpretability tool provide users  and implementers  in order (1) to enable  them to  exercise better -informed  evidence -based judgments and (2) to assist them in offering  plausible , sound ,  and reasonable account s of the logic behind  algorithmically generated  output   to affected individuals and concerned parties ?     • Will the explanatory resources that the interpretability tool offers be useful for   providi ng affected stakeholders with a sufficient  understanding of a given   outcome?     • How , if at all , might the explanatory resources offered by the tool  be  misleading  or confusing ?    You and your team should take these questions as a starting point  for evaluating   prospective  interpretability tool s. These tools should be assessed  in terms of their  capaciti es to render the  reasoning  behind the decisions and behaviours of the   uninterpretable  ‘black box’ systems sufficiently  intelligible  to users and affected  stakeholders  given use case and domain specific interpretability needs .     Keeping this in mind, t here are two  technical dimensions of  supplemental interpretability  approaches that should be systematically incorporated into evaluation processes at this  stage of the innovation workflow .    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  48 The first involves the possible explanatory strategies you choose  to pursue over the  course of the  design and implementation  lifecycle. Such strategies  will largely determine  the paths to understanding you will be able to provide for its users and decision subjects.   They will largely define how you explain  your model an d its outcomes  and hence  what  kinds of explanation you  are able offer .        The second involves the coverage and scope  of the actual explanations themselves. The  choices you make  about explanatory coverage  will determine the extent to which the  kinds of explanations you are planning to pursue will  address  single instances  of the  model’s outputs or  range more broadly to cover  the underlying rationale of its behaviour  in general  and across instances . Choices you make about explanatory coverage will largely  govern the extent to which your AI system is locally and/or globally interpretable.          The very broad -brushed overview  of these two dimensions  that follows is just meant to  orient you  to some of the basi c concept s in an  expanding field of research , so that you  are more prepared for  working with your technical team to think through the strengths  and weaknesses of various approache s. Note , additionally , that this is a rapidly  developing area . Relevant members of your team should keep abreast of the latest  developments in the field of interpretable AI or XAI (Explainable AI) :    Two technical dimensions of supplemental interpretability approaches:     1. Determining explanatory strategies : To achieve the goal of securing a sufficiently  interpretable AI system, you and your team will need to get clear on how  to explain  your model and its outcomes . The explanatory strategies  you decide to pursue  will  shape the  paths to understanding  you are ab le to provide for the  users  of your model   and for its  decision subjects .      There are four such explanatory strategies  to which you should pay special attention :    a) Internal explanation : Pursuing the internal explanation  of an opaque mo del  involves making  intelligible  how the components an d relationships within it   function . There are two ways t hat such a  goal of internal explanation can be  interpreted. On the one hand, it can  be seen as an endeavour  to explain  the  operation of the model by considerin g it globally  as a comprehensible  whole .  Here, the aspiration is to ‘pry open the black box’ by building an explanatory  model that enables a ful l grasp of the opaque system’s internal contents. The  strengths and weaknesses  of such an approach  will be discussed in the  next   section on global interpretability.      On the other  hand, the search for internal explanation  can indicate the pursu it  a kind of engineering insight . In this sense, internal explanation  can be seen as   attem pting to shed descriptive  and inferential  light on the parts and operation  of the system as a whole in order to try to make it work better . Acquiring this  sort of internal understanding of the more general relationships that the  working parts of a trained model have with patterns of its responses can  allow  researchers to  advance step -by-step  in gaining a better data scientif ic grasp on 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  49 why it does what it  does  and how to improve it . Similarly, this type of internal  explanation can  be seen as  attempt ing to shed light on an opaque model’s   operation by breaking  it down into more understandable , analysable,  and  digestible  parts (for instance, in the case of a DNN: into interpretable  characteristics of its  vectors, features, layers, parame ters,  etc.).     From a practical point of view, this  kind of aspiration to engineering  insight  in  the ends of  data scientific advancement  should inform the goals of your  technical team throughout the model selection and design workflow.  Numerous methods exist to help provide i nformative representations of the   innerworkings  of various ‘black box’ systems. Gaining a clearer  descriptive   understanding of  the internal composition of  your  system will  contribute   greatly  to your project’s ability to  achieve  a higher degree of outcome  transparency  and to its c apacity to foster  best practices in the pursuit of  responsible data science  in general .    b) External or post -hoc explanation : External or post -hoc explanation attempts to  capture essential attributes of  the observable behaviour of a ‘black box’  system   by subjecting it to a number of different techniques that reverse engineer  explanatory insight. Some post -hoc approaches test the sensitivity of the  outputs of an opaque model to perturbations in its inputs ; others allow for the  interactive probing of its behavioural characteristics ; others , still, build  proxy based model s that utilis e simplified interpretable techniques t o gain a  better  understanding  of particular instances of its predictions and classifications .    This external or post -hoc approach has , at present,  established itself in machine  learning research as a go -to explanatory strategy  and for good reason. It allows  data scientists to pose mathem atical questions to their opaque systems by  testing them and by  building  supplemental models which enable greater  insight  through  the inference s drawn from their experimental interventions . Such a   post -hoc approach  allows them , moreover,  to seek out evidence for the  reasoning behind a given opaque model’s prediction or classification  by u tilising   maximally int erpretable techniqu es like linear regressi on, decision trees, rule  lists, or case -based reasoning . Several examples of post -hoc explanation will  be  explored below in the section on local interpretability.     Take note  initially  though  that, as some critics have rightly point ed out, because  they  are approximations or simplified supplemental models of the more  complex original s, many post -hoc explanations  can fail to accurately represent  certain areas of the opaque model’s feature space. This  deterior ation of  accuracy in parts of the original model’s domain can frequently produce  misleading and uncertain results  in the post -hoc explanation s of concern .     c) Supple mental explanatory infrastructur e: A different kind of explanatory strategy  involves actually inc orporating secondary explanatory faciliti es in to the system  you are building. For instance, an image recognition system could have a  primary component, like a convolutional neural net, that extracts features from 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  50 its inputs and classifies  them  while a secondary component, like a built -in  recurrent neu ral net with an ‘attention -directing’ mechanism, translates the  extracted features into a natural language representation that produces a  sentence -long explanation of the result to the user.  In other words, a system  like this is designed to provide simple explanations of its own data processing  results.         Research in to integrating ‘attention -based’ interfaces  like this  in AI systems is  continuing to advance toward making their implementations more sensitive  to  user needs , more explanation -forward, and more human -understandable.  For  instance, m ultimodal methods of combining visualisation tools and textual  interface  are being developed that  may make the provision of explanations  more interpretable for both implementers and decision subjects.  Furthermore,  the incorporation of domain knowledge and logic -based  or convention -based  structures into the architectures of complex models  are increasingly allowing  for better and more user -friendly representations and prototypes to be built  into them.  This is gradually enabling  more sophisticated explanatory  infrastructures to  be integrated  into opaque systems and make s it essential to  think about bu ilding explanation -by-design in to your AI projects.     d) Counterfactual explanation : While counterfactual explanation  is a kind of post hoc approach, it deserves special attention insofar as it moves beyond other  post -hoc explanations to provide affected stakeholders with  clear and precise   options for actionable recourse and practical remedy .     Counterfactual explanations are contrastive explanations: They offer succinct   computational  reckonings of how specific factors that influenced an algorithmic   decision  can be changed so that better alternatives can b e realised by the  subject of that decisio n. Incorporating counterfactual explanations into your AI  system at its point of delivery would allow stakeholders to see what input  variables of the model  can be modifi ed, so that the outcome c ould be altered  to their benefit.  Additionally, from a responsible design perspective,  incorporating counterfactual explanation into the development and testing  phases of your system would allow your team to build a model that  incorporates actionable variables , i.e. input variables that w ill afford decision  subjects with concise options for making practical changes that would improve  their chances of obtaining the  desire d outcome.  Counterfactual explanatory  strategies can be used as way to incorporate reasonableness  and the  encouragement o f agency  into the design and implementation of your AI project .    All that said, it is important to recognise that, while counterfactual explanation  does offer an innovative way to contrastively explore how feature importance  may influence an outcome, it is  not a complete solution to the problem of AI  interpretability. In certain cases, for instance, the sheer number of potentially  significant features that  could be at play in counterfactual explanation s of a  given result can make a clear and direct explanat ion difficult to obtain and  selected sets of explanations seem potentially arbitrary. Moreover, there are as 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  51 yet limitations on the types of datasets and functions to which these kinds of  explana tions are applicable . Finally, because this kind of explanati on concedes  the opacity of the algorithmic model outright, it is less able to address concerns  about potentially harmful feature interactions and multivariate relationships  that may be buried deep within the model’s architecture.      Here is an at-a-glance view of a typology of these explanatory strategies:         2. Coverage  and Scope : The main question s you will need to  broach  in the dimension of  the coverage and scope of your supplemental interpretability approach are : To what  extent d oes our interp retability approach  cover the explanation of  singe  prediction s  or classification s of the model  and to what extent does it  cover  the explanation of the  innerworkings and rationale of the model  as a whole and  across predictions ? To what  extent d oes it cover both?     This distinction between single instance and total model explanation is often  characterised as the difference between local interpretability  and the global  interpretability . Both types of explanation offer po tentially h elpful support for the  provision of significant information about the rationale behind an algorithmic  decision or behaviour, but both , in their own ways,  also face difficulties .     Local Interpretability:  A local semantic explanation aims to enable the interpretability  of individual cases . The general idea behind attempts to explain a ‘black box’ system  in terms of specific instances is that, regardless of how complex the architecture or  decision function o f that system may be, it is possible to gain interpretive insight into  its innerworkings by focus ing on single data points or neighbourhoods in its feature  space.  In other words, even if the high dimensionality and curviness of a model  makes it opaque as a whole , there is an expectation  that insight -generating   
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  52 interpretable methods can be applied locally  to smaller sections of the model, where  changes in isolated or grouped variables are more mana geable and  understandable.     This general explanatory perspective has yielded several different interpretive  strategies that have been successfully applied in significant areas of ‘black box’  machine learning. One family of such strategies has ze roed in on neural networks  (DNN s, in particular) by identifying what  features of an input vector’s data points  make it representative of the target concept that a given  model is trying to classify.  So, for example,  if we have a digital  image of a dog  that is converted  into a vector of  pixel  value s and then processed it through a dog-classifying deep neural net, this  interpretive approach w ill endeavour  to tell us why the system yielded a ‘ dogpositive ’ output by isolating  the slices of this set of data points that are most relevant  to its successful classific ation  by the model .     This can be accomplished in several related  ways. What is called sensitivity analysis   identifies the most relevant  features  of an input vector  by calculating local gradients  to determine how a data point has to be  moved to change the output label. Here, an  output’s sensitivity to such changes  in input values  identifies the most relevant  features. Another meth od to identify feature relevance that is  downstream from  sensitivity analysis is called salience mapping , where a strategy of moving backward  through the layers of a neural net graph allows for the mapping of patterns of high  activation in the nodes and ultimate ly generates interpretable groupin gs of salient  input variables  that can be visually represented in a heat or pixel attribution  map .     A second  local  interpretive strategy  also seeks to explain  feature importance in  a  single prediction or classification by perturbing input variables . Howev er, instead of  using these nudges in the feature space to highlight areas of saliency,  it uses them to  prod the opaque model in the area around the relevant prediction , so that a  supplemental interpretable  model  can be constructed which establishes the relative  importance of features in the black box  model ’s output.     The most well -known example of this strategy is called LIME  (Local Interpretable  Model -Agnostic Explanation) . LIME works by  fitting an interpretabl e model to a  specific prediction or classification produced by the opaque system of concern. It  does this by  sampling data  points  at random  around the  target  prediction or  classification and then using them  to build a local approximation of the decision  boundary  that can account  for the features which  figure prominently in the specific  prediction or classification under scrutiny .     The way this works is relatively uncomplicated : LIME generates a  simple  linear  regression model by weighting the val ues of the data points , which were produced by  randomly perturbing the opaque model , according to their proximity to the original  prediction or classification. The closest of these values to the instance being  explained are weighted the heaviest, so that t he supplemental  model can produce an  explanation of feature importance that is locally faithful to that instance.   Note that  the type of model that LIME uses most prominently is a sparse linear  regression  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  53 function for reasons of semantic transparency that were discussed above. Other  interpretable models such as decision trees  can likewise be employed.     While LIME does indeed appear  to be a step in the right direction for the future of  interpretable AI, a host of issues that present challenges to  the approac h remains   unresolved. For instance, t he crucial aspect of  how to  properly  define  the proximity  measure for  the ‘neighbourhood ’ or ‘local region’ where the explanation appli es  remains unclear, and small changes in the scale of the chosen measure can lead to   greatly diverging explanations.  Likewise, the explanation produced by the  supplemental  linear model ca n quickly become unreliable even with small and  virtually unnoticeable perturbations of the system it is attempting to approximate .  This challenges the b asic assumption that that there is always some  simplified  linear  model that successfully approximates the underlying model reasonably well near any  given data point.     LIME’s creators have largely acknowledged these shortcoming s and have recently  offered a  new explanatory approach that they call ‘ anchors ’. These ‘high precision  rules’ incorporate  into their formal structures  ‘reasonable patterns’ that are  operating within the underlying model  (such as the implicit linguistic conventions that   are at work  in a sentiment prediction model) , so that they  can establish suitable and  faithful boundaries of their explanatory coverage of its predictions or classifications.     A related and equally significant local interpretive strategy is called SHAP (Shapley  Additive exPlanations) . SHAP uses concepts from game theory to define a ‘Shapley  value’ for a feature of concern  that provides a measurement of its influence on the  underlying model’s prediction . Broadly, this value is calculated for a featur e by  averaging its marginal contribution to every possible prediction  for the instance under  consideration.     This might seem impossible, but the strategy is straightforward.  SHAP calculates the  marginal contribution of the relevant feature for all possibl e combinations of inputs  in the feature space of the instance.  So, if the opaque model  that it is explaining has   15 features , SHAP would calculate the marginal contribution of the feature under  consideration 32,768 times  (i.e. one calculation for each combination of all possible  combinations of features: 215, or 2k when k = 15).     This method then allows SHAP to estimate the Shapley values for all input features in  the set to produce the complete distribution of the prediction for the instance. In our  example, this would entail 491,520 calculations. While such a procedure  is  computa tionally burdensome  and become s intractable beyond a certain threshold ,  this means that locally , that is,  for the calculation of the specific instance, SHAP can  axiomatically guarantee the consistency and accuracy of its reckoning of the marginal  effect of  the feature . (Note that the SHAP platform does offer methods of  approximation to avoid this excessive computational expense.)     Despite this c alculational  robustness, SHAP also faces some of the same kind s of  difficulties that LIME does. T he way SHAP calculates marginal contributions is by 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  54 constructing two instances: the first instance include s the feature being measured  while  the second leaves it out.  After calculating the prediction for each of these  instances by plugging the ir values  into the underlying  model, the result of the second  is subtracted from that of the first to determine the marginal contribution of the  feature.  This procedure is then repeated for all possible combinations of features so  that the weighted average of all of th e marginal contributions of the feature of  concern can be computed.     The contestable part  of this process  comes with how SHAP defines the absence  of  variables under consideration. To l eave out a feature —whether it’s the one being  directly measured or one of the others not included in the combinatio n under  consideration —SHAP replaces it with a stand -in feature value  drawn from  a selected   donor sample  (that is itself drawn from  the existing  dataset ). This method of sampling  values assumes feature independenc e (i.e. that values sampled are not correlated in  ways that might significantly affect the output for a particular calculation) . As a  consequence,  the interaction effects engendered by and between stand -in variables  are necessarily  unaccounted for when conditional contributions are approximated.  The result is  the introduction of  uncertainty into the  explanation that is produced  because the complexity of multivariate interactions in the underlyi ng model may  not  be sufficiently captured by the  simplicity o f this  supplemental interpretability  technique. This drawback in sampling  (as well as a certain degree of arbitrariness in  domain definition)  can c ause SHAP  to become unreliable even with minimal  perturbations of the model it is approximating.     Despite the se limitations in the existing tools of local interpretability, it is important  that you think ‘local -first’ when considering the issue of the coverage and scope of  the explanatory approaches you plan to incorporate into your project. Being able to  provide  explanations of specific predictions and classifications is of paramount  importance both to securing optimal outco me transparency and  also to ensuring that  your AI system will be implemented responsibly and reasonably.     Global i nterpretability:  The motivation behind the  creation of  local interpretability  tools like LIME or SHAP  (as well as  many others  not mentioned here ) has derived, at  least in part,  from a  need to find a way of  avoid ing the kind of  difficult  double bind   faced by the alternative app roach to the coverage and scope of interpretable AI:  global interpretability.     On the prevailing  view, providing a global explanation of a ‘black box’ model  entail s  offering an alternative interpretable model that captures the innerworkings and logic  of a ‘black box’ model in sum  and across predictions or classifications. The difficulty  faced by global interpretability arises in the seemingly unavoidable trade -off between  the need for the global explanatory model to be sufficiently simple so that it is  understandable by  human s and t he need for that  model to be sufficiently complex so  that it can capture th e intricacies of how the mapping function of a ‘black box’ model  works as a whole.       
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  55 While this is clearly a real problem that appears to be theoretical ly inevitable, it is  important to keep in mind that, from a practical standpoint , a serviceable notion of  global interpretability need not be limited to such a conceptual puzzle. There are at  least two less ambitious  but more constructive  ways to view global interpretability as  a potentially meaningful contributor to the responsible design and implementation of  interpretable AI.     First, m any useful attempts have already been made at building explanatory models  that employ interpretable me thods (like decision trees , rule lists , and case -based  classification ) to globally  approximate  neura l nets, tree ensembles , and support  vector machines. These results  have enabled a deeper understanding of the way  human interpretable logics  and conventions  (like if -then rules  and representationally  generated prototypes ) can be measured against or mapped onto high dimensional  computational structures and even allow for some degree of targeted  comprehensibility of the logic of their parts.     This capacity  to ‘peek into the black box’  is of great practical impo rtance in domains  where trust, user -confidence , and public acceptance are critical  for the realisation   optimal outcomes . Moreover, this  ability to move back and forth between  interpretable architecture s and high -dimensional processing structures can enable  knowledge discover y as well as insight s into the kinds of dataset -level  and  population -level patterns, wh ich are  crucial for well-informed macroscale decision making in areas ranging from public health and economics to  the science of  climate  change.      Being able to uncover global effects and relationships between complex model  behaviour and data distributions at the demographic  and ecological  level may  prove  vital for establishing valuable and practically useful knowledge about unobservable   but significant  biophysical and social configurations. Hence, a lthough these models  have not solved the understandability -complexity puzzle  as such , they have opened   up new pathways for innovative thinking  in the applied data sciences  that may be of   immense public benefit  in the future .    Secondly, as mentioned above, under the auspices  of the aspiration to engineering  insight , a descriptive and analytical kind of global interpretability  can be seen as a  driving force of  data scientific advancement. When seen through a  practitioner centred lens, this sort of global interpretability allows data scientists to take a  wide angled and discovery -oriented view of a ‘black box’ model’s relationship to patterns  that arise across the range of its predictions. Figuring out how an opaque system  works and how to make it work better by more fully understanding these patterns is  a continuous priority  of good research. So too is  understanding the relevance of  features and  of their  complex interactions  through dataset level measurement and  analysis. These dimensions of incorporating the explanatory aspirations of global  interpretability into best practice s of research and innovation s hould be encouraged  in your AI project.     
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  56 (3) Formulate an interpretability action p lan: The final step you will need to take to ensure a  responsible approach to using ‘black box’ models is to formulate an interpretability action plan so  that you and your  team can put adequate forethought into how explanations of the outcomes of  your system’s decisions, behaviours, or problem -solving tasks can be optimally provided to users,  decision subjects, and other affected parties.     This action plan should include th e following:     • A clear articulation of the explanatory strategies  your team intends to use and a detailed  plan that indicates the stages in the project workflow when the design and development of  these strategies will need to take place.     • A succinct formula tion of your explanation delivery strategy , which addresses the special  provisions for clear, simple, and user -centred explication that are called for when  supplemental interpretability tools for ‘black box’ models are utilised.  See more about  delivery and  implementation in Guideline 5.     • A detailed timeframe for evaluating your team’s progress  in executing its interpretability  action plan and a role responsibility list , which maps in detail the various task -specific  responsibilities that will need to be fulfilled to execute the plan.     Guideline 4 : Think about interpretability in terms of the capacities of human understanding     When you begin to deliberate about the  specific  scope and content of your interpretability  platform, it is important to reflect on what it is that you are exactly aiming to do in making your  model sufficiently interpretable. A good initial step to take in this process is to think about what  makes even the simplest explanations clear and understandable . In other words, you should begin  by thinking about interpretability in terms of the capacities and limitations of human cognition.     From this perspective, it becomes apparent that even the most straightforward model  like a linear  regression function or a decision tree  can become uninterpretable when its dimensionality presses  beyond the cognitive limits of a thinking human. Recall our example of the simple linear  regression: 𝑦=𝑎+𝑏𝑥+𝜖. In thi s instance, only one feature x relates to the response variable y,  so understanding the predictive relationship is easy. The model is parsimonious.     However, if we started to add more features as covariates, even though the model would remain  linear and he nce intuitively predictable, being able to understand the relationship between the  response variable and all the predictors  and their coefficients (feature weights) would quickly  become difficult. So, say we added ten thousand features and trained the model: 𝑦=𝑎+𝑏0𝑥0+ 𝑏1𝑥1+⋯+𝑏10000𝑥10000+𝜖. Understanding how  this model’s prediction comes about —what  role each of the ind ividual parts play  in producing the prediction —would become difficult because   of a certain cognitive limit in the quantity of entities that human thinking can handle at any given  time. This model would lose a significant degree of interpretability.     Seein g interpretability as a continuum  of comprehensibility  that is dependent on the capacities  and limits of the individual human interpreter should key you in to what is needed in order to  deliver  an interpretable AI system. Such limits to consider should inc lude not only cognitive 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  57 boundaries but also varying levels of access to relevant vocabularies of explanation; an  explanation about the results of a trained model that uses a support vector m achine  to divide a  26-dimensional feature space with a planar sepa rator , for instance, may  be easy to understand for  a technical operator or auditor but entirely inaccessible to a non -specialist. Offering good  explanations should take expertise level into account. Your interpretability platform should be  cognitively equi table .         Securing responsible delivery through human -centred implementation protocols and  practices     The demand for sensitivity to human factors should inform your approach to devising delivery and  implementation processes from start to finish. To provide clear and effective explanations about the  content and rationale of algorithmic outputs, you will hav e to begin by building from the human  ground up . You will have to pay close attention to the circumstances, needs, competences, and  capacities of the people whom your AI project aims to assist and serve.      This means that context will be critical . By unde rstanding your use case well and by drawing upon  solid domain knowledge, you will be better able to define roles and relationships . You will better be  able to train the users and implementers of your system . And, you will be better able to establish  an  effectual  implementation platform, to clarify  content, and to facilitate understanding  of outcome s for  users and affected stakeholders alike. Here is a diagram of what securing human -centred  implementation protocols and practices might look like:         Let us consider these steps in turn by building a checklist of essential actions that should be taken to  help ensure the human -centred implem entation of your AI project. Because the specifics of your  approach will depend so heavily on the context and poten tial impacts of your project, we’ll assume a  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  58 generic case and construct the checklist around a hypothetical algorithmic decision -making system  that will be used for predictive risk assessment.      Step 1 : Consider aspects of application  type and domain cont ext to define  roles and determine user  needs      (1) Assess which members of the communities you are serving will be most affected by the  implementation of your AI system. Who are the most vulnerable among them? How will their  socioeconomic, cultural, and edu cation backgrounds affect their capacities to interpret and  understand the explanations you intend to provide? How can you fine -tune your explanatory  strategy to accommodate their requirement s and provide them with clear and non -technical  details about the  rationale behind the algorithmically supported result ?         When thinking about providing explanations to affected stakeholders, you should start with  the needs of the most disadvantaged first. Only in this way, will you be able to establish an  acceptabl e baseline for the equitable delivery of interpretable AI.      (2) After reviewing Guideline 1  above, make a list of and define all the roles that will  potentially be involved at the delivery stage of your AI project. As you go  through each role,  specify levels of technical expertise and domain knowledge as well as possible goals and  objectives for each role. For instance, in our predictive risk assessment case:     o Decision Subject  (DS)-   ▪ Role:  Subject of the predictive analytics.    ▪ Possible G oals and Objectives:  To receive a fair, unbiased, and reasonable  determination, which makes sense; to discover which factors might be  changed to receive a different outcome.   ▪ Technical and Domain Knowledge:   Most likely low to average technical   expertise and average domain knowledge.   o Advocate for the DS -   ▪ Role:   Support  for the DS (for example, legal counsel or care worker) and  concerned party to the automated decision .   ▪ Possible G oals and Objectives:  To make sure the best interests of the DS are  safeguarded throughout the process; to help make clear to the DS what is  going on and how and why decisions are being made.   ▪ Technical and Domain Knowledge:    Most likely average technical expertise and  high level of domain knowledge .  o Implementer -   ▪ Role:   User of the AI system as decision support.   ▪ Possible G oals and Objectives:  To make an objective and fair decision that is  sufficiently responsive to the particular circumstances of the DS and that is  anchored in solid reasoning and evidence -based judgement.   ▪ Technical and Domain Knowledge:  Most likely average technical expertise and  high le vel of domain knowledge .  o System Operator/Technician -   ▪ Role:   Provider of support and maintenance for the AI system and its use.  
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  59 ▪ Possible G oals and Objectives:  To make sure the machine learning system is  performing well and running in accordance with its intended design; to handle  the technical dimension of information processing for the DS’s particular case;  to answer technical questions about the system and it s results as they arise.   ▪ Technical and Domain Knowledge:   Most likely high level of technical expertise  and average domain knowledge .  o Delivery Manager -   ▪ Role:   Member of the implementation team who oversees its operation and  responds to problems as they a rise.   ▪ Possible G oals and Objectives:  To ensure that the quality of the automation supported assessment process is high and that the needs of the decision  subject are being serv ed as intended by the project; t o oversee the overall  quality of the relationsh ips within the implementation team and between the  members of that team and the communities they serve.   ▪ Technical and Domain Knowledge:  Most likely average technical expertise and  good to high level domain knowledge     Step 2 : Define delivery relations and map del ivery processes      (1) Assess the possible relationships between the defined roles that will have significant  bearing on your project’s implementation and formulate a descriptive account of this  relationship with an eye to the part it will play in the delivery process. For the predictive risk  assessment example:     o Decision Subject/Advocate to Implementer : This is the primary relationship of the  implementation process. It should be information -driven  and dialogue -driven wit h the  implementer’s exercise of unbiased judgment and the DS’s comprehension of the  outcome treated as the highest priorities. Implementers should be prepared to  answer questions and to offer evidence -based clarifications and justifications for their  deter minations. The achievement of well -informed mutual understanding is a central  aim.   o Implementer to System Operator : This is the most critical operational relationship  within the implementation team. Communication levels should be kept high from  case to case , and the shared goal of the two parties should be to optimise the quality  of the decisions by optimising the use of the algorithmic decision -support system in  ways that are accessible both to the user and to the DS. The conversations between  implementers and system operators should be problem -driven and should avoid, as  much as possible, focus on the specialised vocabularies of each party’s domain of  expertise.   o Delivery Manager to Operator to Implementer : The quality of this cross -disciplinary  relationship  within the implementation team will have direct bearing on the overall  quality of the delivery of the algorithmically supported decisions. Safeguarding the  latter will require that open and easily accessible lines of communication be  maintained between de livery managers, operators, and implementers, so that  unforeseen implementation problems can be tackled from multiple angles and in  ways that anticipate and stem future difficulties. Additionally, differ ent use cases may  present different explanatory chall enges that are best addressed by multidisciplinary 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  60 team input. Good communications within the implementation team will be essential  to enable that such challenges are addressed in a timely and efficient manner.      (2) Start building a map of the delivery pr ocess. This should involve incorporating your  understanding of the needs, roles, and relationships of relevant actors involved in the  implementation of your AI system into the wider objective of providing clear, informative,  and understandable explanations  of algorithmically supported decisions.     It is vital to recognise, at this implementation -planning stage of your project, that the  principal goal of the delivery process  is two -fold: to translate  statistically expressed results into   humanly significant  reasons and  to translate algorithmic  outputs into  socially meaningful   outcomes .     These  overlapping objectives should have a direct bearing on the way you build a map for   your project’s delivery process,  because they  organise the dutie s of implementation into  two  task-specific components :    1. A technical component , which involves determining  the most effective way to convey  and communicate to users and decision subjects  the statistical results of your model’s  information processing so that  the factors that figured into the logic and rationale of  those results can be translated into understandable reasons that can be subjected to  rational evaluation and critical assessment;  and    2. A social component , which involves clarifying the socially meaningful content of t he  outcome  of a given algorithmically assis ted decision by  translat ing that model ’s  technical machinery —its input and output variables, parameters, and functional  rationale —back  into the everyday language of the humanly rele vant categories and  relationships that informed the formulation of its purpose, objective, and intended  elements of design in the first place. Only through this re -translation will the effects of  that model’s output on the real human life it impacts  be und erstandable  in terms of the  specific  social and individual context of that life and be conveyable  as such.     These two components of the delivery process will be fleshed out in turn.     Technical component of responsible implementation:  As a general rule, w e use the results of  statistical analysis to guide our actions, because, when done properly, this kind of analysis  offers a solid basis of empirically derived evidence that helps us to exercise sound and well supported judgment about the matters it informs.     Having a good understanding of the factors that are at work in producing the result of a  particular statistical analysis (such as in an algorithmic decision -support system) means that  we are able to grasp these factors (for instance, input features that weigh heavily in  determining a given  algorithmically generated decision ) as reasons that  may warrant the  rational accept ability of that  result. After all, seen from the perspective of the interpret ability  of such an  analysis, these factors are, in fact, no thing other than  reasons that  are operating  to support its conclusions .    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  61 Clearly understood, these factors that lie behind the logic of the result or decision are not  ‘causes’ of it. Rather , they  form the evidentiary  basis of its  rational soundness and of the  goodness of the inferences that support it. Whether or not we ultimat ely agree with the  decision or the result of the analysis, the reasons that work together to comprise its  conclusions make claims to validity  and can as such  be called before a tribunal of rational  criticism . These reasons, in other words, must bear the bu rden of continuous assessment,  evaluation, and contestation.     This is a n element especially crucial for  the responsible implementation of AI systems:  Because they serve  surrogate cognitive function s in society, their decisions and results are in  no way imm une from these demands for rational justification and thus must be delivered to be  optimally responsive to such demands.     The results of a lgorithmic  decision support systems, in this sense, serve as stand -ins for acts  of speech and representation and there fore bear the justificatory burdens of those cognitive  functions. They must establish the validity of their conclusions and operate under the  constraint of being surrogates of the dialogical goal to convince through good reasons.     This charge to be responsive to the demands of rational justification should be essential to  the way you map out your delivery strategy. When you devise how best to relay and explain  the statistical results of your AI systems, you need to start from the ro le they play in supporting  evidence -based reasoning.     This, however, is no easy job. Interpreting the results of data scientific analysis is, more often  than not, a highly technical activity and can depart widely from the conventional, everyday  styles of reasoning that are familiar to most. Moreover, t he various performance metrics   deployed in AI systems  can be confusing and, at times, seem to be at cross -purposes with  each other, depending upon the metrics chosen. There is also an unavoidable dimension of   uncertainty that must be accounted for and expressed in confidence intervals and error bars  which may only bring further confusion to users and decision subjects.     Be that as it may, by taking a deliberate and human -centred approach  to the delivery proces s,  you should be able  to find the most effective way to convey  your model’s statistical results to  users and decision subjects  in non -technical and socially meaningful language that enables  them to understand and evaluate the rational justifiability of tho se results. A good point of  departure for this is to divide your map -building task into the  means of content delivery  and  the substance of the content to be delivered .     Means of content delivery : When you start mapping  out serviceable ways of presenting and  communicating your model’s results, you should consider  the users ’ and decision subjects ’  perspectives to be of primary importance . Here are a few  guiding questions to ask as you  sketch out this dimension of your delivery process as well as some provisional answers to  them :     o How can the delivery process of explaining the  AI system’s  results aid and augment the  user’s and decision subject’s mental models (their ways of organising and filtering  information), so that they can get a clear pictur e of the technical meaning of the 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  62 assessment or explanation? What is the best way to frame the statistical inferences and  meanings so that they can be effectively integrated into each user’s own cognitive  space of concepts  and beliefs ?      While answering t hese questions will largely depend both on your use case and on  the type of AI application you are building, it is just as important that you start  responding to them by concentrating on the differing needs and capabilities of your  explainees. To do this p roperly, you should first seek input from domain experts,  users, and affected stakeholders, so that you can suitably scan the horizons of existing  needs and capabilities. Likewise, you should take a human -centred approach to  exploring the types of explanat ion delivery methods that would best be suited for  each of your target groups. Much valuable research has been done on this in the field  of human -computer interaction and in the study of human factors. This work should  be consulted when mapping delivery me ans.    Once you have gathered enough background information, you should begin to plan  out how you are going to line up your means of delivery with the varying levels of  technical literacy, expertise, and cognitive need possessed by the relevant stakeholder  groups, who will be involve d in the implementation of your project . Such a multi -tiered  approach  minimally require s that individual attention be paid to the explanatory  needs and capacities of implementers, system operators, and decision subjects and  their advocates. This multi -tiered approach will pose different challenges at each  different level.     For instance, the m ental models of implementers —i.e. their ways of conceptualising  the information they are receiving from the algorithmic decision -support system — may, in some cases, largely be shaped by their accumulation of domain know -how  and by the filter of on -the-job e xpertise that they have developed over long periods  of practice. These users may have a predisposition to automation distrust or aversion  bias, and this should be taken into account when you are formulating appropriate  means of explanation delivery.     In other contexts, the opposite may be the case. Where implementers tend to over rely on or over -comply with automated systems, the means of explanation delivery  must anticipate a different sort of mental model and adjust the presentation of  information accord ingly.     In any event, you will need to have a g ood empirical understanding  of your  implementer’s decision -making context and maintain such knowledge through  ongoing assessment . In both bias risk areas, the conveyance and communication of  the assessments g enerated by algorithmic decision -support systems should attempt  to bolster each user’s  practical judgment  in ways that mitigate the possibility of either  sort of bias. These assessments should present results as evidence -based reasons that  support and bett er capacitate the objectivity of these implementers’ reasoning  processes.    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  63 The story is different with regard to the cognitive life of the technically inclined user.  The mental models of system operators, who are natives in the technical vocabulary  and epi stemic representations of the statistical results, may be adept at the model based problem -solving tasks that arise during implementation but less familiar with  identifying and responding to the cognitive needs and limitations of non -technical  stakeholders . Incorporating ongoing communication exercises and training into their  roles in the delivery process may capacitate them to better facilitate implementers’  and decision subjects’ understanding of the technical details of the assessments  generated by algor ithmic decision -support systems. These ongoing development  activities will not only helpfully enrich operators’ mental models, they may also  inspire them to develop deeper, more responsive, and more effective ways of  communicating the technical yields of t he analytics they oversee.     Finally, the mental models of decision subjects and their advocates will show the  broadest range of conceptualisation capacities, so your delivery strategy should (1)  prioritise the facilitation of  optimal explanation at the ba seline level of the needs of  the most disadvantaged of them and (2) build the depth of your multi -tiered  approach to providing effective explanations into the delivery options presented to  decision subjects and their advocates. This latter suggestion entai ls that, beyond  provision of the baseline explanation of the algorithmically generated result, options  should be given to decision subjects and their advocates to view more detailed and  technical presentations of the sort available to implementers and oper ators (with the  proviso that reasonable limitations be placed on transparency in accordance with the  need to protect the confidential personal and organisational information and to  prevent gaming of the system).        o How can non -technical stakeholders be a dequately prepared to gain baseline  know ledge of the kinds  of statistical  and probabilistic reasoning that have factored into  the technical interpretation of the system’s output, so that they are able to  comprehend it on its own technical terms? How can th e technical components be  presented in a way that will enable explainees to easily translate the statistical  inferences and meanings of the results into understandable and rationally assessable  terms? What are the best available media for presenting the te chnical results in  engaging and comprehensible ways?     To meet these challenges, you should consider supplementing your implementation  platform with knowledge -building and enrichment resources that will provide non technical stakeholders with access to basi c technical concepts and vocabulary. At a  minimum, you should consider building a plain language glossary of basic terms and  concepts that will include all of the technical ideas covered by the algorithmic  component of a given explanation. If your explanat ion platforms are digital, you  should also make them as user friendly as possible by hyperlinking the technical terms  used in the explanations to their plain language glossary elaborations.     Where possible, explanatory demonstrations of technical concepts  (like performance  metrics, formal fairness criteria, confidence intervals, etc.) should be provided to  users and decision subjects in an engaging and easy -to-comprehend way, and 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  64 graphical and visualisation techniques should be consistently used to make po tentially  difficult ideas more accessible. Moreover, the explanation interfaces themselves  should be as simple, learnable, and usable as possible. They should be tested to  measure the ease with which those with neither technical experience nor domain  knowl edge are able to gain proficiency in their use and in understanding their  content.          Substance of the technical content to be delivered: The overall interpretability of your AI  system will largely hinge on the effectiveness and even -handedness of your  technical content  delivery. You will have to strike a balance between (1) determining how best to convey and  communicate the rationale of the statistical results so that they may be treated appropriately  as decision supporting and clarifying reasons and ( 2) being clear about the limitations of and  potential uncertainties in the statistical results themselves so that the explanations you offer  will not mislead implementers and decision subjects. These are not easy tasks and will  require substantial forethou ght as you map out the content clarification aspect of your  delivery process.     To assist you in this, here is a non -exhaustive list of recommendations that you should  consider as you map out the execution of the technical content delivery component of the  responsible implementation of your AI project (This list will, for the sake of specificity,  assume the predictive risk assessment example):     • Each explanation should be presented in plain, non -technical language and in an  optimally understandable way  so tha t the results provided can enable the affordance of  better judgment  on the part of implementers and optimal understanding on the part of  decision subjects . On the implementer’s side, t he primary goal of the  explanation should  be to support the  user’s ability to offer solid, coherent, and reaso nable justifications of  their determinations of decision outcomes. On the decision subject’s side, the primary  goal of the explanation should be to make maximally comprehensible the rationale  behind the algorithmic component of the decision process, so that the decision subject  can undertake a properly informed critical evaluation of the decision outcome as a whole.     • Each explanation should present its results as facts or evidence in as sparse but complete  and sound a manner as possible with a clear indication of what components in the  explanation are operating as premises, what components are operating as conclusions,  and what the inferential rationale is that is connecting the premises to the conc lusions.  Each explanation should therefore make explicit the rational criteria for its determination  whether this be, for example, global inferences drawn from the population -based  reasoning of a demographic analysis or more locally or instance -based infer ences drawn  from the indication of feature significance by a proxy model.  In all cases, the optimisation  criteria of the operative algorithmic system should be specified, made explicit, and  connected to the logic and rationale of the decision.     • Each explan ation should make available the records and activity -monitoring results that  the design and development processes of your AI project yielded. Building this link  between the process transparency dimension of your project and its outcome  transparency will he lp to make its result, as a whole, more sufficiently interpretable. This 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  65 can be done by simply linking or including the public -facing component of the process log  of your PBG Framework.     • Each explanation provided to an implementer should come with a standa rd  Implementation Disclaimer  that may read as follows:                                    • Each explanation should specify and make explicit its governing performance metrics  together with the acceptability criteria used to select those metrics and any standard  benchmarks followed in establishing that criteria. Where appropriate and possible, fu ller  information about model validation measurement (including confusion matrix and ROC curve  results) and any external validation results should be made available.      • Each explanation should provide confirmatory information that the formal fairness criter ia  specified in your project’s Fairness Policy Statement has been met.     • Each explanation should include clear representations of confidence intervals and error bars.  These certainty estimates should make as quantitatively explicit as possible the confidence  range of specific predictions, so that users and decision subjects can more fully understand  their reliability and the levels of uncertainty surrounding them.     • When an explanation offers categorically ordered scores (for instance, risk scores on  a scale  of 1 to 10), that explanation must also explicitly indicate the actual raw numerical  probabilities for the labels (predicted outcomes) that have been placed into those categories.  This will help your delivery process avoid producing confusion abou t the relative magnitudes  of the categorical groupings under which the various scores fall. Information should also be  provided about the relative distances  between the risk scores of specific cases  if the risk  categories under  which they are placed are  unevenly distributed . It may be possible, for  example, for two cases, which fall under the same  high risk category (say, 9) to be farther  apart in terms of the actual values of the ir risk probabilities  than two other cases  in two  different categories (say 1 and 4). This may be misleading to the user.    Implementation Disclaimer :    These results are intended to assist you  in making an evidence -based judgment.  They are meant neither to replace your reasoned deliberations nor to constitute  the sole e videntiary basis of your judgement. These results are also derived from  statistical analysis. This means (1) that there are unavoidable possibilities of  error and uncertainty in their results, which are specified in the performance  measures and confidence intervals provided and (2) that these results are based  on population -level data that do not refer specifically to the actual  circumstances and abilities of the individual subject of their prediction. The  inferences you draw directly from them will therefo re be based on statistical  generalisation not on an understanding of the life context or concrete potential  of the individual person, who will be impacted by your decision.   
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  66 • Each explanation should, where possible, include a counterfactual explanatory tool, so that  implementers and affected individuals have the  opportunity to gain a better contrastive  understanding of the logic of t he outcome and its alternative possibilities.         Social  component of responsible implementation:  We have no w established the first step in  the delivery of a responsible implementation process: m aking clear the rationale behind the  technical content of an  algorithmic model’s statistical results and determining how best to  convey and communicate it so that these results may be appropriately treated as decision  supporting and clarifying reasons.  This leaves us with a second related task of content  clarifica tion, which is only implicit in the first step but must be made explicit and treated  reflectively in a second.     Beyond translating statistically expressed results into humanly significant reasons, you will  have to make sure that their socially meaningful c ontent  is clarified by implementers, so that  they are able to thoughtfully apply these results to the real human lives they impact  in terms  of the specific  societal and individual  context s in which those  lives are situated .     This will involve explicitly translat ing that model ’s technical machinery —its input and output  variables, parameters, and functional rationale —back  into the everyday language of the  humanly relevant meanings, categories, and relationships that informed the formulation of  its purpose, objectives, and intended elements of design in the first place. It will also involve  training and preparing implementers to intentionally assist in carrying out this translation in  each particular case, so that due regard for the dignity of deci sion subjects can be supported  by the interpretive charity, reasonableness, empathy, and context -specificity of the  determination of the outcomes that affect them.     Only through this re -translation will the internals, mechanisms, and output of the model  become useably interpretable  by implementers: Only then will they be able to apply input  features of relevance to the specific situations and attributes of decision subjects. Only then  will they be able to critically assess the manner of inference -making tha t led to its conclusion.  And only then will they be able to adequately weigh the normative considerations (such as  prioritising public interest or safeguarding individual well -being) that factored into the  system’s original objectives.     Having clarified t he socially meaningful content of the model’s results, the implementer will  be able to more readily apply its evidentiary contribution to a more holistic and wide -angled  consideration of the particular circumstances of the decision subject while, at the sa me time,  weighing these circumstances against the greater purpose of the algorithmically assisted  assessment. It is important to note here that the understanding enabled by the clarification  of the social context and stakes of an algorithmically supported decision -making process goes  hand -in-glove with fuller considerations of the moral justifiability of the outcome of that  process.     A good starting point for considering how to integrate this clarification of the socially  meaningful content of an algorithmi c model’s output into your map of the delivery process is  to consider what you might think of as your AI project’s content lifecycle .   
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  67 The content lifecycle : The  output of an algorithmic system does not begin and end with the  computation. Rather, it begins with the very human purposes, ideas, and initiatives that lay  behind the conceptualisation and design of that system. Creating technology is a shared  public act ivity, and it is animated by human objectives and beliefs. An algorithmic system is  brought into the world as the result of this collective enterprise of ingenuity, intention,  action, and collaboration.      Human choices and values  therefore  punctuate the d esign and implementation of AI  systems. These choices and values are inscribed in algorithmic models :    • At the very inception of an AI project, human choices and values come into play when we  formulate the goals and objectives to be achieved by our algorith mic technologies. They  come into play when we define the optimal outcome of our use of such technologies and  when we translate these goals and objectives into target variables and their measurable  proxies.     • Human choices and values come into play when deci sions are made about the sufficiency,  fit-for-purpose, representativeness, relevance, and appropriateness of the data sampled.  They come into play in how we curate our data —in how we label, organise, and annotate  them.     • Such choices and values operate as w ell when we make decisions about how we craft a  feature space —how we select or omit and aggregate or segregate attributes.  Determinations of what is relevant, reasonable, desirable, or undesirable will factor into  what kinds of inputs we are going to inclu de in the processing and how we are going to  group and separate them.     • Moreover, the data points themselves are imbued with residua of human choices and  values. They carry forward historical patterns of social and cultural activity that may  contain configu rations of discrimination, inequality, and marginalisation —configurations  that must be thoughtfully and reflectively considered by implementers as they  incorporate the analytics into their reasoned determinations.          Whereas all of these human choices and values are translated in to the algorithmic systems  we build, the responsible implementation of these systems requires that they be translated  out. The rationale and logic behind an algorithmic model’s output can be properly  understood as it affects th e real existence of a decision subject only when we transform its  variables, parameters, and analytical structures back into the human currency of values,  choices, and norms that shaped the construction of its purpose, its intended design, and its  optimisa tion logic from the start.     It is only in virtue of this re-translation that an algorithmically supported outcome can afford  stakeholders the degree of deliberation, dialogue, assessment, and mutual understanding  that is necessary to make it fully compreh ensible and justifiable to them. And, it is likewise  only in virtue of this re -translation that the implementation process itself can, at once, secure  end-to-end accountability and give due regard to the SUM values.     
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  68 The content lifecycle of algorithmic systems therefore has three phases: (1) The translation in   of human purposes, values, and choices during the design process; (2) The digital processing  of the quantified/mechanised proxies of these purposes, values, and choices in the statistical  frame; (3 ) The translation out  of the purposes, values, and choices in clarifying the socially  meaningful content of the result as it affects the life of the decision subject through the  implementation process. Here is a visualisation of these three phases of the c ontent lifecycle:         The translation r ule: A beneficial result of framing the implementation process in terms of the  content lifecycle is that it gives  us a clear  and context -sensitive measure by which to identify  the explanatory needs of any given AI application.  We can think of this measurement as the  translation rule . It states that:     What is translated in  to an  algorithmic system with regard to  the human choices and  societal  values that determine its  content and purpose  is directly proportional to w hat, in terms of the  explanatory needs of clarification and justification, must be translated out .     The translation rule organically makes two distinctions that have great bearing on the  delivery process for responsible implementation. First, it divides the question of what needs  explaining into two parts: (1) issues of socially meaningful content in nee d of clarification  (i.e., the explanatory need that comes from the transl ation  in to the AI model of the  categories, meanings, and relations that originate in social practices,  beliefs, and intentions)  (2) issues of normative rightness in need of justi fication (i.e. the explanatory need that comes  from translation in to the AI model of choices and considerations that have bearing on its  ethical permissibility, discriminatory non -harm, and public trustworthiness). These two parts  line up with what we have above  called  interpretable  AI and justifiable AI  respectively , and  what we have also identified as  tasks 2 and 3  of delivering transparent AI .    Secondly, the translation rule divides the two  dimensions of translation (translation in and  translation out) into aspects of intention -in-design  and intention -in-application . Translating in   
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  69 has to do with intention -in-design . It involves an active awareness of the human purposes,  objectives, and inte ntions that factor into the construction of AI systems. Translating out, on  the other hand, has directly to do with intention -in-application , or put differently, the  intentional dimension of the implementation of an AI system by a user in a specific context  and with direct consequences for a subject affected by its outcome.      In human beings, intention -in-design and intention -in-application a re united in intelligent  action , and it is precisely this unity that enables people to reciprocally hold each other  accountable for the consequences of what they say and what they do. By contrast, in artificial  intelligence systems, which fulfil surrogate cognitive functions in society but are themselves  neither intentional nor accountable, design and application are divided. In these systems,  intention -in-design and intention -in-application are and must remain punctuation points of  human involvement and re sponsibility  that manifest on either side of the vacant mechanisms  of data processing. This is why translation is so important, and this is why enabling the  implementer’s capacity to intentionally translate out the social and normative content  of the  model ’s results is such a critical element of the responsible delivery of your AI project.     It might  be helpful to think more concretely about the translation rule by considering it in  action. Let’s compare two hypothetical examples: (1) a use case about an ear ly cancer  detection system in radiomics (a machine learning  application  that uses high throughput  computing to identify  features of pathology that are undetectable to the trained radiological  eye); and (2) a use case about a predictive risk assessment appl ication that supports decision making in child social care.     In the radiomics case, the translating in  dimension  involves minimal social content: the  clinical goal inscribed in the model’s objective is that of lesion detection and the features of  relevanc e are largely voxels extracted from PET and CT scanner images. However, the  normative aspect of translating in  is, in this case, significant. Ethical considerations about  looking after patient wellbeing and clinical safety are paramount and wider justice c oncerns  about improving healthcare for all and health equity factor in as well.     The explanatory needs of the physician/implementer receiving clinical decision support and  of the clinical decision subject will thus lean less heavily on the dimension of th e clarification  of socially meaningful content than it will on the normative dimension of justifying the safety  of the system, the priority of the patient’s wellbeing, and the issues of improved delivery and  equitable access. The technical content of the d ecision support may be crucial here (Issues  surrounding the reproducibility of the results and the robustness of the system may, in fact,  be of great concern in the assessment of the validity of the outcome.), but the translating out   component of the imple mentation remains directly proportional to the minimal social  content and  to the substantial ethical concerns and objectives that were translated in  and  that thus inform the explanatory  and justificatory  needs of the result in general.          The explanat ory demands in the child social care risk assessment use case are entirely  different. The social content of the translating in  dimension is intricate, multi -layered, and  extensive. The chosen target variable may be child safety or the prevention of severe  mistreatment and the measurable proxy, home removal of at -risk children within a certain  timeframe. Selected features that are  deemed relevant may include the age of the at -risk 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  70 children, public health records, previous referrals, family history of violent crime, welfare  records, juvenile criminal records, demographic information, and mental health records.  Complex socioeconomic and cultural formations  may additionally influence the  representativeness and quality of the dataset as well as the substance of the data itself.     The normative aspect of translating in  here is also subtle and complicated. Ethical  considerations about prot ecting the welfare of children at risk are combined with concerns  that parents and guardians be treated fairly and without discrimination. Objectives of  providing evidence -based decision support are also driven by hopes that accurate results and  well-reaso ned determinations will preserve the integrity and sanctity of familial relations  where just, safe, and appropriate. Other goals and purposes may be at play as well such as  making an overburdened system of service provision more efficient or accelerating r eal-time  decision -making without harming the quality of the decisions themselves.       In this case of predictive risk assessment, the translating out  burdens of the frontline social  worker are immense both in terms of clarifying content and in terms of mor al justification. If,  for example, analytical results yielding a high risk score were based on the relative feature  importance of demographic information, welfare records, mental health records, and  criminal history, the implementer would have to scrutinis e the particular decision subject’s  situation, so that the socially meaningful content of these factors could be clarified in terms  of the living context, relevant relationships, and behavioural patterns of the stakeholders  directly affected. Only then cou ld the features of relevance be thoroughly and deliberatively  assessed.     The effective interpretability of the model’s result would, in this case, heavily depend on the  implementer’s ability to apply domain -knowledge in order to reconstruct the meaningful   social formations, intentions, and relationships that constituted the concrete form of life in  which the predictive risk modelling applies. The implementer’s well -reasoned decision here  would involve a careful weighing of this socially clarified content a gainst the wider predictive  patterns in the data distribution yielded by the model’s results —patterns that may have  otherwise gone unnoticed.       Such a weighing process would, in turn, be informed by the normative -explanatory need to  translate out  the mor ally implicating choices, concerns, and objectives that influenced and  informed the predictive risk assessment model’s development in the first place. Again, the  interpretive burden of the frontline social worker would be immense here. First, this  implemen ter would have to deliberate with a critically informed awareness of the legacies of  discrimination and inequity that tend to feed forward in the kinds of evidentiary sources  drawn upon by the analytics. Such an active reflexivity is crucial for retaining the punctuating  role of human involvement and responsibility in these sensitive and high -stakes  environments.     Just as importantly, the frontline social worker would have to evaluate the real impact of  ethical objectives at the point of delivery. Not only  would the results of the analytics have to  be aligned with the ethical concerns and purposes that fostered the construction of the  model, this implementer would have to reflectively align their  own potentially diverging  ethical point of view both with tho se results and with those objectives. This normative 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  71 triangulation  between the original intention -in-design, the implementer’s intention -inapplication, and the content clarification of the AI system’s results is, in fact, a crucial  safeguard to the delive ry of justifiable AI. It again enables a reanimation of moral  involvement and responsibility at the most critical juncture of the content lifecycle.         Step 3 : Build an ethical implementation platform:      (1) Train ethical implementation . The continuous challenges of translation, content  clarification, and normative explanation should inform how you set up your implement ation  training  to achieve optimal outcome transparency. In addition to the necessary training to  prevent implementation biases in the users of your AI system  (discussed above), you shoul d  prepare and train the implementers to be stewards of interpretable and justifiable AI. This  entails that they be able to:     o Rationally evaluate and crit ically assess the logic and rationale behind the outputs of  the AI systems;     o Convey and communicate their algorithmically assisted decisions to the individuals  affected by them in plain language. This includes e xplain ing to them  in an everyday,  non-technic al, and accessi ble way how and why the decision -supporting  model  performed the way it did in a specific context  and how that result factored into the final  outcome of the implementation ;    o Apply the conclusions reached by the AI model to a  more  focused cons ideration of the  particular social circumstances and life context of the decision subject  and other  affected parties;     o Treat the inferences drawn from the results of the model’s computation as evidentiary  contributions to a broader, more rounded , and coherent understanding of the  individual situation s of the decision subject and other affected parties ;    o Weigh the interpret ive understanding gained by integrating the model’ s insights into  this rounded picture of the life context of the decision subject against the greater   purpose and societal objective of the algorithmically assisted assessment ;    o Justify the ethical permissib ility, the discriminatory non -harm, and the pu blic  trustworthiness both of the AI system’s  outcome and of the processes behind its design  and use      (2) Make your implementation platform a relevant part and  capstone of the sustainability track  of your projec t. An important element of gauging the impacts of your AI technology on the  individuals and communities it touches is having access to the frontlines of its potentially  transformative and long -term effects. Your implementation platform should assist you in   gaining this access by being a two-way medium  of application and communication . It should  both enable you to sustainably achieve the objectives and goals you set for your project  through responsible implementation, but it should also be a sounding board a s well as a site  for feedback and cooperative sense -checking about the real -life effects of your system’s use. 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  72 Your implementation platform should be dialogically and collaboratively connected to the  stakeholders it effects. It should be bound to the commu nities it serves as part of a shared  project to advance their immediate and long -run wellbeing.      (3) Provide a model sheet to impleme nters and establish protocols for  implementation  reporting. As part of the roll -out of your AI project, you should prepare a summary /model  sheet for implementers, which includes summation information about the system’s technical  specifications and all of the relevant details indicated above in the section on substance of t he  technical content to be delivered . This should include relevant information about performance  metrics, formal fairness criteria and validation, the implementation disclaimer, links or  summaries to the relevant information from the process logs of your P BG Framework,  and  links or summary information from th e Stakeholder Impact Assessment.       You should also set up protocols for implementation reporting that are proportional to the  potential impacts and risks of the system’s use.         (4) Foster outcome und erstanding through dialogue. Perhaps the single most important  aspect of building a platform for ethical implementation is the awareness that the realisation  of interpretable and justifiable AI is a dialogical and collaborative effort. Because all types of   explanation are mediated by language, each and every explanatory effort is a participatory  enterprise where understanding can be reached only through acts of communication. The  interpretability and justifiability of AI systems depend on this shared human capacity to give  and ask for reasons in the ends of reaching mutual understanding. Implementers and  decision subjects are,  in this respect,  first and foremost participants in an explanatory  dialogue, and the success of their exchange will hinge both on a r eciprocal readiness take the  other’s perspective and on a willingness to enlarge their respective mental models in  accordance with new, communicatively achieved, insights and understandings.     For these reasons, your implementation platform should encourage  open, mutually  respectful, sincere, and well -informed dialogue. Reasons from all affected voices must be  heard and considered as demands for explanation arise, and manners of response and  expression should remain clear, straightforward, and optimally acce ssible. Deliberations that  have been inclusive, unfettered, and impartial tend to generate new ideas and insights as  well as better and more inferentially sound conclusions, so approaching the interpretability  and justifiability of your AI project in this manner will not only advance its responsible  implementation, it will likely encourage further improvements in its design, delivery, and  performance.                    
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  73   Conclusion :    In 1936, a 23 -year -old mathematician from Maida Vale named Alan Turing sat down with pencil and  paper. Using just the image of a linear tape  divided evenly into squares, a list of symbols, and a few  basic rules, he drew a sketch to show the step -by-step process of how a human being can carry out  any calculation, from the simplest oper ation of arithmetic to the most complex nonlinear differential  equation.     Turing’s remarkable invention (now known simply as the Turing machine) solved the perplexing and  age-old mathematical question of what an effective calculation is —the question of how  to define an  algorithm . Not only did Turing show what it means to compute a number by showing how human s  do it , he created, in the process, the idea behind the modern general purpose computer. Turing’s  astonishingly humble innovation ushered in the digita l age.       Just over eight decades later, a s we step forward together into the open horizo ns of a rapidly  evolving  digital future , it is difficult to image that what started as a thought experiment in a small  room at Kings College, Cambridge has now become  such a humanly defining force. We live in an  increasingly dynamic and integrated computational reality where connected devices containing  countless sensors and actuators intermingle with omnipresent algorithmic systems and cloud  computing platforms.     With the rise of the Internet of Things, edge computing,  and the expanding  smart  automation of  infrastructure, industry , and the workplace , AI systems are progressively more coming to compri se  the cyber -physical frame and fabric of our networke d society. For better or worse, a rtificial  intelligence is not simply becoming a general purpose technology (like steam power or electrici ty). I t  is, more essentially, becoming a gatekeeper technology that uniquely holds the ke y both to the  potential for t he exponential advancement of human wellbeing and  to possibilities for the  emergence of significant risks  for society’s future . It is, as yet,  humankind  that must ultimately  choose which direction the key will turn .    This choice leaves difficult questions in the lap of the moral agency of the present:  What shape will  the data -driven  society of tomorro w take? How will the values and motivations that are currently  driving the gath ering energies of technological advancement  in artificial intelligence  come  both  to  influence that future society’s ways  of life  and to  transform the identities  of its warm -blooded   subjects?      This guide on und erstanding AI ethics and safety  has offered you one way to move forward  in  answering these questions . In a significa nt sense, it has attempted to prepare you to take Turing’s  lead: to see the design and implementation  of algorithmic models as an eminently human activity — an activity guided by our purposes and values, an activity for which, each of us, who  is involved in the  development and deployment of AI system s, is morally and socially responsible.      This starting point in human action and intention is a crucial underpinning of responsible innovation.  For, i t is only when we prioritis e considerations of the ethical purposes and value s behind the  trajectories of our technolog ical advancement, that we, as  vested  societal stakeholders , will be able  to take the reins of innovatio n and  to steer the course of our algorithmic  creations  in accordance  with a shared vi sion of what a  better human  future  should  look like . 
                                                                             Understanding Artificial Intelligence Ethics and Safety  74   Acknowledgments:     Writing this guide would simply not have been possible without the hard work, dedication, and  insight of so many interlocutors both within The Alan Turing Institute  and through the meaningful  partnerships th at the Turing’s Public P olicy Programme has formed with stakeholders from across  the UK Government.     To take the latter group first, the Office for Artificial Intelligence (OAI) and the Government Digital  Service (GDS )’s ke en vision and their commitment to responsible AI innovation have been an  enabling condition of the development of this work. In particular, the patience and incisiveness of  OAI’s Sebastien Krier and Jacob Beswick, and GDS’ Bethan Charnley have been instrum ental in  bringing the project to its completion.      I am also incredibly grateful for the impact that our interactions with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ)’s  Data Science Hub has had on developing the framing for this guide. Input from the MoJ’s Megan  Whewell , Philip Howard, Jonathan Roberts, Olivia Lewis, Ross Wyatt, and from its Data Science  Innovation Board have left a significant mark on the research.     Last, but not least, our ongoing partnership with the Information Commissioner’s Office on Project  ExplAIn—and, in particular, with ICO colleagues Carl Wiper and Alex Hubbard —has been a key  contributor to this guide’s focus on fairness, transparency, and accountability. Project Expl AIn aims  to provide practical guidance for organisations on explaining AI supp orted decisions to the subjects  of those decisions. Taking inspiration from our work on Project Expl AIn and from the input gathered  over the course of the two citizens’ juries we held in Manchester and Coventry , the current guide  emphasises the importance of communication and attempts to build out a vision of human -centred  and context -sensitive implementation.      As the Ethics Fellow within the Public Policy Programme at t he Turing, I have benefited  tremendously from being surrounded by an immensely talented group  of thinkers  and doers , whose  commitment to making the connected world a better place through interdisciplinary research and  advisory intervention  is an inspiration  every day. Programme Director, Helen Margetts , and Deputy  Director,  Cosmina Dor obantu , have  been  crucial  and inimitable  supports of this pr oject from its  inception as has  my small but brilliant team of researchers, Josh Cowls and Christina Hitrova.  My  involvement with the Turing’s Data Ethics Group has also been a tremend ous source of insight and  inspiration for this project. Given the ambitious  deadlines that accompanied this guide’s final stages  of production, heroic efforts to review its contents as a whole or in parts were made by Florian  Ostmann, Michael Veale,  David Watson,  Mark Briers, Evelina Gabsova, Alexander Harris, and Anna  FitzMaurice.
