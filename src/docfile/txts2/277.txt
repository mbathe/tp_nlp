BRIEFING        EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service   Author: Tambiama Madiega   Members' Research Service  PE 640.163 –  September 2019    EN EU guidelines on ethics   in artificial intelligence:   Context and implementation   SUMMARY   The discussion around a rtificial intelligence (AI) technologies and their impact on society is  increasingly  focus ed on the question  of whether AI should be regulated . Following the call from the   European Parliament to update and complement the existing Union legal framework with guiding  ethical principles, the EU has c arved  out a ' human -centric ' approach to AI that is respectful of  European values and principles . As part of this approach, the EU published its guidelines on ethics  in AI in April 2019,  and European Commission President -elect , Ursula von der Leyen, has announced  that the Commission will soon put forward further legislati ve proposals  for a coordinated European  approach to the human and ethical implications of AI .  Against this background, this paper aims to shed  some light on the ethical rules that are now   recommended  when designing, devel oping, deploying, implementing or using AI products  and  services in the EU. Moreover, it identifies s ome implementation challenges and presents possible  further EU action ranging from soft law guidance to standardisation to legislation in the field of  ethic s and AI . There are calls for clarifying the EU guidelines, fostering the adoption of ethical  standards and adopting legally binding instruments to , inter alia , set common rules on transparency   and  common requirements fo r fundamental rights impact assessments,  and to provide an adequate  legal framework for face recognition technology.  Finally, the paper gives a n overview of the main  ethical frameworks for AI under development  outside the EU (e.g. in the  United States and  China ).     In this Briefing   • EU human -centric approach to artificial  intelligence   • Key ethical requirements   • Implementation challenges   • Possible further EU action   • International context   • Outlook      
EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service   2 EU human- centric approach to a rtificial intelligence   Background   Artificial intell igence  (AI) commonly refers to  a combination of : machine learning  techniques  used  for searching and analysing large volumes of data ; robotics  dealing with the conception, design,  manufacture and operation of programmable machines ; and algorithms and automated decision making systems  (ADMS)  able to predict human and machine behaviour and to make au tonomous  decision s.1 AI technologies can be extremely beneficial  from an  economic and social  point of  view  and are alread y being used in areas such as healthcare  (for instance, to find  effective   treatments for cancer ) and transport ( for instance, to predict traffic conditions  and guide  autonomous vehicles) , or to efficiently manage energy  and water consumption. AI increasingly  affec ts our daily li ves, and its potential range of application  is so broad that it is sometimes referred  to as the fourth industrial revolution .2  However, while most  studies concur that AI brings many  benefits , they also highlight a  number of ethical,  legal and  economic concerns, relat ing primarily  to the risks facing  human rights and f undamental freedoms . For instance, AI poses  risks to the right to personal data protection  and priva cy, and  equally so a risk of discrimination when algorithm s are used for  purposes such as to profile people or to resolve situations in  criminal justice.3 There are also some concerns about the impact  of AI technologies and robotics on the labour market (e.g. jobs   being destroyed by automation) . Furthermore, there are calls to  assess the impact of algorithms and automated decision making systems (ADMS) in the context of  defective products  (safety and liability), digital currency  (block chain ),  disinformation -spreading (fake news ) and the potential military  application  of algorithms (autonomous weapons systems and  cybersecurity ). Finally, the question of how to develop  ethical  princip les in algorithms and AI design has also been raised.4  EU approach   Policy -makers across the world are looking at  ways to tackle the risks associated with the  development of AI . That said , the EU  can be considered a front -runner with regard to establishing a  framework on ethical rules for AI .  Leading the EU -level debate, the Eur opean Parliament  called on the European Commission to  assess the impact of AI , and made wide -ranging recommendations on civil law rules on robotics  in  January 2017. The Parliament  drew up a code of ethic s for robotics engineers  and asked t he  Commission to consider the creation of a European a gency for robotics and AI , tasked with  provid ing the technical, ethical and regulatory expertise nee ded in an A I-driven environment .5  Against this background, in 2018 the Commission  adopted  a communication  to promote the  development of AI  in Europe , and in 2019 it published a coordinated plan  on AI – endorsed  by t he  Council of the European Union  – to coordinat e the EU Member States ' national AI strategies.6  Building on this groundwork , in April 2019 the Commission published a set of non -binding  Ethics  guidelines for trus tworthy AI. Prepared by  the Commission's  High -Level Expert Grou p on AI ,  composed of 52 independent  experts , this document aims to offer guidance on how  to foster and  secur e the development of ethical AI  systems in the EU .  A recent  report  by  Algorit hmwatch – a not -for-profit  organisation promoting  more  transp arency in the use of  algorithms – lists examples of  ADMS  already in use  in the EU . AI  applications are wide -ranging.  For instance, the Slovenia n  Ministry of Finance uses a  machine -learning system to  detect tax evasion  and tax fraud.  In Belgium, the police are using a  predictive algorithm  to predict  car robberies . In Poland, this  technology is used to profile  unemployed people and decide  upon the type of assistance   appropriate for them . 
EU guidelines on ethics in artificial intelligence: Context and implementation   3 Notion of h uman -centric AI   The core principle  of the  EU guidelines is that the EU must develop a 'human -centric' approach   to AI  that is respectful of European values and principles .  The human-centric approach to AI strives to ensure that human values are central to the way  in which AI systems are developed, deployed, used and monitored, by ensuring respect for  fundamental rights, including those set out in the Treaties of the European Union and Charter  of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, all of which are united by reference to a  common foundation roo ted in respect for human dignity, in which the human being enjoy s  a unique and inalienable moral status. This also entails consideration of the natural  environment and of other living beings that are part of the human ecosystem, as well as a  sustainable ap proach enabling the flourishing of future generations to come.7  While t his approach will unfold in the context o f the global race on AI, EU policy -makers have   adopted  a frame of analysis to differentiate the EU strategy  on AI from  the US strategy  (developed  mostly  through private -sector initiatives and self -regulation)  and the Chinese  strategy  (essentially  government -led and characterised by strong coordination of private and public  investment  into AI  technologies).8 In its approach , the EU seeks to remain faithful to its cultural preferences and its  higher standard of protection against the social risks posed by AI – in particular those affecting  privacy, data protection and discrimination rules – unlike other more lax jurisdictions .9  To that end, the EU ethics guidelines promote a trustworthy AI system  that is lawful (complying  with all applicable laws and regulations ), ethical  (ensuring adherence to ethic al principles and  values) and robus t (both from a technic al and social perspectiv e) in order to avoid causing  unintentional harm. Furthermore, the guidelines highlight that AI software and hardware systems   need to be human -centric , i.e. develop ed, deploy ed and use d in adhere nce to the key ethical  requirements  outlined below .  Key ethical  requirements   The guidelines are addressed to all AI stakeholders  designing, developing, deploying,  implementing, using or being affected by AI  in the EU , including companies, researchers, public  services, government agencies, institutions, civil society  organisations, individuals, workers and  consumers. Stakeholders ca n voluntarily  opt to use these guidelines  and follow the seven key  requirements  (see box  on the right ) when they are developing, deploying or using AI systems  in  the EU .  Human agency and oversight   Respect for human autonomy  and fundamental rights is at the  heart of the seven EU ethic al rules. The EU guidelines prescribe  three measures t o ensure this requirement is reflected in practice:   • to make sure that an AI system does not hamper EU  fundamental ri ghts, a fundamental rights impact  assessment  should be undertaken prior to its  development . Mechanisms should  be put in place  afterwards to allow for external feedback  on any potential  infringement of fundamental rights;   • human agency  should be ensured, i.e. users should be  able to understand and interact with AI systems to a  satisfactory degree. The right of end users not to be  subject to a decision based solely on automated  processing  (when this produces a legal effect on users or  significantly affect s them)  should  be enforced  in the EU ; The key EU requirements for  achieving trustworthy AI   • human agency and  oversight   • robustness and safety   • privacy and data  governance   • transparency   • diversity, non discrimination and fairness   • societal and environmental  well- being   • accountability  
EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service   4 • a machine cannot be in full control.  Therefore, t here should always be human  oversight . Human s should always have the possibility ultimately to  over -ride a  decision  made by a system. W hen design ing an AI product or service,  AI developers  should  consider the type of technical measures  that should be implemented to  ensure human oversight. For instance, they should  provide a stop button or a  procedure  to abort an operation to ensure human control.   Different types of fundamental rights impact assessments  are already being used in the EU. The European   Commission adopted a set of guidelines  on fundamental rights in impact assessments  and uses this  checklist to  identify  which fundamental rights could be affected by a proposal and to assess systematically  the impact of each envisaged policy option on these rights . The General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR)  provides for a regulatory framework that obliges data controller s to apply a Data Protection Impact  Assessment  (DPIA). The Government of Canada  has als o developed an Algorithmic Impact Assessment  that  assesses the potential imp act of an algorithm on citizens , with  a digital questionnaire evaluating  the potential  risk of a public -facing automated decision system. This  tool will be mandatory in Canada as of 2020.    Technical robustness and safety   Another essential requirement is to have secure and reliable systems and software. Trustworthy  AI requires algorithms to be secure, reliable and robust enough to deal with errors or inconsistencies  during all life -cycle phases of an AI system.  This requirement i s about ensuring cybersecurity . In  practice, all vulnerabilities  should  be taken into account when building algorithms.  This requires  testing AI system s to understand and  mitigate the risks of cyber -attacks a nd hacking . AI developers  should  put in place process es capable of assessing  the safety risks  involved , in case someone uses  the AI system they are building for harmful purposes . For instance,  if the system is compromised , it  should be possible for human c ontrol to take over and abort the system. To tackle this important  question, the EU applies a twofold approach : first, foster ing cooperation  between the AI  community and the security community , and s econd, reflecting  on how to modify the legal  framework governing liabilities in the EU , and to  go from a human -conduct -based liability  regime  to a more machine -based liability regime .  Privacy and data protection   In the EU , there is a lot of consideration  for data protection and privacy,  and all AI stakeholders must  comply with the General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR ) as a matter of principle. Furthermore,  the EU guidelines  on AI advise the AI community to ensure privacy and  personal data are protected ,  both when building  and when  running an AI system.  Citizens  should have full control over  their  own data , and their data should not be used to harm or discriminate against them.  In practice , this  means that AI systems should  be designed to guarantee privacy and data protection . To this end , AI  developers should apply design  techniques  such as data encryption and data anonymi sation .  More over , they should ensure the  quality of the data , i.e. avoid socially constructed biased,  inac curacies, errors and mistakes. To that end , data collection should not be biased a nd AI  developers should  put in place oversight mechanism s to control the quality of data sets .  Transparency   Transparency is paramount to ensur ing that AI is not biased. The AI guidelines  introduce a number  of measures  to ensure transparency in the AI industry. For instance, the data sets and processes that  are used in build ing AI system s should be documented and traceable . Also , AI systems should be  identifiable as such , and humans need to be aware  that they are interacting with an AI system .  Furthermore, AI systems and related human decisions are subject to the principle of  explain ability ,  according to which it should be possible for them to be understood and traced by humans . 
EU guidelines on ethics in artificial intelligence: Context and implementation   5 Diversity, non -discrimination and fairness   The guidelines focus  strongly on avoi ding unfair bias   when AI products and services are designed.  In  practice, AI developers should make sure that the  design of their algorithms is not biased  (e.g. by the  use of an inadequate data set) . Stakeholders  that may  be directly or indirectly affected by AI systems should  be consulted and involved in their development and  implementation . AI systems should be conceived with  consideration for  the whole range of human abilities,  skills and requirements, and ensu re accessibility  to  persons with disabilities .  Societ al and environmental wellbeing   AI systems should be used to enhance positive social  change and encourage sustainability and  environmental responsibility  of AI systems. In other  words, m easures securing the environmental  friendliness  of AI systems should be encouraged (e.g.  opting for a less harmful energy consumption  method) and the social impacts  of these systems (i.e.  on people 's physical and mental wellbeing) must be  monitored and considered. Moreover, the effects of  AI systems on  society and democrac y (including  regarding the electoral context) should be assessed.   Accountability   Mechanisms should be put in place to ensure responsibility and accountability for AI systems and  their outcomes.  Internal and external independent audit s should be put in place , especially for AI  systems whose use affects  fundamental rights. Reporting  of the AI systems' negative impacts  should be availabl e (including for whistle- blowers),  and impact assessment  tools should be used  to that end. In situations where the implementation of the key ethic al requirements creates conflict s  between them , decision s on the trade -off (i.e. the decision to choose to ful fil one ethic al  requirement over  another) should be evaluated  continuously. Accessible r edress  mechanisms  should be implemented.   Implementation challenges   While the implementing  phase of the guidelines has started, academics and stakeholders have  warned about a number of implementation challenges.  Need for clarification   The lack of clarity in the wording of the guidelines  has been criticised in many respect s. Thomas  Metzinger,  professor of theoretical philosophy at the University of Mainz and a member of the  Commission's expert group  on AI , warns  that the guidelines are short -sighted , deliberately vague   and do not tak e long -term risks into consideration. Furthermore,  he regrets that the 'red -lines'  (i.e. non -negotiable  ethical principles ) in the draft guidelines were deleted or watered down in the  final text.  Two of the se 'red lines'  had been that AI should never be used to build autonomous lethal  weapons  or social scoring systems . However, after prot racted negotiations, the final version of the Explainability – part I   The wide -ranging concept of e xplainability  is  about making explanations on an  algorithmic decision -making system   available.  The requirement for explainable AI   addresses the fact that complex machines and  algorithms often cannot provide insights into  their behavio ur and processes . This sometimes  results in a black box effect, i.e. a situation  where AI systems are cap able of produc ing  results , but the process by which the results are  produced and the reasons why the algorithm  makes specific decisions are not fully  understandable  by humans .   Explainability is therefore particularly  important  to ensure fairness  in the use of  algorithms and to identify potential bias in the  training data . This far-reaching requirement  means that an explanation should be available  on how AI systems influence and shape the  decision -making  process , on how they are  designed , and on what is the rationale for  deploying them. Explainability must address  both the technical processes of an AI system  and the related human decisions taken in  accordance with the EU guidelines.  
EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service   6 text instead referred to these issues as 'critical concerns' and  did not inclu de a clearly formulated  prohibition .  Another expert group member, Andrea Renda , together with the AI task force of the Centre for  European Policy Studies (CEPS), also published a report  highlighting some shortcomings of the draft  ethics guidelines. The report warn s in particular about the lack of a hierarchy of principles  that  would otherwise have allow ed EU institutions to tailor their policy approach .  Lack of r egulatory oversight   The EU ethics guidelines are non -binding . However,  concerns have been raised regarding the lack  of regulatory oversight to support the ir implementation. Non -profit research and advocacy  organisation AlgorithmWatch stresses  that most of the recommendations and  guidelines on AI  issued so far do n ot provide any oversight mechanisms  to ensure and enforce compliance with  voluntary commitments.  Without such mechanism s, however, there is little incentive to adhere to  these ethical principles . Others also warn  about the risk of the technology  industry financing and  shaping  the ethical debate about  algorithms and automated decision -making systems. The lack of  regulatory oversight raises the issue of the empowerment of public bodies or authorities to monitor  the enforcement of the EU ethical guidelines .  The AI Now Institute , argues  for expanding the powers of regulators  to oversee, audit, and monitor AI  technologies by domain. The institute favours a sector -speciﬁc approach that focuses on the application of AI  technologies within individual do mains (e.g. health, education, transport).   Need for c oordination of actions at EU and national levels   Several EU Member States have started work on establishing their own national framework s on  ethic s and AI  in parallel to the EU initiatives . Below is an outline of these moves , by country.   France   Dating from March 2018, the French AI s trategy  sets out as one of its core principles the requirement  that AI technologies must be explainable  to be socially acceptable. To that end, the government is  required to : put in place several policies in order to develop algorithm transparency and audits ;  include ethics in training for AI engineers a nd researchers ; carry out a discrimination impact  assessment (to encourage AI designers to consider the social implications of the algorithms they  produce); and ensure that the principle of human responsibility is applied (e.g. by setting  boundaries for th e use of predictive algorithms in the law enforcement context).  Furthermore, it is  proposed that a consultative ethics committee for digital technologies and AI  be set up for the  purpose of organi sing a public debate in this field.   Germany   Initially, t he ethic s-related  debate was essentially driven by sector- specific industry interests , and  resulted in the adoption in June 2017 of a set of ethical rules for automated and connected vehicular  traffic  by the Transport Ministry's E thics Commission . In November 2018, the national AI strategy   was launched, setting out a range of measures on ethics.  For instance, the document advocates  using an ' ethics by, in and for design ' approach  for all development stages and uses  of AI . It  pledges to promote research into n ovel ways for pseudonymising and anonymising data and for  differential privacy. Furthermore, t he federal government will review whether the German AIrelated legal framework covers all aspects related to algorithm -based and AI -based decisions,  services and  products and, if necessary, adapt it in order to make it possible to verify whether there  is any undue discrimination or bias.  The legislation governing the use of personal and non personal data for AI -based applications will be reviewed , and  the possibil ity to establish and/or  expand government agencies or privat e-sector auditing  institutions to  verify algorithmic decision making  process es will be examined.  
EU guidelines on ethics in artificial intelligence: Context and implementation   7 Finland   In August 2018,  the Ministr y of Economic Affairs issued a report  recommending to set up a  parliamentary monitoring group to promote the ethical value  base of AI more extensively in  society, and to monitor and evaluate pilots and technology development s associated with the  ethical aspects of artificial intelligence. This  group would be tasked with  the creation of rules and  the assessment of  practices in the context of defining responsibilities in situations where a machine  is taking decisions autonomousl y.  United Kingdom   The UK Committee on Standards in Public Life announced  in March 2 019 it was launching an inquiry   into the use of AI in public services, with  the aim of examining whether the rules  were sufficient to  ensure that high standards of conduct are upheld as technologically  assisted decisio n-making is  adopted more widely  across the public sector . In the UK , there is particular focus on the  risks of  biometrics in ongoing discussions. A 2019 report from the UK Biometr ics and Forensics Ethics  Group outlines some of the ethical issues raised by the use of live (real -time) face recognition  technology  (FRT) based on machine -learning techniques and recommends the development of an  adequate legal framework. Against this background, the House of Commons Science and  Technology Committee  has urge d the UK government to issue  a moratorium on the current use of  FRT and to prohibit further FRT trials until a proper legislative framework has been introduced , and  guidance on trial protocols and an oversight and evaluation system ha ve been established.   Risk of fragmentation . EU Me mber States are likely to enact some diverging national ethical rules on AI that  could fragment the EU landscape in this domain. Such fragmentation may hamper the emergence of pan European Al services. Therefore, coordinated actions at EU and national levels will be key to ensuring coherent  harmonisation of the EU ethic al guidelines and avoiding any discrepancies within the EU.   Possible further EU action  Following the publication of the EU guidelines on ethics in AI, t he Commission launched  a pilot  phase  in June 2019 and invited a ll stakeholders to  provide feedback on the practical   implement ation  of the key requirements by the end of 2019. To this end, c ompanies participating  in the pilot will report on their experience in implement ing the guidelines.  Based on the feedback  received, the High- Level Expert Group on AI will propose a revised version of the compliance  assessment list  to the Commission in early 2020.   Something crucial in this context is to reflect on the following question: to what  extent  will voluntary   ethical rules , driven by industry ’s pace and strategies , be sufficient to address the ethical issues  raised by AI development. There are calls for stronger intervention on the part of public authorities  to influence the development  and enforcement  of these rules . The European Commission   President -elect , Ursula von der Leyen , has announced  that she will put forward legislati ve  proposals  for a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of AI with in  her first 100 days in office. Policy -makers, a cademics and stakeholders have called for further action  to implement and complement the ethics guidelines , and equally to ensure a harmonised approach  and avoid fragment ation . Possible further action focusing on ethical issues ranges  from soft law  guidance , hard law legislation  and standardisation.10  Clarification of the guidelines   One of the main recommendations of the CEPS task force report on AI is to adopt some guidance   allowing to identify which applications or business models are potentially problematic  and which  should be prohibited because they are incompatible with EU core values and legislation.  The report   further stresses  that extensive explanations  should be provided to establish effective  fairness  standards  and that it is necessary to focus more extensively on setting up appropriate redress 
EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service   8 mechanisms for individuals .11 Another great chall enge is to clarify how to implement the  requirement of explainability  in a context where the complexity of AI algorithms can make it  difficult to provide a c lear explanation and justif ication for a decision made by a machine (i.e. black  box  effect ). Ensuring a  harmonised application of the guidelines throughout  the EU would require  spell ing out this concept  in more detail .  Explainability – part II   While AI sys tems can be made explainable, this may  result in a trade- off between cost and interpretability .12  In order to apply the guidelines consistently and efficiently, stakeholders would need additional  recommendations on key questions such as: i ) do they need to ensure explainability by design ; ii) can they  differentiate the level of transparency required when they face cases where AI supports decision -making  by humans which may raise fewer explainability issues than full y automated decision -maki ng systems ;13 and  iii) to what extent should intellectual property rights  and trade secret protection  be limited by the  implementation of the explainability requirement. In this regard, the AI Now Institute  argues  that AI  companies should waive trade secrecy and other legal claims that inhibit full auditing and understanding of  their software, because such trade secrecy contributes to the black box effect and makes it hard to assess bias,  contest decisions or remedy errors.   Standardisation   Standardi sation  is expected to play an essential role in driving AI market adoption. Standards can  influence the developmen t and deplo yment of particular AI systems through product certification ,  and  serve to disseminate best practices in AI as is the case in cybersecurity or environmental  sustainability .14 A number of standardisation organisations are working on AI technical s tandards ;  in parallel, ethical  AI standards  are also being developed.15  For instance, the joint technical committee of the  International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the  International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC)  is working on  developing standards to ensure  trustworthiness in AI  technology  from the outset. Expert working groups are  considering  how to technically achieve AI systems '  robustness, resiliency, reliability, accuracy, safety, security and  privacy. Another leading standardisation organisation, the  Insti tute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers  (IEEE)  publish ed in 2019 an ethical framework  setting out more than  100 ethical issues and recommendations to serve as a  reference for policy -makers , eng ineers , developers  and  companies deploying, selling  and using  AI systems. In  practice, the IEEE seeks to develop specific industry  standards and processes  – related to transparency,  accountability, and algorithmic bias  – for the certification  of  AI systems.16   Against this background, the  Commission ’s 2019 Rolling p lan for ICT standardisation  identifies three  main actions in relation to standard -setting i n AI, namely: i) f oster ing coordination of  standardisation efforts on AI in Europ e; ii) ensur ing coordination between standardisation efforts on  AI in Europe and other international standa rdisation efforts;  and iii) integrat ing the outcomes of the  High -Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence within the standardisation roadmaps.   However, l aunching a standardisation process raises many questions. Similar to technical standards,  ethical standards are voluntary measures . Standards can be made mandatory  or become a  condition for awarding procurement contracts17 so as to ensure that industry players implement  them. Some researchers  stress, however , that there are not sufficient grounds for the adoption of  public certification or mandatory stand ards on AI in Europe,  as the self -certification framework is AI ethical standards   An IEEE standard establishes a  process model by which engineers  and technologists can address  ethical consideration  throughout  the various stages of system  initiation, analysis and design of  new IT product s and systems.   Other standards address the  manner in which personal privacy   terms are offered and how they can  be read and agreed to by machines ,  or describe specific methodologies  (e.g. selection of data sets) to  address and eliminate bias  when  algorithms are created.  
EU guidelines on ethics in artificial intelligence: Context and implementation   9 evolving and it is too early to anticipate with enough certainty how the AI market will develop over  time.18 The fact that standards are vague  and certification enforcement and oversight  are  uncle ar (i.e. w ho perf orms the ethical certifications?) has been criticised too . One concern is that the  standardisation and certification bodies  are focus ed on enabling AI to become 'ethically' marketable   and  that existing market logic will control AI development .19 The risk of a race to the bottom in  regulatory oversight  because  AI development organisations may choose to locate in jurisdictions  that im pose more lax  rules for implementing ethical standards has also been pointed out.20  EU regulatory framew ork on AI   A number of proposals on AI legislation have been discussed ,21 including several  described below .  Legislation on t ransparency of decision -making systems   Transparency is paramount to ensur ing that  AI is not biased and AI systems  are explainable . There  are calls to legislate and make the transparency  requirement mandatory . For instance , the  Finnish national AI strategy  paper recommend s assessing  how ethic al obligation s could be imposed  on platforms  as is done in the GDPR. The paper stresses in particular that certain parts of  an  algorithm  developed and used by the platforms could be prohibited  if it distorts or restricts  competition without justification .22 The EU could build on existing legislative initiatives and research  on transparency conducted in recent years. In July 2019, the EU adopted the new   Regulation  (EU)  2019/1150  requiring p roviders of online intermediation services and online search  engines to implement a set of measures to ensure transparency and fairness in the contractual  relations they have with online businesses (e.g. online retailers, hotels and restaurants businesses,  app stores) that use such online platforms to sell and provide their services to customers in the EU.   The Commission is also carrying out an in -depth analysis on algorithmic transparency .  Against this background, a  2019  Parliament study  recommends the creation of a regulatory body  for algorithmic d ecision -making  tasked with defining i) criteria that can be used to differentiate  acceptable algorithmic decision -making systems  (that should be subject to an algorithmic  impact assessment) and systems that should be prohibited ; and ii) the obligations falling on  algorithmic decision -making system providers (such as the obligation to make their systems  auditable). New EU legislation could also address the responsibility for informing the persons  affected by such systems, while also clarify ing the explain ability requirements  and set ting  specific liability  and certifications regimes .23  Sector -specific legislation  in the health sector   It is arguably more important to ensure rigorous implementation of the ethical rules in specific  sector s, such as health care,  where human control over algorithms and decision -making systems is  paramount. Against this background, the  Finnish national AI strategy  proposes to formulate AI  ethics rules specific to the healthcare ecosystem . A 2018 study  by the University of Oxford stresses  the need to a nalyse the implementation of the GDPR in  the field of health research, and where  needed, amend laws or create more clarity through interpretation and guidance.   Legislation on face recogn ition technology   The use of  face recognition technology  (FRT)  is becoming widespread across Europe  and is giving  rise to growing concerns . FRT is considered as processing 'biometric data ' under the GDPR,  and is in  principl e subject to strict terms and conditions  of use . However, t echnology experts  disagree  on  whether the GDPR framework is robust enough to address all issues created by the growing use of  AI-based FRT, or whether ad ditional legislation will be necessary to ensure EU fundamental rights  are protected.24 Already, the adoption of national FRT legislation  is being discussed in some  Member States (see in particular the UK debate mentioned above).25 
EPRS | European Parliamentary Research Service   10 A number of legally bindin g instruments  could be adopted to translate ethical rules into hard law  and ma ke  them  mandatory for the most influential AI industry players in the EU.   International context   While the EU is clearly a front -runner in the debat e on the ethical and social implications of AI, other  government entities in the world are also looking at these issues.   United States   In the US, w hile a range of industry players have already developed some codes of conduct on ethics  and AI, there are calls fo r more government -led regulation . Collaborative industry groups,  such  as the Partnership on AI  (including Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook and Apple) , have pledged to  develop and share best practices , inclu ding on ethics . The Association for  Computing Machinery  (ACM) also published in 2018 a Code of Ethics and Professional  Conduct  to guide the ethical conduct  of computing professionals.  Furthermore, c ompanies are developing their own ethical guidelines.  For instance, Microsof t has its own AI advisory board  and Google has disclosed its AI principles , an  ethic s charter to guide the responsible development and use of AI in research and products.26  However, there is growing concern  that self -regulation w ill not be enough to tackle the ethical  challenges posed by the development of AI. In 2018 the AI Now Institute  issued a report  concluding  that internal governance structures in  most technology companies are failing to  ensure  accountability for AI systems. It argues therefore that government agencies need greater power to  oversee, audit and monitor  AI technologies, especially those involving face recognition.   China  In China, t here is growing interest  in setting up an ethical framework for the development of AI. In  2017, China released its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan  setting out long term strategic goals for AI developme nt in the country by 2030. One objective is to establish  regulatory and ethical frameworks  to ensure the healthy development of AI in China. China would  promote self -discipline of the AI industry and enterprises, and increase punishments for data abuse,  violations of personal privacy and unethical activities in this regard. The Artificial Intelligence  Industry Alliance, which bring s together Chinese tech firms and universities , released draft  guidelines  for self -regulation  in the field of A I in May 2019.27 These  call for imple menting principl es  of 'human -oriented ', 'secure/safe and controllable'  and ' transparent and explainable ' AI similar to  the ones enshrined i n the EU AI ethical guidelines. Furthermore, the New Generation AI Governance  Expert Committee , established by the Ministry of Scienc e and Technology , released in June 2019 a  document  outlining eight non -binding principles  to guide AI development in China. Th ese  principles largely mirror t he EU rules  on AI . For instance, AI development should conform to 'human  values, ethics, and morality '; 'should be based on the premise of safeguarding societal security and  respecting huma n rights';  should ' eliminate bias and discrimination in the process of data  acquisition, algorithm design, technology development, product R&D, and application';  and  should  'respect and protect personal privacy '.28  Other countries and organisations in the w orld   Canada  has already adopted a number of guiding principles  governing the use of AI in the  administration and public services . Public i nstitutions are required to  incorporate some  ethical  principles (including privacy and transparency concerns) in their application of AI .29 The 2018  Directive on Automated Decision -Making for Federal Institutions  outlines the responsibilities of  federal institutions and provides  rules to help them assess and mitigate the risks associated with  deploying  an automated decision system. Australia  is also well advanced. T he Office of the  Australian Info rmation Commissioner published a Guide to d ata analytics and the Australian p rivacy  principl es in 2018 and is working on a national ethics  framework  to address standards and codes o f 
EU guidelines on ethics in artificial intelligence: Context and implementation   11 conduct in the field of AI. Preparatory work for establishing an AI ethical framework is also ongoing  in India , New Zealand , Singapore , South Korea  and Japan .30 Some i nternational organisations  are engaging in setting  international rules in the field of ethic s and AI. In May 2019, the OEC D and  associated nations adopted a non -binding list of guidelines  for the development and use of AI.   The AlgorithmWatch AI Ethics Guidelines Global Inventory  lists all of the ethical frameworks and principles  being developed across the globe. Recent years have seen a flurry of initiatives  from companies, governments,  NGOs and research bodies to propose ethical rules on AI. The ethical principles laid down in other jurisdict ions  seem relatively similar to those of the EU (though less detailed) and are essentially of a self -regulat ory nature ,  even though there is growing demand for more government oversight.   Outlook   Policy -makers all over the globe are looking at how to tackle the risks associated with the  development of AI. In April 2019, t he EU published its guidelines on ethics in AI, bec oming a front runner in the setting up of a framework  for AI . Ethical rules  on AI , where such exist, are so far   essentially of a self -regulat ory nature , and  there is growing demand for more government  oversight. In the EU, there are str ong  calls for clarifying the EU guidelines, fostering the adoption of  ethical standards and adopting legally biding  instr ument s in order to, inter alia , set common rules  on transparency , set common requirements for fundamental rights impact assessments and  provide an adequate legal framework for face recognition technology.
