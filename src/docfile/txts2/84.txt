What does this report cover?
The report highlights trends and patterns that the CDEI has identified from producing its COVID-19 repository, which is a database for novel use-cases of artificial intelligence and data specifically being used to counter and mitigate the effects of COVID-19. It also details findings from a longitudinal survey, which it commissioned to understand UK public opinion towards the use of AI and data-driven technology in the UK’s COVID-19 response. The survey ran from June-December 2020 with a representative sample of over 12,000 people.
What are the key findings?

Public support for greater use of digital technology depends on trust in how it is governed. The single biggest predictor for supporting greater use of digital technology was an individual believing that ‘the right rules and regulations are in place’. This was more important than demographic factors such as age.
Trend analysis of the use of AI and data-driven technologies revealed that, aside from advancing vaccine research, AI did not play the outsized role many thought it would in relief efforts, in part due to a lack of access to data on COVID-19 to train algorithms. Instead, conventional data analysis, underpinned by new data sharing agreements, has made the biggest difference to the work of health services and public authorities.

What happens next?
For organisations and policymakers looking to realise the benefits of greater data use, it will be important to build data governance mechanisms that are worthy of citizens’ trust. The CDEI is committed to playing its part by developing governance approaches that the public can have confidence in.
