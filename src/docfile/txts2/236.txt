New Technologies Formation 3 Executive summary   Artificial intelligence and other emerging digital technologies, such as the Internet of Things or  distributed ledger technologies , have the  potential to transform our societies and economies for  the better. However, their rollout must come with sufficient safeguards , to minimise the risk of  harm  these technologies may cause, such as bodily injury or other harm . In the EU , product  safety regulations ensure this is the case. However, such regulations cannot completely exclude  the possibility of damage resulting from the operation of these technologies . If this happens ,  victims will seek compensation. Th ey typically do so on the basis of liability regimes under  private law, in particular tort law, possibly in combination with insurance. Only the strict liability of producers for defective products, which constitutes a small part of this kind of liability  regimes, is harmonised at EU level by the Product Liability Directive, while all other regimes   – apart from some exceptions in specific sectors or under special legislation – are regulated by  the Member Stat es themselves.   In its assessment of  existing liability regimes  in the wake of emerging digital technologies, the  New Technologies Formation of the Expert Group has concluded that the liability regimes in  force in the Member States ensure at least basic pro tection of victims whose damage is caused  by the operation of such new technologies. However, the specific characteristics of these technologies and their applications –  including complexity, modification through updates or self learning during operation, limited predictability, and vulnerability to cybersecurity threats –   may make it more difficult to offer these victims a claim for compensation in all cases where  this seems justified. It may also be the case that the allocation of liability is unfair or inefficient.  To rectify this, certain adjustments need to be made to EU and national liability regimes.   Below are listed the most important findings of this report on  how liability regimes should be  designed – and, where necessary, changed – in order to rise to the challenges emerging digital  technologies  bring with them.    A person operating a permissible technology that nevertheless carries an increased risk of harm to others, for example AI -driven robots in public spaces, should be subject to strict  liability for damage resulting from its operation.    In situations where a s ervice provider ensuring the necessary technical framework has a  higher degree of control than the owner or user of an actual product or service equipped with AI, this should be taken into account in determining  who primarily operates the technology.    A per son using a technology that does not pose an increased risk of harm to others should  still be required to abide by duties to properly select, operate, monitor and maintain the technology in use and – failing that – should be liable for breach of such dutie s if at  fault.    A person using a technology which has a certain degree of autonomy should not be less accountable for ensuing harm than if said harm had been caused by a human auxiliary.    Manufacturers of products  or digital content incorporating emerging di gital technology  should be liable for damage caused by defects in their products, even if the defect was caused 
Executive Summary   4 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  by changes made to the product under the producer ’s control after it had been placed on the  market.    For situations expos ing third parties to an increased risk of harm, compulsory liability insurance could give victims better access to compensation and protect potential tortfeasors  against the risk of liability.    Where a particular technology increases the difficulties of proving the existence of an  element of liability beyond what can be reasonably expected, victims should be entitled to facilitation of proof.   Emerging digital technologies should come with logging features , where appropriate in the  circumstances, and failure to log, or to provide re asonable access to logged data, should  result in a reversal of the burden of proof in order not be to the detriment of the victim.   The destruction of the victim ’s data should be regarded as damage , compensable under specific conditions.   It is not necessary  to give devices or autonomous systems  a legal personality , as the harm  these may cause can and should be attributable to existing persons or bodies . 
New Technologies Formation 5 Key Findings   [1] Digitalisation brings fundamental changes to our environments, some of which have an  impact on liability law. This affects, in particular, the   (a) complexity,   (b) opacity,   (c) openness,   (d) autonomy,   (e) predictability ,   (f) data- drivenness, and   (g) vulnerability    of emerging digital technologies.   [2] Each of these changes may be gradual in nature, but the dimension of gradual change, the  range and frequency of situations affected, and the combined effect, results in disruption.   [3] While existing rules on liability offer solutions with regard to the risks created by emerg-ing digital technologies, the outcomes may not always seem appropriate, given the failure  to achieve:   (a) a fair and efficient allocation of loss, in  particular because it could not be attributed  to those:   whose objectionable behaviour caused the damage; or who benefitted from the activity that caused the damage; or who were in control of the risk that materialised; or who were cheapest cost avoiders or cheapest takers of insurance. (b) a coherent and appropriate response of the legal system to threats to the interests of  individuals, in particular because victims of harm caused by the operation of emerging digital technologies receive less or  no compensation compared to victims in a  functionally equivalent situation involving human conduct and conventional technology;   (c) effective access to justice, in particular because litigation for victims becomes unduly  burdensome or expensive.   [4] It is therefore necessary to consider adaptations and amendments to existing liability regimes, bearing in mind that, given the diversity of emerging digital technologies and the  correspondingly diverse range of risks these may pose, it is impossible to come up with a  single solution suitable for the entire spectrum of risks.   [5] Comparable risks should be addressed by similar liability regimes, existing differences  among these should ideally be eliminated. This should also determine which losses are 
Key Findings   6 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  recoverable  to what extent.   [6] Fault liability (whether or not fault is presumed), as well as strict liability for risks and  for defective products, should continue to coexist. To the extent these overlap, thereby  offering the victim more than one basis to seek compensation against more than one person, the rules on multiple tortfeasors ([31]) govern.   [7] In some digital ecosystems, contractual liability or other compensation regimes will apply alongside or instead of tortious liability. This must be taken into account when determining to what extent the latter needs to be amended.   [8] For the purposes of liability, it is not necessary to give autonomous systems a legal personality   [9] Strict liability is an appropriate response to the risks posed by emerging digital technolo-gies, if, for example, they are operated in non- private environments and may typically  cause significant harm.   [10] Strict liability should lie with the person who is in control of the risk connected with the  operation of emerging digital technologies and who benefits from their operation (operator).  [11] If there are two or more operators, in particular   (a) the person primarily deciding on and benefitting from the use of the relevant technology (frontend operator) and   (b) the person continuously de fining the features of the relevant technology and providing essential and ongoing backend support (backend operator),  strict liability should lie with the one who has more control over the risks of the operation.   [12] Existing defences and statutory exceptions from strict liability may have to be reconsid-ered in the light of emerging digital technologies, in particular if these defences and exceptions are tailored primarily to traditional notions of control by humans.   [13] Strict liability of the prod ucer should play a key role in indemnifying damage caused by  defective products and their components, irrespective of whether they take a tangible or  a digital form.   [14] The producer should be strictly liable for defects in emerging digital technologies e ven if  said defects appear after the product was put into circulation, as long as the producer was still in control of updates to, or upgrades on, the technology. A development risk defence  should not apply.   [15] If it is proven that an emerging digital technology has caused harm, the burden of proving defect should be reversed if there are disproportionate difficulties or costs pertaining to  establishing the relevant level of safety or proving that this level of safety has not been  met. This is without p rejudice to the reversal of the burden of proof referred to in [22]  and [24].   [16] Operators of emerging digital technologies should have to comply with an adapted range  of duties of care, including with regard to  
Key Findings   New Technologies Formation  7 (a) choosing the right system for the righ t task and skills;   (b) monitoring the system; and   (c) maintaining the system.   [17] Producers, whether or not they incidentally also act as operators within the meaning of  [10], should have to:   (a) design, describe and market products in a way effectively e nabling operators to comply with the duties under [16]; and   (b) adequately monitor the product after putting it into circulation.   [18] If harm is caused by autonomous technology used in a way functionally equivalent to the employment of human auxiliaries, the operator’s liability for making use of the technology should correspond to the otherwise existing vicarious liability regime of a principal  for such auxiliaries.   [19] The benchmark for assessing performance by autonomous technology in the context of vicarious liability is primarily the one accepted for human auxiliaries. However, once  autonomous technology outperforms human auxiliaries, this will be determined by the performance of comparable available technology which the operator could be expected  to use, taking into account the operator’s duties of care ([16]).   [20] There should be a duty on producers to equip technology with means of recording infor-mation about the operation of the technology (logging by design), if such information is  typically esse ntial for establishing whether a risk of the technology materialised, and if  logging is appropriate and proportionate, taking into account, in particular, the technical feasibility and the costs of logging, the availability of alternative means of gathering such  information, the type and magnitude of the risks posed by the technology, and any adverse  implications logging may have on the rights of others.   [21] Logging must be done in accordance with otherwise applicable law, in particular data protection law  and the rules concerning the protection of trade secrets.   [22] The absence of logged information or failure to give the victim reasonable access to the information should trigger a rebuttable presumption that the condition of liability to be  proven by the  missing information is fulfilled.   [23] If and to the extent that, as a result of the presumption under [22], the operator were obliged to compensate the damage, the operator should have a recourse claim against the producer who failed to equip the technol ogy with logging facilities.   [24] Where the damage is of a kind that safety rules were meant to avoid, failure to comply with such safety rules, including rules on cybersecurity, should lead to a reversal of the  burden of proving   (a) causation, and/or   (b) fault, and/or   (c) the existence of a defect.  
Key Findings   8 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  [25] As a general rule, the victim should continue to be required to prove what caused her  harm.   [26] Without prejudice to the reversal of the burden of proof proposed in [22] and [24](a), the burden of proving causation may be alleviated in light of the challenges of emerging digital technologies if a balancing of the following factors warrants doing so:   (a) the likelihood that the technology at least contributed to the harm;   (b) the likelihood that the harm was  caused either by the technology or by some other  cause within the same sphere;   (c) the risk of a known defect within the technology, even though its actual causal impact is not self -evident;   (d) the degree of ex -post traceability and intelligibility of processes within the technology that may have contributed to the cause (informational asymmetry);   (e) the degree of ex -post accessibility and comprehensibility of data collected and generated by the technology   (f) the kind and degree of harm potentially and actually caused.   [27] If it is proven that an emerging digital technology caused harm, and liability therefor is  conditional upon a person’s intent or negligence, the burden of proving fault should be  reversed if disproportionate difficulties and costs of establishing the relevant standard of  care and of proving their violation justify it. This is without prejudice to the reversal of  the burden of proof proposed in [22] and [24](b).   [28] If a cause of harm is attributable to the victim, the reasons for hold ing another person  liable should apply correspondingly when determining if and to what extent the victim’s  claim for compensation may be reduced.   [29] Where two or more persons cooperate on a contractual or similar basis in the provision of different eleme nts of a commercial and technological unit, and where the victim can  demonstrate that at least one element has caused the damage in a way triggering liability but not which element, all potential tortfeasors should be jointly and severally liable vis à-vis the victim.   [30] In determining what counts as a commercial and technological unit within the meaning  of [29] regard is to be had to   (a) any joint or coordinated marketing of the different elements;   (b) the degree of their technical interdependency and interoperation; and   (c) the degree of specificity or exclusivity of their combination.   [31] Where more than one person is liable for the same damage, liability to the victim is usu-ally solidary (joint). Redress claims between tortfeasors should only be for identified  shares (several), unless some of them form a commercial and/ or technological unit ([29] [30]), in which case the members of this unit should be jointly and severally liable for  their cumulative share also to the tortfeasor seeking redress.  
Key Findings   New Technologies Formation  9 [32] Damage caused to data may lead to liability where   (a) liability arises from contract; or   (b) liability arises from interference with a property right in the medium on which the  data was stored or with another interest protected as a property right under the applicable law; or   (c) the damage was caused by conduct infringing criminal law or other legally binding rules whose purpose is to avoid such damage; or   (d) there was an intention to cause harm.   [33] The more frequent or severe potential harm resulting from emerging digital technology,  and the less likely the operator is able to indemnify victims individually, the more suitable  mandatory liability insurance for such risks may be.   [34] Compensation funds may be used to protect tort victims who are entitl ed to compensation  according to the applicable liability rules, but whose claims cannot be satisfied.  

New Technologies Formation 11 A. Introduction   I. Context   Artificial intelligence (AI) and other e merging digital technologies, 0F1 such as the Internet of  Things and of Services (IoT/  IoS), or distributed ledger technologies (DLT), have  extraordinary  potential to transform products, services and activities, procedures and practices, in a multitude  of eco nomic sectors and in relation to many aspects of societ y. Although some of these technologies 1F2 are not new, the ir increasing application to  a growing variety of purposes, and new  combinations of a range  of different emerging digital  technologies , opens up unprecedented  possibilities. All this comes with the promise of  making the world a safer, fairer, more productive, more convenient place, of  helping to fight illness, poverty, crime, discrimination and other  forms of injustice, and of  connect ing people wor ldwide . Although many of these promises are  expected to come true, new or enhanced potential  brings new risks  with it, or increases existing  ones. 2F3  Throughout history, l egal rules, concepts and principles have risen  to the challenges posed by  scientific, t echnical and,  more recently , technological progress. In the last few decades, the  adaptable principles of technological neutrality and functional equivalence  have catered for the  impact of digital technologies . These principles have served as the basis for the international  response to the advent and first stages of development  of the digital economy, and have largely  guided the legislative and regulatory initiatives on electronic commerce (and information society services) adopted to date.   The adequacy and completeness of liability regimes in the face of technological challenges are crucially important for society . If the system is  inadequate or  flawed or has shortcomings  in  dealing with damages caused by emerging digital  technologies, victims may end up totally or  partially uncompensated,  even though an overall equitable analysis may make the case for  indemnifying them. The social impact of a potential inadequacy in  existing legal regimes , in addressing  new risks created by emerging digital technologies , might compromise the expected  benefits. Certain factors, such as the ever-increasing presence of emerging digital technologies  in all aspects of social life, and the multiplying effect of automation, can also exacerbate  the                                                    1 The term ‘ emerging digital technologies ’ is used with the same meaning as in the Commission Staff Working  Document ‘Liability for emerging digital technologies ’ (SWD(2018) 137 final) .  2 Strictly speaking, it is not so much the technology itself, but a particular product or service making use of the  technology , that poses a risk. However, for brevity and simplicity, this report will use the term ‘technology ’.  3 This is also acknowledged by key players in this area of technology; for example  Microsoft in its 2018 US  Securities and Exchange Commission filing stated that    ‘As with many disruptive innovations, AI presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and  therefore our busine ss. AI algorithms may be flawed. Datasets may be insufficient or contain biased information. Inappropriate or controversial data practices by Microsoft or others could impair the acceptance of AI solutions. These deficiencies could undermine the decisions,  predictions, or analysis AI applications produce, subjecting us to competitive harm, legal liability, and brand or reputational harm. Some AI scenarios  present ethical issues. If we enable or offer AI solutions that are controversial because of their impact on  human rights, privacy, employment, or other social issues, we may experience brand or reputational harm.’    <https: //  www.sec.gov /  Archives /  edgar /  data/  789019 /  000156459018019062/  msft-10k_  20180630.htm >. 
A. Introduction   12 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  damage  these technologies cause. Damages can easily become viral and rapidly propagate in a  densely  interconnected society.   II. Background   On 16 February 2017 the European Parliament adopted a Resolution on Civil Law Rules on  Robotics  with recommendations to the Commission. 3F4 It proposed a whole range of legislative  and non- legislative initiatives in the field of robotics and AI. In particular, it asked the  Commission to submit a proposal for a legislative instrument providing civil law rules on the  liability of robots and AI.  In February 2018, the European Parliamentary Research Service  (EPRS) published a study on ‘ A common EU approach to liability rules and insurance for  connected and autonomous vehicles ’ 4F5 as a European added value assessment accompanying  the Resolution on Ci vil Law Rules .  The 2018 Commission Work Programme announced that the Commission would be  seeking to  make the most of AI , since  it will increasingly play a role in our economies and societies. 5F6 On  14 December  2017, in a Joint Declaration , 6F7 the Presidents of  the Commission, Parliament and  Council agreed to ensure ‘ a high level of data protection, digital rights and ethical standards  while capturing the benefits and avoiding t he risks of developments in artif icial intelligence and  robotics ’. On 25 April 2018, the Commission published a Staff Working Document on  ‘Liability for emerging digital technologies ’ 7F8 accompanying a Communication from the  Commission to the other institutions on the same day , on ‘Artificial Intelligence for Europe ’. 8F9  This Communication and the Sibiu Communication of May 2019 9F10 stress that ‘ a robust regulatory framework should proactively address the ethical and legal questions surrounding AI ’. In  its 2018 AI  Communication the Commission also announced the adoption of  a report assessing  the implications of emerging digital technologies on existing safety and liability frameworks  by mid- 2019. In its 2019 Work Programme, it confirmed it would ‘ continue work on the  emerging challenge of Artificial Intelligence by enabling coordinated action acros s the  European Union’ . 10F11  In March 2018, the Commission set up an Expert Group on Liability and New Technologies, 11F12  operating in two different formations: the Product Liability Directive formation and the New  Technologies formation.                                                     4 P8_TA(2017)0051 .  5 <http://  www.europarl.e uropa.eu/  thinktank/  en/  document.html?  reference=  EPRS_STU(2018)615635 >.  6 <https://  ec.europa.eu/  info/  sites/  info/  files/  cwp_2018_en.pdf >.  7 <https://  ec.europa.eu/  commission/  sites/  beta-political/  files/  joint-declaration -eu-legislative -priorities -201819_en.pdf>.   8 SWD(2018) 137 final.   9 COM(2018) 237 final.   10 <https://  ec.europa.eu/  commission/  sites/  beta-  political/  files/  comm_  sibiu_  06-  05_  en.pdf>.   11 <https://  ec.europa.eu/  info/  sites/  info/  files/  cwp_2019_en.pdf>.   12 <http://  ec.europa.eu/  transparency/  regexpert/  index.cfm?  do=  groupDetail.  groupDetail&  groupID=3592>.  
II. Background  New Technologies Formation  13 In the call for applicatio ns, 12F13 the New Technologies formation (NTF) was asked to assess  ‘whether and to what extent existing liability schemes are adapted to the emerging market  realities following the development of the new technologies such as Artifical Intelligence,  advanced robotics, the IoT and cybersecurity issues’. The experts were asked to examine  whether the current liability regimes are still ‘ adequate to facilitate the uptake of … new  technologies by fostering investment stability and users ’ trust’. If there are shortcomings, the  NTF should make  recommendations for amendments , without being limited to existing national  and EU legal instruments. However, recommendations should be limited to matters of  extracontractual liability, leaving aside in particular correspo nding (and complementary) rules  on safety and other technical standards. 13F14  The NTF 14F15 first convened in June 2018 and held nine further meetings up to May 2019. After  analysing the relevant national laws and looking at specific use cases, 15F16 it compares various   aspects of existing liability regimes. This report presents the NTF’s  findings.                                                    13 <http://  ec.europa.eu/  transparency/  regexpert/  index.cfm?  do=  news.open_doc&  id=12065>.   14 See the overview in the Commissi on Staff Working Document (fn 8), 4 ff.  15 See the list of members in the Annex.   16 The following use cases were examined, with the further participation of technical experts in the field in  question: autonomous cars, smart home, blockchain and other distrib uted ledger technologies , autonomous  healthcare applications, algorithmic decision making in the financial and other sectors , drones.  

New Technologies Formation 15 B. Liability for emerging digital technologies under existing laws in  Europe  I. Overview of existing liability regimes   The law of tort of EU Member States is largely non -harmonised, with the exception of product  liability law under  Directive 85/  374/  EC, 16F17 some aspects of liability for infringing  data protection law (A rticle 82 of the General Data Protection Regulation  (GDPR) 17F18), and liability for  infring ing competition law (Directive 2014/  104/  EU 18F19). There is also  a well -established regime  governing liability insurance with regard to damage caused by the use of motor vehicles (Directive 2009/  103/  EC 19F20), although without touching upon liability for accidents itself. E U law  also provides for a conflict of tort laws framework, in the form of the Rome II Regulation . 20F21  On a national level, it can generally be observed that the laws of the Member States do not (yet)  contain liability rules specifically applicable to damage resulting from the use of emerging digital technologies such as AI. By way of exception, those juris dictions that already allow the  experimental or regular use of highly or fully automated vehicles usually also provide for cov-erage of any damage caused, be it only by way of insurance 21F22 or by reference to the general  rules . 22F23                                                    17 Council Directive 85 /  374/  EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (OJ L 210, 7.8.1985, p  29),  as amended by Directive 1999 /  34/  EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 May 1999, OJ L  141 20 4.6.1999.

Spain’s Directorate -General for Traffic ( Dirección General de Tráfico ) circular of  13 November 2015 ( Instrucción 15/V- 113) also authorises the testing of automated cars and requires liability  insurance to cover compulsory insurance limits for motor vehicles.   23 For example, §  7 of the German Road Traffic Act (Straßenverkehrsgesetz ) provides for strict liability of the  keeper of the vehicle.  This rule was deliberately left un chang ed when the Road Traffic Act wa s adapted to  the emergence of automated vehicles.  Similarly , French Decree n° 2018 -211 of 28 March 2018 on experimentation with automated vehicles on public roads relies on the Loi Badinter  of 5 July 1985 (n°85 -677).

B. Liability for emerging digital technologies under existing laws in Europe   16 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  Apart from this legislation, th e harmful effects of the operation of emerging digital technologies  can be compensated under existing ( ‘traditional ’) laws on damages in contract and in tort in  each Member State. This applies to all fields of application of AI and other emerging digital  technologies the  NTF of the  Expert Group have analysed .  In general, these domestic tort laws include a rule (or rules) introducing fault- based liability  with a relatively broad scope of application, accompanied by several more specific rules which  either mo dify the premises of fault -based liability (especially the distribution of the burden of  proving fault) or establish liability that is independent of fault (usually called strict liability or  risk-based liability), which also takes many forms that vary with regard to the scope  of the rule ,  the conditions of liability and the burden of proof. 23F24 Most liability regimes contain the notion  of liability for others (often called vicarious liability). 24F25  However, these regimes may not always lead to satisfactory and adequate results. 25F26 Furthermore, given the  significant differences between the tort laws of all Member States, the outcome  of cases will often be different depending on which jurisdiction applies. As experience with the Product Liability Directive  has shown, efforts to overcome such differences by harmoni sing  only certain aspects of liability law may not always lead to the desired degree of uniformity of  outcomes.  II. Some examples of the a pplication of existing liability regimes to emerging digital  technologies   In most jurisdictions, damage caused by motor vehicles is subject to a special liability regime.  As mentioned above, there is an EU -wide insurance scheme in place, in the form of the (recodified) Motor Insurance Directive (MID), 26F27 but the MID only harmonises liability insurance  cover, not civil liability itself . Member States therefore continue to regulate tortious liability  for accidents involving motor vehicles themselves, limited in their discretion only by the principle of effe ctiveness of the MID. 27F28 These rules usually impose liability on the owner/  keeper  of a vehicle and/  or on the driver, although there are systems which introduce direct claims  against the insurer regardless of any other person’ s liability. The a ppropriatenes s of existing  traffic liability regimes for  autonomous vehicles  (AV)  may be disputed, especially with regard  to systems which rely on fault -based liability in general (Malta  for example ) or in limited circumstances, such as in the case of a collision (Poland for example ), or for certain types of  damage (Spain  for example 28F29), or which make the application of the traffic liability regime                                                    which provides that ‘the insurer is liable’ for damage incurred by the insured or any other person in an accident  caused by an automated vehicle. If the vehicle is uninsured, it is the owner of the vehicle who is liable instead.   24 See also infra B.III. 5.  25 See also infra B.III.4.  26 See infra B.III.   27 Supra fn  20.  28 CJEU Delgado Mendes , C-503/  16, EU:C:2017:681, para graph  48; CJEU Marques Almeida, C -300/  10, EU:   C:  2012:  656, para graph s 31, 32, and the case -law cited.   29 Under Spanish law, liability for damage to property caused by motor vehicles remains subject to a fault -based  regime.  
II. Some examples of the application of existing liability regimes to emerging digital technologies   New Technologies Formation  17 conditional on the involvement of a driver (Italy). Liability gaps may emerge in the case of a  single -vehicle accident in as  much as , under  existing traffic liability rules, the injured owner/   keeper is excluded from compensation. Some legal systems even exclude passengers from protection under strict traffic liability, either in general (Greece 29F30 or the Netherlands  for exa mple  30F31) or only in specific circumstances (Poland 31F32 or Austria  for example 32F33). This  would be hard  to accept for accidents involving AVs . Given the complex character of the autonomous driving  environment, exclusion of strict liability in the case of a third -party intervention may also prove  problematic,  particularly in the context of cybersecurity risks, such as where a connected AV  has been hacked, or where an accident has been  caused because the ICT infrastructure  sent the  wrong signals . Where damage was caused by a defective vehicle, product liability or producer ’s  liability in tort may apply, but usually become relevant only at the redress stage. 33F34  For most technological ecosystems (by which we mean systems with interacting devices or progr ams), however, no specific liability regimes exist . This means that product liability, general tort law rules (fault- based liability, tort of negligence, breach of statutory duty) , and possibly contractual liability , occupy centre stage. The more complex these ecosystems become with  emerging digital technologies, the more  increasingly difficult it become s to apply liability  frameworks .  An example would be the use case of smart home systems and networks. Where smart ho me  devices were already defective at the point at which  they were put into circulation, product  liability law applies. In most jurisdictions the producer may also be liable under general tort law, which could go beyond product liability by making the producer liable  for, for example ,  defective ancillary digital services , and for updates as well as for failures in product surveillance  or monitoring. In the case of damage caused by the seller of a product, an installing/  configuring  service provider, internet  service provider, energy supplier, cloud operator and others involved  in the smart home scenario, both general tort law , and possibly contractual liability, may come  into play. Some countries (such as Spain or Greece) can use their special regimes of liab ility  for flawed services, based on a presumed fault on the service provider ’s part . Other legal systems operate solely or mainly on the basis of their general provisions on fault liability (general clauses) or relatively open tort law concepts (tort of ne gligence, breach of statutory duty). These                                                    30 Article 12 of Law 3950  /   1911 on Liability for Automobiles .  31 Article 185, paragraph  1 of the Road Traffic Act ( Wegenverkeerswet  1994 ) in the Netherlands . The problem  there  has recently been solved in a pragmatic way as , per 1 April  2017, the Dutch Association of Insurers  declared that motor third -party liability (MTPL) insurers shall compensate passengers of the insured motor  vehicle regardless of liability (< https: //  www.v erzekeraars.nl /  publicaties /  actueel /  inzittende -kan-schade -voortaan-direct -regelen >).  32 According to Article  436 §  2 of the Polish Civil Code, strict liability does not apply to passengers transported  without any remuneration or other benefit (‘out of pol iteness’).   33 According to §  3 of the Austrian Railway and Motor Vehicle Liability Act  (EKHG), people transported by  the vehicle without the keeper’s consent are not covered.   34 Typically, at least in systems with strict liability for motor vehicles, the fact that these were defective does  not preclude liability of the vehicles’ keeper. It will therefore often be the motor vehicle liability insurer who will pursue the product liability claim.  
B. Liability for emerging digital technologies under existing laws in Europe   18 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  provisions or legal concepts usually require proof of the defendant ’s failure to observe the required standard of care. 34F35  When the user in the smart home scenario is contractually tied to the actor (seller, install ing  service providers, internet service provider, energy supplier, cloud operator), the latter may be  liable in contract to the user for damage caused by non -performance. Some legal systems (Germany, Austria, or Greece, and to some extent Denmark , for exam ple) extend contractual liability under certain conditions , allow ing a third party to invoke  a contract they were not a party to  themselves. This applies to situations where the contract is deemed to establish duties to also  protect such third parties, allowing the latter to sue for compensation in cases of breach. 35F36 The  protected third party must be foreseeably close to the contracting partner, though, confronted in a similar way with the danger stemming from non -performance (such as family members or  guests). Any kind of contractual liability is, however, usually subject to contractual (and sometimes also statutory) limitations.   Similarly , complex situations may result in cases where d amage was caused by autonomous  healthcare applications . Such damage  would usually be subject to fault -based liability, either in  contract  or in tort. Many jurisdictions allow the victim to bring concurrent claims based on  contract and on tort alternatively. In some jurisdictions  however , this is not possible, in which  case i t becomes necessary to choose the one or the other. When damage is triggered by a defect  present before putting these applications into circulation , product liability may apply, if the  application or the device is considered a product for the purpose of pr oduct liability law. Further  complexities arise from the interplay between  these regimes and social insurance and/  or  healthcare systems.   Damage in connection with the use of algorithms or AI in the financial market is currently  subject to reparation under  traditional fault -based regimes. Some jurisdictions, however, allow  the claimant to invoke  administrative law (financial regulations) to establish the benchmark   against  which the perpetrator ’s conduct is to be assessed. On the contractual level, informati on  asymmetry resulting from the use of AI may justify the application of a (statutory or case law) pre-contractual liability regime (culpa in contrahendo and similar concepts). It seems more  likely, however, that the reaction of the legal system to potenti al irregularities in contracting  with the use of algorithms will rely on contract law tools for assessing and challenging the  validity of contracts (vitiated consent, lack of fairness, etc.). 36F37  The use of blockchain, in particular cryptocurrencies, is not s ubject to any particular liability  rules, and new legislation already enacted or under discussion in some Member States, related among other things  to initial coin offerings, certifications of platforms and cybersecurity, does  not extend to compensation for damage. In as much as this legislation provides for the duties                                                    35  The standard of care referred to in this document is the mode l of careful and prudent conduct required from  the perpetrator of the damage . It should not be confused with standards of safety or quality of products or  services established by law or by certain bodies .  36 This is typically used as a workaround for deficiencies of the tort law regime, whereas other legal systems  come to similar solutions via their (at least in some respects such as vicarious liability) more generous law of  torts.   37 Cf, e.g., Spanish case law related to swap agreements according to wh ich the infring ement of financial regulations and of the duty to inform in the precontractual stage were  treated as grounds for vitiated consent.

Some examples of the application of existing liability regimes to emerging digital technologies New Technologies Formation  19 and responsibilities of the participants in  a blockchain or of public authorities, it may be relevant  for establishing the standard  of care for the purpose of applying fault- based liability rules.   III. Specific challenges to existing tort law regimes posed by emerging digital technologies It is possible to appl y existing liability regimes to emerging digital technologies, but in light of  a number of challenges and due to the limitations of existing regimes , doing so may leave victims under - or entirely uncompensated. The adequacy of existing liability rules  may therefore  be questionable, considering in particular that these rules were formulated decades or even centuries ago, based on even older concepts and incorporating a primarily anthropocentric and  monocausal model of inflicting harm.   1. Damage The main purpose of t ort law is to indemnify victims for losses they should not have to bea r  themselves entirely on the basis of  an assessment of all the interests involved. However, only  compensable harm will be indemnified, meaning damage to a limited range of interests that a  legal system deems worthy of protection. 37F38 W hile there is unanimous accord that injuries to a person or to physical property can trigger  tortious liability, 38F39 this is not universally accepted  for pure economic loss. 39F40 Damage caused  by self -learning algorithms on financial markets, for example, will therefore often remain uncompensated , because some legal systems do not provide tort law protection of such interests  at all or only if  additional requirements  are fulfilled , such as a contractual relationship between  the parties or the violation of some specific rule of conduct. Nor is it universally accepted   throughout Europe that damage to or the destruction of data is a property loss, since in some  legal systems the notion of property is limited to corporeal objects and excludes intangibles. 40F41 O ther differences exist when it comes to the recognition of personality rights, which may also  be adversely affected by emerging  digital technologies, if certain data is released which infringes on the right to privacy  for example. 41F42 H owever, generally speaking, AI and other emerging digital technologies do not call into question the existing range of compensable harm per se . Rather , some of the already recogni sed  38 See A rticle VI-2:101 Draft Common Frame of Reference (DCFR ), in particular para graph  1 lit c; Article 2:101 Principles of European Tort Law ( PETL). This range is defined differently at present, with some  systems (such as the Romanic systems) being more generous than others, and some of those others setting  out only a limited list of protected interests by statut e.  39 See A rticle 2:102 para graphs  2 and 3 PETL.   40 See A rticle 2:102 para graph 4 PETL: ‘ Protection of pure economic interests … may be more limited in  scope. ’ See for example W van Boom /  H Koziol /  Ch Witting (eds), Pure Economic Loss  (2004); and M  Bussani/  V Palmer , ‘The liability regimes of Europe – their fa çades and interiors ’, in M Bussani /  V Palmer  (eds), Pure Economic Loss in Europe  (2003) p. 120 ff.   41 Compare §  90 German BGB (according to which a ‘ thing ’ by definition must be corporeal) with § 285 Austrian ABGB (which does not provide for such a limitation, so that ‘things ’ in Austria may also be intangible).   42 But see Article 82 of the GDPR for a harmon ised claim for compensation in cases of data breach.  
B. Liability for emerging digital technologies under existing laws in Europe   20 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  categories of losses may be more relevant in future  cases than in traditional tort scenarios. D amage as a prerequisite for liability is also a flexible concept – the interest at stake may be more  or less significant, and the extent of damage to such an interest may also vary . This may in turn  have an impact on the overall assessment of whether or n ot a tort claim seems justified in an   individual case. 42F43 2. C ausation One of the most essential requirements for establishing liability is a causal link between the  victim ’s harm and the defendant ’s sphere. As a rule, it is the victim who must prove that their  damage originated from some conduct or risk attributable to the defendant. T he victim needs to  then produce evidence in support of this argument. However, the less evident the sequence of  events was that led to the victim’s loss, the more complex the  interplay of various factors that  either jointly or separately contributed to the damage, the more crucial links in the chain of  events are within the defendant ’s control, the more difficult it will be for the victim to succeed  in establishing causation  without alleviating their burden of proof . If the victim fails to persuade   the court , to the required standard of proof , 43F44 that something for which the defendant has to  account for trigger ed the harm they suffered , they will lose their case, regardless of how strong  it would have been against the defendant otherwise ( for example,  because of evident negligence  on the defendant’s part).  Hard as it is  to prove that some hardware defect was the reason someone was injured, for example, it becomes very difficult to  establish that the cause of harm was some flawed algori thm.  Illustration 1.  If a smoke detector in a smart home environment fails to trigger an alarm  because of flawed  wiring, this defect may be identifiable (and in this case  is even visible ).  If, on the other hand, the smoke detector did not go off because of some firmware error,  this may not be proven as easily (even though the absence of an alarm per se may  be  easily proven ), if only because it requires a careful analysis of the firmware’ s code and  its suitability for the hardware components of the smoke detector.  It is even harder  if the algorithm suspected of causing harm has been developed or modified by  some AI system fuelled by machine  learning and deep learning techniques , on the basis  of multiple external data collected since  the start of its operation.  Even without changes to the original  software design, the embedded criteria steering the collection and analysis of data and the decision -making process may not be readily explicable and often require costly analysis by experts . This may in itself be a primary practical obstacle to pursuing a claim for compensation ,  even if those costs should ultimately be recoverable as long as the chances of succee ding are  hard to predict for the victim upfront.  43 See A rticle 2:102 para graph  1 PETL: ‘ The scope  of protection of an interest depends on its nature; the higher  its value, the precision of its definition and its obviousness, the m ore extensive is its protection’.   44 The standard of proof determines the degree to which a court must be persuaded  of some assertion in order  to hold it as true . This standard is quite different throughout Europe . Most c ivil law systems traditionally  require that the judge  be convinced to something equivalent to a certainty , or at least a high degree of probability , to find in favour of  the p arty with the burden of proof. By contrast, common law countries require that  there be a probability greater than 50% (or a preponderance of the evidence) to satisfy the burden of proof. 
III. Specific challenges to existing tort law regimes posed by emerging digital technologies   New Technologies Formation  21 In cases of strict liability, 44F45 proving causation may be easier for the victim, and not only in  those jurisdictions where causation is presumed in such cases. 45F46 Instead of establishing some  misconduct in the sphere of the defendant, the victim only has to prove that the risk triggering  strict liability materialise d. Depending on how this risk was defined by the legislator , this  may  be easier , considering that , for example, current motor vehicle liability statutes merely require  an ‘involvement ’ of the car or its  being ‘ in operation ’ when the accident happened.   In addition to the initial complexity of AI systems upon release, they will most likely be subject  to mor e or less frequent updates which are not necessarily supplied by the original producer.  Identifying which part of a now flawed code was wrong from the beginning or adversely  changed in the course of an update , will at least require (again) significant expe rt input , but  doing so is essential in order to determine whom to sue for compensation.   The operation of AI systems often depends on data and other input collected by the system ’s  own sensors or added by external sources. Not only may such data be flawed i n itself, but the  processing of otherwise correct data may also be imperfect. The latter may be due to original  defects in designing the handling of data , or the consequence of distortions of the system’s selflearning abilities  due to the bulk of data collected , whose randomness may lead the AI system  in question to misperceive  and miscategorise subsequent input .  Problems of uncertain causation are of course not new to European legal systems, even though they are posed differently depending on the appli cable standard of proof. 46F47 As long as the uncertainty exceeds th at threshold, the victim will remain uncompensated, but as soon as the likelihood of the causation theory on which the victim ’s case rests meets the standard of proof, they  will be full y compensated  (subject to the further requirements of liability).   This all -or-nothing dilemma  is already being addressed throughout Europe by some modifications that aid the victim in proving causation under certain circumstances. Courts may for instance be willin g to accept prima facie evidence in complex scenarios, such as those emerging  digital  technologies  give rise to,  where the exact sequence of events may be difficult to prove.  While the burden of proving causation is not shifted yet, 47F48 it is clearly alleviated for the victim,  who need not prove every single link i n the chain of causation if courts accept  that a given  outcome is the typical effect of a certain development i n that chain. Furthermore, as past medical mal practice cases have shown, courts tend to be willing to place the burden of producing  evidence on the party who is or should be in control of  the evidence , with failure to bring forward such evidence resulting in a presumption to the disadvantage of that party. If, for example,  certain log files cannot be produced or properly read, courts may be prepared to hold this against                                                    45 But see the differences between the tort laws of th e Member States when it comes to introducing and applying  strict liability infra B.III. 5.  46 See for example Article 1063 of the Croatian Civil Obligations Act: ‘Damage caused in relation to a dangerous thing or dangerous activity shall be considered to re sult from that thing or activity, unless it has been  proved that it did not cause the damage. ’ (transl ated by M Baretić  in E Karner /  K Oliphant /  B Steininger (eds),  European Tort Law: Basic Texts  [2nd ed ition 2019] 48).   47 See fn  44.  48 Unlike in a full reve rsal of the burden of proof, prima facie evidence is meant to resolve uncertainties rather  than bridge non liquet situations, and it can be rebutted  already  if the opponent can prove (again adhering to  tradition al standards) that there is a (mere) genuine possibility of a turn of events deviating from the one  expected according to experience.  
B. Liability for emerging digital technologies under existing laws in Europe   22 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  the party that was in charge of these recordings (and/or of the technology for  analys ing them).   In some cases, some European  legislators have intervened and shifted the burden of proving  causation altogether, 48F49 thereby presuming that the victim ’s harm was caused by the defendant,  though leaving the defendant the possibility to rebut this. 49F50 It remains to be seen to what extent  any of these tools will be used in favour of the victi m if their harm may have been caused by  emerging digital technologies.  It is already  difficult to prove that some conduct or activity was the cause of harm, but it gets  even more complex if other alternative causes come into play. T his is nothing new, but it will  become  much more of an issue  in the future , given  the interconnectedness of emerging digital  technologies and their increased dependency on external input and data, making it increasingly  doubtful whether the damage at stake was triggered by a single original cause or by the interplay  of multiple (actual or potential) causes.  Current tort law regimes in Europe handle such  uncertainties in the case of multiple potential  sources of harm quite differently. Even if some thing is proven to have triggered the harm  (for  example,  because an autonomous car collided  with a tree), the real  reason for it is not  always   equally evident. The car may have been poorly designed (be it its hardware, pre -installed software, or both), but it may also have either misread correct , or received incorrect , data, or a  software update done by the original producer or by some third party may have been flawed, or  the user may have failed to install an update which would have prevented the collision, to give  just a few examples, not to mention a combination of multiple such factors.  The c lassic response by existing tort laws in Europe in such cases of alternative causation, if it  remains unclear which one of several possible causes was the decisive influence to trigger the  harm, is that either no -one is liable (since the victim ’s evidence fails to reach the threshold to  prove causation of one cause), or that all parties are jointly and severally  liable , which is the  majority view. 50F51 The former  outcome is undesirable for the victim, the latter for those merely  possible tortfeasors  who in fact did not cause harm, but may still be attractive targets for litigation because of their procedural availability and/  or their more promising financial ability to  actually pay compensation. The problem of who really caused the harm in question w ill therefore often not be solved  in the first round of litigation initiated by the victim, but on a recourse  level, if ever. More modern approaches provide for  proportional liability at least in some cases,  reducing the victim ’s claim against  each potenti al tortfeasor  to a quota corresponding to the  likelihood that each of them in fact caused the harm  in question. 51F52 49 One such example is §  630h of the German BGB in the field of medical malpractice.   50 However, since the reason for shifting the burden of proof has often been the expectation that the victim will  not succeed in establishing causation, the burden on the defendant will typically not be lighter.   51 See, e.g., B Winiger et al (eds), Digest of European Tort Law I: Essential Cases on Natural Causation  (2007) ,  p.387 ff. 52 See I Gilead /  M Green /  BA Koch (eds), Proportional Liability: Analytical and Comparative Perspectives   (2013).  
III. Specific challenges to existing tort law regimes posed by emerging digital technologies   New Technologies Formation  23 3. Wrongfulness and fault   As already mentioned in the overview above, tort laws in Europe are traditionally fault -based,  providing compensation to the victim if the defendant i s to blame for the former ’s damage. 52F53  Such blame is commonly linked to the deviation from some conduct expected of , but not shown,  by the tortfeasor. W hether or not a legal system distinguishes between objective or subjective  wrongdoing and/  or divides the basis of liability for misconduct into wrongfulness and fault, 53F54  two things remain crucial : to identify the duties  of care the perpetrator  should have discharged  and to prove that the conduct of the perpetrator of the damage did not discharge those duties.   The duties in question are  determined by various factors . Sometimes they are defined beforehand by statutory language prescribing or prohibiting certain specific conduc t, but often they  must be reconstructed after the fact  by the court on the basis of social beliefs about  the prudent  and reasonable course of action in the circumstances. 54F55  Emerging digital technologies make it difficult to apply  fault-based liability rules , due to the  lack of well  established  models  of proper functioning of these technologies and the possibility  of their developing as a result of learning without direct human control.   The processes running in AI  systems cannot all be measured according to duties of care designed for human conduct, or not without adjustments that would require further justification.   As European legal systems tend to regulat e product and safety requirements  in advance more  than other jurisdictions, 55F56 it may well be the case tha t at least certain minimum rules will be  introduced (if only, for example, logging requirements alleviating an analysis , after the fact,  of  what actually happened) , to help defin e and apply the duties of care relevant for tort law should  damage occur. A vi olation of such statutory or regulatory requirements  may also trigger liability  more easily for the victim, by shifting the burden of proving fault in many systems  for example. 56F57 Still, such requirements  will not be present from the beginning, and it may ta ke years for  such rules to emerge, either in legislation or in the courts.   Legal requirements have to be distinguished from industry standards  (or practices)  not yet recognised by the lawmaker. Their relevance in a tort action is necessarily weaker, even though  the courts may look at such requirements  as well when assessing in retrospect whether or not   conduct complied with the duties of care that needed to be discharged under the circumstances.   Taking a step back and shifting the focus onto a software developer who wrote the firmware  for some smart gadget, for example, does not resolve the problem entirely, since – as already                                                    53 See also the Commission Staff Working Document (fn  8), p. 7.   54 On the range of existing approaches in this regard throughout Europe, see H Koziol , ‘Comparative Conclusions ’, in H Koziol (ed), Basic Questions of Tort Law from a Comparative Perspective  (2015) , p. 685 (782 ff).  55 See the notion of a ‘Schutzgesetz ’ (protective norm) in a comparative overview, see B Winiger et al (eds),  Digest of European Tort Law III: Essential Cases on Misconduct  (2018) , p. 696 ff.  56 See U Magnus , ‘Why is US Tort Law so Different? ’, JETL 2010, 1 (20).   57 See for example § 2911 Czech Civil Code: ‘If a wrongdoer causes damage to the injured party by breaching  a legal obliga tion, he shall be deemed to have caused the damage through negligence. ’ (transl ated by J Hradek  in European Tort Law: Basic Texts ² [fn 46] 68). There are also tort law systems where fault is presumed in  general (see Article  45(2) of the Bulgarian Law on Obligations and Contracts; §  1050 of the Estonian Law of  Obligations Act; §  6:519 of the Hungarian Civil Code; §  420(3) of the Slovak Civil Code).  
B. Liability for emerging digital technologies under existing laws in Europe   24 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  mentioned – the software may have been designed to adj ust itself to unprecedented situations   or at least to cope with novel input not matching any pre -installed data. If the operation of some  technology that includes AI, for example, is legally permissible, presuming that the developer  made use of  state-of-the-art knowledge at the time the system was launched, any subsequent  choices made by the AI technology independently may not necessarily be attributable to some  flaw in its original design. The question therefore arises whether the choice to admit it to the   market, or implement the AI system in an environment where harm was subsequently caused, in itself is  a breach  of the duties  of care applicable to such choices.   In addition to the difficulties of  determining what constitutes fault in the case of damage caused  by an emerging digital  technology, there may also be problems with  proving fault. Generally ,  the victim has to prove that the defendant (or someone whose conduct is attributable to the m)  was at fault. The victim therefore not only needs to identify which duties  of care the defendant   should have discharged , but also to prove to the court that th ese duties were breached . Pro ving  the defendant  is at fault entails providing the court with evidence  that may lead it to believe  what the applicable standard of care was and that it has not been met. The second part of this is  to provide evidence  of how the event giving rise to the damage occurred.  The more complex  the circumstances leading to the victim ’s harm are, the harder  it is to identify relevant  evidence.   For example, it can be difficult  and cost ly to identify a bug in a long and complicated software  code. In the case of AI, examining the process leading to a specific result (how the input data  led to the output data) may be difficult, very time -consuming and expensive.  4. Vicarious liability   Existing tort laws in Europe differ substantially in their approach to holding someone (the prin-cipal) liable for the conduct of another (the auxiliary). 57F58 Some attribute an auxiliary ’s conduct  to the principal without further requirements , other than that the auxiliary acted under the direction of the principal and for  the benefit  of the principal. Others hold the principal liable in  tort law only under ver y exceptional circumstances, such as known dangerousness of the auxiliary or the auxiliary’s complete unsuitability  for the assigned task, 58F59 or if the defendant  was  at fault in selecting or supervising the auxiliary. 59F60 There are also jurisdictions which use both  approaches. 60F61                                                    58 See the overview by H Koziol , ‘Comparative Conclusions ’ (fn 54), p. 795 ff.  59 The latter is true in Austria  for example.  See § 1315 ABGB: ‘Whosoever, for the conduct of his affairs, avails  himself either of an unfit person, or knowingly of a dangerous person, is liable for the harm such a person  causes to another in that capacity. ’ (transl ated by B Steininger in European Tort Law: Basic Texts ² [fn 46] 5).  60 See, e.g., the German §  831 BGB, according to which the principal can excuse him self ‘where the principal  has exercised due care in the selection of the agent and – in so far as he has to provide equipment or tools or  has to supervise the performance of the duties – has acted with due care in such provision and supervision, or  where the loss would have occurred even if such care had been exercised’  (transl ated by F Wagner von Papp/   J Fedtke in European Tort Law : Basic Texts ² [fn 46] 144).   61 See, e.g., Article  429 of the Polish Civil Code, according to which the principal is liable for the agent’s unlawful (but not necessarily culpable) conduct, unless the principal has chosen the agent carefully or has chosen  a professional agent, and Article  430 of the Polish Civil Code, which makes the principal strictly liable for  the culpable conduct of the agent if the agent is a subordinate of the principal.

III. Specific challenges to existing tort law regimes posed by emerging digital technologies   New Technologies Formation  25 Jurisdictions with a neutral (and therefore broader) definition of strict liability (as liability without fault of the liable person in general) regard  vicarious liability as a mere variant of this strict  (or no -fault) liability. If the n otion of strict liability is equated with liability for some specific  risk, dangerous object or activity instead, vicarious liability is rather associated with fault liability, as liability of the principal without personal fault of t heir own, but for the (passed -on)  ‘fault’ of their auxiliary instead, even though the auxiliary’s conduct is then not necessarily  evaluated according to the benchmarks applicable to  themselves, but to the benchmarks for  the  principal. 61F62  Irrespective of such differences, the concept of vicarious liability is considered by some as a  possible catalyst for arguing that operators of machines, computers, robots or similar technologies should also be strictly liable for their operations, based on an analogy to the basis of vicarious liability . If someone can be held liable for the wrongdoing of some human helper, why  should the beneficiary of such support not be equally liable if they  outsource their duties to a  non-human helper instead, considering that they equally benefit from suc h delegation? 62F63 The  policy argument is quite convincing that using the assistance of a self -learning and autonomous  machine should not be treated differently from employing a human auxiliary, if such assistance  leads to harm of a third party  (‘principle of functional equivalence ’). However, at least in those  jurisdictions which consider vicarious liability a variant of fault liability, holding the principal liable for the wrongdoing of another, it may be challenging to identify the benchmark against   which the operations of non- human helpers will be assessed in order to mirror the misconduct  element of human auxiliaries. The potential benchmark should take into account that in many  areas of application non- human auxiliaries are safer, that is less likely to ca use damage to others  than human actors , and the law should at least not discourage their  use. 63F64  5. Strict liability   Particularly from the 19th century onwards, legislators often responded to risks brought about  by new technologies by introducing strict liabili ty, replacing the notion of responsibility for  misconduct with liability irrespective of fault, attached to specific risks linked to some object  or activity which was deemed permissible, though at the expense of a residual risk of harm  linked to it. 64F65 So far, these changes to the law  have  concerned, for example, means of transport  (such as trains or motor vehicles), energy ( such as nuclear power, power lines), or pipelines. 65F66  Even before that, tort laws often responded to increased risks by shifting the  burden of proving                                                    62 On this divide, see S Galand -Carval , ‘Comparative Report on Liability for Damage Caused by Others’, in J  Spier (ed), Unification of Tort Law: Liability for Damage Caused by Others  (2003 ), 289 (290).   63 One might even dra w support for such a solution from the analogy to a historic precedent – the Roman legal  concept  of noxal liability for slaves, whom the law at the time treated  as property and not as persons, see,  e.g., W Buckland/  A McNair , Roman Law and Common Law  (1952) , p. 359 ff; AJB Sirks,  ‘Delicts ’, in D  Johnston (ed), The Cambridge Companion to Roman Law  (2015), p. 246 (265 ff).   64 R Abbott,  ‘The Reasonable Computer: Disrupting the Paradigm of Tort Liability ’, 86 Geo.

B. Liability for emerging digital technologies under existing laws in Europe   26 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  fault, making it easier for the victim to succeed if the defendant was in control of particular  sources of harm such as animals 66F67 or defective immovables . 67F68  The landscape of strict liability in Europe is quite varied. Some legal systems ar e restrictive and  have made very limited use of such alternative liability regimes (often expand ing fault liability  instead) . Others are more or less generous, while not allowing  analogy to individually defined  strict liabilities (with the sole exception o f Austria 68F69). Some  Member States have also introduced a (more or less broad) general rule of strict liability, typically for some ‘ dangerous activity’, 69F70 which the courts in those jurisdictions interpret quite differently . 70F71 In some jurisdictions,  the keeping  of a thing triggers strict liability, 71F72 which is another way to provide for a rather far reaching deviation from the classic fault requirement.   Existing rules on strict liability for motor vehicles (which can be found in many, but not all EU  Member States)  or aircrafts  may well also be applied to autonomous vehicles  or drones , but  there are many potential liability gaps. 72F73  Strict liability for the operation of computers, software or the like is so far widely unknown in  Europe, even though there are some limi ted examples where countries provide for  the liability  of the operator of some (typically narrowly defined) computer system, such as databases oper-ated by the state. 73F74  The advantage of strict liability for the victim is obvious, as it exempts them from  having to  prove any wrongdoing within the defendant ’s sphere, let alone the causal link between such  wrongdoing and the victim’s  loss, allowing the victim to focus  instead only on whether the risk  brought about by the technology material ised by causing them  harm. However, one has to bear  in mind that often strict liabilities are coupled with liability caps or other restrictions in order  to counterbalance the increased risk of liability of those benefiting from the technology. Such                                                    67 See the notes to Article  VI-3:202 DCFR, describing the rather diverse landscape in Europe, which sometimes  holds the keeper of the animal regardless of fault, or based on a pres umption of the keeper’s fault (in particular  of an omission). Some jurisdictions also distinguish between the types of animal (wild or farm animals).   68 See the notes to Article  VI-3:202 DCFR, which sets out strict liability ‘for damage caused by the unsafe  state  of an immovable, inspired by existing laws in Europe, which typically either provide for strict liability or  liability based on a presumption of flawed maintenance (which may or may not be rebutted).   69 BA Koch/  H Koziol , ‘Austria ’, in Unification of  Tort Law: Strict Liability  (fn 66), 14.  70 See Article 1064 of the Croatian Civil Obligations Act (dangerous things and activities); §  2925 of the Czech  Civil Code (extraordinarily dangerous operation); §  1056 of the Estonian Law of Obligations Act (major  source of danger); §  6:535 of the Hungarian Civil Code (extraordinarily dangerous activity);  Article 2050 of  the Italian Civil Code  (dangerous activity); Article 2347 of Latvian Civil Law (activity associated with increased risk for other persons); §  432 of the Slovakian Civil Code (extremely dangerous operation); Article 149 ff of the Slovenian Obligations Code (dangerous objects or activities). The French liability for things  (Article 1242 of the Civil Code) is another peculiar solution not limited to an y specific object or risk.   71 See also the variety of causes of action in the Czech Civil Code (< http://  obcanskyzakonik.justice.cz/  images /   pdf/  Civil -Code.pdf >): Article  2924 (damage caused by an operating gainful activity unless all reasonable care  exercised), Article  2925 (damage caused by a particularly hazardous operation, ‘if the possibility of serious  damage cannot be reasonably excluded in advance even by exercising due care’), Article 2937 (damage  caused by a thing, though with a reversal of the bu rden of proof that the defendant had properly supervised  it).  72 See A rticle 1242 of the French Civil Code  and Article 1384 of the Belgian Civil Code .  73 See supra B.II.  74 See §§ 89e, 91b para graph  8 of the Austrian Gerichtsorganisationsgesetz  (Court Organi sation Act).  
III. Specific challenges to existing tort law regimes posed by emerging digital technologies   New Technologies Formation  27 caps are often further justi fied as contributing to making the risk insurable, as strict liability  statutes often require adequate insurance cover for the liability risks.   A factor which any legislator considering the introduction of strict liability will have to take  into account is  the effect that such introduction may have on the advancement of the technology,  as some may be more hesitant to actively promote technological research if the risk of liability  is considered a deterrent. On the other hand, this allegedly chilling effect of tort law is even  stronger as long as the question of liability is entirely unresolved and therefore unpredictable,  whereas the introduction of a specific statutory solution at least more or less clearly delimits the risks and contributes to making them insurable.  6. Product liability   For more than 30 years, the principle of strict producer liability for personal injury and damage  to consumer property caused by defective products has been an important part of the European  consumer protection system. At the s ame time, the harmoni sation of  strict  liability rules  has  helped to achieve a level playing field for producers supplying their products to different coun-tries. However, while all EU Member States have implemented the Product Liability Directive  (PLD 74F75), liability for defective products is not harmoni sed entirely. Apart from differences in  implementing the directive, 75F76 Member States also continue to preserve alternative paths to compensation in addition to the strict liability of producers for defective produ cts under the PLD .  The PLD  is based on the  principle that the producer ( broadly defined along the distribution  channel ) is liable for damage caused by the defect in a product t hey have put into circulation  for economic purpose s or in the course of their business. 76F77 Interests protected by the European  product liability regime are limited to life and health and consumer property.   The PLD was drawn up on the basis of the technological neutrality principle. According to the  latest evaluation of the directive ’s performance, its regime continues to serve as an effective  tool and contributes to enhancing consumer protection, innovation, and product safety. 77F78 Nonetheless, some key concepts underpinning the EU regime, as adopted in 1985, are today  an inadequate match  for the potential risks of  emerging digital technologies. 78F79 The progressive sophistication of the market and the pervasive penetration of emerging digital technologies reveal  that some key concepts require clarification. This is because the key aspects of the PLD ’s lia                                                  75 Council directive of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions  of the Member States concerning liability for defective products (85 /  374/  EEC).   76 Apart from variations allowed by the directive i tself (art  15 f PLD), there is, for example, no accord on  whether the threshold of 500 ECU in art  9 lit b PLD is a minimum loss (allowing recovery for the entire harm  as long as it exceeds this amount) or a deductible (granting only compensation for any lo ss above the minimum).   77 Art 4 and 7 PLD.   78 Commission Staff Working Document, Evaluation of Council Directive 85 /  374/  EEC, SWD(2018) 157.   79 This was also acknowledged by the (Fifth) Report from the Commission to the European Parliament, the  Council and t he European Economic and Social Committee on the Application of the Council Directive on  the approximation of the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning  liability for defective products (85 /  374/  EEC), COM(2018) 246 final, 8  f. 
B. Liability for emerging digital technologies under existing laws in Europe   28 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  bility regime have been designed with traditional products and business models in mind – material objects placed on the market by a one -time action of the producer , after which the producer does not maintain control over the product. Emerging digital technologies put the existing  product liability regime to the te st in several respects concerning notions of product, defect and  producer.   The scope of the product liability regime rests on the concept of product. For the purposes of  the Directive,  products are defined as movable objects, even when incorporated into another  movable or immovable object, and include electricity. So far, the distinction of products and  services has not encountered i nsurmountable difficulties. However, emerging digital technologies, especially AI systems, challenge that clear distinction and raise open questions. In AI systems, products and services permanently interact and a sharp separation between them is  unfeasible. It is also questionable whether software is covered by the legal concept of product  or product component . It is particularly discussed whether the answer should be different for  embedded and non- embedded software, including over -the-air software updates or other data   feeds. In any case, where such updates or other data feeds are provided from outside the EEA, the victim may not have anybody to turn to within the EEA, as there will typically not be an  intermediary importer domiciled within the EEA in the case of direct  downloads.   The second key element of the product liability regime is the notion of defect. D efectiveness is  assessed on the basis of the safety expectations of an average consumer, 79F80 taking into account  all relevant circumstances. The interconnectivity of products and systems makes it hard to  identify defectiveness. Sophisticated AI autonomous systems with self -learning capabilities  also  raise the question of whether unpredictable deviations in the decision- making path can be  treated as defects. Even if the y constitute a defect, the state -of-the-art defence may apply. Additionally, the complexity and the opacity of emerging digital technologies complicate chances for the victim to discover and prove the defect and prove causation.   As the PLD focuses on the m oment when the product was put into circulation as the key turning  point for the producer ’s liability, this cuts off claims for anything the producer may subsequently add via some update or upgrade. In addition, the PLD does not provide for any duties to monitor the products after  putting them into circulati on. 80F81 Highly sophisticated AI systems  may not be finished products that are put on the market in a traditional way. The producer may retain some degree of control over the product ’s further development in the form of additions  or updates after circulation. At the same time, the producer’s  control may be limited and nonexclusive if the product ’s operation requires data provided by third parties or collected from the  environment, and depends on self -learnin g processes and personali sing settings chosen by the  user. This dilutes  the traditional role of a producer , when a multitude of actors contribute to the  design, functioning and use of the AI product/  system.   This is related to another limitation of liability – most Member States adopted the so -called  development risk defence, which allows the producer to avoid liability if the state of scientific                                                    80 “Safety which a person is entitled  to expect ” (Article 6 para graph  1 PLD) .  81 On the manifold difficulties with the PLD today, see P Machnikowski,  ‘Conclusions ’, in P Machnikowski  (ed), European Product Liability: An Analysis of the State of  the Art in the Era of New Technologies  (2016)  669 (691 ff). 
III. Specific challenges to existing tort law regimes posed by emerging digital technologies   New Technologies Formation  29 and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as  to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered ( Article 7 lit e PLD). The defence may  become much more important practically with regard to sophisticated AI- based products.  It has been mentioned that the PLD regime prot ects life and health as well as consumer property.  With regard to the latter, it is not clear whether it covers damage to data, as data may not be an  ‘item of property ’ within the meaning of A rticle  9 lit b PLD.   7. Contributory conduct   While balancing liability in light of the victim ’s own conduct contributing to their  harm does  not raise new  problems in the era of emerging digital technologies, one should keep in mind  that all challenges listed above with respect to the tortfeasor apply correspondingly to the  victim. This is particularly true if the victim was involved in or somehow benefited from the operation of some smart system or other interconnected digitalised device, e.g. by installing (or  failing to install) updates , by modifying default system settin gs, or by adding their own digital  content. Apart from collisions of autonomous vehicles, further obvious examples include the  home owner who fails to properly install and combine multiple components of a smart home system despite adequate instructions. In  the former case, two similar risks meet, whereas in the  latter the risks of an emerging digital technology have to be weighed against failure to abide by the expected standard of care.   8. Prescription   While there is a certain trend throughout Europe to reform the laws regarding prescription of  tort claims, 81F82 it is unproblematic to apply these rules to scenarios involving emerging digital  technologies. However, one should be aware that particularly in jurisdictions where the pre-scription period is comparat ively short, 82F83 the complexities of these technologies , which may  delay the fact -finding process , may run counter to the interests of the victim by cutting off t heir  claim prematurely, before the technology could be identified as the source of her harm.   9. Proc edural challenges   In addition to the problems of substantive tort law already indicated, the application of liability  frameworks in practice is also affected by  challenges in the field of procedural law. Considering  the tendency of case law experience in some Member States to alleviate the burden of proving  causation in certain complex matters (such as medical malpractice), 83F84 one could easily envisage  that courts might be similarly supportive of  victims of emerging digital technologies who have                                                    82 See, e.g., BA Koch, ‘ 15 Years of Tort Law in Europe – 15 Years of European Tort Law? ’, in E Karner/  B  Steininger (eds), European Tort Law 2015  (2016) 704 (719  f).  83 For example, only one year, as in Spain (Article  1968 of the Civil Code ), as opposed to, e.g., three to six years  elsewhere.   84 See, e.g., BA Koch,  ‘Medical Liability in Europe: Comparative Analysis ’, in BA Koch (ed), Medical Liability  in Europe  (2011) 611 (632 ff).  
B. Liability for emerging digital technologies under existing laws in Europe   30 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  a hard time p roving that the technology in question  was the actual cause of their harm. However,  again this is likely to differ from case to case and most certainly from Member State to Member  State. As far as purely procedural issues are concerned, there may equally b e problems, as well established procedural law concepts  like prima facie evidence may be difficult to apply  to situations involving emerging technological developments .  The ensuing differences in the outcome of cases which result from differences in the procedural  laws of the Member States may be alleviated at least in part by harmonising the rule s on the  burden of proof .  10. Insurance  An obligatory insurance scheme for certain categories of AI/  robots has been proposed as a  possible solution to the problem of allocating liability for damage caused by such systems   (sometimes combined with compensation funds for damage not covered by mandatory insurance policies) . 84F85 However, an obligatory insurance scheme cannot be considered the only answer to the problem of how to allocate liability and cannot completely replace clear and fair  liability rules. Insurance companies form a part of the whole social ecosystem and need liability  rules to protect their own interests in relation to  other entities (redress rights). Moreov er, in  order to keep emerging digital technologies as safe as possible and, therefore, trustworthy, a  duty of care should be affected by insurance as little as possible. Yet, at the same time, cases of  very high or catastrophic risks need to be insured in order to secure compensation for  potentially  serious damage.   Hence, the question relates to whether first -party or third -party insurance , or a combination of  both, should be required or at least recommended and in which cases. 85F86 Currently, EU law  requires o bligatory liability (third -party) insurance e.g. for the use of motor vehicles, 86F87 air carriers and aircraft operators, 87F88 or carriers of passengers by sea. 88F89 Laws of the Member States  require obligatory liability insurance in various other cases, mostly couple d with strict liability  schemes, or for practising certain professions.   New optional insurance policies  (e.g. cyber -insurance) are offered to those interested in covering both first - and third -party risks. Overall, the insurance market is quite heterogeneo us and  can adapt to the requirements of all involved parties. However, this heterogeneity, combined  with a multiplicity of actors involved in an insurance claim , can lead to high administrative                                                    85 See points 57 et seq. of the EP Resolution cited in fn  4 above .  86 The whole insurance system is a combination of public and private obligatory or optional insurance that takes  the form of first -party or third -party insurance.   87 Directive 2009 /  103/  EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 September 2009 relating to  insurance against civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles, and the enforcement of the obligation  to insure against such liability.   88 Regulation (EC) No 785 /  2004 of  the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on insurance  requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators.   89 Regulation (EC) No 392 /  2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 on the liability  of carriers of pa ssengers by sea in the event of accidents.  
III. Specific challenges to existing tort law regimes posed by emerging digital technologies   New Technologies Formation  31 costs both on the side of insurance companies and potential de fendants, the lengthy processing  of insurance claims, and unpredictability of the final result for the parties  involved.   Insurers traditionally use historical claims data to assess risk frequency and severity. In the  future, more complex systems, using highly granular risk profiles based on data analytics, including by analysing data  logged or streamed in real time, will be gaining ground. In the light  of this, the issue of  access to data for insurance companies is very pertinent .   The cost efficiency of the claims process is also an important consideration. 89F90                                                    90 F Pütz et al, ‘Rea sonable, Adequate and Efficient Allocation of Liability Costs for Automated Vehicles: A  Case Study of the German Liability and Insurance Framework ’, European Journal of Risk Regulation (2018 )  9.3: 548 -563. 
New Technologies Formation 32 C. Perspectives on l iability for e merging digital technologies   The promise of benefits and remarkable opportunities for society enabled by a multitude of uses  and applications of emerging digital technologies is incontestable. Despite these indisputable  gains, the pervasive use of increasingly sophisticated systems and combinatio ns of technologies, in multiple economic sectors and societal contexts, creates risks and can cause losses. The  adequacy of current liability legal regimes in Europe to fully compensate damages caused by  these technologies i s, however, questionable. 90F91 To th at end, certain key concepts underpinning  classical liability regimes need legal clarification. Furthermore, to deal with some situations, the formulation of specific rules, principles and concepts might also be necessary to accommodate legal liability regimes to new realities.   1. Challenges of emerging digital technologies  for l iability law ([1]–[2]) [1] Digitalisation brings fundamental changes to our environments , some of which have  an impact on liability law. This affects, in particula r, the   (a) complexity,   (b) opacity,  (c) openness ,  (d) autonomy,  (e) predictability,   (f) data -drivenness, and   (g) vulnerability   of emerging digital technolgies .  [2] Each of these changes may be gradual in nature, but the dimension of gradual change, the range and frequency of situations affected, and the combined effect, results in disruption.   Digitalis ation has changed and is stil l changing the world. T he law of liability in European  jurisdictions has evolved over the course of many centuries and has already survived many  disruptive developments. It therefore does not come as a surprise that, in principle, the law of  liability is able to also cope with emerging digital technologies. However, there are some fundamental changes, each of which may be  only gradual in nature, but whose dimension and  combine d effect results in disruption. 91F92 (a ) Complexity:  Modern- day hardware can be a composite of multiple parts whose interaction  requires a high degree of technical sophistication. Combining it  with an increasing percentage  91 Supra B.III .  92 See also the Commission Staff Working Document (fn  8) 9 ff, 22  f. 
1. Challenges of emerging digital technologies for liability law New Technologies Formation  33 of digital components , including AI, makes such technology even more complex and shifts  it  far away from the archetypes of potentially harmful sources on which the existing rules of liability are based. Where , for example, an AV interacts with other AVs , a connected road infrastructure and various cloud services, it may be increasingly difficult to find out where a problem  has its source and what ultimately caused an accident.  The plurality of actors in digital ecosystems makes  it increasingly difficult to f ind out who might be liable for the damage caused.  Another dimension of this complexity is the internal complexity of the algorithms involved.  (b) Opacity: The more complex emerging digital  technologies become, the less those taking  advantage of their functions or being exposed to them  can comprehend the processes that may  have caused harm to themselves or to others. Algorithms often no longer come as more or less  easily readable code, but as a black -box that has evolved through self -learning and which we  may be able to test as to its effects, but not so much to understand. It is therefore becoming  increasingly difficult for victims to identify such technologies as even a possible source of  harm , let alone why they have caused it . Once a victim has successfu lly claimed damages from  a tortfeasor , the tortfeasor may face similar difficulties at the redress level.   (c) Openness:  Emerging digital technologies are not completed once put into circulation, but  by their nature depend upon subsequent input, in particular more or less frequent updates or  upgrades . Often they need to interact with other systems or data sources in order to function  properly. They therefore need to remain open by design, i.e.  permit external input either via  some hardware plug or through some wireless connection, and come as hybrid combinations of  hardware, software, continuous software updates, and various continuous services. This shift  from the classic notion of a product completed at a certain point in time to a merger of product s  and ongoing services has a considerable impact on, among other thing s, product liability.   (d) Autonomy : Emerging new technologies increasingly perform tasks with less, or entirely  without, human control or supervision. They are themselves capable of altering the initial algorithms due to self -learning capabilities that process external data collected in the course of the  operation. T he choice of such data and the degree of impact it has on the outcome  is constantly  adjusted by the evolving algorithms themselves.  (e) Predictability: Many  systems are designed to not only respond to pre -defined stimuli, but  to identify and classify new ones and link them to a self -chosen corresponding reaction that has  not been pre-programm ed as such . The more external data systems are capable of processing,   and the more they are equipped with increasingly sophisticated AI , the more difficult it is to  foresee the precise impact they will have once in operation.   (f) Data -drivenness:  Emerging digital technologies increasingly depend on external information that is not pre -installed, but generated either by built -in sensors or communicated from  the outside, either by regular data sources or by ad hoc suppliers. Data necessary for the ir proper  functioning may, however, be flawed or missing altogether, be it due to communication errors  or problems of the external data source, due to flaws of the internal sensors or the built -in algorithms designed to analyse, verify and process such data.   (g) Vulnerability: E merging digital technologies are typically subject to more or less frequent  updates and operate in more or less constant interaction with outside information. The built -in 
C. Perspectives on l iability fo r emerging digital technologies   34 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  features granting access to such input make these technologies particularly vulnerable to cybersecurity breaches. These may cause the system itself to malfunction and/  or modify its features  in a way more likely to cause harm.   2. Impact of these c hallenges and n eed for action  ([3]–[4]) [3] While existing rules on liability offer solutions with regard to the risks cr eated by  emerging digital technologies, the outcomes may not always seem appropriate , given  the failure to achieve:   (a) a fair and efficient allocation of loss, in particular because it could not be attributed to those :  whose objectionable behaviour caused the damage; or who benefitted from the activity that caused the damage; or who were in control of the risk that materialise d; or who were cheapest cost avoiders or cheapest takers of insurance. (b) a coherent and appropriate response of the legal system to threats to  the interests of individuals, in particular because victims of harm caused by the operation of emerging digital technologies receive less or no compensation compared  to victims in a functionally equivalent situation involving human cond uct and  conventional technology;  (c) effective access to justice, in particular because litigation for victims becomes  unduly burdensome or expensive.   [4] It is therefore necessary to consider adaptations and amendments to existing liability  regimes, bearing in mind that, given the diversity  of emerging digital technologies  and the correspondingly diverse range of risks these may pose, it is impossible to come up with a singl e solution suitable for the entire spectrum of risks.   Existing liability regimes in all Member State s already now provide answers to the question of  whether the victim of any risk that material ises can seek compensation from another, and under  what conditions. 92F93 H owever, these answers may not always b e satisfying when harm is caused by emerging digital  technologies given the challenges, and for various reasons.  One reason why existing rules on liability may produce unsatisfactory results is that loss resulting from emerging digital technologies is not allocated to the party who is the  most appropriate t o bear that loss . As a general rule, loss normally falls on the victim th emselves ( casum  sentit dominus ) unless there is a convincing reason for shifting it to another party to whom the  loss can be attributed. Reasons for attributing loss to another party vary  depending on which  type of liability is at stake. Under fault- based liability, the pivotal point is that the tortfeasor ’s  objectionable and avoidable behaviour caused the damage, which in turn translates both into a  93 B.III.  
2. Impact o f these ch allenges and need fo r action   New Technologies Formation  35 corrective justice argument and an argument about providing the right incentives to avoid harm.  Under many regimes of strict liability , the pivotal points are benefit and control, i.e. that the  liable person  exposed others to the risks of an activity from which the liable person  benefited   and which was under their control. This again translates into arguments both of corrective justice and of the right incentives. Economic analysis re -phrased these elements by putting the  stress on the cheapest cost avoider  or the cheapest taker of insurance, with the cheapest cost  avoider usually being precisely the person who could simply desist from objectionable behaviour, or who controls a risk and its extent .  Illustration 2.  For traditional road vehicles, it used to be the individual owner (O) who  was the most appropriate person to be  liable, where damage was caused by the vehicle ’s  operation. Regardless of whether or not the damage was caused by O ’s intent or negligence, it was definitely O who benefited from the operation in general, who had the highest degree of control of the risk by deciding when, where and how to use , maintain and  repair the vehicle, and who was therefore also the cheapest cost avoider and taker of  insurance. Where modern autonomous vehicles (AVs) are privately ow ned, it is still the  individual owner who decides when to use the AV and puts the destination  into the system ,  but all other decisions (route, speed etc.) are taken by algorithms provided by the producer (P) of the AV or a third party acting on P ’s behalf . P is also in charge of maint aining the vehicle. P may therefore be the much more appropriate person to be  liable than  O.  Existing rules on liability may also lead to  inappropriate results for reasons related more to  coherence and consistency, in particular taking into account the principle of functional equiv-alence, such as where compensation is denied in a situation involving emerging digital technologies when there would be compensation in a functionally equivalent situation involving  human conduct and conventional technology.  Illustration 3.  Hospital H uses an AI -based surgical robot. Despite the fact that H and  its staff have discharged  all possible duties of care , damage is caused to patient P by way  of some malfunctioning of the robot nobody could have foreseen, and which is unrelated  to the condition in which the robot was shipped. If P were not indemnified for the ensuing  harm, this would be inconsistent with the outcome in the functionally equivalent situation  in which  H ha s employed a human doctor and is liable for that doctor ’s comparable misconduct under national rules of vicarious liability (see C.8 ).  The application of traditional liability rules may also lead to unsatisfactory results because,  while the victim might theoretically receive compensation, litigation would be unduly burdensome and expensive , leaving them without  effective access to justice. This may be the case if  the liability requirements they would have to prove either are entirely unsuitable for the risk  posed by emerging digital technologies or too difficult to establish.  Leaving the victim uncompensated  or undercompensated in such cases may be undesirable, as it may effectively deprive  the victim of basic protection with regard to significant legally protected interests of theirs  (such  as life, health, bodily integrity and property, or other important rights).  In many situations , a particular outcome is not satisfactory  for two or more of the above reasons . 
C. Perspectives on l iability fo r emerging digital technologies   36 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  It is clear from the outset that no one -size-fits-all solution  can ( or should) be offered. Instead,  it is necessary to consider a range of options, with the choice within that range to be determined  by various factors. V arious policy arguments  have shown that  strict liability of the operator of  some emerging digital technology may be justified, given  the competing interests of said operator and of the victim , as well as the victim’s alternatives to getting  compensation ( [9]-[12]). In  the case of a product defect, the manufacturer of that prod uct may be the appropriate addressee  of claims arising out of such defects ( [13]- [15]). However, adapting the notion of fault liability  by specifying further duties of care  ([16]- [17]) , or by shifting the burden of proving fault   ([22](b), [24](b), [27]) , for example, may already resolve disruptive effects of emerging  digital  technologies in the field of tort law, if necessary and appropriate at all. Remaining gaps may  often be filled by extending vicarious liability to the use of autonomous technology in lieu of  human auxiliaries ( [18]). If there are  systemic practical difficulties in proving causation  and  other factors , it may be necessary to make some adjustments in this respect ([22], [24], [25][26], [29]- [30]).  An insurance requirement may be necessary in some cases, to ensure that victims will get compensation ([33]). Compensation funds can also play a complementary role  ([34] ).  3. Bases of liability  ([5]–[7]) [5] Comparable risks should be addressed by similar liability regimes, existing differ-ences among these should ideally be eliminated. This should also determine which  losses are recoverable to what exten t.  [6] Fault liability (whether or not fault is presumed), as well as strict liability for risks  and for defective products, should continue to coexist. To the extent these overlap,  thereby offering the victim more than one basis to seek compensation against m ore  than one person, the rules on multiple tortfeasors ( [31]) govern.  [7] In some digital ecosystems, contractual liability or other compensation regimes will apply alongside or instead of tortious liability . This must  be taken into account  when  determining to  what extent the latter needs to be amended.   In most cases,  also with emerging digital technologies, more than one basi s of liability  may  be invoked if the risks they carry with them  materialise. These bases of liability may either all  or in part be available to the immediate victim, or to the various parties involved. This raises  the question of whether the first person who paid compensation to the victim can recover at  least part of their  compensation payment from another party.  Illustration 4.  For example, if the operator of an autonomous vehicle  (O) is held strictly  liable for any losses caused by its operation, but the producer of the autonomous vehicle  (P) is also liable because the accident was caused by a product defect, O may pass on 
3. Bases of liab ility  New Technologies Formation  37 some or all of that ri sk on the recourse level to P, if it is O, or O ’s insurer, who has paid  damages to the victim in the first place. 93F94 Dr awing the line between liability in tort and contractual liability is often difficult. Doing so  becomes all the more important in jurisdict ions that do not allow concurrent claims under both  regimes, such as France. 94F95 Jurisdictions that do allow concurrent claims  tend to overcome deficiencies of tort  law by shifting tort cases into the realm of contractual liability , for example   by creating quasi -contractual obligations with the prime purpose of allowing the beneficiaries  of such obligations to avail themselves of the benefits of a contractual claimant. 95F96 However,  there is always a limited group of victims who benefit from such contract theories, and victims  who are outside the scope of application may still face serious difficulties.   To the extent that victims of emerging digital technologies already have claims under such  contract theories, the liability gap created by the disrup tive effects of these technologies may  be narrow or even non -exist ant, at least with regard  to the immediate victims of the risks of the  technologies in question. However,  those paying compensation to them under contract liability  may still want to seek re course against , for example , the manufacturer of the product they sold ,  which caused harm to their customers  or users.  The availability of a contractual claim of recourse against another party may also come into  play in deciding whether  or not  the party in question may be the appropriate addressee of the  victim ’s tort claim. 96F97 In  certain damage scenarios, such as healthcare, there may be other systems in place to protect  the immediate victims. This has to be taken into account when determining to what extent (and where exactly) emerging digital technologies pose challenges to existing liability regimes.  4. Legal p ersonality  ([8]) [8] For the purposes of liability, it is not necessary to give autonomous systems  a legal  personality   Over the years, there have been many proposals for extending some kind of legal personality  to emerging di gital technologies , some even dating from the last century . 97F98 In recent times, the  EP report on ‘Civil Law Rules on Robotics’ 98F99 called on the Commission to create a legislative  instrument to deal with  liability caused by robots. It also asked  the Commission to consider  ‘a  94 See the choices made in  the PLD in this respect.   95 See M Martín -Casals (ed), The Borderlines of Tort Law: Interactions With Contract Law (2019).   96 See, for example, the concept of a contract with protective duties in relation to  third parties, which was (and  is still being) used in Austria to pursue direct claims of the victims of defective products against the manufacturer alongside the strict liability regime of the PLD.   97 This is one reason why the manufacturer of the final product is typically singled out as the primary person to address  product liability claims to, because they may have a contractual claim against the producer of a component (or at least have assigned the risk of harm to third parties internally).   98 See, e.g., L Solum , ‘Legal Personhood for Artificial Intelligences ’, 70 NC  L Rev 1231 (1992).   99 Footnote  4 above . 
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologi es  38 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  specific legal status for robots ’, ‘possibly applying electronic personality’,  as one liability solution. 99F100 Even in such a tentative form, this proposal proved highly controversial. 100F101 Le gal personality comes in many forms , even for natural persons , such as children , who may  be treated differently from adults . The best -known class of other- than-natural persons, corporations , have long enjoyed only a limited set of rights and obligations that allows them to sue  and be sued, enter into contracts, incur debt, own property, and be convicted of crimes. G iving  robots or AI  a legal personality would not require including all the rights natural persons, or  even companies, have . Theoretically, a legal personality could consist solely of obligations.  Such a solution, however, would not be practically useful, since civil liability is a property  liability, requiring its bearer to have assets.   Still, the experts believe there is currently no need to give a  legal personality  to emerging  digita l technologies. Harm caused by even fully  autonomous technologies is  generally reducible  to risks attributable to natural persons or existing categories of legal persons, and where this is  not the case , new laws directed at individuals are a better response than creating a new category  of legal person. 101F102 Any sort of legal personality  for emerging digital technologies may raise a  number of ethical issues.  More importantly, it would only make sense to go down that road if  it helps legal systems to tackle the challenges of emerging digital technologies. 102F103 Any additional personality should go hand- in-hand with funds assigned to such electronic persons, so  that claims  can be effectively brought against them . This would amount t o putting a cap on  liability and – as experience with corporations has shown – subsequent attempts to circumvent  such restrictions by pursuing claims against natural or legal persons to whom electronic persons can be attributed, effectively  ‘piercing the e lectronic veil’. 103F104 In addition, in order to give a real  dimension to liability, electronic agents would have to be able to acquire assets on their own .  This would require the resolution of several  legislative problems related to their legal capacity  and how they act when performing legal transactions.  Illustration 5.  Imagine liability for a fully autonomous car were on the car instead of its  operator. Victims of accidents would receive compensation only if insurance is taken out for the car and someone (who?) pays the premi ums, or if someone (who?) provides the  car with assets from which damages could be paid. If such assets did not suffice to fully compensate the victims of an accident, said victims  would have a strong incentive to seek  compensation from the person benefiting from the operation of the car instead.

Legal personality  New Technologies Formation  39 car’s assets were sufficient to pay the same level of compensation as under existing liability and insurance regimes, th ere would not be any cause for discussion, but in that  case,  giving the car a legal per sonality would be a mere formality and not really change  the situation.  The experts wish to stress, however, that they only look at the liability side of things and do not  take any kind of position on the future development of company law  – whether an AI could act  as a member of a board, for example.  5. Operator’ s strict l iability  ([9]–[12]) [9] Strict liability is a n appropr iate response to the risks posed by emerging digital technologies, if , for example, they are operated in non -private environments and may  typically cause significant harm .  [10] Strict liability should lie with  the person who is in control of the risk connected with  the operation of emerging digital technologies and who benefits from their operation   (operator).  [11] If there are two or more operators, in particular  (a) the person primarily deciding on and benefitting from the use of the relevant  technology (frontend operator) and   (b) the person continuously defining the features of the relevant technology and  providing essential  and ongoing  backend support (backend operator),  strict liability should lie with  the one who has more control over the risks of the  operation.  [12] Existing defences and statutory exceptions from strict liability may have to be reconsidered in the light of emerging digital technologies, in particular if these defences and exceptions are ta ilored primarily to  traditional notions of control by humans.   Existing strict liability rules in the Member States may already apply to emerging digital technologies. T he best example of this is liability regimes for motoris ed vehicles that  will most  likely already apply  to autonomous cars, or for aircraft , (that may already include at least some  drones). However, the situation in Europe still varies a lot.  Some jurisdictions have more or less  generous general clauses , or at least allow analogy to existing statutory regimes, whereas others  do without the fault requirement in only very few , narrowly defined situations , but often expand  the notion of fault. Strict liability typically only applies in cases of physical harm  to persons or  property, but not for pure economic loss. Even in the same jurisdiction, there can be  considerable differences between the various strict liability regimes, as shown by the diverse range of  defences available to the liable person, or by the legislator ’s choice in favour of or against caps.  
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologi es  40 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  The mere fact that technology is new is not justification enough for introducing strict liability .  Nevertheless, emerging digital technologies that may typically cause significant harm 104F105 c omparable to the risks already subject to strict liability should also be subject to strict liability .  This is because victims should be treated alike if they are exposed to and ultimately harmed by  similar dangers.   For the time being, this applies primarily to  emerging digital  technologies which move in public spaces, such as vehicles, drones, or the like . Smart home appliances will typically not be  proper candidates for strict liability.  It is in particular objects of a certain minimum weight ,  moved at a certain minimum speed , that are candidates for  additional bases of strict liability,  such as AI-driven  delivery or cleaning robots, at least if they are operated in areas w here others  may be exposed to risk. Strict liability  may not be appropriate for merely stationary robots ( e.g.  surgical or industrial robots), even if AI -driven, which are exclusively employed in a confined  environment, with a narrow range of people exposed to risk, who in addition are protected by  a different – including contractual – regime (in the illustrations  below, patients protected by  contractual liability or factory staff covered by workmen’ s compensation schemes). 105F106 I llustration 6.  The sensors controlling the path of a n AI-driven  robot transporting heavy  component parts in Factor y F malfunction, causing the robot to leave its  intended path,  exit the factory and run into passer -by P on the street. Even if existing rules of strict motor  vehicle liability may not apply in this case , P should still be able to seek compensation  from F without having to prove that F  or of one of its staff is at fault .  If the relevant risk threshold for an emerging digital technology is reached and it therefore  seems appropriate to make the operation of this  technology subject to a strict liability regime,  said regime should share the same features as other no -fault liabilities  for comparable risks .  This also applies to the question which losses are recoverable to what extent, including whether  caps should be introduced and whether non-pecuniary damage is recoverable.  The introduction of strict liability should offer victims easier access to compensation , without  excluding, of course, a parallel fault liability claim if its requirements are  fulfilled. 106F107 Furthermore, while strict liability will typ ically channel liability onto the liable person (for example,  the operator of the technology), this  person will retain the right to seek recourse from others  contributing to the risk, such as the producer.   The experts have discussed extensively whether strict liability for emerging digital technologies  should rather be on the owner /  user/  keeper of the technology than on its producer. It has been  pointed out , in particular in the context of autonomous cars , that while the vast majority of  accidents used to be caused by human error  in the past, most accidents will be caused by the  malfunctioning of technology in the future (though not necessarily of the autonomous car itself). This in turn could mean that it would not be appropriate to hold the owner /  user/  keeper  strictly liable in the first place , because it is the producer who is the cheapest cost avoider and  who is primarily in a position to control the risk of accidents. On the other hand, it is still the  105 The significance being determined by the interplay of the potential frequency and the severity of pos sible  harm.   106 See also  Illustration 3 above .  107 See Illustration 9 below.  
5. Operator's strict liability New Technologies Formation  41 owner/  user/  keeper who dec ides when, where and for which purposes the technology is used,  and who directly benefits from its  use. Also, if strict liability  for operati ng the technology (besides product liability) w ere on the producer , the cost of insurance would be passed on to the   owners anyway through the price mechanism.  On balance the NTF of the Expert Group does not consider the traditional concepts of owner/ user/  keeper  helpful in the context of emerging digital technologies. Rather, the y prefer the more  neutral and flexible concept of ‘ operator ’, which refers to the person who is in control of the  risk connected with the operation of emerging digital technologies and who benefits from  such  operation. ‘Control’ is a variable concept, though, ranging from  merely activating the technology, thus exposing third parties to its potential risks , to determining the output or result (such  as entering the destination of a vehicle or defining the next tasks of a robot), and may include  further steps in between , which affect  the details of  the operation from start to stop. However,  the more sophisticated and more autonomous a system, the less someone exercises actual ‘control’ over the details of the operation, and defining and influencing the algorithms, for example   by continuous updates, may have a greater  impact than just starting the system .  With emerging digital technologies, there is often more than just one person who may, in a  meaningful way, be considered as ‘operating’ the technology. The owner /  user/  keeper may operate the technology on the frontend, but there is often also a central backend provider  who,  on a continuous basis, defines the features of the technology and provides essential backend support services.  This backend operator may have  a high degree of control over the operational  risks others are exposed to . From an economic point of view , the backend operator also benefits  from the operation, because that operator profits  from data generated by the operation, or that  operator’s  remuneration i s directly calculated on the basis of the duration, continuous nature or  intensity of the operation, or because a one -off payment this backend operator  has received  reflects the estimated overall duration, continuous nature and intensity of the operation.  Illustration 7.  An AV may be privately owned by an individual who decides whether to  use the AV for shopping or for going on a business trip, and how often, when and where. This individual is the frontend operator. The producer of the AV or another service provider is lik ewise controlling the AV on a continuous basis, e.g. by continuous ly providing  cloud navigation services, continuous ly updating map data or the AV software as a result  of supervised fleet machine learning,  and deciding when the AV needs what kind of  mainte nance. This person is the  backend operator. Of course frontend and backend operator may also be the same person, such as in a ‘ mobility as a service ’ scheme (MaaS),  where an AV is operated by a fleet operator who is also the backend operator.   Where there is more than one operator, such as a frontend and a backend operator, the experts  find that strict liability should be on the one who has more control over the risks posed by the  operation. While both control and benefit are decisive for qualifying a person as operator, the  benefit is often very difficult to quantify, so relying only on benefit as the decisive factor  for  deciding who, out of two operators, should be liable, would lead to uncertainty.  Very often, the frontend operator will have more control , but where emerging digital technologies become more backend -focused , there may be  cases where so much continuous control over  the technology remains with the  backend operator that – despite the fact that the technology is  
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologi es  42 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  sold to individual owners – it is more convincing  to hold the backend operator liable  as the  person primarily in a position to control, reduce and insure the risks associated with the use of  the technology.  Ideally, in order to avoid uncertainty, the legislator should define which operator  is liab le under  which circumstances, and all other matters  that need to be regulated (concerning insurance  for  example) . For instance, the legislator could decide that for AVs with a level of automation of 4  or 5, it is the provider running the system and who enters the AV  in the national registry who   is liab le. This provider would therefore also take out insurance and could pass on the premiums   through the fees paid for its services. Where several providers  fulfil the function of backend  operators , one of them would have to be designated as responsible operator for every AV.  What has been said so far can , in most Member States, largely be implemented by way of a  simple extension of existing schemes of strict liability. However, as these schemes stan d today  in many  Member States, they include a range of defences, exceptions and exclusions that may  not be appropriate for emerging digital technologies, because they reflect a focus on continuous  control by humans for example.  Illustration 8.  Several national traffic liability schemes focus on the existence of a  driver   or allow for a defence in case of an unavoidable event or similar notions. These concepts  do not translate properly into risk scenarios involving emerging digital technologies be-cause the  driver of an AV more resembles a passenger and because liability (or the exclusion of it) can no longer be linked to human control, which is typically missing entirely,  at least with level 5 AVs.   6. Producer ’s strict l iability  ([13]–[15]) [13] Strict liability of the producer should play a key role in indemnifying damage caused  by defective products and their components , irrespective of whether they take a tangible or a digital form.  [14] The producer should be strictly liable for defects in emerging digital technologies   even if said  defects appear after the product was put into circulation , as long as the  producer was still in control of updates to , or upgrades o n, the technology . A d evelopment risk defence should not apply.   [15] If it is proven that an emerging digital technology has caused harm , the burden of  proving defect should be reversed if there are disproportionate difficulties or costs  pertaining to  establishin g the relevant level of safety or proving  that this level of  safety  has not been met . This is without prejudice to the reversal of the burden of  proof referred to  in [22]  and [24].  In the opinion of the NTF of the Expert Group, the principle of producer re sponsibility, adopted  in relation to traditional products,  should also apply to emerging digital technologies. The motives  behind it, such as a fair distribution of the risks and benefits associated with commercial  production, the spreading of the costs of  individual harm to all buyers of a given type of product, 
6. Producer's strict liability New Technologies Formation  43 and prevention, are fully valid even if the product or  one of  its essential component s is in digital  form .  It is in line with the principle of functional equivalence  (see [3](b) ), that d amage caused by   defective digital content should trigger the producer ’s liability because digital content fulfils  many of the functions tangible movable items used to fulfil when the PLD was drafted and  passed. This is all the more true for defective digital ele ments of other products, some of which  come separately from the tangible item ( for example, as a control app to be downloaded onto  the user ’s smartphone), or as  over- the-air updates after the product  has been put into circulation  (security updates for exam ple), or as digital services provided on a continuous basis during the  time the product i s being used ( for example,  navigation cloud services).  When the defect came into being as a result of the producer ’s interference with the product  already put into cir culation ( by way of a software update  for example ), or the producer ’s failure  to interfere, it should be regarded as a defect in the product for which the producer is liable.  The point in time at which a product is placed on the market  should no t set a strict limit on  the producer’ s liability for defects where, after that point in time, the producer or a third party  acting on behalf of the producer remains in charge of providing updates or digital services . The  producer should therefore remain liable where the defect has its origin (i) in a defective digital  component or digital ancillary part or in other digital content or service s provided for the product with the producer ’s assent after the product h as been  put into circulation; or (ii) in the absence of an update of digital content , or of the provision of a digital service which would have  been required to maintain the expected level of safety  within the time period for which the  producer is obliged to provide such updates .  Only recently, the E U has co nfirmed in Directive (EU) 2019/771 on the sale of goods that a  seller is also liable for such digital elements being in conformity with the contract, including  for updates provided for as long a period as the consumer may reasonably expect, and Directive  (EU 2019/770 establishes a similar regime for digital content and digital services . The proposed  features of a producer’ s strict liability are v ery much in the same vein and follow very much  the same logic, though on different grounds.  As indicated above, e merging digital technologies are characterised by limited predictability.  This phenomenon will intensify with the dissemination of machine learning. The interconnectedness of devices , as well as threats to cyber security , also contribute to difficulties in  predicting  the product ’s performance. A defect in digital content or in a product with digital elements may  therefore result from the impact of the environment in which the product operates or from the  product’ s evolution, for which the manufacturer only created a general framework but  which  they did not design in detail. In view of the need to share benefits and risks efficiently and fairly,  the development risk defence , which allows the producer to avoid liability for unforeseeable  defects, should not be  available in cases where it was predictable that unforeseen developments  might occur.  Features of emerging  digital technologies, such as opacity, openness, autonomy and limited  predictability  (see [1]), may often result in unreasonable difficulties or cos ts for the victim to  establish both what  safety an average use r is entitled to expect , and the failure to achieve this 
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologi es  44 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  level of safety . At the same time, it may be significantly  easier for the producer  to prove relevant  facts. This asymmetry justifies the reversal of the burden of proof.  The victim should also benefit from an alleviation of evidentiary burden with regard to the  causal relationship between a defect and the damage (see [26] ).  Producers’ strict liability for defective products should be supplemented with fault -based liability for failure to discharge monitoring duties (see [17](b)).  7. Fault l iability and d uties of care ([16]–[17]) [16] Operators of emerging digital technologies should have to comply with an adapted  range of duties of care, including with regard to   (a) choosing the right system for the right task  and s kills;  (b) monitoring the system; and   (c) maintaining the system.   [17] Producers, whether or not they incidentally also act as operators within the meaning  of [10], should have to :  (a) design, describe and market products in a way effectively enabling operators  to comply with the duties under [16] ; and  (b) adequately monitor the product after putting it into circulation.   For the use of more traditional technologies , it is already recognised that their operators have  to discharge  a range of duties of care. They relate  to the choice of technology, in particular in  light of the tasks to be performed and the operator ’s own skills and abilities; the organisational  framework provided, in particular  with regard to proper monitoring ; and maintenance , including any safety checks and repair. Failure to comply with such duties may trigger fault liability   regardless of whether the operator may also be strictly liable for the risk created by the technology.  Illustration 9.  Despite adverse weather conditions due to a heavy storm , which were entirely foreseeable, r etailer (R) continues to employ drones to deliver goods to customers.  One of the drones is hit by a strong wind, falls to the ground and severely injures a passerby. 107F108 R may not only be strictly liable for the risks inherent in operating drones, but also  for its failure to interrupt the use of such drones during the storm.  In many national legal systems, courts have raised the relevant duty of care to a point where it  is difficult to draw the line between fault liability and strict liability. With emerging digital  technologies, such duties of care  – despite all new opportunities and safety- enhancing technologies these systems may feature – are often  magnified even more.  108 This illustration is inspired by a hypothetical of the Commission Staff Working Document (fn 8) 12.  
7. Fault liability and duties of care New Technologies Formation  45 Illustration 10. Airline A buys a plane from producer P. A new AI element  of the auto  pilot may, under very exceptional circumstances, cause the plane to crash if the software  is not manually disabled by the pilot. Airline A has a duty of care to make  itself familiar  with the new feature, to monitor the plane and to make sure pilots receive appropriate  training and exchange information about and experience of dealing with the new software. If A breaches this duty , A may be liable under fault liability (without prejudice to  existing international legal instruments that may limit A ’s liability).   The more advanced technologies become , the more difficult it is for operators to develop the  right skills and discharge all duties. While the risk of insufficient  skills should still be borne by  the operators , it would be unfair to leave producers entirely out of the equation. Rather, producers have to design, describe and market products in a way effectively enabling operators to discharge their duties.   Illustration 11. In Illustration 10, it is primarily P who has to alert its customer (A) to  the particular features and risks  of the software in question, and possibly to offer the  necessary training courses, and to monitor the system once it is on the market.  Under many national jurisdictions, a general product monitoring duty on the part of producers  has already been developed for the purposes of tort law. In the light of the characteristics of  emerging digital technologies, in particular their openness and dependency on the  general digital environment, including the emergence of new malware, such a monitoring duty would also  be of paramount importance.  8. Vicarious l iability for autonomous s ystems ([18]–[19]) [18] If harm is caused by a utonomous technology used in a way functionally equivalent  to the employment of human auxiliaries , the operator ’s liability  for making use of  the technology should correspond to the otherwise existing vicarious liability regime  of a principal for such auxiliaries .  [19] The benchmark  for assessing performance by autonomous technology in the context  of vicarious liability is primarily the one accepted for human auxiliaries. However,   once aut onomous technology outperforms human auxiliaries , this will be determined by the performance of comparable available technology which the operator  could be expected to use , taking into account  the operator’s duties of care ([16]).  One option proposed for addressing the risks of emerging digital technology is the potential  expansion of the notion of vicarious liability, leaving the respective national regime of liability   for others  intact , but expanding it (either directly or by way of analogy) to functional ly equiv-
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologies   46 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  alent situations  where use is made of autonomous technology  instead of using a human auxiliary. 108F109 This may complement strict liability within the meaning of [9]-[12], and fault liability  based on the notion of enhanced duties of care within the meaning of [16]. 109F110 I llustration 12. A hospital uses a n AI-driven  surgical robot. Despite the fact that the hospital has complied with all possible duties of care , a patient is harmed because the robot  malfunction s in a way nobody could have foreseen. The hospital should be liable, in any  case, under the principle outlined in [18].  The scope and conditions for the application of vicarious liability vary from one country to  another, as a result of t he different ways national legal systems have developed and the resulting  broader or narrower scope of application of strict liability they adopted. However, t he development of emerging digital technologies, in particular systems with a high degree of decision making autonomy, requires that the requirements of equivalence be respected (see 2[3](b) ).  Where the use of a human  auxiliary would give rise to the liability of a principal, the use of a  digital technology tool instead should not allow the principal to avoid liability . Rather, it  should  give rise to such liability  to the same extent .  However, as the laws stand in many jurisdictions, the notion of vicarious liability at present requires the auxiliary to have misbehaved (though as assessed according  to the standards applicable to the principal). In the case of a machine or technology, this triggers the question  according to which benchmarks such “conduct” should be assessed. The experts discussed this  in some depth, but did not come to a final conclusion. However, the most convincing answer  seemed to be that the benchmark for assessing performance by autonomous technology should  primarily be the benchmark accepted for human auxiliaries, but once autonomous technology  outperforms human auxiliaries in t erms of preventing harm , the benchmark  should be determined by the performance of comparable technology that is available  on the market . 110F111 As there  is usually a broad range of technologies available, which may feature very different safety  benchmarks , in choosing the appropriate point of comparison, the same principles should apply  as with traditional technologies  (such as  x-ray machines or other equipment ), i.e. reference  should be made to the operator ’s duty of care with regard to the choice of system (s ee [16](a) ).  Illustration 13. In the example of the surgical robot  (Illustration 12 ), it is not difficult to  establish relevant misconduct where, for example, the cut made by the robot is twice as  long as one a human surgeon would have made. If the cut is longer than the best robots  on the market  would have made , but still shorter than that of  a human surgeon, the question of whether the hospital should have bought a better robot must be answered according to the same principles as the question of whether a hospital should have bought a  better X -ray machine or employed extra doctors.  109 See B.III.4 above .  110 In many legal systems, some or all types of vicarious l iability are in any case considered  a subcategory of the  former or the latter .  111 R Abbott,  86 Geo Wash L Rev  1 (2018).  
9. Logging by design  New Technologies Formation  47 9. Logging by d esign  ([20] –[23]) [20] There should be a duty on producers to equip technology with means of record ing  information about the operation of the technology (logging by design), if such information is typically essential for establish ing whether a risk of the technology materialised, and if logging is appropriate and proportionate, taking into account, in particular, the technical feasibility and the costs of logging, the availability of alternative means of gather ing such information, the type and magni tude of the risks posed  by the technology, and any adverse implications logging may have on the rights of  others.  [21] Logging must be done in accordance with otherwise applicable law, in particular  data protection law and the rules concerning the protection of  trade secrets.   [22] The absence of logged  information or failure to give the victim reasonable access to  the information should trigger a rebuttable presumption that the condition of liability to be proven by the missing information  is fulfilled.   [23] If and to the  extent that , as a result of the presumption  under [22], the operator were  obliged to compensate the damage, the operator  should have  a recourse claim  against the producer who failed to equip the technology with logging facilities .  Emerging digital technologies not only give rise to unprecedented complexity and opacity.  They  also offer unprecedented possibilities of reliable and detailed documentation  of events  that may enable the identification inter alia of what has caused an accident. This can usu ally be  done using log files , which is why it seems desirable to impose, under certain circumstances, a  duty to provide for appropriate logging and to disclose the data to the victim  in readable format .  Any requirements must definitely be suitable for the goals  to be achieved and proportionate,  taking into account, in particular, the technical feasibility and costs of logging, the values at  stake, the magnitude of the risk, and any adverse implications for  the rights of others. Logging  would have to be done in such a way that no interested party could manipulate the data  and that  the victim and/or the person who compensates the victim in the first place, for example  an  insurance provider , has access to it. Furthermore, it goes without saying that logging must be  done in accordance with otherwise applicable law , notably on data protection and the protection of trade secrets.   Illustration 14. There would be a logging duty in the case of AVs. Traffic accidents occur  rather frequently and often cause severe harm to the life and health of humans. Motor  vehicles are very sophisticated and expensive anyway, so  adding logging technology  should not significantly increase  the costs of production. There is a lot of data that can  reasonably be logged and will serve to reconstruct events and ca usal chains that are both  essential for allocating liability ( for example  by finding out which AV has caused the  crash by not replying to a signal sent by the other AV) and could hardly be reconstructed otherwise.  
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologies   48 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  Illustration 15. Logging would not be advisable, however, in the case of an AI-equipped  doll for children. T he risks associated with the doll are not of a kind where logging would  be a suitable response. With regard to the risk of hidden merchandising, meaning that the  doll manipulates the child’ s mind by mentioning and repeating certain product brands,  the negative implications of logging (which would have to include, to a certain extent, the  recording of conversations) for data protection would outweigh any possible benefit. With  regard to the risk of a stranger hacking into the doll, the proper response is more cybersecurity to prevent this, not a duty to log.  Failure to comply with a logging and disclosure duty should lead to a rebuttable presumption  that the information would, if logged and disclosed, have rev ealed that the relevant element of  liability is fulfilled.   Illustration 16. Take the example of a crash between A ’s AV and B ’s AV, injur ing B . The  traffic situation was one where , normally, the two AVs would exchange data and “negotiate” which AV enters the lane first. Whe n sued by B , A refuses to disclose the data  logged in her AV ’s recordings . It is therefore presumed that her AV sen t a signal telling  B’s AV to enter the lane first, but nevertheless went  first itself.   If a product used by the operator failed to contain a logging option ( for example, in violation of  mandatory regulatory requirements or in contrast to other products of such kind)  and the operator is , for this reason, exposed to liability, the operator should be able to pass on the loss resulting from her inability to comply with the duty of disclos ing logged data to the victim (typically resulting in the operator’ s liability towards the victim ) to the producer . This can be  achieved in various ways, including by allowing a separate claim, or by subrogation.  Illustration 17. Imagine that, in Illustration 16 , it is not that A refused to disclose the  data, but that A’s  AV failed  to log th e kind of data in question. If A had to pay damages  to B for this reason only, she should also be able to sue the producer.  10. Safety r ules ([24]) [24] Where the damage is of a kind that safety rules were meant to avoid , failure to comply with such safety rules, including rules on cybersecurity,  should l ead to a reversal  of the burden of proving   (a) causation, and /  or  (b) fault, and/  or  (c) the existence of a defect .  With enhanced complexity, openness and vulnerability, there comes a  greater  need to introduce  new safety rules . Digital product safety differs from product safety in traditional terms in a  number of ways, including by taking into account any effect a product may have on the user ’s  digital environment. Even more importantly, cybersecurity has become essential. 111F112 112 Cf the Commission Staff Working Document (fn 8) 20.  
10. Safety rules New Technologies Formation  49 As to the consequences of compliance or n on-compliance with such rules , the experts considered two different solutions. One solution was that failure to comply with the rules  may lead to  a reversal of the burden of proof  concerning key elements of liability, including causation  and fault. The  other solution  was that compliance with the rules leads to a presumption of the  absence of causation or fault. The experts decided in favour of the first solution, because it is  better suited to addressing  the difficulties of victims when it comes to proving the elements of  liability in settings that involve emerging digital technologies. It is in particular the pace at  which these technologies are evolving, and the necessity of imposing a duty on providers  to  monitor the market and react more quickly to new threats than any rulemaker could, that made  it seem inappropriate to have a presumption of the absence of causation or fault where a pro-vider complied with the rules.  Illustration 18. Imagine there is a new rule on  cybersecurity of IoT household equipment,  designed to prevent hacking and the resulting harm. The victim ’s private Wi -Fi is hacked  in a way typical of cybersecurity gaps in  IoT equipment. Where t he victim can show that   a water kettle produced by P failed to  com ply with  the standard of safety under adopted  safety rules, the victim could sue P , and the onus  would be on P to prove that the damage  had been caused by a different device.  It should be stressed that this refers only to rules adopted by the lawmaker, suc h as those  adopted under the “ New Regulatory Approach”, and not to mere technical standards developing  in practice.   The reversal of the burden of proof discussed here  is essential in the area of fault -based liability.  In the case of producer liability , a similar principle is already applied in many jurisdictions in  the context of national PLD implementations. It is assumed that failure to meet a safety standard  means that the product does not provide the level of safety that the consumer is entitled  to  expect.  Similar reasoning should apply to the liability of the producer of an emerging digital  technology ([13] – [15]).   11. Burden of proving causation ([2 5]–[26]) [25] As a general rule, the victim should continue to be required to prove what caused  her harm.   [26] Without prejudice to the reversal of the burden of proof proposed in [22] and [24](a),  the burden of proving causation may be alleviated in light of the challenges of emerging digital technologies if a balancing of the following factors warrants doing so:  (a) the likelihood that the technology at least contributed to the harm;   (b) the likelihood that the harm was caused either by the technology or by some  other cause within the same sphere ;  (c) the risk of a known defect within the technology, even though its actual causal  impact is not self- evident;   (d) the degree of ex -post traceability and intelligibility of processes within the technology that may have contributed to the cause ( informational asymmetry ); 
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologies   50 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  (e) the degree of ex -post accessibility and comprehensibility of data collected and  generated by the technology   (f) the kind and degree of harm potentially and act ually caused.   As is already the standard rule in all jurisdictions, whoever demands compensation from another should in general prove all necessary requirements for such a claim, including in particular  the causal link between the harm to be indemnified on the one hand and the activities or risks  within the sphere of the addressee of the claim may  trigger the latter ’s liability  on the other .  This general principle is supported inter alia by concerns of fairness and results from the need  to consider and bala nce the interests of both sides .  However, given the practical implications of the complexity and opacity of emerging digital  technologies in particular, victims may be in a weaker position to establish causation than in  other tort cases, where the events leading to the harm can be more easily analysed  in retrospect ,  even from the victim’s point of view.  As is true in all jurisdictions, courts have already in the past found ways to alleviate the burden  of proving causation  if the claimant ’s position is deemed weaker than in typical cases. 112F113 This  includes procedural options such as allowing prima facie  evidence, 113F114 applying the theory of  res ipsa loquitur , 114F115 or lowering the standard of proof in certain categories of cases. 115F116 Some  jurisdictions are also prepared to even shift the burden of proving causation entirely if the basis  for holding the defendant liable can be proven as particularly strong by the claimant (such as  the defendant ’s grave misconduct), but the causal link between such faulty behaviour and the  claimant ’s harm is merely suspected , but not proven, by the evidence available to the claimant. 116F117 Yet another  method of aiding the claimant to prove the cause of harm is by focusing on  113 Cf the ruling in CJEU 21.6.2017 C -621/  15 Sanofi Pasteur , ECLI:EU:C:2017:484, where the Court greenlighted a rather far -reaching presumption of causation in French court practice on vaccine damage, as long as  it did not amount to a full -fledged reversal of the burden of proof, which would have infringed A rticle 4 of  the PLD , which  was at stake.   114 Unlike in a fully -fledged reversal of the burden of proof, prima facie  evidence is meant to resolve uncertainties rather than bridge non liquet  situations. The claimant still has to prove (in compliance with ordinary  evidentiary standards) some links i n the alleged chain of causation, but is spared proving  all of them if experience has shown that the missing link is typically given in other similar cases. The defendant can rebut this  by proving (again adhering to traditional standards) that there is a (mere) genuine possibility of a turn of  events deviating from the one expected according to said experience, so that the missing link may indeed have not been given in the present  case.   115 Res ipsa loquitur  is the inference of negligence from the very nature of a harmful event , where the known  circumstances are such that no other explanation for the accident seems possible than negligence within the sphere of the defendant, who had been in full control of the incident that may have caused the harm,  such as  a hospital where the patient has some surgical instrument in her body after an operation. Cf the English case  of Byrne v Boadle, (1863) 2 H & C 722, 159 Eng Repr 299, where a barrel of flour fell out of a warehouse  onto a pedestrian passing by, who was not required to prove the negligence of the flour monger,  as barrels do  not fall out of such premises in the absence of fault within the latter’s sphere. The dealer could in theory have rebutted this by proving some external cause, though.   116 The latte r can often be seen in medical malpractice cases . See BA Koch , ‘Medical Liability in Europe: Comparative Analysis ’, in BA Koch (ed), Medical Liability in Europe  (2011) 611 (nos 46 ff).  117 Again, this is the practice in medical malpractice in countries like Germany, see §  630h para graph  5 BGB,  according to which it is presumed that a treatment error was the cause of the deterioration in  the patient’s 
11. Burden of proving causation  New Technologies Formation  51 whoever is in control of key evidence but fails to produce it, for example, if the defendant is or  should be able to submit internal evidence such as design blueprints, internal expertise, log files  or other recordings, but does not produce such evidence in court, either strategically or because  the evidence was lost or never generated.   Promoting any specific measure would run the risk of interfering with national ru les of procedure in particular. However , in order to offer guidance on the further development and approximation of laws, and in order to allow for a more coherent and comparable line of reasoning,  the experts think that lowering the bar for the claimant to prove causatio n may be advisable for  victims of emerging digital technologies if the following  factors are at play.  First, the technology itself may be known to have certain potentially harmful features, whichcould be taken into account even though it is not (yet) proven that such risks have indeed material ised. If the claimant can prove that there was a defect in a product incorporating emerging digital technologies, thereby creating an extraordinary risk in addition to the ones commonly associated  with flawless products, but – again – the harm caused  cannot be (fully) traced to said defect, this might still be considered in the overall assessment of how to im-plement the burden of proving causation. If there are  multiple possible causes and it remai ns unclear what exactly triggered the harm (or which combination of potential causes at which percentage of probability ), but if the likelihood of all possible causes combined , that are attributable to one party ( e.g. the operator) exceeds a certain thresh old ( e.g. 50% or more), this may also contribute to placing the burden of producing evidence rebutting such first- hand impressions onto that party. Illustration 19. A small delivery robot operated by retailer R injures a pedestrian on the  street. It remains unclear which of the following possible causes triggered the accident: the robot may have been defective from the start ; R may have failed to install a necessary  update that would have prevented the accident ; R’s employee E may have overloaded the  robot ; hacker H may have intentionally manipulated the robot ; some teenagers may have  jumped onto the robot for fun; a roof tile may have fallen off a nearby building, and so  on. 117F118 If the likelihood of all possible causes that are attributable to R  significantly exceeds the likel ihood of all other possible causes, the onus should be on R to prove that  none of the causes within its own sphere triggered the accident.  Considering further aspects that relate to the analysis of the causal events and who is (or should be) predominantly in control of the expertise and evidence contributing to such analysis, one could consider the informational asymmetry  typically found between those developing and producing emerging digital technologies on the one hand and third- party victims on the other  hand as another argument in the overall assessment of who should bear the burden of proving causation and to what extent. This includes the technology itself, but also potential evidence generated by such technology on the occasion of the harmful event. The latter not only considers who can retrieve such data, but also who can read and interpret condition if such an error was grave and in principle prone to causing such harm. See also the Dutch omkeringsregel ; cf A Keirse, ‘G oing Dutch: How to Address Cases of Causal Uncertainty’ , in I Gilead /  M Green /   BA Koch (eds), Proportional Liability: Analytical and Comparative Perspectives  (2013) 227 (232).   118 Cf the hypothetical used by the Commission Staff Working  Document (fn 8) 12.  
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologies   52 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  it (particularly if it is encrypted or only intelligible with specific expert knowledge). One  specific aspect in this context i s if an item that was involved in the harmful event did (or  according to industry standards should) have some logging device installed, which could  have collected information that is capable of shedding light on what actually happened. 118F119 F inally, as is already commonly used as one weighty argument in the overall balance of interests in tort cases, the type and extent of harm may also  contribute to deciding to what extent it should still be the victim who proves the cause of her damage. 119F120 12. B urden of proving f ault ([27]) [27] If it is proven that an emerging digital technology caused harm, and liability therefor is conditional upon a person ’s intent or negligence, the burden of proving fault  should be reversed if disproportionate difficulties and costs of establishing the rele-vant standard of care and of proving their violation  justify it.  This is without prejudice to the reversal of the burd en of proof proposed in [22]  and [24](b).   When the damage results from an activity in which emerging digital technologies play a role,  the victim may face significant difficulties in proving facts that substantiate her damages claim  based on negligence or fault. This justifies rethinking the traditional approach to proving these  conditions of liability .  Adopting any rule concerning the distribution of the burden of proving fault requires explaining  fault in the first place. There is a variety of meanings attached to this word in various legal  systems, ranging from equating fault with wrongfulness of conduct to understanding fault as  purely individual and subjective blameworthiness. 120F121 Thus fault- based liability requires:  a) always a breach  of a certain duty of ca re (standard of conduct); b)in some (probably most) jurisdictions , an intent to breach  this duty of care  or negligence in so doing; c)in some (probably the minority of) jurisdiction s, a negative ethical assessment of the tortfeasor’s conduct as subjectively reprehensible. The standard of conduct may be set by the statute or otherwise normatively prescribed in the  form of regulatory measures or standards and norms enacted by competent authorities. How-ever, it may also be established ex post by the court , on the basis of general criteria such as  reasonableness, diligence, etc.   Emerging digital technologies, in particular the presence of AI, change the structure of fault based liability. The t wo most prominent examples of applying fault-based liability to A I-related  119 See also  [22].  120 As expressed by Article 2:101 para graph  1 PETL, ‘ [t]he scope of protection of an interest depends on its  nature; the higher its value, the precision of its definition and its obviousness, the more extensive is its p rotection. ’  121 See P Widmer, ‘ Comparative Report on Fault as a Basis of Liability and Criterion of Imputation (Attribu tion)’,  in P Widmer  (ed), Unification of Tort Law: Fault  (2005), 331 ff.  
12. Burden of proving fault New Technologies Formation  53 damage are the liability of the producer for damage caused by the product he has produced,  should have monitored, etc. (liability outside the scope of a strict liability regime  such as the  one envisaged under [13] -[15] above ) and liability of the  user (operator) for damage caused by  him while  using an  AI-driven tool.   In the case of the producer’ s liability  (outside strict product liability), the direct cause of damage  is a product, but the damaging features of the product are the effect of the producer’ s negligence  in designing, manufacturing, marketing, monitoring, etc., the product. Thus , proving fault requires proving that the product was not of a required quality and that the producer intentionally  or negligently breached  an applicable stand ard of conduct with regard to this product. The advance of emerging digital technologies increases evidentiary difficulties in relation to:   the quality requirements for the product and details of its actual operation that has led to the damage; breach of a duty of care on the part of the producer with regard to the product  (including the applicable standard of conduct); facts that allow the court to establish that breach  of the duty of care  was intentional or negligent. As far as the user ’s liability is con cerned, the overall structure of liability for actions performed  using tools is the following:  an actor + the use of a tool   victim   an act  causation  damage   [wrongfulness /  fault]  [protected interest]   The challenge of the fault analysis in the traditional model is the assessment of the actor ’s behaviour with regard to: (i) his decision to act; (ii) his decision to use a tool at all, (iii) his choice of tool, (iv) his way of using it or controlling or monitoring its operation.  Thus the actor is at fault if: (i) his decision on the action itself is wrong and there is intent or  negligence in making this decision, or (ii) his decision about using a tool in the action instead  of performing it himself is wrong and there is intent or negligence in making this decision, or  (iii) his choice of tool is faulty (he chooses the kind of tool that is unsuitable to the task or the  right tool he has chosen subsequently malfunctions) and there was intent or negligence in making this choice , or (iv) he uses his tool or controls /  monitors its operation incorrectly and there  is intent or negligence in this behaviour.   Under the general rule of liability, the burden of proving both breach  of a duty of care  and intent  or negligence lies with the victim.  In the traditional  model, the proper functioning of the tool and the expected outcome of its  operation are known and easy to establish and details of the tool ’s actual performance are usually not too difficult to examine. Because of their fast development and their features , described  above (opa city, openness, autonomy and limited predictability), emerging digital technologies  used as tools add further layers of complexity to the fault -based liability model , challeng ing the  operation of fault-based liability rules on two l evels:  
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologies   54 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  a)a structural level: the autonomy and self -learning capacity of the technology may be seen as breaking the causal link between the actor ’s conduct and the damage – this is the problem of attribution of the operation and its outcome to a person, which should be solved by legally ascribing all the emerging digital technology’ s actions and their effects to the operator of the technology ( cf [18] ). b)a practical, fact -finding level: facts on which liability is dependent may be hard to discover and communicate to the court. The difficulty  may be: finding out and explaining to another person how a given set of input data resulted in the outcome of the AI -operated process  and that this amounted to a deficiency in the system; showing the tortfeasor breached a st andard (level) of care in deciding to use this particular emerging digital technology in this concrete situation, or in operating/  monitoring it; establishing that the breach  of this standard was intentional or negligent. In theory, the claimant has to prove that the defendant breached  an applicable standard (level)  of care and did so intentionally or negligently. In practice, however, if the standard of care has  not been normatively prescribed (by a statute or otherwise), the claimant ’s burden extends to  proving (or persuading) what level  of care should apply to the defendant ’s behaviour. The lack  of a clear standard  therefore puts  the party with  the burden of proving the  existence of the  standard, or its breach,  at a disadvantage.   The question is thus whether all these evidentiary difficulties should remain with the victim or  all or some of them, in all or in specific circumstances, should affect the defendant.   Items  of proof , the burden for which normally is on the claimant, but could be allocated to the  defendant are:   breach  of a duty of care  by the defendant ( the producer, with regard to designing, manufacturing, monitoring, etc., and the user with regard to the choice of technology and operating /   monitoring it), intention or negligence of the defendant, substandard qualities of the technology, incorrect functioning of the technology. In various legal systems, various factors  are recogni sed as justifying modification of the burden  of proof in favour of the claimant , in particular:   a)high likelihood of fault, b)the parties ’ practical ability to prove fault, c)violation of statutory obligation by the defendant, d) particular dangerousness of the defendant’ s activity that resulted in damage, e)nature and scope of the damage.
13. Causes within the victim's own sphere New Technologies Formation  55 There are also various legal techniques for doing this, from the statutory reversal of the burden  of proof to all sorts of procedural tools such as prima facie  evidence, presumptions in fact,  adverse inference and so on.   Features of emerging digital technologies such as opacity, openness, autonomy and limited predictability may often result in unreasonable difficulties or costs for the plaintiff to prove facts  necessary for the establishment of fault. At the same time, the proof of relevant facts may be  much easier for the defendant (producer or operator of the technology). This asymmetry justifies the reversal of the burden of proof. While, as mentioned above, in many cases courts may  achieve similar results with various procedural arrangements, the introduction of a clear rule  will ensure the desired convergence and predictability in the application of the law.  13. Causes within the victim ’s own s phere ([28]) [28] If a cause of harm is attributable to  the victim, the reasons for holding another person liable should apply correspondingly when determining if and to what extent the  victim’s claim for compensation may be reduced.   While jurisdictions throughout Europe already now acknowledge that conduct or some other  risk within the victim ’s own sphere may reduce or even exclude her claim for compensation  vis-à- vis another, it seems important to state that whatever the NTF of the Expert Group proposes to enhance the rules on liability for emerging digital technologies should apply accordingly if such technologies are being used within the victim ’s own sphere. This is in line with  the so -called “mirror image” rule of contributory conduct. 121F122 Therefore, if two AVs  collide,  for example, the above -mentioned criteria for identifying the liable operator ([10]- [11]) should  apply correspondingly to determin ing what effect  the impact of the victim ’s own vehicle on her  loss has on the liability of the other AV’ s operator .  14. Commercial and technological u nits ([29]–[30]) [29] Where two or more persons cooperate on a contractual or similar basis in the provision of different elements of a commercial and technological unit, and where the  victim can demonstrate that at least one element has caused the damage in a way triggering liability but not which element, all potential tortfeasors should be jointly  and severall y liable vis -à-vis the victim.   122 Cf comment 5 on Article  VI-5:102 DCFR (The mirror principle) and M Martín Casals/  U Magnus , ‘Comparative Conclusions’, in M Martín Casals/  U Magnus (eds), Unification of Tort Law: Contributory Negligence   (2004 ) 259 (263 ff), highlighting that this mirror i s quite ‘blurred’ (at 264). 
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologies   56 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  [30] In determining what counts as a commercial and technological unit within the meaning of [29] regard is to be had to   (a) any joint or coordinated marketing of the different elements ;  (b) the degree of their technical interdependency a nd interoperation;  and  (c) the degree of specificity or exclusivity of their combination.   Among the many challenges for  victims of emerging digital technologies is the challenge of  showing what part of a complex digital ecosystem has caused the damage. This may be particularly  hard where different elements have been provided by different parties, creating a significant risk for the victim of suing the wrong party and ending up with no compensation and high  litigation costs. It is therefore justified to have special rules for situations where two or more  parties cooperate on a contractual or similar basis in the provision of different elements of one  and the same digital ecosystem, forming a commercial and technological unit. In these situations, all potential to rtfeasors should be jointly and severally liable towards the victim where  the victim can demonstrate that at least one element has caused the damage in a way triggering  liability , but not which element.  Illustration 20. A smart alarm system  produced by manufacturer A was added to a smart  home environment produced by B and set up and installed by C. This smart home hub  runs on an ecosystem developed by provider D. A burglary occurs, but the police is not  duly alerted by the alarm system , so s ignificant damage is caused. 122F123 A, B and D are  linked by sophisticated contractual arrangements concerning the interoperation of the relevant components each of them supplies and any related marketing. If it can be shown  that the malfunctioning was not cause d by C (or an external cause), but if it remains  unclear what the situation i s between A, B and D, the home owner should be able to sue  A, B and D jointly. Any one of them is free to prove in proceedings  that it was not the  commercial and technological uni t that caused the malfunctioning, but if not , the home  owner can hold them jointly and severally liable.  The rationale behind this is, on the one hand, that there might be serious undercompensation of victims in a n emerging digital technologies scenario as compared with the functionally equivalent situation  of the past  when alarm systems used to be manufactured by one clearly identifiable producer (and any responsibility on the part of the suppliers of components would have  come on top of that) without any significant interaction with the other components of an ecosystem. This may even create false incentives, as providers might be tempted to artificially  split  up the ecosystems they provide into independent components, thereby obscuring causal links and diluting responsibility. In any case, it should not be the victim who ultimately bears the risk  of a particular internal structure on the provider ’s side in a situation where there could just as  well have been one provider. It is also more efficient to hold a ll potential injurers liable in such  cases, as the different providers are in the best position to control risks of interaction and interoperability and to agree upfront on  the distribution of the costs of accidents.  123 Based on the examp le used in the Commission Staff Working Document (fn  8) 15 f. 
15. Redress between multiple tortfeasors New Technologies Formation  57 It may be difficult, in borderline case s, to define what still qualifies as a commercial and technological unit. Factors  to be taken into account will be , primarily, any joint or coordinated  marketing of the elements, but also the degree of technical interdependency and interoperation  between t he elements and the degree of specificity or exclusivity of their combination.  Illustration 21. Imagine there was, in Illustration 20 , also network provider E who could  have caused the problem because of a temporary interruption of the internet connection.  However, smart h ome equipment normally just needs network connectivity , but not network connectivity from a particular provider, and enhanced cooperation between A, B  and D on the one hand and E on the other cannot be expected by the consumer. Things  might be different in the rather exceptional case that this was in fact offered as a package,  with E marketing her services on the strength of their being  particularly reliable as a  basis for this type of smart home ecosystem.   Commercial and technological units may also become  relevant at the stage of redress between  multiple tortfeasors, whether or not the notion of commercial and technological unit s had already been relied on by the victim (see [31] ).  15. Redress b etween m ultiple  tortfeasors ([31]) [31] Where more than one person is liable for the same damage, liability to  the victim is  usually  solidary (joint). Redress claims between tortfeasors should only be for identified shares (several), unless some of them form a commercial and /  or technological  unit ([29]-[30]) , in which case  the members of this unit  should be jointly and severally liable for their cumulative share also to  the tortfeasor seeking redress.   One of the most pressing problems for victims in modern digital ecosystems is that, due to  enhanced complexity and opacity, they often cannot find out and prove which of several elements has actually caused an accident (the classic alternative causation sc enario ).  Illustration 22. A patient ’s artery is cut by a n AI-driven  surgical robot either due to a  failure of the surgeon operating the robot , or due to the wrong execution of the surgeon’ s  movements by the robot. If so, neither of the two potential causes satisfies the co nditio  sine qua non test (‘but for ’ test), because if either one of them is hypothetically disregarded, the damage may still have been caused by the remaining respective other event(s). The consequence would be that neither of these suspected reasons why t he victim  was harmed could trigger liability, so the victim could – at least in some legal systems –  end up without a claim for compensation, despite the known certainty that one of the two  or more events was indeed the cause of damage.  Legal systems in the Member States react very differently to such scenario s, and each solution  has its own drawbacks. 123F124 Where a person caused damage to the victim and the same damage  124 The PETL have opted for the solution that each of multiple potential tortfeasors should only be held liable  for a share of the total loss that c orresponds to the probability that it might have been them, which – in cases  where this share cannot be determine d – typically means per capita: Article  3.103 para graph  1 PETL provides:  ‘In case of multiple activities, where each of them alone would have been sufficient to cause the damage, but 
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologies   58 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  is also attributable to another person , the liability of multiple tortfeasors is normally joi nt liability , 124F125 i.e. the victim may request payment of the full  sum or part of the sum from any of the  multiple tortfeasors , at the victim ’s discretion , but the total sum requested may not exceed the  full sum due . There may exceptionally be situations where there is a reasonable basis for attributing only part of the damage to each of the tortfeasors, in which case liability may also be  several . 125F126 At the redress stage, liability of other tortfeasors towards  the tortfeasor who has  paid dama ges to the victim is normally several, i.e. other tortfeasors are liable only for their  individual share of responsibility for the damage . 126F127 There is no reason to deviate from these  principles in the context of emerging digital  technologies , and this is why [31] suggests several  liability at the redress stage as a general rule.  However, the complexity and opacity of emerging digital  technology settings that already make  it difficult for a victim to get relief in the first place also make it difficult for the paying tortfeasor to identify shares and seek redress from the other tortfeasors. However, despite complexity  and opacity, it is  often possible to identify two or several tortfeasors who form a commercial  and/  or technological unit  (see [29]- [30]). This should be relevant at the redress stage  too, i.e.  members of that unit should be liable jointly to indemnify another tortfeasor who is not a member of the unit and has paid damages to the victim exceeding his share.   Illustration 23. The producer of hardware has a contract with a software provider and  another one with the provider of several cloud services, all of which have caused the  damage, and all  of which collaborate on a contractual basis. Where another tortfeasor  has paid compensation to the victim and seeks redress, the three parties may be seen as  a commercial unit, and the paying tortfeasor should be able to request payment of the  whole cumulative share from any of the three parties.   As has been explained in the context of [29]- [30]) , this is  also i n the interest s of efficiency , as  parties are incentivised to make contractual arrangements for tort claims in advance.   it remains uncertain which one in fact caused it, each activity is regarded as a cause to the extent corresponding to the likelihood  that it may have caused the victim’s damage.’ (emphasis added).   This proportional (or several) liability leads to an overall fairer outcome when looking at all parties involved,  but the victim is at least worse off insofar as she will have to collect compensation from all potential injurers  and bear the risk of each injurer’s insolvency. See the comparative in -depth analysis of this way of dealing  with causal uncertainty in I Gilead /  MD Green /  BA Koch (eds), Proportional Liability: Analytical and Comparative  Perspectives (2013).   125 Cf Article 9:101 para graph  1 PETL.  126 Cf Art icle 9:101 para graph  3 PETL.  127 Cf Art icle 9:102 para graph  4 PETL. 
16. Damage to  data New Technologies Formation  59 16. Damage to data ([32]) [32] Damage caused to data may lead to liability where  (a) liability arises from contract ; or  (b) liability arises from interference with a property right in the medium on which  the data was stored or with another interest protected as a property right under the applicable law ; or  (c) the damage was caused by conduct infringing criminal law or other legally  binding rules whose purpose is to avoi d such damage; or   (d) there was an intention to cause harm.   In terms of damage caused , the emergence of digital technologies has brought about some gradual shifts, but only little disruptive change. There is one exception, which is strictly speaking  likewise a  gradual change, but whose dimension is such that it may be considered disruptive:  the significance of damage to data, such as by the deletion, deterioration, contamination, en-cryption, alteration or suppression of data. With much of our lives and our ‘property ’ becoming  digital, it is no longer appropriate to limit liability to  the tangible world. However, neither is it  appropriate to simply equate data with tangible property for the purposes of liability.  Most legal systems do not have much of an issue when it comes to contractual liability , in  particular where there was negligence of the contracting partner .  Illustration 24. A stores all her files in cloud space provided by cloud space provider C  on the basis of a contract. C has failed to properly secure the cloud space , which is why  an unknown hacker deletes all of A ’s photos. C will normally be liable to A on a contractual basis. Liability would in any case be for the economic loss, e.g. any costs A has to  incur for restoring the files. Whether or not A would receive co mpensation for the noneconomic loss associated with the loss of family memories would depend on the national  legal system  in question.  Things are less obvious for liability in tort, at least in a number of jurisdictions. For a long time, some jurisdictions have been solving the issue by considering damage to data as damage to the  physical medium  on which the data was stored. This should still be possible.  Illustration 25. Imagine A had stored all her files on her personal computer ’s hard disk  drive at home. Neighbour B negligently damages the computer , making the files illegible .  Irrespective of the qualification of damage to data, this was in any case unlawful damage  to A’s tangible property (the hard disk drive), and already for this reason B would be  liable.  However, this approach does not lead to satisfactory results where the owner of the medium is not identical with the person who has a protected lega l interest in the data.   The most difficult question is what amounts to a protected legal interest that is sufficiently akin to property. The NTF of the Expert Group discussed in some depth whether there should also  be liability in tort where the relevant d ata was protected by intellectual property  law or a 
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologies   60 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  similar regime, such as database protection or trade secret protection.  However, at the end of  the day it does not seem to make sense to focus on IP protection, because the reason s the legislator introduces IP rights for  intellectual achievement have little to do with the reasons a particular copy on a particular medium should be protected.  Illustration 26. A has all her files stored in cloud space provided by C. Without any negligence on C ’s part , B negligently damage s C’s servers and all of A ’s files are deleted. It  is not clear why it should make a difference to  B’s liability whether (a) the files contained  text or photos to  which A held the copyright, (b) the files contained text or photos to  which  third parties held the copyright, or (c) the files contained machine data of great economic  value, to  which nobody held any copyright or other IP right.  Depending on the applicable legal system, there may, however, be other legal interests  that are  protected with third -party effect (not only against a contracting party or other particular party) ,  such as possession.  Data being sufficiently akin to property is just one of the justifications for recogni sing tort liability where data has been damaged. Alternatively, there should be liability where the damage  has been  caused by conduct amounting to a criminal act, in particular an activity that is unlawful under international law such as the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime, 127F128 or where it  has infring ed other conduct -related rules such as product safety legislation whose purpose is to  avoid such damage.  Illustration 27. If B in Illustration 26 hacks the cloud space and deletes A ’s files , this  normally qualifies as criminal conduct and B should be liable.  This purpose should ideally be expressed  by the language of such legislation. One example,  where it has been made very clear , is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) . Article 82 explicitly states that  there is liability where damage has been caused by infringing the  requirements of the GDPR.  In defining such conduct -related rules the law should give due consideration, in particular, to  the ubiquity of data and its  significance as an asset.  While it would theoretically be possible to  introduce, for example, a standard stating very broadly  that it is generally prohibited to access,  modify etc. any data controlled by another person and to attach liability if this standard is  breached,  this might result in excessive liabi lity risks  because all of us are, in one way or another, constantly accessing and modifying data controlled by others.  Last but not least, most jurisdictions would agree that damage to data should lead to liability  where the tortf easor was acting with an intention  to cause harm.   128 Convention on Cybercrime , Council of Europe Treaty No. 185, 23 November 2001 ( ‘Budapest Convention ’). 
17. Insurance New Technologies Formation  61 17. Insurance ([33]) [33] The more frequent or severe potential harm resulting from emerging digital technology, and the less likely the operator is able to indemnify victims individually, the  more suitable mandatory liability insurance for such risks may be.   Statutory strict liability regimes in particular 128F129 often come with a requirement that the person  to whom the risk is attributable must take out insurance  cover against her risk of liability. This  is typically explained with a need to protect future victims against the  risk of the liable person’s insolvency. 129F130 However, from an economic analysis point of view, the insurance requirement rather fosters the internalisation of the costs of the activities that the liable person (per-missibly) pursues. 130F131 E ither way, compulsory liability insurance should not be introduced without a careful analysis  of whether it is really needed, rather than automatically linked to a certain activity. After all,  the tortfeasor  may be able to compensate victims of her activities out of her own funds if the  overall losses to be expected can be covered even without insurance. Also, the market may  simply not offer insurance cover for a certain risk, particularly if it is difficult to calculate due  to missing experience, which is quite likely with new technologies (and may therefore also be  a problem with emerging digital technologies). Requiring insurance in the latter situation may  effectively prevent the deployment of the technology, if this requires proof of insurance despite  the fact that no -one on the market is willing to underwrite suc h yet unknown risks.  This may in part be remedied by capping liability for certain risks at a pre -determined (though  regularly adjusted) amount, as is often the case with statutory strict liability regimes. One could  also imagine a less specific requiremen t to provide cover (so not necessarily by taking out insurance, but also other financial securities). 131F132 N evertheless, as experience in at least some fields (most ly motor ised traffic) has shown, mandatory liability insurance can work well and is indeed appropriate under certain conditions. From an insurance perspective, certain sectors are the most suited to compulsory insurance  129 Mandatory liability insurance is by no means exclusively linked to strict liability; see the extensive list of  statutory insurance requirements for both strict and fault liability in A Fenyves et al (eds), Compulsory Lia-bility Insurance from a European Per spective (2016) 445 ff.   130 D Rubin, ‘Conclusions ’, in Fenyves (fn 129) 431. Cf also the Commission Staff Working Document (fn 8 )  21: ‘In order to facilitate the victim’s compensation and protecting the victim from the risk of insolvency of  the liable person , it could be discussed, among other solutions, whether various actors in the value chain  should be required to take out insurance coverage as it is the case today for cars. ’  131 M Faure,  ‘Economic Criteria for Compulsory Insurance’, The Geneva Papers on Ris k and Insurance 31 (2006)  149, who also highlights at 158 ‘that lawyers often view especially third- party insurance as an instrument of  victim protection, whereas economists would stress the fact that insurance is an instrument to remove risk from the risk -averse injurer or to cure the risk of underdeterrence’.   132 D Rubin  (fn 130) 436; M Faure  (fn 131) 162 f. 
C. Perspectives on l iability for emerging digital technologies   62 Expert Group on Liability for New Technologies  schemes, including transportation, industries with a high potential for personal injury and/or  environmental harm, hazardous activit ies and certain professional sectors. 132F133 T herefore, it may indeed be advisable to make  liability insurance cover compulsory for certain   emerging digital technologies. This is particularly true for highly significant risks (which may  either lead to substantia l harm 133F134 and/or cause frequent losses) , where it seems unlikely that  potential injurers will be capable of compensating all victims themselves (either out of their  own funds, with the help of alternative financial securities , or through voluntary self -insur ance).   If mandatory liability insurance is introduced, the insurer should have a recourse claim against  the tortfeasor.  In risk scenarios comparable to those of motor ised traffic, a direct action of victims against the insurer may also be advisable. 134F135 18. C ompensation f unds  ([34]) [34] Compensation funds may be used to protect tort victims who are entitled to compensation according to  the applicable liability rules, but whose  claims cannot be satisfied.   If liability regimes described above (producer ’s and operator ’s strict liability and wrongdoer’ s  fault-based liability) function properly, there is no need to establish new kinds of compensation  funds, funded and operated by the state or other institution s and aiming to compensate victims  for losses suffered as a result of operating emerging digital  technologies. It is advisable, however, to ensure that in the areas where compulsory liability insurance is introduced, a compensation fund is also in place to redress damage caused by an unidentified or uninsured technology. 135F136 Article 10 of the Motor Insurance Directive may serve as a model for such a scheme.   As hacking is a serious threat to users of software- based technologies and traditional tort law  rules may often prove insufficient because of the victim’ s inability to identify the tortfeasor ,  it may be advisable to introduce a non- fault compensation scheme equivalent to that applicable  to victims of violent crimes , 136F137 if and t o the extent that a cybercrime constitute s an offence  133 B Tettamanti/H Bär/J -C Werz , ‘Compulsory Liability Insurance in a Changing Legal Environment – An Insurance and Reinsurance Perspective ’, in Fenyves (fn  129) 343 (359).   134 However, one should keep in mind that the risk of extremely high or even catastrophic losses may not be  (fully) insurable and require, for example, a public -private partnership, as experience in the US has shown  with covering the risk s of nuclear power plants (< https://  www.nrc.gov/  reading -  rm/  doc-  collections/  fact-   sheets/  nuclear -  insurance.html>).   135 Cf Article  15:101 Principles of European Insurance Contract Law  (PEICL).  136 This is also supported by the EP Resolution on ‘Civil Law  Rules on Robotics ’ (fn 4), no  59 lit b. However,  Parliament also suggests to expand the scope of a compensation fund in lit c , combining it with limited liability of those contributing to such a fund. In lit  d, Parliament considers ‘to create a general fu nd for all smart  autonomous robots’ or individual funds per category of robots. Such proposals are also put forward  in academic writing , see, for example, K Abraham/R Rabin, ‘Automated Vehicles and Manufacturer Responsibility  for Accidents: A New Legal Regime for a New Era’, <https://papers.ssrn.com/  sol3/  papers.   cfm?   abstract  _id=   3151133 >.  137 Under national implementations of Council Directive 2004/  80/  EC of 29 April 2004 relating to compensation  to crime victims .
