  EN   EN       EUROPEAN   COMMISSION    Brussels, 25.4.2018   COM(2018) 237 final     COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN  PARLIAMENT, THE EUROPEAN COUNCIL, THE COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN  ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE  REGIONS   Artificial Intelligence for Europe   {SWD(2018)  137 final}   
  1   1. INTRODUCTION – EMBRACING CHANGE   Artificial intelligence (AI) is already part of our lives – it is not science fiction. From using a  virtual personal assistant to organise our working day, to travelling in a self -driving vehicle,  to our phones suggesting songs or restaurants that we might like,  AI is a reality.   Beyond making our lives easier, AI is helping us to  solve some of the world's biggest  challenges:  from treating chronic diseases or reducing fatality rates in tra ffic accidents1  to fighting climate change or anticipating  cybersecurity threats .  In Denmark, AI is helping save lives by allowing  emergency services to diagnose cardiac arrests or  other conditions based on the sound of a caller's  voice. In Austria, it is helping radiologists detect  tumours more accurately by instantly comparing x rays with a large amount of other medical data.   Many farms across Europe are already using AI to  monitor the movement, temperature and feed  consumption of their animals. The AI sy stem can  then automatically adapt the heating and feeding  machinery to help farmers monitor their animals'  welfare and to free them up for other tasks. And AI  is also helping European manufacturers to become  more efficient and to help factories return to  Europe.2  These are some of the many examples of what we  know AI can do across all sectors, from energy to  education, from financial services to construction.  Countless more examples that cannot be imagined  today will emerge over the next decade.   Like the st eam engine or electricity in the past,  AI is transforming our world, our society and  our industry3. Growth in computing power,  availability of data and progress in algorithms have  turned AI into one of the most strategic  technologies of the 21st century . The stakes could not be higher. The way we approach AI  will define the world we live in . Amid fierce global competition, a solid European  framework is needed .                                                     1 It is estimated that around 90% of road accidents are caused by human errors. See Commission's report on  Saving Lives: Boosting Car Safety in the EU (COM(2016) 0787 final).   2 Why AI is the future of growth, Accenture, 2016. The economic impact of the auto mation of knowledge work,  robots and self -driving vehicles could reach between EUR 6.5 and EUR 12 trillion annually by 2025 (including  improved productivity and higher quality of life in ageing populations).

What is artificial intelligence?   Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to  systems that displ ay intelligent  behaviour by analysing their  environment and taking actions – with  some degree of autonomy – to achieve  specific goals.   AI-based systems can be purely  software -based, acting in the virtual  world (e.g. voice assistants, image  analysis software, search engines,  speech and face recognition systems) or  AI can be embedded in hardware  devices (e.g. advanced robots,  autonomous cars, drones or Internet of  Things applications).   We are using AI on a daily basis, e.g. to  translate languages, gen erate subtitles  in videos or to block email spam.   Many AI technologies require data to  improve their performance. Once they  perform well, they can help improve and  automate decision making in the same  domain. For example, an AI system will  be trained and then used to spot cyber attacks on the basis of data from the  concerned network or system.     
  2   The European Union (EU) should have a coordinated approach  to make the most of the  opportunities offered by AI and to address the new challenges that it brings. The EU  can  lead the way in developing and using AI for good and for all , building on its values and its  strengths. It can capitalise on:   - world -class researchers, labs and startups . The EU i s also strong in robotics and has  world -leading industry , notably in the transport, healthcare and manufacturing sectors that  should be at the forefront of AI adoption;   - the Digital Single Market . Common rules, for example on data protection and the free  flow  of data in the EU, cybersecurity and connectivity help companies to do business, scale up  across borders and encourage investments; and   - a wealth of industrial, research and public sector data which can be unlocked to feed AI  systems. In parallel to  this Communication, the Commission is taking action to make data  sharing easier and to open up more data – the raw material for AI – for re -use. This  includes data from the public sector in particular, such as on public utilities and the  environment, as w ell as research and health data.   European leaders have put AI at the top of their agendas. On 10 April 2018, 24 Member  States4 and Norway committed to working together on AI. Building on this strong political  endorsement , it is time to make significant eff orts to ensure that:   - Europe is competitive in the AI landscape , with bold investments that match its economic  weight.  This is about supporting research and innovation to develop the next generation of  AI technologies, and deployment to ensure that compan ies – in particular small and  medium -sized enterprises which make up 99% of business in the EU – are able to adopt AI.   - No one is left behind in the digital transformation . AI is changing the nature of work:  jobs will be created, others will disappear, m ost will be transformed. Modernisation of  education, at all levels, should be a priority for governments. All Europeans should have  every opportunity to acquire the skills they need. Talent should be nurtured, gender balance  and diversity encouraged.   - New technologies are based on values . The General Data Protection Regulation will  become a reality on 25 May 2018. It is a major step for building trust, essential in the long  term for both people and companies. This is where the EU's sustainable approach to  technologies creates a competitive edge, by embracing change on the basis of the Union's  values5. As with any transformative technology , some AI applications may raise new ethical  and legal questions, for example related to lia bility or potentially biased decision -making.  The EU must therefore ensure that AI is developed and applied in an appropriate framework  which promotes innovation and respects the Union's values and fundamental rights as well  as ethical principles such as a ccountability and transparency. The EU is also well placed to  lead this debate on the global stage.   This is how the EU can make a difference – and be the champion  of an approach to AI that  benefits people and society as a whole .                                                    4 Austria, Belgi um, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland,  Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden,  United Kingdom.    5 Article 2 of the Treaty on EU: "Th e Union is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom,  democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to  minorities". The Member States share a "society in which pluralism, non -discrimination, tolerance, justice,  solidarity and equality between women and men prevail."  
  3   Launching a European initi ative on AI   In May 2017, the Commission published its mid-term review of the Digital Single Market  strategy6. It highlighted  the importance  of building on Europe's scientific and industrial  strengths, as well as on its innovative startups, to be in a leadi ng position in the development  of AI technologies, platforms, and applications.   The European Council of October 2017 stated that the EU needs a sense of urgency to  address emerging trends such as AI "while at the same time ensuring a high level of data  protection, digital rights and ethical standards" and invited "the Commission to put forward a  European approach to artificial intelligence ".7 The European Parliament made wide ranging recommendations on civil law rules on robotics and the European Economic and  Social Committee has also issued an opinion on the topic.8  This Communication sets out a European initiative on AI , which  aims to:    Boost  the EU's technological and industrial capacity and AI uptake  across the  economy , both by the private and public se ctors9. This includes investments in research  and innovation and better access to data.    Prepare for socio -economic changes brought about by AI by encouraging the  modernisation of education and training systems, nurturing talent, anticipating changes in  the labour market, supporting labour market transitions and adaptation of social protection  systems.    Ensure  an appropriate ethical and legal framework , based on the Union's values and in  line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. This includes forthcoming  guidance on existing product liability rules, a detailed analysis of emerging challenges,  and cooperation with stakeholders, through a European AI Alliance, for the development  of AI ethics guidelines .10  All this requires joining forces . Building on the approach set out in this Communication and  the declaration11 of cooperation signed by 24 Member States on 10 April 2018, the  Commission will work with Member States on a coordinated plan on AI . The discussion  will take place in the framework  of the existing European platform of national initiatives to  digitise industry, with the view to agree this plan by the end of 2018 . The main aims will be  to maximise the impact of investments at EU and national levels, encourage synergies and  cooperation  across the EU, exchange best practices and collectively define the way forward  to ensure that the EU as a whole can compete globally.   In the coming weeks the Commission will issue  a Communication on the future of connected  and automated mobility in Europ e and a Communication on the future research and  innovation ambitions for Europe. AI will be a key element of these initiatives.                                                     6 https://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=COM:2017:228:FIN    7 http://data.consilium.europa.eu/doc/document/ST -14-2017 -INIT/en/pdf   8 European Parliament resolution with recommendations to the Commission on Civil Law Rules on Robotics  (2015/ 2103(INL)); European Economic and Social Committee opinion on AI (INT/806 -EESC -2016 -05369 -0000-AC-TRA).   9 AI can significantly improve public services and contribute to the objectives set out in the Ministerial  Declaration on eGovernment – the Tallinn Dec laration (October 2017, https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single market/en/news/ministerial -declaration -egovernment -tallinn -declaration ). For example, the Commission will  look into AI's potential to analyse large amounts of data and help check how single market rules are applied.   10 Building on the work of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies   11 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news/eu -member -states -sign-cooperate -artificial -intelligence   
  4   2. THE EU' S POSITION IN A COMP ETITIVE INTERNATIONA L LANDSCAPE   Most developed economies recognise the game -changing nature of AI and have adopted  different approaches which reflect their own political, economic, cultural and social  systems.12   The government of the United States presented an AI strategy and invested around EUR 970  million in unclassified AI research in 2016. With its  'Next Generation Artificial Intelligence  Development Plan', China is targeting global leadership by 2030 and is making massive  investments.13 Other countries, such as Japan and Canada, have also adopted AI strategies.   In the United States and in China, la rge companies are significantly investing in AI and are  exploiting large amounts of data.14   Overall, Europe is behind in private investments  in AI which totalled around EUR 2.4 -3.2  billion in 2016, compared with EUR 6.5 -9.7 billion in Asia and EUR 12.1 -18.6 billion in  North America.15  It is therefore crucial that the EU continues its work to  create an environment that  stimulates investments  and uses public funding to leverage private investments. To do so,  the EU needs to preserve and build on its assets .   Europe is home to  a world -leading AI research community , as well as innovative  entrepreneurs and deep -tech startups (founded on scientific discovery or engineering).16 It  has a strong industry , producing  more than a quarter of the world's industrial and  professional service robots (e.g. for precision farming, security, health, logistics)17, and is  leading in manufacturing, healthcare, transport and space technologies – all of which  increasingly rely on AI. Europe also plays an important role in the developmen t and  exploitation of platforms providing services to companies and organisations (business -tobusiness) , applications to progress towards the "intelligent enterprise" and e -government.   One of the main challenges for the EU to be competitive is to ensure t he take -up of AI  technology across its economy . European industry cannot miss the train. Only a fraction of  European companies have already adopted digital technologies. This trend is particularly  acute in small and medium -sized businesses. In 2017, 25% of  EU large enterprises and 10%  of small and medium -sized enterprises used big data analytics. Only one in five small and  medium -sized enterprises was highly digitised, while one third of the workforce still does not  possess basic digital skills.18 At the sam e time, the benefits of adopting AI are widely  recognised. For example, the 2018 Digital Transformation Scoreboard shows that businesses                                                    12 See also the Commission's European Political S trategy Centre's Strategic Note: The Age of Artificial  Intelligence, 2018.   13 Recent announcements include a EUR 1.7 billion AI technology park in Beijing.   14 With  1.4 billion mobile phone subscriptions and 800 million internet users – more than the USA and  the EU  combined – Chinese people generate vast amounts of personal data that are used to develop related AI products.   15 10 imperatives for Europe in the age of AI and automation, McKinsey, 2017.   16 Europe accounts for the largest share of top 100 AI research institutions worldwide. 32 research institutions in  the global top 100 for AI -related research paper citations vs 30 from the USA and 15 from China.

Europe is home to thr ee of the world's largest  producers of industrial robots (KUKA, ABB and Comau).   18 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/digital -scoreboard . According to McKinsey (2016), Eur opean  companies operating at the digital frontier only reach a digitisation level of 60% compared to their US peers.  
  5   in the agrifood and construction sectors  which have adopted AI confirm positive impacts on  entering new markets, improv ing products or services, and gaining new clients.19   EU efforts so far: laying the groundwork to make the most of AI   AI has featured in the EU research and  development framework programmes since 2004  with a specific focus on robotics. Investments  increased to up to EUR 700 million for 2014 -2020,  complemented by EUR 2.1 billion of private  investments as part of a public -private partnership  on robotics.20 These efforts have significantly  contributed to Europe' s leadership in robotics .  Overall, around EUR 1.1 billion has been invested  in AI -related research and innovation during the  period 2014 -2017 under the Horizon 2020 research  and innovation programme, including in big data,  health, rehabilitation, transport  and space -oriented  research.   Additionally, the Commission has launched major  initiatives which are key for AI. These include the development of more efficient electronic  components and systems, such as chips specifically built to run AI operations   (neurom orphic chips)21; world -class high -performance computers22, as well as flagship  projects on quantum technologies and on the mapping of the human brain .23  3. THE WAY FORWARD : AN EU INITIATIVE ON AI  3.1.  Boosting the EU's technological and industrial capacity and AI uptake  across the economy   The public and private sectors must seize the opportunities that come both from developing  innovative AI solutions and applying them to a range of fields.24   The EU should be ahead of technological developments in AI and ensure they are swiftly  taken up across its economy. This implies stepping up investments  to strengthen  fundamental research and make scientific breakthroughs, upgrade AI research infrastructure,                                                    19 https://ec.europa.eu/growth/tools -databases/dem/monitor/scoreboard   20 https://eu -robotics.net/sparc/ .  21 Neuromorphic chips are modelled on biological structures such as brains. This project is part of the Elect ronic  Components and Systems for European Leadership joint undertaking ( EUR 4.8 billion of public -private  investments by 2020).   22 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/eurohpc -joint-undertaking . This infrastructure will underpin the  European Open Science Cloud that will offer researchers a virtual environment to store, process, share and re use their data across disciplines and borders : https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/    23 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/fet -flagships     24 The recent report of the "High Level  Group on Industrial Technologies" recognised AI as a "key enabling  technology" highlighting the transformative role of AI and the necessity for the industry to use AI to maintain its  leadership: http://ec.europa.eu/research/industrial_technologies/pdf/re_finding_industry_022018.pdf   Projects funded by the EU have  developed for example:    an unmanned agricultural vehicle that  can mechanically remove weeds,  reducing the need for pesticides;    a highway pilot project using AI &  Internet of Things to provide safe  driving recommendations and reduce  road fatalities;    a robotic ortho -prosthesis to restore  mobility to amputees;    robots to take care of repetitive tasks  for workers in car manufacturing  plants and improve the efficiency of  the manufacturing process.  
  6   develop AI applications in key sectors from health to transport, fa cilitate the uptake of AI and  the access to data.   Joint effort by both the public  (national and EU levels) and private sectors  are needed to  gradually increase overall investments by 2020 and beyond, in line with the EU's economic  weight and investments on  other continents.   Public and private research and development investments  in AI  in the EU last year were  estimated to total EUR 4 -5 billion.25 The EU as a whole (public and private sectors  combined)  should aim to increase this investment to  at least EUR 20 billion by the end of  2020 . It should then aim for more than EUR 20 billion per year over the following decade  (this objective does not pre -empt any decision to be taken with respect to the next EU  multiannual financial framework).   The Com mission will work with Member States on a coordinated plan to help align and step  up investments, building on the declaration of cooperation signed on 10 April 2018.   Without such efforts, the EU risks losing out on the opportunities offered by AI, facing  a brain -drain and being a consumer of solutions developed elsewhere . The EU should  therefore strengthen its status as a research powerhouse while bringing more innovation to  the market. A vast majority of European companies – whether large or small – shoul d also  adopt AI technologies.   Stepping up investments   2018 -2020    To support joint efforts, the Commission is increasing investments in AI under the research  and innovation framework programme Horizon 2020 to around EUR 1.5 billion by the end  of 2020  (this works out as an average of EUR 500 million per year and represents an increase  of around 70%). Under the existing public -private partnerships (for example in robotics and  big data), this investment will trigger an additional EUR 2.5 billion  over the same period.   These investments will aim at consolidating research and innovation in AI, encouraging  testing and experimentation, strengthening AI excellence research centres and starting efforts  to bring AI to all potential users, with a focus on small and medi um-sized enterprises.   If Member States26 and the private sector (beyond established partnerships)  make similar  investment efforts, the total investments in the EU will grow to around EUR 7 billion per  year, totalling more than EUR 20 billion by the end of 2020 .  This will position the EU  well to further increase efforts over the next decade.                                                         25 Estimate based on data on public and business spending in research and development (R&D) in information  and communication  technologies (ICT) (source: Prospective Insights in ICT R&D, PREDICT, European  Commission) and the share of funding in AI as part of the Commission's research and development budget in  information and communication technologies since 2014 (around 13%). Bu ilding on previous trends, a similar  share is calculated for government budget allocations for research and development and business expenditure on  research and development which represents the major part of investments (ca. EUR 4 billion, which is consist ent  with recent findings by McKinsey).   26 For example, France has just announced a EUR 1.5 billion  investment in AI over five years.  
  7   Strengthening research and innovation from the lab to the market   The Commission will support  AI technologies both in basic and industrial research27. This  includes in vestments in projects in key application areas such as health, connected and  automated driving, agriculture, manufacturing, energy, next generation internet technologies,  security and public administrations (including justice).  Funding will also reinforce European  strengths in embodied AI/robotics.   The Commission will also support breakthrough market -creating innovation such as AI   through the pilot of the European Innovation Council .28 A budget of EUR 2.7 billion is  made available for 2018 -2020 to support 1, 000 potential breakthrough projects and 3,000  feasibility awards. This pilot scheme can be particularly helpful for AI development as AI  technology is expected to be part of many projects, for applications in e.g. health, agriculture  and manufacturing.   Funding in fundamental research is expected to be provided by the European Research  Council , based on scientific excellence. Marie Skłodowska -Curie actions  provide grants  for all stages of researchers' careers and have supported research in AI in the past years.   Supporting AI research excellence centres across Europe   Building on Member States' efforts to jointly establish AI -focused research centres , the  Commission will support and strengthen AI excellence centres across Europe. The  Commission will also en courage and facilitate their collaboration and networking.   Bringing AI to all small businesses and potential users   Europe can only reap the full benefits of AI if it is  available and accessible to all. The Commission will  facilitate access of all potential users, especially  small and medium -sized enterprises, companies  from non -tech sectors and public administrations,  to the latest technologies and encourage them to  test AI . To this end, t he Commission will support  the development of an "AI -on-demand platform".  This will provide a single access poi nt for all users  to relevant AI resources in the EU, including  knowledge, data repositories, computing power  (cloud, high performance computing), tools and  algorithms. It will offer services and provide support  to potential users of the technology, analyse  the  business case behind AI in their specific  circumstances and help them to integrate AI  solutions in their processes, products and services.   To facilitate access to the platform, the existing  network of more than 400 Digital Innovation Hubs29                                                    27 The guiding principle of all support for AI -related research will be the development of "responsible AI",  putting the huma n at the centre , see the Commission's "Responsible Research and Innovation" workstream:  https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020 -section/responsible -research -innovation    28 https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/e n/h2020 -section/european -innovation -council -eic-pilot   29See also the Commission's Communication of 19 April 2016 on Digitising European Industry  (COM/2016/0180 final) and list of hu bs.  Digital Innovation Hubs  help  companies (especially small and  medium -sized enterprises) to take  advantage of digital opportunities.  They o ffer expertise on technologies,  testing, skills, business models,  finance, market intelligence and  networking.   For example, a small company that  produces metal parts for the  automotive industry could consult the  regional hub (which can be a science  park fo r example) and ask for advice  on how to improve the manufacturing  process with AI. Experts from the hub  would then visit the factory, analyse  the production process, consult with  other AI experts in the network of  hubs, make a proposal and then  implement i t. These activities would be  partially financed with EU money.  
  8   will be in strumental. Further Hubs are coming on stream and a dedicated network of Digital  Innovation Hubs focused on AI  will be created.   The Commission will also analyse systemic shifts in value chains in order to anticipate AI  opportunities for small and medium -sized enterprises, pilot critical industrial AI applications  in non -tech sectors, and reinforce the European advanced manufacturing support centre for  small and medium -sized enterprises.   Supporting testing and experimentation   Testing of and experimenting wi th AI products and services  is crucial to make them market ready, ensure compliance with safety standards and rules as well as security by design and  enable policymakers to gain experience with new technologies to devise suitable legal  frameworks. The Comm ission will support the set -up of testing and experimentation  infrastructures that are open to businesses of all sizes and from all regions. Building on the  established network of Digital Innovation Hubs, a first series of testing and  experimentation infra structures for AI  products and services will be set up in the areas of  healthcare, transport, infrastructure inspection and maintenance, agrifood and agile  production.   Attracting private investments   On top of investments under the research and innovation f ramework programme , a  sufficient level of private investments in the AI transformation is crucial . The European  Fund for Strategic Investments  will be further mobilised to attract private investment to  support the development and the uptake of AI, as part of the wider efforts to promote  digitisation. The Commission will work with the European Investment Bank Group with the  aim of reaching at least EUR 500 million in total investments  in that area in the period  2018 -2020. In addition, the European Commission  and the European Investment Fund have  just launched a EUR 2.1 billion Pan -European Venture Capital Funds -of-Funds programme –  VentureEU – to boost investment in innovative startup and scale -up companies across  Europe. The Commission also provides support as part of its initiatives to digitise  industry30.   In 2018 -2031, the Commission will invest around EUR 1.5 billion  in:   research and innovation in AI technologies  to strengthen European industrial leadership,  excellence in science, and support AI applications which address societal challenges in  sectors such as health, transport and agrifood. The Commission will also support  breakthroug h, market -creating innovation through the pilot phase of the European  Innovation Council;    strengthening AI research excellence centres ; and    the uptake of AI across Europe , via a toolbox for potential users, with a focus on  small and medium -sized enterprise s, non -tech companies and public administrations :                                                    30 The Commission has just launched the Strategic Forum for Important Projects of Common European Interest  to identify and ensure appropriate large -scale finance for value chains of strategic importance for Europe  including the integration of AI to str engthen EU industrial leadership. Moreover, the Commission supports and  facilitates inter -regional partnerships for investments in advanced technologies and AI through its Smart  Specialisation Platform on Industrial Modernisation.   31 Actions will stem from the work programme Horizon 2020. They will be financed within the current financial  programming envelope and subject to future revision of the work programme in the frame of the comitology  procedure.  
  9   this will include an AI-on-demand platform giving support and easy access to the latest  algorithms and expertise; a network of AI -focused Digital Innovation Hubs  facilitating  testing and experimentation ; and the set -up of industrial data platforms  offering high  quality datasets.    In addition, the Commission aims to stimulate more private investments in AI under the  European Fund for Strategic Investments  (at least EUR 500 million  in 2018 -20).  Beyond 2020   Commission proposals under the next EU multiannual financial framework (2021 -2027)   will open the door to investments into:    upgrading the pan-European network of AI excellence centres ;    research and innovation in fields such as explainable AI32, unsupervised machine  learning, energy and data efficiency33;   additional Digital Innovation Hubs, world -leading testing and experimentation facilities   in areas such as transport, healthcare, agrifood and manufacturing , supported by  regulatory sandboxes34;    supporting the adoption of AI by organisations across all sectors, including public interest  applications , through co -investment with Member States;    exploring joint innovation procurement for the use and development of AI; and    a support centre for data sharing , which wil l be closely linked with  the AI -on-demand  platform to facilitate development of business and public sector applications.     The Commission also intends to continue its support for technologies and infrastructure that  underpin and enable AI such as high -perfo rmance computing, microelectronics, photonics,  quantum technologies, the Internet of Things and cloud.   In doing so, the Commission will support more energy -efficient technologies  and  infrastructure, making the AI value chain greener .                                                        32 In order to increase transparency and minimise the ri sk of bias or error, AI systems should be developed in a  manner which allows humans to understand (the basis of) their actions.   33 These being methods to use less data in order to train AIs.   34 These are testing grounds for new business models  that are not ( yet) regulated.  
  10   Making more data a vailable   AI needs vast amounts of data to be developed. Machine learning, a type of AI, works by  identifying patterns in available data and then applying the knowledge to new data.35 The  larger a data set, the better even subtle relations in the data can be  discovered. When it comes  to using AI, data -rich environments also provide for more opportunities. This is because data  is the way the algorithm learns about and interacts with its environment. For example, if all  machines and processes in a factory conti nuously produce data, it is likely that further  automation and optimisation can be achieved with the help of AI. In an analog setting, e.g. in  a paper -based operation without digitised data about what is happening, that is not the case.   In view of this, access to data is a key ingredient for a competitive AI landscape, which the  EU should facilitate.   The EU has made significant eff orts over the past  15 years to open up public sector information and  publicly funded research results  for re -use, such  as data generated by the EU's space programmes  (Copernicus36, Galileo). With its initiative to  improve the accessibility and re -usability of such  data, this body of data will grow further.   Public policy should also encourage the wider  availability of privately -held data , while ensuring  full respect for legislation on the protection of  personal data. The Commission calls on companies  to recog nise the importance of non -personal data re use, including for AI training purposes.   A new support centre for data sharing  will  provide public authorities and companies with legal  and technical support when trying to access data  from public sector bodies a nd companies.   The Commission will continue to study how more data can be made available.   Alongside this Communication, the Commission has put forward a set of initiatives to grow  the European data space37. These are:    an updated Directive on public sector  information , e.g. traffic, meteorological,  economic and financial data or business registers;    guidance on sharing private sector data in the economy (including industrial data);    an updated Recommendation on access to and preservation of scientific information ;  and                                                    35 Sometimes finding the pattern is itself the goal of the activity: in text and data mining, researchers use  algorithms to “read” a large numbers of texts (e.g. scientific papers on chemistry) and automatically extract  knowledge (e.g. findi ng facts that are not explicitly stated in any one of the papers but can be derived from the  whole corpus). The Commission introduced an exception for text and data mining as part of the modernisation  of EU copyright rules.   36 Copernicus Data and Informati on Access Services: http://copernicus.eu/news/upcoming -copernicus -data-andinformation -access -services -dias  37 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/policies/building -european -data-economy  Deep learning  has been a game -changer  for AI with a tremendous improvement in  performance for specific tasks such as  image or speech recognition, or machine  translation.   Training a deep learning algorithm to  classify objects works by exposing it to a  large number of l abelled examples (e.g.  pictures) that are correctly categorised  (e.g. pictures of planes).   Once trained, algorithms can correctly  classify objects that they have never  seen, in some cases with accuracies that  exceed those of humans.   Significant advances in these  technologies have been made through  the use of large data sets and  unprecedented computing power.  
  11    a Communication on the digital transformation of health and care , including sharing  of genomic and other health data sets.   3.2. Preparing for socioeconomic changes   Throughout history, the emergence of new technologies – from electricity to the internet –  has changed the nature of work. It has brought major benefits to our society and economy,  but also raised concerns. The emergence of automation, robotics and AI is transforming  the  labour market, and it is essential for the EU to manage this shift.   These technologies can make the life of workers easier. They can, for example, help them  with repetitive, strenuous and even dangerous tasks (for example cleaning unsafe or difficult   to access locations such as industrial pipes ). They can also help summarise large amounts of  data, provide more accurate information and suggest decisions, including using AI to assist  doctors with diagnosis. They ultimately help to enhance people’s abili ties. Against the  background of an ageing society, AI can provide new solutions to support more people to  participate and remain in the labour market, including persons with disabilities. New jobs  and tasks will emerge as a result of AI , some of which are difficult, or even impossible to  predict. Other jobs and tasks will be replaced. While the exact quantification of AI’s impact  on jobs is difficult to determine at this stage, the need for action is clear.   Overall there are three main challenges for the E U – highlighting the fundamental role of  education and training, including of teachers and trainers themselves, for which responsibility  lies with Member States. The first challenge is to prepare the society as a whole . This  means helping all Europeans to develop basic digital skills, as well as skills which are  complementary to and cannot be replaced by any machine such as critical thinking, creativity  or management. Secondly, the EU needs to focus efforts to help workers in jobs which are  likely to be the  most transformed or to disappear  due to automation, robotics and AI. This  is also about ensuring access for all citizens, including workers and the self -employed38, to  social protection39, in line with the European Pillar of Social Rights . Finally, the EU n eeds  to train more specialists in AI , building on its long tradition of academic excellence, create  the right environment for them to work in the EU and attract more talent from abroad.   Leaving no one behind   In 2016, the European Commission launched a com prehensive plan to help equip people with  the right skills for the evolving labour market: a New Skills Agenda for Europe40. As part of  this agenda, the Commission issued a Recommendation for Member States on "Upskilling  Pathways: New Opportunities for Adul ts" to improve their basic literacy, numeracy and  digital skills. A Recommendation was also adopted on key competences for lifelong learning,  focusing notably on the acquisition of competences in sciences, technology, engineering and  mathematics (STEM), di gital competences, entrepreneurship and creativity. The Commission  also presented a Digital Education Action Plan41 which aims to foster digital skills and                                                    38 http://ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=19158&langId=en     39 Automation may impact the way social protection is financed, necessitating a proper reflection on the  sustainability and adequacy of social security systems.   40 http://eur -lex.europa.eu/legal -content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52016DC0381   41 https://ec.europa.eu/education/sites/education/files/digital -education -action -plan.pdf   
  12   competences for all citizens. This plan explores the impact of AI in education and trainin g  through pilots.   While digitisation is affecting the structure of the labour market in particular through the  automation of middle -skilled jobs, AI could have a more significant impact on lower skilled  jobs.42 If not addressed early and proactively, this may exacerbate inequalities between  people, regions and industries in the EU.   To manage the AI transformation, workers whose jobs are changing or may disappear due to  automation must have every opportunity to acquire the skills and knowledge they need, to   master new technology and be supported during labour market transitions. This anticipatory  approach and focus on investing in people is a cornerstone of a human -centric, inclusive  approach to AI, and will require a significant investment. National schemes  will be essential  for providing such up -skilling and training. They will benefit from support by the European  Structural and Investment Funds (supporting skills development with EUR 27 billion over the  period 2014 -2020, out of which the European Social Fu nd invests 2.3 billion specifically in  digital skills) and should also benefit from support from the private sector. The Commission  will also continue to support research into human -AI interaction and cooperation.   Nurturing talent, diversity and interdisc iplinarity   AI has brought about new job profiles , including in the area of developing machine -learning  algorithms and other digital innovations.43 Overall, the number of specialists in information  and communication technologies in the EU has grown annually  by 5% since 2011, creating  1.8 million jobs and rapidly increasing its share of total employment from 3% to 3.7% in just  five years. There are at least 350,000 vacancies for such professionals in Europe, pointing to  significant skills gaps.44 This is why E urope should strive to increase the number of people  trained in AI  and encourage diversity . More women and people of diverse backgrounds,  including people with disabilities, need to be involved in the development of AI, starting  from inclusive AI education  and training, in order to ensure that AI is non -discriminatory and  inclusive. Interdisciplinarity  should also be supported (by encouraging joint degrees, for  example in law or psychology and AI). The importance of ethics in the development and use  of new technologies should also be featured in programmes and courses. And it is not only  about training the best talent, but also creating an attractive environment for them to stay  in the EU .   Initiatives to encourage more young people to choose AI subjects and  related fields as a  career should be promoted. The Commission has recently launched the "Digital Opportunity  Traineeships"45, supporting internships aimed at acquiring advanced digital skills, and a  number of actions of the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalitio n46 aim at spreading coding skills and  increasing the number of experts in digital.   Ensuring that workers are given the chance to adapt and to have access to new opportunities  will be crucial for people to accept AI. Like any other technology, AI is not jus t imposed on  society. It is up to governments, in dialogue with the social partners and civil society bodies,                                                    42 Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development , "Automation, skills use and training", 2018.   43 https://www.cognizant.com/whitepapers/21 -jobs-of-the-future -a-guide -to-getting -and-staying -employed -overthe-next-10-years -codex3049.pdf    44 http://www.pocbigdata.eu/monitorICTonlinevacancies/general_info/   45 https://ec .europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/digital -opportunity -traineeships -boosting -digital -skills -job  46 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/digital -skills -jobs-coalition         
  13   to collectively steer the process to ensure that its benefits are widely shared, that all citizens  are suitably equipped to take full advantage of  this technology and that a broader reflection  on potentially deeper societal changes is taking place.   In 2018, in order to support the efforts of Member States which are responsible for labour and  education policies, the Commission will:    set up dedicated (re-)training schemes  in connection with the Blueprint on sectoral  cooperation on skills47 – which brings together businesses, trade unions, higher education  institutions and public authorities – for professional profiles which are at risk of being  automate d, with financial support from the European Social Fund48;   gather detailed analysis and expert inputs to anticipate the changes on the labour  market and the skills mismatch across the EU, and inform decision -making at EU,  national and local levels. More specifically, the Commission will (i) publish a foresight  report on the impact of AI in education; (ii) launch pilots to predict the training  requirements for future competence profiles; and (iii) publish an expert  report addressing  the labour market impac ts of AI , with recommendations ;   support Digital Opportunity  Traineeships  (2018 -20) in advanced digital skills  for  students and fresh graduates;    encourage, through the Digital Skills and Jobs Coalition, business -education  partnerships  to take steps to attra ct and retain more AI talent and to foster continued  collaboration; and    invite social partners  to include AI and its impact on the economy and employment,  including the importance of diversity and gender balance in AI jobs, in their joint work  programmes a t sectoral and cross -sectoral level where relevant.   The European Institute of Innovation and Technology  will integrat e AI across curricula  in the education courses it supports , in order to contribute to developing a talent pool for  AI in Europe.   Proposals under the next EU multiannual financial framework (2021 -2027 ) will include  strengthened support for the acquisition of advanced digital skills including AI -specific  expertise.   The Commission also intends to broaden the scope of the current European Globali sation  Adjustment Fund beyond redundancies caused by delocalisation, including to those resulting  from digitisation and automation.   3.3. Ensuring an appropriate ethical and legal framework    An environment of trust and accountability around the development and u se of AI is needed.   The values  set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union constitute the foundation of  the rights enjoyed by those living in the Union. In addition, the  EU Charter of Fundamental                                                    47 http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1415&langId=en   48 The cooperation now focuses on the automotive, maritime technology, space, textile and tourism sectors, and  will address six other sectors in the future: additive manufacturing; construction; green technologies and  renewable energy; maritime shipping; paper -based value chain; steel industry.  
  14   Rights  brings together all the personal, civic, political, economic and social rights enjoyed by  people within the EU in a single text.   The EU has a strong and balanced regulatory framework to build on, which can set the global  standard for a sustainable approa ch to this technology. The Union has high standards in  terms of safety and product liability . The first EU -wide rules on network and information  systems security  and stronger rules on the protection of personal data  will become a reality  in May 2018.   The General Data Protection Regulation  ensures a high standard of personal data  protection, including the principles of data protection by design and by default. It guarantees  the free flow of personal data within the Union. It contains provisions on decision -making  based solely on automated processing, including profiling. In such cases, data subjects have  the right to be provided with meaningful information  about the logic involved in the  decision.49 The General Data Protection Regulation also gives individual s the right not to be  subject solely to automated decision -making, except in certain situations.50 The Commission  will closely follow the Regulation's application in the context of AI and calls on the national  data protection authorities and the European Da ta Protection Board to do the same.   The Commission has also put forward a series of proposals under the Digital Single Market   strategy that will be a key enabler for the development of AI , such as the Regulation on the  free flow of non -personal data, and that will strengthen trust in the online world, such as the  ePrivacy Regulation and the Cybersecurity Act. These proposals need to be adopted as soon  as possible. This is essential as citizens and businesses alike need to be able to  trust the  technology th ey interact with , have a predictable legal environment and rely on effective  safeguards protecting fundamental rights and freedoms.   To further strengthen trust, people also need to understand how the technology works, hence  the importance of research into  the explainability of AI systems . Indeed, i n order to increase  transparency and minimise the risk of bias or error, AI systems should be developed in a  manner which allows humans to understand (the basis of) their actions .  Like every technology or tool, A I can be used to positive but also to malicious ends. Whilst  AI clearly generates new opportunities, it also poses challenges and risks, for example in the  areas of safety and liability, security (criminal use or attacks), bias51 and discrimination.   Reflection will be needed on interactions between AI and intellectual property rights, from  the perspective of both intellectual property offices and users, with a view to fostering  innovation and legal certainty in a balanced way.52  Draft AI ethics guideli nes  As a first step to address ethical concerns,  draft  AI ethics guidelines will be developed by  the end of the year , with due regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European  Union. The Commission will bring together all relevant stakeholders i n order to help develop  these draft guidelines.                                                     49 Articles 13 (2) f), 14 (2) g) and 15 (1) h) of the General Data P rotection Regulation.   50 Article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation .  51 Depending on the data input that is used to train AI systems, their outputs can be biased.   52 Using AI to create works can have implications on intellectual property, with ques tions arising for instance on  patentability, copyright and right ownership.  
  15   The draft guidelines will address issues such as the future of work, fairness, safety, security,  social  inclusion and algorithmic transparency. More broadly, they will look at the impact on  fundamental right s, including privacy, dignity,  consumer protection and non -discrimination .  They will build on the work of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New  Technologies53 and take inspiration from other similar efforts.54 Companies, academic  institutions, and other organisations from civil society bodies will be invited to contribute. In  parallel, the Commission will continue its work towards progress on ethics at international  level55.  While self -regulation can provide a first set of benchmarks against which em erging  applications and outcomes can be assessed, public authorities must ensure that the regulatory  frameworks for developing and using of AI technologies are in line with these values and  fundamental rights.  The Commission will monitor developments and, if necessary, review  existing legal frameworks to better adapt them to specific challenges, in particular to ensure  the respect of the Union’s basic values and fundamental rights.   Safety and liability   The emergence of AI, in particular the complex enabling  ecosystem and the feature of  autonomous decision -making, requires a reflection about the suitability of some established  rules on safety and civil law questions on liability.    For instance, advanced robots and Internet of Things products empowered by AI may act in  ways that were not envisaged at the time when the system was first put into operation. Given  AI's widespread uses, both horizontal and sectoral rules may need to be revie wed56.   The EU safety framework57 already addresses the intended use and foreseeable (mis)use of  products when placed on the market. This has led to the development of a solid body of  standards in the area of AI -enabled devices that is continuously being ada pted in line with  technological progress..   The further development and promotion of such safety standards and support in EU and  international standardisation organisations will help enable European businesses to benefit  from a competitive advantage, and i ncrease consumer trust58.                                                     53 The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies is an advisory group of the Commission.   54 At the EU level, the EU Fundamental Rights Agency will carry out an assess ment of the current challenges  faced by producers and users of new technology with respect of fundamental rights compliance. The European  Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies also published a relevant statement on AI, Robotics and  ‘Autonomous’ S ystems on 9 March 2018. Examples of international efforts: Asilomar AI principles  (https://futureoflife.org/ai -principles/ ), Montréal Declaration for Responsible AI draft principles  (https://www.montrealdeclaration -responsibleai.com/ ), UNI Global Union Top 10 Principles for Ethical AI  (http://www.thefutureworldofwork.org/opinions/10 -principles -for-ethical -ai/).   55 The European Commission's International Dialogue on Bioethics and Ethics in Science and New  Technologies brings together the National Ethics Councils of EU Member States and of  third countries, to work  together on those matters of common concern.    56 For any new regulatory proposals that shall be needed to address emerging issues resulting from AI and  related technologies, the Commission applies the Innovation Principle, a set of  tools and guidelines that was  developed to ensure that all Commission initiatives are innovation friendly:  https://ec.europa. eu/epsc/publications/strategic -notes/towards -innovation -principle -endorsed -better regulation_en    57 For example, the Machinery Directive, the Radio Equipment Directive, the General Product Safety Directive  as well as specific safety rules for example for medical devices or toys.   58 Standards should also cover interoperability, which is crucial for o ffering consumers greater choices and  ensuring fair competition . 
  16   The Commission is currently assessing whether the safety and national and EU liability  frameworks are fit for purpose in light of these new challenges or whether any gaps should be  addressed. A high level of safety and an efficien t redress mechanism for victims in case of  damages helps to build user trust and social acceptance of these technologies.   Evaluations of the Product Liability Directive59 and the Machinery Directive have already  been conducted.60 An initial assessment was a lso carried out on the current liability  frameworks in light of AI and emerging technologies.61 An expert group will help the  Commission to analyse these challenges further.62  Empowering individuals and consumers to make the most of AI   The large -scale use of  AI-enabled tools in business -to-consumer transactions needs to be fair,  transparent and compliant with consumer legislation. Consumers should receive clear  information on the use, features and properties of AI -enabled products. Individuals should be  able to control the data generated by using these tools and should know whether they are  communicating with a machine or another human. In particular, when interacting with an  automated system, consideration should be given to when users should be informed on h ow  to reach a human and how to ensure that a system's decisions can be checked or corrected.   The Commission will:    set a framework for stakeholders and experts –  the European AI Alliance – to develop  draft  AI ethics guidelines , with due regard to fundamental rights, by the end of the year ,  in cooperation with the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies;    issue a guidance document on the interpretation of the Product Liability Directive  in  light of technological  developments by mid -2019 . This will seek to ensure legal clarity for  consumers and producers in case of defective products;    publish, by mid -2019 , a report on the broader  implications for, potential  gaps in and  orientations for, the liability and safety fr ameworks  for AI, Internet of Things and  robotics;    support research in the development of explainable AI  and implement a pilot project  proposed by the European Parliament on Algorithmic Awareness Building63, to gather a  solid evidence -base and support the de sign of policy responses to the challenges brought  by automated decision -making, including biases and discrimination (2018 -2019); and    support national and EU -level consumer organisations and data protection supervising  authorities  in building an understand ing of AI -powered applications with the input of the  European Consumer Consultative Group and of the European Data Protection Board.                                                     59 The Product Liability Directive states that if a defective product causes any damage to consumers or their  property, the producer has to provide compensation irrespectively of whether there is n egligence or fault on their  part.  60 The evaluation of the Machinery Directive indicates that some provisions do not explicitly address certain  aspects of emerging digital technologies, and the Commission will examine whether this requires legislative  chang es. On the evaluation of the Product Liability Directive, the Commission will issue an interpretative  guidance document, clarifying important concepts in the Directive.   61 See the Staff Working Document on Liability accompanying this Communication (SWD (201 8)137).   62 http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/item -detail.cfm?item_id=615947   63 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/algorithmic -awareness -building   
  17   3.4. Joining forces   Engaging Member States   Several Member States have developed or are working towards strategies to support AI. On  29 March 2018, France presented its national strategy for AI, building on the Villani report.64  Germany, following the example of "Industrie 4.0", has set up a platform on learning systems  to enable a strategic dialogue between academia, industry and  the government, and it has put  forward a report on the ethics of automated and connected driving.65 Finland has put forward  its 'Tekoälyaika' strategy to make it a leader in the field.66 Every Member State is encouraged  to have an AI strategy, including on investment.   Sharing best practices, identifying synergies and aligning action where relevant will  maximise the impact of investments in AI and help the EU as a whole to compete globally.  Cooperating on interoperability and data sets, and working together on legal solutions will  prevent a fragmentation of the single market and therefore fuel the emergence of AI startups.  24 Member States and Norway have already committed to joining forces on AI and entering  into a strategic dialogue with the Commission.67 The Commission will facilitate this  dialogue and aim to agree a coordinated plan on AI with Member States by the end of  the year.    Engaging stakeholders: setting up a European AI Alliance   Given the scale of the challenge associated with AI, the full mobilisa tion of a diverse set of  participants, including businesses, consumer organisations, trade unions, and other  representatives of civil society bodies is essential. The Commission will therefore facilitate  the creation and operation of a broad multi -stakehol der platform, the European AI  Alliance , to work on all aspects of AI.68 The Commission will also facilitate interactions of  the Alliance with the European Parliament, Member States, the European Economic and  Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions as  well as international organisations. The  Alliance will be a space for sharing best practices, encourage private investments and  activities related to the development of AI.                                                        64 https://www.aiforhumanity.fr    65 https://www.plattform -lernende -systeme.de   66 https://tekoalyaika.fi/   67 https://ec.europa.eu/di gital-single -market/en/news/eu -member -states -sign-cooperate -artificial -intelligence   68 https://ec.europa.eu/digital -single -market/en/news /call-high-level -expert -group -artificial -intelligence  
  18   Monitoring AI development and uptake   Many of today's debates about AI are based  on opinions, hearsay and assumptions – not  always on facts and science. To ensure quality input and to inform policy -making, the  Commission will monitor the uptake of AI applications across the economy and identify  potential shifts in industrial value cha ins caused by AI as well as  societal and legal  developments and the situation on the labour market. It will also benchmark the technical  capabilities of AI components and systems to give a realistic understanding of where the  technology stands, and help in crease public awareness.69 The Commission will also regularly  assess progress towards the objectives and the initiatives set out in this Communication.   International outreach   International discussions on AI have intensified after Japan's G7 Presidency put t he topic on  the table in 2016. The EU has supported these discussions both in G7 ministerial meetings  and at the Organisation for Economic Co -operation and Development , which is becoming a  major international venue to discuss this topic. More specifically,  the Commission has  encouraged the discussions on AI ethics within the G7.   With AI being easily tradeable across borders, only global solutions will be sustainable in this  domain. The G7/G20, United Nations and Organisation for Economic Co -operation and  Development have begun to address the role of AI, including in the military domain. The EU  will continue to encourage discussions on AI and its various dimensions – including research  and innovation cooperation as  well as competitiveness – in such fora. It will promote the use  of AI, and technologies in general, to help solve global challenges, support the  implementation of the Paris Climate agreement and achieve the United Nation s Sustainable  Development Goals.   The EU can make a unique contribution to the worldwide debate on AI based on its values  and fundamental rights.    By the end of the year , the Commission will work, as part of the existing European  platform of national initiatives to digitise industry, on a coordinated plan with Member  States  in order to maximise the impact of investments at EU and national levels, exchange  on the best way for governments to prepare Europeans for the AI transformation and  address legal and ethical considerations.  In parallel,  the Commission will systematically  monitor AI -related developments , e.g. policy initiatives in the Member States, AI uptake  and its impact on labour markets as well as AI capabilities, including high-level  benchmarking, showcasing current capabilities and d eveloping an AI index in order to  inform the discussions.    By July 2018 , the European AI Alliance will be set up. It will involve all relevant  stakeholders to gather input, exchange views, develop and implement common measures  to encourage the development and use of AI.   4. CONCLUSION   The EU has a strong scientific and industrial base to build on, with leading research labs and  universities, recognised leadership in robotics as well as innovative startups. It has a                                                    69 This work shall also be informed by the EU Agency on Fundamental Rights . 
  19   comprehensive legal framework which protects consumers while promoting innovation and it  is making progress in creating a Digital Single Market. The main ingredients are there for  the EU to become a leader in the AI revolution , in its own way and based on its values.   The approach to AI described in this document shows the way forward and highlights the  need to join forces at European level, to ensure that all Europeans are part of the digital  transformation, that adequate resources are devoted to AI and that the Union’s values and  fundamental rights are at the forefront of the AI landscape.    Together, we can place the power of AI at the service of human progress .
